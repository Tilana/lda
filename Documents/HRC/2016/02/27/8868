</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report describes some key aspects of the human rights situation in 
Guatemala as well as the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2009. Under the mandate established by the agreement of 
10 January 2005 between OHCHR and the Government of the Republic of Guatemala, 
which was extended for three years on 19 September 2008, the OHCHR office in 
Guatemala (OHCHR-Guatemala) continued to monitor the human rights situation and to 
provide advisory and technical assistance services to State institutions and civil society, 
geared towards the implementation of the recommendations contained in the previous 
report of the High Commissioner to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/31/Add.1). 
 During the reporting period, Guatemala experienced political instability, social 
unrest and persistent and increasing violence and insecurity. OHCHR-Guatemala closely 
followed the security situation and its impact on human rights, the challenges met in the 
fight against impunity, the strengthening of the rule of law, and in the combating of 
discrimination and poverty. The present report addresses human rights issues of utmost 
concern, such as insecurity and the right to life, rule of law, violence against women, 
attacks against human rights defenders, impunity, racism and discrimination, issues related 
to transitional justice, and the situation of economic, social and cultural rights. 
 The report also gives an overview of the activities of OHCHR-Guatemala in 2009. 
In particular, the office provided various national institutions (such as Congress, the 
Presidential Human Rights Commission, the Ministry of the Interior, the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Presidential Commission on Discrimination and Racism against

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) signed an agreement with the Government of the Republic of 
Guatemala on the establishment of an OHCHR office in Guatemala. OHCHR-Guatemala 
officially started its work on 20 September 2005. On 19 September 2008, its mandate was 
extended for three years. 
</p>
<p>2. Under the agreement, and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141 
of 20 December 1993, the mandate of OHCHR-Guatemala is to monitor the situation of 
human rights in order to advise State institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala, 
focusing on several key issues. It also describes the work carried out by OHCHR-
Guatemala in accordance with its mandate, including information on the advisory services 
and technical cooperation provided to assist implementation of the recommendations 
contained in the High Commissioner&#8217;s reports for 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 2009, Guatemala faced significant challenges which put its political stability and 
the response capacity of the State to the test. 
</p>
<p>5. In April, confronted with persistent levels of violence and widespread impunity, the 
heads of the three branches of the State signed the National Agreement for the 
Advancement of Security and Justice. Supported by civil society organizations, the private 
sector, church representatives, academia, the Human Rights Procurator and representatives 
of the international community, the Agreement contains 101 commitments that could serve 
as the basis for a national strategy to overcome the challenges faced in these sectors. 
</p>
<p>6. The murder of lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg, in May 2009, triggered a political crisis 
that led to massive demonstrations for and against the Government, as high-level 
Government officials were accused of involvement in the murder.1 It also brought together 
vast sectors of society against rampant impunity. The social mobilization against impunity 
facilitated the approval by Congress of the Law on Nominating Commissions, which served 
as the basis for the election of judges of the Supreme Court of Justice and Courts of Appeal. 
</p><p>7. In July, Congress ratified a two-year extension of the mandate of the International 
Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) that was previously agreed to between 
the Government and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>8. Public security continued to be affected by persistent instability at its highest levels. 
In January, a new Minister of the Interior took office, but resigned six months later. His 
successor became the fourth Minister of the Interior under the current administration. 
</p>
<p>9. The persistence of social conflicts throughout the year highlighted the urgent need to 
establish a comprehensive State policy that fully guarantees individual and collective rights, 
particularly those of indigenous peoples, especially in relation to the exploitation of natural 
resources. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 According to the conclusions of the investigation carried out by the International Commission against 
</p>
<p>Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, Rodrigo Rosenberg planned his 
own death, with the complicity of relatives. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11714 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>10. Guatemala, the largest economy of Central America, was affected by the world 
financial crisis, with consequences such as a reduced collection of indirect taxes on imports, 
and a 10 per cent lower income from international remittances. This has aggravated the 
already low level of funds collected through taxes. In this context, the Government was 
unable to gather the support needed in Congress to approve a tax modernization plan 
enabling the State to ensure the necessary resources to fulfil its obligations. Neither was it 
able to secure approval for the draft budget for 2010, and therefore the revenue and 
expenditure budget will remain the same in 2010 as it was in 2009. The State needs to 
secure the necessary funds to ensure the population is able to enjoy basic human rights. An 
open and participatory dialogue among all social sectors over tax reform is deemed 
necessary. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>11. While the critical situation of insecurity persists, State institutions remain fragile and 
are unable to assume their role in preventing and reacting to the violence. Security is 
provided in great part by private companies over which there is minimum or no State 
control, and abuses are committed by illegal armed groups that assume security functions. 
</p>
<p>12. The National Civilian Police (NCP) reported that there were 6,498 violent deaths in 
2009, compared to 6,244 in 2008. A total of 720 of the victims were women and 510 were 
children. The rate of homicides remained above 48 per 100,000 inhabitants, with a high 
percentage of deaths by firearm (83 per cent), which reveals the urgent need to ensure 
effective control over the ownership, possession and use of such weapons. 
</p>
<p>13. The National Commission of the Judiciary in Support of the Educational 
Subprogramme for the Prevention of Lynchings reported 119 cases of lynching with a total 
of 325 victims and 47 deaths, which included the death of two women and an adolescent. 
These figures show a dramatic increase compared to 2008, when 56 occurrences resulted in 
22 deaths. The office notes with concern the recurrence of these practices radically opposed 
to human rights, which amount to extrajudicial executions when perpetrated with the 
participation, acquiescence or tolerance of State officials. In the case of the lynching and 
death of police officer Pedro Rodr&#237;guez Toma in San Juan Cotzal, Quich&#233;, in November 
2009, the office received information which indicates acquiescence and instigation by some 
municipal authorities as well as tolerance on the part of members of the security forces. 
</p>
<p>14. NCP remains unable to address the significant challenges posed by the alarming 
insecurity. An insufficient number of active officials (22,092 active police officers, 
equivalent to one police officer per 619 inhabitants,2 and 5,002 vacant posts during most of 
the year3), added to frequent changes and dismissals within the Ministry of the Interior, 
affected the functioning of the police. In August, two months after taking office, 11 high-
ranking officials of NCP, including the Director-General, the Deputy Director and the 
Operations and Investigations Deputy Directors were dismissed and subsequently 
prosecuted for their presumed participation in criminal activities. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Based on a total population of 13,667,000 (United Nations Development Programme, <i>Informe de 
</i></p>
<p><i>desarrollo humano para Am&#233;rica Central 2009&#8211;2010 </i>(Human Development Report for Central 
America 2009&#8211;2010), UNDP, Colombia, 2009, p. 432). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 On 24 November, 2,161 new police officers graduated. In December 2009, the National Civilian 
</p>
<p>Police (NCP) registered 1,866 vacant posts. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11714 
</p>
<p>15. In April, a Government resolution (97-2009) restructuring NCP entered into force. 
This resolution curtailed the functioning and administrative independence of several police 
departments, including the police academy, deviating from the consensus reached among 
civil society, international actors and former authorities of the Ministry of the Interior and 
NCP on the need to raise the status of the General Inspectorate and to strengthen 
professional training for police. 
</p>
<p>16. In an effort to professionalize the police an additional police academy was 
established in San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez. Nevertheless significant challenges persist, including 
the continuation of internal vetting processes, and obtaining tangible improvements in 
police facilities and adequate wages for police officers. In this regard, action protocols, 
coordinated with judicial authorities, should be implemented, and indicators to assess the 
efficiency of police operations developed. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to private security, the Ministry of the Interior has recorded a total of 
147 private security companies operating in Guatemala, representing 35,892 registered 
security officers and 32,723 firearms.4 The United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) estimates that the number of private agents in Guatemala would amount to 
106,700, the highest in Central America.5 This implies that a large part of the public 
security role has been yielded, de facto, to private entities over which there is neither 
effective control nor an adequate legal framework to regulate their operations and to ensure 
their complementarity and subordination to civilian public security forces. 
</p>
<p>18. In several regions, the army continued to carry out preventive patrolling despite this 
being the exclusive role of NCP. This practice contradicts the principle of division of 
responsibilities and the civilian nature of the public security forces, as set forth in the 
National Security System Framework Law. In one of these cases, monitored by the office, a 
military patrol killed a peasant in a checkpoint in Alta Verapaz in May, allegedly as a result 
of inappropriate and disproportionate use of firearms. Two army officers are being 
investigated for this act. 
</p>
<p>19. Through its prevention unit, NCP sought to increase trust in the institution and 
generate civil support both at the school and community levels, through the promotion of 
local security committees. The number of local security committees increased from 677 in 
2008 to 1,029 in 2009.6 Although encouraging preventive efforts, the office observed with 
concern that some local security committees have assumed public security functions. 
General Order 11-99 of NCP, which established these committees, sets forth broad and 
ambiguous provisions which do not allow for adequate control of their actions. The State 
has the obligation to adopt effective measures to prevent these committees from taking on 
public security functions, particularly by reforming standards and laws and avoiding 
practices that allow or delegate to citizens the exercise of such role. 
</p>
<p>20. The office also received information regarding groups of armed civilians that 
operate in municipalities such as Villanueva and San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez (Department of 
Guatemala); San Mart&#237;n Jilotepeque (Department of Chimaltenango), and San Juan Cotzal 
(Department of Quich&#233;). In the latter, the office observed that a group of armed civilians, 
under the guise of local security committees and with the participation of municipal 
authorities, carried out surveillance activities, illegal detentions and interrogations; operated 
checkpoints and surveillance posts; and carried out intimidating actions and other acts

<p>threatening the physical integrity of persons. Urgent effective measures have yet to be taken 
to dismantle these groups. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>21. According to NCP, the number of violent deaths of women amounted to 720 in 
</p><p>2009. Women&#8217;s bodies were found with evident signs of mutilation, sexual violence and 
other forms of ill-treatment, indicating that the attacks were gender-based. Of the 30,873 
complaints of violence against women filed in 2009, only 0.7 per cent led to prosecution 
and 0.2 per cent (70 cases) to sentences.7 The number of domestic violence complaints 
increased from 37,358 cases in 2008 to 48,437 in 2009. A total of 89 per cent of victims 
were women, and 63 per cent of them were assaulted by their live-in partners.8 In 2009, 
38,756 protective measures were granted.9 
</p>
<p>22. Since the adoption of the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence 
against Women 19 months ago, the number of complaints has increased significantly. 
However, the State&#8217;s capacity to respond has neither been proportionate nor effective 
enough in terms of investigation, sanction and reparation. Of the 166 complaints of 
femicide in 2009, only 11 cases were prosecuted and 10 sentences were dictated in the 
application of the recent Law.10 
</p>
<p>23. Although a larger number of public officials received training, the programmes 
lacked technical and practical components related to the new laws on violence against 
women. In some cases indications of discriminatory interpretation and enforcement of these 
new provisions were noted. The lack of effective inter-institutional coordination and 
duplication of actions coexisted with the absence of specific, homogeneous and specialized 
instructions on femicide and violence against women. The establishment of a specialized 
justice system as well as the implementation of the National Information System on 
Violence against Women are still pending. 
</p>
<p>24. In February, Congress passed a law on sexual violence, exploitation and trafficking 
in persons (Decree 9-2009), introducing sanctions and preventive measures. This 
constitutes a major achievement which shows the will to adequately define and criminalize 
sexual violence and trafficking in persons, filling legal voids and amending existing norms 
in compliance with the main international human rights standards. Furthermore, it sets up a 
legal framework that includes specific sanctions for the sale of children, for child 
pornography, and for irregular adoptions. Such measures are in line with recommendations 
by the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, as well as OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Human Rights Section of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the civil society-
run Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders noted an increase in the reported number 
of threats and attacks against human rights defenders during 2009, registering 346 and 343

<p>cases, respectively. According to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the cases included 167 
attacks against justice operators, 87 against activists, 51 against trade unionists and 41 
against journalists. The Protection Unit denounced 16 homicides among the attacks. 
</p><p>26. In addition to recorded attacks against defenders working on justice and the right to 
truth, as well as on women&#8217;s and juvenile&#8217;s rights, OHCHR-Guatemala received reports of 
intimidation, excessive use of force and arbitrary use of criminal proceedings against 
defenders upholding collective, environmental, economic, social and cultural rights in the 
context of social unrest related to large-scale industrial projects in the area of natural 
resource extraction, such as those carried out in the departments of Alta Verapaz, 
Huehuetenango, Izabal, Quich&#233;, San Marcos and Zacapa. The limited progress achieved in 
criminal prosecutions in such cases, the lack of effective protective measures, and the 
presence of organized crime groups in vast areas of the countryside increase the 
vulnerability of those who defend and promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>27. The Body for the Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights Defenders has 
generated trust among its participants and advances in inter-institutional coordination. 
Created in 2007 and led by the Ministry of the Interior, the Board is a multi-institutional 
body aimed at identifying threats and responding to attacks against human rights defenders. 
Nevertheless, adequate measures should be taken by the State to strengthen the 
systematization, organization and coordination of preventive and other measures to ensure 
the protection of human rights defenders as well as sustainable and effective institutional 
support. It is also necessary to increase awareness among State officials, civil society and 
public opinion on the crucial role that human rights defenders play in safeguarding 
democracy and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Rule of law and impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>28. In order to comply with its human rights obligations under international law, the 
Government should address several challenges, such as endemic structural deficiencies, 
including the overall weakness of public institutions, insufficient budgets and resources, 
and the prevalence of individual interests over public interest. Other major challenges 
include the frequent changes of officials that have prevented effective continuity of 
policies, programmes, trainings and all institutional processes; the centralization of most 
public functions in the capital; as well as the lack of institutional ownership of development 
programmes and the absence of a systematic evaluation of their impact. To address these 
challenges, the authorities should be fully aware of their public role as duty bearers and 
human rights warrantors, and Congress should promote legal reforms leading to the 
effective implementation of a professional career for public servants which would ensure 
adequate selection, professional competency and stability of tenure. 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding criminal justice, while some changes have led to an increase in the 
number of complaints and to expediting some investigations, the actions undertaken by the 
justice system institutions still do not correspond to the needs given the context of 
generalized violence and high levels of impunity. In this context, improving the justice 
system involves strict observance of rights and guarantees, which are not an obstacle for 
efficient investigation and prosecution but an essential component of the rule of law that 
strengthens the fight against impunity, protects institutional legitimacy and provides trust in 
State institutions. 
</p>
<p>30. The Law on Access to Public Information, which entered into force in April 2009, 
must be acknowledged as a positive step forward that could become a useful tool both for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11714 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>civil society and the authorities in the urgent task to achieve transparency and strengthen 
internal controls and State accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and criminal investigations 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office carried out actions aimed at strengthening in 
particular its Special Investigation Methods Unit and district prosecutor&#8217;s offices. It also 
made progress in the investigation of some high-impact cases against illegal organizations, 
including those where CICIG is the joint complainant. 
</p><p>32. While the career system for prosecutors continues to lack a complete and adequate 
set of norms, progress in the performance assessment system was noted. Consistent and 
effective implementation is expected with the application of the necessary qualitative 
technical assessment criteria. The disciplinary regime should be harmonized with 
international standards, in order to avoid arbitrariness and guarantee effective 
accountability. 
</p>
<p>33. The absence of an adequate criminal prosecution policy for past and present human 
rights violations, of adequate protocols to investigate them and of a regulation that clarifies 
the structure, operation and competence of the Human Rights Section of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office are challenges that were not overcome during 2009. 
</p>
<p>34. The police&#8217;s criminal investigation structure was partially reorganized by absorbing 
police officers from other units who had experience in this issue. Furthermore, a separate 
unit for crimes against life, with 105 investigators, was created in October. However, the 
Special Criminal Investigation Division of the National Civilian Police (DEIC) had 
insufficient geographic coverage11 and 400 positions remained vacant at the end of the year. 
In addition to work overload, training continues to be limited and procedure manuals and 
protocols are lacking. 
</p>
<p>35. The lack of operational inter-institutional coordination in investigation tasks by the 
Special Criminal Investigation Division, the General Directorate of Civilian Intelligence, 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the National Forensic Science Institute at times results in 
the duplication of functions, the contamination of crime scenes, and presents significant 
deficiencies both in the collection and the chain of custody of evidence, as well as in 
meeting procedural deadlines. This all negatively affects the quality of judicial proceedings. 
The use of technical-scientific experts for criminal investigation is still limited and should 
be extended in order for proceedings not to be solely based on testimonial evidence. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Judiciary and justice sector 
</b>36. The approval of the Law on Nominating Commissions is a significant step forward 
to institutionalize processes for the selection of public officials, particularly regarding the 
justice system, based on principles of transparency, objectiveness, adequacy, publicity and 
participation. Nonetheless, inconsistencies were noted in the initial application of the law, 
such as in the election process of the Director of the Public Criminal Defence Institute. 
Future processes, particularly the one to select the Public Prosecutor, should fully comply 
with international principles and standards, as contemplated in the Law. 
</p>
<p>37. With regard to the election of judges to the Supreme Court of Justice and to the 
Courts of Appeal, the implementation of the Law on Nominating Commissions contributed 
to ensuring greater access to information about the process and to achieving noteworthy 
participation and monitoring by several social sectors and the media. However, deficiencies

<p>persisted particularly at the final short-listing stage by the Commissions and at election by 
Congress, especially with regard to the full application of objective criteria in the 
discussion and assessment of every candidate, in accordance with international standards. 
Furthermore, the process did not ensure equitable elections in terms of gender and ethnic 
diversity. 
</p>
<p>38. Legislation in force concerning the system that regulates the selection, disciplinary 
regime, performance evaluation, transfers and promotion of judges and justice clerks and 
assistants still does not ensure the application of objective criteria, which leads to 
discretionary decisions, hence affecting the independence of the Judiciary. It is essential to 
make progress towards a comprehensive reform of the legal and regulatory framework of 
the judicial and civil service career, particularly in the Law governing the Judiciary, with 
the participation of relevant officials and civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p>39. Despite the fact that new courts were opened in 2009, access to justice remains 
limited due to the insufficient geographic coverage of the justice system, which still does 
not fully respond to the needs of the population. Backlogs persist at alarming levels12 and 
free legal counselling is still lacking in non-criminal areas, particularly for women victims 
of violence and for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>40. A legal framework to strengthen the Coordinating Body of the Justice Sector and 
provide it with stability is still needed in order to ensure permanent and coordinated analysis 
and monitoring of the main problems of the sector, as well as to develop policies, plans and 
programmes with the participation of the National Forensic Science Institute. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>41. The State continues to face difficulties to exert effective control on detention centres 
under the General Prison System Directorate and detention places run by NCP. According to 
information received by OHCHR, criminal networks continue operating from and within 
some detention centres, and corruption and insufficient resources have substantially limited 
the impact of measures aimed at regaining control over those places, such as searches, 
transfers of detainees and the installation of devices to block mobile phones. 
</p>
<p>42. The office noted that some detainees exercise control over others and carry out 
disciplinary functions, at times with the knowledge and acquiescence of the detention centre 
authorities, contravening international standards. In the context of such abuses, violent acts 
led to deaths in at least two cases: Mario Mart&#237;nez Santos died in April while detained in 
Quetzaltenango, and in August, Alonso Domingo P&#233;rez died while detained in 
Huehuetenango, both while in NCP custody. 
</p>
<p>43. In 2009, 20 deaths in custody were officially reported.13 According to international 
law, the State is responsible for preventing and investigating the death of detainees, as well 
as for identifying, prosecuting, trying and sanctioning all those responsible, including public 
officials, for their participation in, or support, acquiescence or tolerance of such acts. 
</p>
<p>44. In the context of criminal prosecutions for torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, the inadequate definition of these crimes in the Penal Code and 
inaccurate classification of complaints, as well as the lack of access to prompt, confidential

<p>and reliable complaint mechanisms, have limited the recording of cases and the victims&#8217; 
right to an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>45. The State must guarantee that all persons deprived of liberty are detained in legally 
established detention centres. However, 1,127 persons are held under NCP authority14 in 
places that fall outside any kind of regulatory framework and are therefore illegal. 
Conditions in such places regularly fail to meet minimum international standards. They are 
overcrowded and unsanitary, and lack adequate medical care, institutional work 
opportunities and education programmes. The separation of accused and convicted persons 
is not always guaranteed. Conditions for women are particularly alarming. Regulation of the 
Prison System Law consistent with international standards and its implementation are still 
pending.  
</p>
<p><b> F.  Transitional justice 
</b>46. The recognition by the Constitutional Court of enforced disappearance as a 
continuing or permanent crime, in accordance with international standards, in July 2009 was 
reflected by the Court of Chimaltenango (Tribunal de Sentencia) in its first conviction for 
this crime one month later. This is in line with the High Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation in 
the amicus curiae brief presented in 2008.15 
</p>
<p>47. In December 2009, the Court of Chiquimula handed down another conviction for the 
crime of enforced disappearance in Guatemala. The perpetrators, including an army colonel 
and three military commissioners,16 were sentenced to 53 years of imprisonment each. This 
is the first conviction for this crime against a member of the army. In addition, the Court 
decided to reclassify the offence of kidnapping as a crime of enforced disappearance, and 
called on the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to investigate the chain of command, including the 
role of the former Ministry of Defence and the former Chief of the Combined Armed 
Forces, as well as other members of the army that carried out activities in the military base 
in Zacapa in 1981. All these decisions are valuable tools to bring to justice all enforced 
disappearance cases that have yet to be tried. 
</p>
<p>48. The digitalization of almost 9.5 million documents and the delivery of 25,617 pages 
of information requested from the Historic Archives of the National Police, mainly by the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office,17 have provided a valuable source for truth and memory and an 
effective documentary basis for the criminal investigation of serious human rights violations 
committed in the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>49. Two years after the Constitutional Court dismissed the request of the National Court 
of Spain to provisionally detain for extradition purposes several persons accused of 
genocide and crimes against humanity, progress in domestic justice has not yet been noted. 
This situation compromises Guatemala&#8217;s international responsibility under the principle <i>aut 
dedere aut judicare</i>.  
50. With regard to reparations, the delivery of 888 houses, financial compensation to 
3,725 persons, 30 actions of symbolic reparations and Government statements in favour of 
victims are positive steps to repair violations committed during the internal armed conflict.

</p>
<p>However, it is still necessary to advance on the adoption of adequate legislation to 
strengthen and bring sustainability to State policies in terms of reparations. Such legislation 
should ensure continuity, inter-institutional coordination and the full inclusion of 
international standards, including those related to gender and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> G.  Combating racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>51. In the context of the 2009 Durban Review Conference, Guatemala renewed its 
commitment against racism and racial discrimination and reviewed achievements and 
challenges. This exercise revealed gaps, such as the limited implementation of the 2006 
Public Policy for Coexistence and the Elimination of Racism and Racial Discrimination as 
well as the lack of decisive measures to strengthen the indigenous institutions created as a 
result of the Peace Agreements. 
</p>
<p>52. The limited number of complaints and convictions regarding discrimination is a 
matter of concern. According to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, of the 412 complaints filed 
between 2002 and 2009, only 4 led to convictions. Nevertheless an important step forward 
was taken with the conviction of civil servants for discriminatory expressions against 
C&#225;ndida Gonz&#225;lez Chipir, former Vice-Minister of Labour and Social Protection.  
</p>
<p>53. Attacks and threats against lawyers from the Office for the Defence of Indigenous 
Women (DEMI) were reported during 2009. In one such case a female lawyer in 
Quetzaltenango dealing with several cases of violence against indigenous women was the 
victim of an attack that caused her serious injuries in September. The State should urgently 
adopt measures to ensure effective investigation and prosecution of such violations, and 
ensure protection to all persons who defend the rights of indigenous women. 
</p>
<p>54. Recognition of the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination to consider individual communications and the criminalization of racism are 
still absent from the legislative agenda, although progress was made with regard to 
favourable opinions on the bills on sacred places and the indigenous peoples consultation, a 
legal requirement prior to discussion in Congress in 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>55. The enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in Guatemala is a major 
challenge. The UNDP <i>Human Development Report 2009</i>18 ranks the country 122nd among 
182 countries. The country also ranks 76th among the 135 countries for which the Human 
Poverty Index was calculated. Over 50.9 per cent of the population is poor and 15 per cent 
is extremely poor. Based on data available prior to the food crisis, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations estimated the number of undernourished at 2.1 million. 
According to 2007 data, the school enrolment rate reaches 95 per cent at the primary level 
and 36.4 per cent at the secondary level. Guatemala is also one of the most unequal 
countries in Latin America, with a GINI coefficient of 53.7 and with important trends of 
discrimination, particularly against indigenous peoples. About 74.8 per cent of indigenous 
peoples are poor (compared with 36.2 per cent of the rest of the population). 
</p>
<p>56. The increase in social expenditure in 2009 is a positive sign, particularly the 
investment in cash transfer programmes, which is the main Government mechanism for 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11714 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>poverty reduction. Although initial measures have been taken, progressive mainstreaming of 
human rights principles, in particular publicity, transparency and accountability, into these 
social programmes is paramount. Strategies should be put in place to ensure that progress in 
social policies such as free education and health services achieve the intended outcomes. 
These strategies should be met with an adequate budget and sufficient resources to extend 
the coverage and quality of these services as needed, particularly in the light of the demand 
created by the cash transfer programme. 
</p>
<p>57. Efforts should be intensified to establish database systems which include updated, 
reliable, public, timely, transparent and disaggregated statistical data, in order to improve 
the quality of decision-making processes. The establishment of the Office for Cross-cutting 
Coordination of Statistics on Gender and Indigenous Peoples is a step forward in this regard. 
It is also important to consolidate and improve the mapping on poverty, in order to use more 
detailed and accurate information, thus increasing the impact of the cash transfer 
programme. A lack of consolidation of programmes to ensure the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights would be a regression tantamount to a violation of international 
human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The right to food 
</b></p>
<p>58. The realization of the right to food involves overcoming historic and structural 
challenges. In 2009, Guatemala again faced a food crisis caused by climate and economic 
phenomena resulting in harvest losses and higher basic grain prices. According to the 
Government, this crisis affected an estimated 2.5 million people, particularly in the &#8220;dry 
corridor&#8221;,19 including an undetermined loss of lives of children due to acute malnutrition. 
This crisis has particularly affected agricultural workers and the poorest part of the 
population, increasing their vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>59. In September 2009, the Government declared a &#8220;State of Calamity&#8221;, thus facilitating 
the mobilization of national and international funds to address the crisis. Among other 
actions, the Government distributed food aid and established the Food Security 
Coordinating Mechanism to improve coordination among institutions, civil society and 
international cooperation. The inadequate assessment of the available information hindered 
the State&#8217;s ability to react to the early signals of such crisis and delayed its response. 
</p>
<p>60. Given the cyclical nature of food crises in Guatemala, systematic monitoring of the 
situation by the State is required to develop preventive measures as well as prompt and 
efficient mitigating measures in case of crises. The provisions that established mandatory 
notification on acute malnutrition cases in hospitals and the manual for epidemiological 
malnutrition are positive steps towards more active monitoring. The adoption of a structural 
and sustainable rural development strategy could improve the impact of State efforts to 
prevent and address food crises. 
</p>
<p>61. The current crisis is expected to continue over several months in 2010, rendering the 
conditions of the dry corridor more serious and widespread, which requires an adequate 
response by the State.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. The right to education 
</b></p>
<p>62. In 2009 the Government established free primary education for all, a principle of the 
right to education recognized in domestic law. The office considers free education as an 
important step in the realization of this right. To break the circle of poverty, it is necessary

</p>
<p>to make progress in improving the quality of education and in the coverage of secondary 
education. The office received information related to unlawful charges for enrolment fees 
and for school activities. An initial positive development is the adequate functioning of 
administrative complaint mechanisms that ensured that parents did not pay undue charges. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>63. During 2009, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare suffered several 
budgetary cuts, and the 2009&#8211;2010 budget remains insufficient. Additionally, human and 
hospital resources continue to be unequally distributed, with concentration in urban areas.  
According to UNDP, the Department of Guatemala has one physician for 384 citizens while 
the department of Quich&#233; has one physician for 11,948 people.20 According to a report of the 
Instituto Centroamericano de Estudios Fiscales and the Center for Economic and Social 
Rights,21 the poorest departments with the lowest human development indices are those with 
fewer resources. 
</p>
<p>64. In order for the State to fulfil its basic obligation to ensure the availability of and 
access to the health system without discrimination, in particular for the vulnerable or 
marginalized groups, a strategic and operational plan, as well as adequate resources are 
needed. The office acknowledges the creation of the Indigenous Health Care and 
Intercultural Unit in Guatemala as a step towards recognizing the cultural dimension of the 
right to health.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Activities of the office in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>65. During the period under review, OHCHR-Guatemala carried out 40 missions to the 
22 departments of the country and recorded 155 complaints of human rights violations. 
During these visits, the office held meetings with authorities and representatives of civil 
society. On this basis, OHCHR was able to adjust its advisory and technical cooperation 
services and to provide support to victims and witnesses. In addition, the office provided 
advice to civil society organizations and national institutions. 
</p>
<p>66. The office provided the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers with support during his visit in January and, in coordination with the 
Resident Coordinator&#8217;s Office, supported two follow-up missions in May and July. It also 
supported the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in September. The office 
provided technical assistance to the Presidential Commission on Human Rights 
(COPREDEH) in the periodic reporting to treaty bodies, particularly to the Committee on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(CMW), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human Rights 
Committee. It also gave technical advice in the drafting and dissemination of NGO 
alternative reports presented to CMW, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The concluding 
observations of the latter were presented in 15 dissemination activities. Regarding the

Foreign Affairs, the Congressional Committee on Women, DEMI and the Presidential 
Commission on Discrimination and Racism against Indigenous Peoples (CODISRA). It also 
supported DEMI and CODISRA participation in the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues.  
</p>
<p>67. Regarding the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the office provided technical assistance to the National Council for Persons 
with Disabilities (CONADI) and the Office of the Human Rights Procurator to produce the 
public version of the Convention in text, audio and Braille. The office also participated in 
the joint action plan for dissemination of the Convention, which included four workshops 
with State institutions and indigenous leaders from the Kaqchiquel, Mam, Queqch&#237; and 
Quich&#233; communities. It also supported the Second National Congress on Disability held in 
November 2009. 
</p>
<p>68. In order to promote the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the office 
provided technical assistance in the drafting process of the law for the establishment of a 
national prevention mechanism, in which several State institutions and civil society 
organizations participated. 
</p>
<p>69. In order to assist in the harmonization of national legislation with international 
standards, the office provided the following with technical assistance: the Parliamentary 
Commission for Women, to reform the Law to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Domestic 
Violence, and on the Elections and Political Party Law and the Labour Code; the Legislation 
and Constitutional Points Committee of the Congress, on an opinion about the legal 
initiative on Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking of Persons; and Congress&#8217; 
Migrants Committee, in the reform process of the Migration Law. The office also provided 
the Special Committee for Amendments to the Justice Sector with technical advice 
regarding the Law on Nominating Commissions, and provided assistance to develop legal 
initiatives and regulations promoted by State institutions and civil society organizations, 
such as the reform to the Organic Charter of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and regulations 
to the Prison System Law.  
</p>
<p>70. The office provided technical assistance to the NCP Gender Equity Division, 
including workshops on women&#8217;s rights for police women in seven police districts. To 
follow up on the implementation of legislation on violence against women, the office 
participated in the Multi-sector Committee for the Life and Security of Women, composed 
of members of Congress, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Judiciary, the Institute of 
Public Criminal Defense, the National Commission on Domestic Violence and Violence 
Against Women, the Presidential Secretariat for Women, the Office for the Defence of 
Indigenous Women and civil society organizations.   
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR-Guatemala continued to provide advice to the Body for the Analysis of 
Attacks against Human Rights Defenders and monitored trends and patterns on the human 
rights situation, working with social organizations, the Human Rights Procurator, the 
Ministry of the Interior, COPREDEH, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, donors, and the so-
called filter group of European Union delegations, in charge of monitoring the situation of 
human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>72. The office started a series of capacity-building activities focused on international 
standards applicable to the administration of justice, addressed to the School of Judicial 
Trainers and the judicial clerks of the Constitutional Court. This will continue during 2010.  
</p><p>73. The office provided technical assistance to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in the 
drafting of an internal instruction for the investigation of serious human rights violations 
and a regulation for its Human Rights Office.  </p>

</p>
<p>74. Jointly with the Social Studies and Research Association (ASIES), the office 
disseminated the recommendations contained in the OHCHR-ASIES study on a human 
rights-based approach to indigenous people&#8217;s access to justice: perspectives from indigenous 
law and from the official justice system, particularly to representatives of the Judiciary. 
Discussions were held with indigenous authorities of Quich&#233; and with civil society 
organizations on indicators aimed at monitoring institutional measures in that matter. 
</p>
<p>75. With funding from the German Federal Government, the office continued to 
implement the project entitled &#8220;Contributing to the eradication of racism and ethnic and 
gender discrimination, particularly against indigenous women&#8221;, jointly with CODISRA and 
DEMI. Among other planned activities, the office supported the design and launching of the 
second phase of the National Campaign for Coexistence in Cultural Diversity entitled: 
&#8220;Indigenous women have rights; we demand that they be met&#8221;. This campaign included nine 
regional meetings and media actions. The office also supported the strengthening of DEMI 
and CODISRA legal units through training programmes on strategic litigation in cases of 
discrimination, workshops with female indigenous leaders aimed at promoting a culture of 
filing complaints against human rights violations and round tables with justice operators. It 
also provided technical assistance to update and operate CODISRA and DEMI complaint 
databases. 
</p>
<p>76. The office provided technical assistance to UNDP in the creation and definition of 
the programme to support transitional justice, which will be implemented between 2010 and 
</p><p>2014. 
</p>
<p>77. The office, the Government of Norway and the United Nations System in Guatemala 
signed an agreement for the establishment of the &#8220;Maya Programme&#8221;, and implemented its 
first phase, the &#8220;Technical Training Programme for Strategic Human Rights Litigation for 
Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights&#8221; with 33 students, 8 professors from the participating 
universities (San Carlos and Rafael Landivar), and representatives of 12 indigenous 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>78. Training was provided to judges, prosecutors, police officers and civil society 
organizations on international human rights standards, including independence of the 
judiciary, enforced disappearances, serious human rights violations, juvenile criminal 
justice, access to justice, prevention of torture, discrimination and violence against women, 
access to information, arbitrary interference with private life, the human rights-based 
approach and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>79. The office conducted training programmes and working meetings with 
COPREDEH, the Office of the Human Rights Procurator and the National Human 
Development Report team at UNDP on human rights indicators. 
</p>
<p>80. Regarding the process of the Common Country Assessment and United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (CCA/UNDAF), the office provided technical support 
in the definition of strategic lines and the inclusion of a human rights-based approach. It also 
led the Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Rights, Governance, Security and Justice.  
</p>
<p>81. The office continued to facilitate dialogue between donors and United Nations 
agencies in the Indigenous Peoples and Transition Justice working groups. It also 
participated in Inter-Agency Working Group on Gender and the Advancement of Women 
(GIGAM) meetings, together with the United Nations Development Fund for Women and 
the United Nations Population Fund, and supported the regional launch of the Secretary-
General&#8217;s campaign to end violence against women in November 2009. 
</p>
<p>82. Finally, the office provided information on the situation of human rights through 
press conferences, press releases, interviews, public forums and through the annual report of 
the High Commissioner. It also developed and disseminated publications, audio-visual and </p>

<p>GE.10-11714 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>interactive materials, distributing more than 21,000 copies to State institutions and a wide 
range of civil society organizations. It also provided information to different audiences 
through its Documentation Centre.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Follow-up to recommendations made in previous reports of the High 
Commissioner on the human rights situation in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>83. In her previous report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/10/31/Add.1), the High Commissioner issued 15 recommendations to the 
Government, the Congress, the Judiciary, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and civil society 
organizations, related to the following themes: the legal framework for the protection of 
human rights; the right to life and security; the rule of law and impunity; indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights; women&#8217;s rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. OHCHR-
Guatemala has assisted in the implementation of these recommendations.  
</p>
<p>84. The High Commissioner calls on the relevant counterparts in Guatemala to 
implement the pending recommendations submitted in her predecessor&#8217;s reports (2005 to 
2007) and in her 2008 report to the Human Rights Council, in a coordinated, consistent and 
effective manner. She also calls on the Government to implement the recommendations 
which emanated from the universal periodic review of Guatemala by the Human Rights 
Council in May 2008, and invites civil society to participate in following up and monitoring 
those recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Based on the progress made in 2009 and remaining challenges in the promotion 
and protection of human rights in Guatemala, the High Commissioner makes the 
following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The High Commissioner urges Congress and the Government to ratify the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty, the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. She also urges the Government to recognize the 
competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and to 
adhere to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The right to life and security 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The High Commissioner calls on the Government to urgently undertake the 
necessary measures to ensure that the National Civilian Police efficiently assumes its 
public security role and to ensure that no private citizen or entity assumes those roles,
