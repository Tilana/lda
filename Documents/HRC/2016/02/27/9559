<p><b>Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children,

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 2/102.  In its 
resolution 2005/44, the Commission on Human Rights called upon all States, inter alia, to take 
the necessary measures to eliminate the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
by adopting a holistic approach and addressing the contributing factors, including 
underdevelopment, poverty, economic disparities, inequitable socio-economic structures, 
dysfunctional families, lack of education, urban-rural migration, gender discrimination, 
irresponsible adult sexual behaviour, harmful traditional practices, armed conflicts and 
trafficking in children. 
</p>
<p> In recent years the Special Rapporteur has received worrying allegations relating to the 
issue of illegal trafficking of children&#8217;s organs and tissues, but the sporadic information remains 
in most cases unsubstantiated.  The Special Rapporteur finds it important to examine the above 
problem in his annual report so as to better assess the issue of organ trafficking, in order to 
provide better protection for children in that area, keeping in mind that the best interests of 
children should always remain a primary consideration. 
</p>
<p> Also, the issue of abduction of children is a serious concern to the Special Rapporteur.  
The phenomenon of missing children has taken a worldwide importance, and requires a 
coordinated, comprehensive and global approach.  With the objective of providing standards for 
other States, the Special Rapporteur deemed it worthwhile to provide further details on the 
different models already created in response to the problem.  Rapid-response programmes such 
as those cited as examples are to be encouraged. 
</p>
<p> The report is based on information received from Governments, international 
organizations, non-governmental organizations and individuals in response to a questionnaire 
sent by the Special Rapporteur.  It reflects the responses received from 27 countries, from 
several intergovernmental organizations and from various non-governmental organizations and 
individuals. 
</p>
<p> This report does not pretend to give a comprehensive analysis of the two issues 
discussed, but rather to highlight examples of international and regional standards and strategies 
as well as to discuss the situation in some countries, bearing in mind the legislation adopted and 
how institutions are working regarding these two issues. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
decision 2/102. 
</p>
<p>2. During 2006, the Special Rapporteur carried out one field mission to Ukraine.  The aim 
of this mission was to acquire a better understanding of phenomena such as child trafficking, 
child prostitution and vulnerable children at risk.  The report on the visit is submitted as an 
addendum to this report (A/HRC/4/31/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout the year 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent communications to Governments 
in the form of letters of allegation and urgent appeals, which are detailed along with the 
responses received from concerned Governments as an addendum to this report 
(A/HRC/4/31/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>4. In 2004, the Special Rapporteur had sent requests for invitations to the Governments of 
India and Thailand.  In 2005, the Special Rapporteur sent a request for an invitation to 
Cambodia.  This year, consultations with relevant partners of the mandate were held in Geneva 
to determine other countries that might possibly be visited in 2007.  The Special Rapporteur in 
2006 sent requests for invitations to visit Ukraine, which took place from 22 to 27 October 2006, 
and to Mexico.  The Special Rapporteur has received positive responses to his request to visit 
Mexico in the first half of 2007 and to visit Thailand jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children.  Since his appointment, the Special 
Rapporteur has also visited South Africa, France, Brazil, Paraguay, Romania, Albania and 
Greece. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur addressed the new Human Rights Council during its second 
session from 18 September to 6 October 2006 and presented his annual and mission reports at 
that time, and an interactive dialogue between concerned and interested countries and NGOs 
followed. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur participated, during his visit to Geneva in September 2006, in a 
parallel event on the reinforcement of the children&#8217;s rights protection at United Nations level 
organized by the World Organization against Torture (OMCT), together with Paulo S&#233;rgio 
Pinheiro, independent expert of the Study on violence against children; Norberto Liwski, expert 
member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child; Vitit Muntarbhorn, Chairman of the 
Coordination Committee of the special procedures and current Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and former Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (1991-1994); and 
Eug&#233;nie Nakpa Polo, member of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of 
the Child.  The event aimed at discussing proposals for strengthening United Nations 
mechanisms for the protection of children&#8217;s rights, in view of the follow-up of the 
United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s Study on violence against children, in the context of the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s review of special mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>7. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur continued to receive late replies 
to the questionnaire sent for the preparation of last year&#8217;s annual report, which focused on the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>issue of demand for sexual services deriving from exploitation.  The Special Rapporteur 
concluded that demand was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.  In any situation of child 
sexual exploitation, there were several different kinds of demand generated by different actors at 
different times.  The demand factor went hand in hand with the supply factor and the reasons that 
push children into sexual exploitation were also multiple.  The Special Rapporteur stressed that 
educational programmes as well as awareness-raising activities were essential to reduce demand 
for services deriving from sexual exploitation.  Persons in prostitution should never be 
penalized - either directly for prostitution or indirectly for engaging in a commercial activity 
without a visa or permit.  Non-criminalization ensured that women and children who are forced 
into prostitution have access to the authorities without fear of sanctions.  However, child sexual 
exploitation should always be criminalized, whether committed at home (internal trafficking) or 
abroad, and whether involving an individual or an organized group.  Consent of the child to 
trafficking is always to be considered irrelevant. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RELATION TO THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Positive developments during the year 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that 10 more countries, namely Algeria, Belgium, 
Burkina Faso, Cyprus, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, 
Switzerland and Thailand ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in 2006.  The Special 
Rapporteur strongly encourages the States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the two 
Optional Protocols to the Convention, the other being on children and armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>9. At the regional level, 2006 was marked by the signature by Governments of West and 
Central African States of a multilateral agreement and regional plan of action to fight trafficking in 
persons and build a wall against traffickers in both regions.  The Agreement was signed at a Joint 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and Economic Community of Central 
African States (ECCAS) Conference of Ministers to combat trafficking in persons held in Abuja, and 
hosted by ECOWAS. 
</p>
<p>10. Bilateral agreements were also signed in February 2006 between Albania and Greece on 
trafficking, and between Turkey and four neighbouring countries concerning trafficking in human 
beings to ensure cooperation with the police of other countries on that issue.  Viet Nam and China 
organized in August 2006 a Children&#8217;s Forum on cross-border trafficking between these two 
countries. 
</p>
<p>11. At the national level, in February 2006 Benin adopted an Anti-Trafficking Law and in 
April 2006 Slovenia signed the European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings.  In November 2006, Peru announced the creation of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsperson to 
oversee the defence and promotion of the rights of children and adolescents.  As well, 
Afghanistan launched a new National Strategy for Children at Risk in May 2006, designed to 
improve care and support for the country&#8217;s most vulnerable children.  This strategy will set out 
to improve provision of care for working street children who are orphans, children in conflict </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>with the law, children deprived of parental care and children suffering abuse.  Finally, the 
Syrian Arab Republic announced plans to elaborate a national programme to combat child 
prostitution and pornography and requested the assistance of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to this effect. 
</p>
<p>12. Initiatives taken over the year to fight child sex tourism also deserve to be highlighted, 
such as the one launched in June 2006 by Sri Lanka.  A two-year action plan to stop commercial 
exploitation of children was signed by the Sri Lanka Tourist Board with the support of the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF).  This follows previous initiatives taken in the past in 
South-East Asia as well as in Japan, France and Kenya. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Report on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>13. The year 2006 was marked by the presentation of the report on violence against children 
(the Study).  In 2003, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 57/190, the Secretary-General 
appointed an independent expert, Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro, to lead the Study and provide a global 
picture of violence against children and recommendations to prevent and respond to this issue.  
The Study was prepared through a participatory process that included regional, subregional and 
national consultations, expert thematic meeting, field visits and the collaboration of the 
Governments through a questionnaire.  It also involved the cooperation of different 
United Nations bodies, such as OHCHR, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), 
civil societies and children. 
</p>
<p>14. It is the first comprehensive, global analysis conducted by the United Nations that deals 
with all the forms of violence against children in its different settings (in homes, schools and 
educational settings, care and justice systems, in work settings and in the community in general).  
Directly engaging children in the analysis, this Study combines at the same time human rights, 
public health and a child protection perspective.  Before examining the settings in which 
violence against children occurs, the Study set a global framework of the issue.  The problem is 
still mainly hidden, unreported or under-recorded and data generated by international and local 
initiatives show that the majority of violent acts are perpetrated by people who are part of their 
lives.  The Study also analysed the risk and protective factors on the question and the range of 
short- and long-term repercussions of violence on children. 
</p>
<p>15. The core message of the Study is that no violence against children is justifiable; all 
violence against children is preventable.  There can be no compromise.  Therefore, Member 
States, all sectors of the society, and all individuals must commit themselves in ensuring 
protection from all forms of violence against children.  Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro addressed a 
number of overarching recommendations and specific ones relating to the different settings 
where violence occurs.  Among the recommendations, the Study indicated that all States should 
strengthen national and local commitment, prohibit all violence against children, prioritize 
prevention, and promote non-violent values. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur would like to congratulate Mr. Pinheiro and his team for this 
outstanding Study.  This first global report on the issue of violence against children will 
undoubtedly strengthen the efforts and progress already realized on the subject.  With reference </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to our mandate, the report will ameliorate the data collection on violence occurring because of 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and encourage the States parties to 
ratify and implement the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography. 
</p>
<p>17. More specifically, Mr. Pinheiro suggests, in order to ensure the safety of children in 
residential care and juvenile justice detention facilities, to reduce the numbers of children in 
those centres by decriminalizing &#8220;status offences&#8221;, survival behaviours and victimization by 
trafficking or criminal exploitation.  With regard to violence against children occurring in the 
workplace, the report recommends that States implement domestic labour laws, mainstream the 
elimination of child labour and give priority to the &#8220;worst forms&#8221; of child labour, which are 
inherently violent.  Where children are working illegally, it is important to ensure the availability 
of recovery and integration programmes.  Finally, in the community context, the Study proposes 
several ideas, such as to enhance the prosecution of offences relating to the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography through the review of domestic laws in order to abolish the 
requirement of &#8220;double criminality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SALE OF CHILDREN</b>&#8217;<b>S ORGANS 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the past years, the Special Rapporteur has received worrying allegations relating 
to the issue of illegal trafficking of children&#8217;s organs and tissues.  In fact, the sporadic 
information remains in most cases unsubstantiated.  Trafficking of organs remains a sensitive 
issue, especially when involving vulnerable victims such as children.  The Special Rapporteur 
finds it important to examine the above problem in his annual report so as to better assess the 
issue of organ trafficking.  This will provide better protection for children in that area, keeping in 
mind the best interests of children which should always be a primary consideration. 
</p>
<p>19. According to information gathered, human organs and tissues are generally trafficked for 
different reasons.  For example, they can be used for genetic research, religious or magic rituals, 
but are mainly trafficked for transplantation use.  In fact, thanks to the rapid progress of medical 
science and technology, the success of organ transplantation is progressively increasing.  
However, a gap between the supply and demand for organs is continuing to widen.  In fact, 
patient demand for transplants is so strong and the medical capacity to satisfy it so widespread, 
that shortages of organs are therefore bound to occur.  It is alleged that, in recent years, 
international criminal organizations have detected the lucrative aspect of this black market.  With 
the globalization of this phenomenon, the trade is becoming known as &#8220;transplant tourism&#8221;.  As 
a result, this shortfall in the availability of organs in certain areas of the globe has generated a 
desperate search for them.  Many people are thus prepared to travel to secure a transplant, and 
are even ready to put aside the questions about how the organ was obtained. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur believes that one of the major problems pertaining to this 
particular issue is that, while evidence abounds for the trade of adult organs, the search for proof 
concerning trade in children&#8217;s organs poses a still greater challenge.  In fact, the knowledge of 
this particular organ trafficking remains weak due to an overload of rumours and hearsay.  Most 
of the stories related to child organ trafficking have spontaneously arisen as &#8220;urban legends&#8221;, 
which could be defined as a false but widely believed form of modern folklore.  The danger </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of that is when the information gathered is partial or even inaccurate, intervention will 
unfortunately not be effective.  For example, in Guatemala in 1994, several American nationals 
were attacked owing to unfounded rumours concerning trafficking of children for organ 
transplantation.  Other rumours have since been denounced by the media in countries such as 
Azerbaijan, Mozambique, Brazil and India but not all the information obtained could be 
assessed. 
</p>
<p>21. The issue has previously been analysed by other Special Rapporteurs, in 1991 and 1999 
respectively (E/CN.4/1991/51 and E/CN.4/1999/71), but blind spots persist.  This is the reason 
why the Special Rapporteur thought it primordial to address this issue once again in his annual 
report.  An extensive questionnaire was thus developed on the sale of children&#8217;s organs and sent 
to all Member States and to intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations working 
on issues related to trafficking on 24 July 2006.  Member States were requested to respond 
by 31 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>22. The questionnaire covered a number of queries on the subject.  First of all, the Special 
Rapporteur wished to know about the framework that the Member States had elaborated.  More 
specifically, the States and NGOs were probed on the multilateral, regional and bilateral 
arrangements developed in order to prevent and eliminate the sale of children&#8217;s organs.  
Furthermore, another number of questions were set up in order to acquire more knowledge of the 
national legislation applicable on that matter, the different public institutions in charge of 
preventing, countering and eliminating the sale of child organs and their role and activities. 
</p>
<p>23. Secondly, the Special Rapporteur enquired about the factual context occurring in the 
different States, particularly if there had been official reports relating to the sale of organs in 
general and also involving children.  If so, what had been the measures undertaken?  Finally, two 
matters were tackled:  if there had been cases of abduction or disappearance of children in which 
they were later found (alive or dead) with missing organs; and, if reports had been published 
relating to the existence of religious or magic rituals involving the removal of organs. 
</p>
<p>24. As of 12 December 2006, the following Governments had responded to the 
questionnaire:  Austria, Belarus, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, 
Germany, Honduras, Japan, Lithuania, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Nicaragua, 
Philippines, Qatar, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of). 
</p>
<p>25. The responses from Belarus and Ukraine were received on time and sent for translation.  
Unfortunately, these responses could not be debated in the report due to the non-receipt of the 
translations.  As for the late responses received from Qatar and Moldova, they could also 
unfortunately not be considered in this report for the same reason. 
</p>
<p>26. The questionnaire was also sent to NGOs and intergovernmental organizations and 
replies were received from the Child Rights Information Network; World Vision International in 
Guatemala and Kenya; Save the Children in Guatemala, Norway, and Uganda; and Plan 
International in Togo, Guinea, Senegal, Mali, Ghana and West Africa.  A response was also 
received from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children regarding the issue of 
rapid response programmes, which will be discussed later in the report. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur would like to warmly thank all those who responded to the 
questionnaire.  Only a relevant selection of the experiences and initiatives on which information 
was received is outlined in this report. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  International and regional standards/strategies 
</b></p>
<p>28. Due to the rapid development of the organ and tissue trafficking issue, the Special 
Rapporteur finds it worthwhile to present the different standards and strategies that have been 
developed both on the international then on the regional level, in order to lay out a general 
overview on that particular question. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography ensures in its article 3 that different acts and 
activities must be covered under criminal or penal law as a minimum guarantee.  In this specific 
context, the profitable act of offering, delivering or accepting, by whichever means, a child for 
the purpose of transfer of organs is expressly included.  Furthermore, the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime also defines the concept of 
trafficking in persons in its article 3.  The removal of organs is defined as a case of exploitation. 
</p>
<p>30. The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors implementation of the two Optional 
Protocols to the Convention, on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography.  All States parties are obliged to submit 
regular reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented.  Additional reports 
are also submitted for those who have acceded to the Optional Protocols.  The Committee cannot 
consider individual complaints, although child rights may be raised before other committees with 
competence to consider individual complaints.  In this regard, reports from several Member 
States (Italy, Norway, Turkey, Iceland, Kazakhstan, and Denmark)<b>1</b> have been submitted to the 
Committee that have alluded to the question of trafficking of organs in their country. 
</p>
<p>31. Several allegations were also brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention over the past 
years.  These mainly cover two specific situations of children trafficked with the aim of 
removing their organs for transplantation, and of ritual killings in which human parts were 
offered as sacrifices.  On 28 January 2004, an urgent appeal was sent to the Government 
of Mozambique concerning the situation of five nuns from the Sister Servants of Mary 
Immaculate who had been working in the Nampula region for over 30 years.  According to the 
source, the nuns began to receive death threats after they had uncovered an organ-trafficking 
network.  The Special Rapporteur expressed his deep concern about the threats and the 
allegations reported by the nuns (see E/CN.4/2005/78/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>32. WHO has also addressed this issue.  The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to hold 
discussions at WHO with the Clinical Procedures Unit in the Department of Essential Health 
Technologies, which covered the issue of organ and tissue transplantation for the preparation of 
this report.  In 1991, WHO approved a set of Guiding Principles on human organ transplantation </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in order to provide an orderly, ethical and acceptable framework for regulating the acquisition 
and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes.<b>2</b>  In such cases, the protection of 
minors could be assured by requiring the minor&#8217;s comprehending consent and the consent of the 
parent or the legal guardian.  Guiding principle 4 provides absolute prohibition of the removal of 
organs from legal minors, exception in the case of regenerative tissues.  It adds in guiding 
principle 5 that no human body or parts can be the subject of commercial transactions, neither 
compensations nor rewards.  Finally, guiding principle 7 prohibits physicians and other health 
professionals from engaging in organ transplantation procedures if they have reason to believe 
that the organs concerned have been the subject of commercial transactions. 
33. In response to a request of the Government of Colombia, the Ethics Department and the 
Department of Essential Health Technologies of WHO undertook a study on the issue.  The 
report was accepted by the Executive Board and, after several amendments, the fifty-seventh 
World Health Assembly adopted a resolution in May 2004, that urged the member States to take 
measures to protect the poorest and most vulnerable groups from &#8220;transplant tourism&#8221; and the 
sale of tissues and organs, including by giving attention to the wider problem of international 
trafficking in human organs.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>34. On 20 December 2004, the General Assembly of the United Nations, in its 
resolution 59/156, also made a recommendation on the issue of illicit removal and trafficking of 
human organs.<b>4</b>  It requested the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and 
Criminal Justice to prepare a study on the extent of the phenomenon for submission at its 
fifteenth session. 
</p>
<p>35. The United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) has also contributed on this 
matter, through its Terrorism, Corruption and Human Trafficking division.  According to 
UNODC, trafficking in human beings (including the removal of organs) is a global issue, and 
there is a need to strengthen the criminal justice response to trafficking through legislative 
reform, awareness-raising and training, as well as national and international cooperation.  
Thus, the Global Programme against Trafficking in Human Beings (GPAT) was launched in 
March 1999 with its main objective being to bring to the foreground the involvement of 
organized criminal groups on that issue.  Its key components are data collection, assessment and 
technical cooperation.  Pursuant to that aim, a report was issued in April 2006 entitled &#8220;Global 
Patterns&#8221;, which constitutes an analysis of human trafficking data collected from 1996 to 2003 
that shows patterns at the global, regional and national levels. 
</p>
<p>36. Moreover, several countries are involved in technical cooperation projects and specific 
intervention measures are introduced to strengthen the capacity to combat forms of trafficking.  
At the national levels, the programme helps, for example, to promote awareness-raising by 
public campaigns, to train law-enforcement officers, prosecutors and judges or to strengthen 
victim and witness support.  For example, in the West African region, a project is currently 
under implementation covering Benin, Togo, and Nigeria.  With support from Canada, France 
and Norway, the project carries out an assessment of human trafficking trends.  Training for 
criminal justice practitioners was provided in February-March 2004 focusing on the 
investigation and prosecution of human trafficking as well as international cooperation.  On an </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international level, GPAT provides assistance to agencies, institutions and Governments in order 
to design effective measures against trafficking in human beings and cooperated closely with 
other intergovernmental and NGOs in the implementation of the activities. 
</p>
<p>37. Among the organizations working on the issue of trafficking of organs are Interpol and 
Europol.  But due to lack of information on their activities, it is difficult for the Special 
Rapporteur to express his views as to what the two entities are currently undertaking.  Finally, it 
is also worth mentioning the following legal standards developed by the World Medical 
Association (WMA) on the subject:  the Statement on Live Organ Donation and Transplantation 
(revised in October 2006); the Resolution on the non-commercialization of human reproductive 
material (May 2003); the Statement on Fetal Tissue Transplantation (2006); and the Statement 
on In-Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transplantation (2006). 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Regional standards 
</b></p>
<p>38. On the regional level, the Council of Europe has greatly contributed through the 
elaboration of legal standards and publication of reports.  A number of conventions and 
recommendations have been adopted by the Committee of Ministers, more specifically the 
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005), the Convention on Human 
Rights and Biomedicine (1997), the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights and 
Biomedicine, on Transplantation of Organs and Tissues of Human Origin.<b>5</b>  There were also 
recommendations relating to the issue:  Recommendation No. 94 on human tissue banks, 
Recommendation No. 97 on liver transplantation from living related donors, and 
Recommendation No. 5 on the management or organ transplant waiting lists and waiting times. 
</p>
<p>39. The Rapporteur of the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe, Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold has also worked on the 
question of trafficking of organs.  In June 2003, she submitted a report entitled &#8220;Trafficking in 
organs in Europe&#8221;,<b>6</b> which raised important ethical questions on the subject.  As a result, the 
Assembly called on the Council of Europe to develop a European strategy for combating 
trafficking in organs and recommended a number of concrete measures to be taken in the 
&#8220;donor&#8221; and the &#8220;demand&#8221; countries.  According to the Rapporteur, most countries in Europe 
still have legislative loopholes in the domain of criminal responsibility in organ trafficking and it 
is rarely specified in details in national criminal codes.  The Rapporteur also visited several 
countries of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Moldova.  She mainly expressed her deep 
concern on the issue of the disappearance of newborn children in this area.  Only three legal 
inquiries have been launched (in December 2002) and they have produced no concrete results to 
date.  To date, no further updates on the investigations have been produced or made public by 
the Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>40. Recommendation 1611, adopted in 2003, invited States to strengthen their existing 
mechanisms of cooperation with the Committee on the Organization Aspects of Cooperation in 
Organ Transplantation and step up funding for assistance activities in this area.  It also 
recommended the adoption and application of the recommendations in the World Medical 
Association.  As for the &#8220;demand&#8221; countries, it invited, among others, to take appropriate 
measures to encourage individuals to indicate, by means of statements of &#8220;consent&#8221;, their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>wish to donate their organs after their death, in order to increase the availability of organs and 
tissues obtained post-mortem.  Finally, the principle according to which the human body and its 
parts shall not, as such, give rise to financial gain is part of the legal <i>acquis</i> of the Council of 
Europe.  This principle was enacted by article 21 of the Convention on Human Rights and 
Biomedicine and reiterated in its Additional Protocol on Transplantation of Organs and Tissues 
of Human Origin. 
</p>
<p>41. The Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI) of the European Health Committee 
(CDSP) also works on the trafficking of organs in the framework of the Council of Europe.  
Among its activities, the CDBI aims to harmonize the policies of member States as far as 
possible and to prepare additional protocols to the Convention on human rights and biomedicine 
on ethical and legal questions related to different topics, such as organ transplantation.  In 
June 2005, the Committee published the responses of 40 member States to a questionnaire on 
organ trafficking.  Asked about the existence of allegations that residents have been travelling 
abroad to illegally sell or procure organs, the Committee noted that five States (Albania, Croatia, 
Cyprus, France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) responded 
positively, without specifying if it involved children.  Further asked about any official 
investigations having taken place in the past to ascertain allegations of organ trafficking, seven 
States responded positively (Albania, France, Georgia, Germany, the Russian Federation, Turkey 
and the United Kingdom) but only Albania mentioned a case involving a child. 
</p>
<p>42. Another regional scheme developed on the regional level is the Eurotransplant 
International Foundation.  It is responsible for the mediation and allocation of organ donation 
procedures in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Croatia (a 
candidate country).  In this international collaborative framework, the participants include all 
transplant hospitals, tissue-typing laboratories and hospitals where organ donations take place. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Other initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>43. On a non-governmental level, the Special Rapporteur would like to mention some of the 
initiatives undertaken.  The work of the Bellagio Task Force on Securing Bodily Integrity for the 
Socially Disadvantaged in Transplant Surgery (1994-1996) was developed by Columbia 
University in order to produce a document on the use of organs for transplantation.  The report 
that emerged from the Task Force<b> 7</b> documented the many abuses that flow from the traffic in 
organs, including the sale of organs in countries such as India and the use of organs from 
executed prisoners, in countries such as China.  It also analysed the complex sources of rumours 
of organ theft, which have not been documented but nevertheless point to the pervasive fears of a 
loss of bodily integrity by vulnerable populations.  Its main recommendation is for the 
establishment of a permanent monitoring body through the creation of an international human 
donor surveillance committee that could firstly serve as a clearing-house for information on 
organ donation practices, and secondly, produce an annual review of declarations by 
international transplant and human rights groups on organ donation and examine the ethical 
issues in donation. 
</p>
<p>44. In a follow-up to the Bellagio Task Force, Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Lawrence Cohen 
of the Department of Anthropology, University of California at Berkeley, with support from the 
Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation) conducted ethnographic research in sites in Brazil, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>India and South Africa during 1997-1998.<b>8</b>  Their findings revealed different points and among 
them, that there existed strong and persistent race, class, and gender inequalities and injustices in 
the acquisition, harvesting and distribution of organs, persistent and flagrant human rights 
violations of cadavers in public morgues, with organs and tissues removed without any consent 
for international sale and a spread and persistence of narratives of terror concerning the theft and 
disappearance of bodies and body parts globally. 
</p>
<p>45. Further studies were conducted by Professor Scheper-Hughes also a member of the 
Bellagio Task Force.  In 2000, she put forward a paper entitled &#8220;The global traffic in human 
organs&#8221;.  Moreover, the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) submitted 
a report<b>9</b> in order to improve the flow of information related to the removal of organs, 
specifically to kidneys.  The study concluded that effective regulation would require a system of 
free long-term health care for kidney-sellers.  According to the report, in human and organ 
trafficking, the root causes are poverty and discrimination.  Its recommendations for the 
Governments are to promote the ratification of relevant international instruments and to 
elaborate alternative measures such as increasing the supply of cadaver donations.  The report 
suggests that NGOs undertake needs assessments in the area so as to provide specialized services 
to the victims of organ trafficking.  The donor organizations&#8217; contribution should be for example, 
to support research for campaigning purposes in order to encourage effective legislative action. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National strategies:  responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Reported cases:  replies of Governments and NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>46. The questionnaire asked Governments to identify cases relating to the sale of organs 
involving adults and children, if there had been cases of abduction/disappearing of children 
where the victim was later found with a missing organ and if there had been reports relating to 
the existence of religious/magic rituals which could lead to the removal of organs.  Based on 
the information received, few Member States have encountered cases of sale or trafficking of 
organs.  Some of them have nevertheless been reported. 
</p>
<p>47.<b> Germany</b> indicated that there had only been reports relating to attempted trafficking of 
organs.  In 2002, the Munich Regional Court found an individual guilty of attempted trafficking 
of organs from Eastern Europe.  He was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  Shortly after that, the 
Hombert/Efze local court held the view that offering one&#8217;s own kidney for sale on the Internet 
was considered an illegal trafficking attempt.  Moreover, the Federal Criminal Police Office 
(BKA) is currently investigating different cases.  The Mannheim public prosecutor&#8217;s office is 
looking into a case of a Chinese student who offered to act as a middleman in finding donors 
from an alleged Chinese public hospital.  The Hanover public prosecutor&#8217;s office is also 
investigating a company based in Prague advertising access to donated kidneys without a waiting 
list.  But in all the cases investigated in Germany, there has been no proof of illegal removal or 
transplantation of organs or human tissue, nor has there been any specific case related to the 
trafficking of children&#8217;s organs. 
</p>
<p>48.<b> Finland </b>reported a case of sale and/or trafficking of organs in which a minor was 
involved.  Its National Bureau of Investigation is aware of a particular case in which 
intelligence reports suggest that, in 2004, a young Russian girl was transported through </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Finland to another country possibly for the purpose of organ transplantation.  Unfortunately, 
the information could not be confirmed and no evidence could be found by the intelligence 
reports. 
</p>
<p>49.<b> Turkey </b>stated that there had been allegations reported in the press of cases relating to 
the sale/trafficking of organs intervening some private medical clinics in Turkey where the 
foreign donors and receivers met and where the operation was conducted.  However, it added 
that because the new Penal Code has been newly adopted and due to the statistics collection 
technique of the relevant judicial bodies in Turkey, it is impossible for the time being to 
provide any information on the court verdicts on this issue. 
</p>
<p>50. The same questionnaire was sent to non-governmental organizations and they have also 
highlighted allegations of cases of sale and/or trafficking of organs. 
</p>
<p>51. An NGO<b> </b>reported unconfirmed allegations obtained from local sources that organs 
from kidnapped children had been used for sacrificial purposes, precisely for witchcraft 
practices in Kenya and Zambia.  In fact, according to the NGO, these practices involved the 
sacrificing of humans, especially children.  The belief is that the ancestors to whom sacrifices 
are to be made in order to grant clients&#8217; requests require an innocent being that has not shed 
any blood in whatever form.  According to the source, the child (usually aged between 4 
and 10) is abducted, and then murdered for the removal of his/her organs.  Another NGO also 
reported on allegations of organ trafficking for magic rituals that were taking place in countries 
like Ghana and Nigeria.  The aim in removing human organs for that purpose is to fulfil one&#8217;s 
political and financial ambitions.  These statements, having not been confirmed by the 
Governments concerned or by other sources, remain unsubstantiated evidence. 
</p>
<p>52. Reports have recently been circulated in the press<b>10</b> indicating that Chinese officials had 
for the first time recognized the existence of an organ black market in China, originating from 
executed prisoners.  According to these reports, no public officials were involved in the 
trafficking, only surgeons.  Once again, having not been confirmed by the Governments 
concerned or by other sources, this statement remains unsubstantiated. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  National standards/strategies:  Government responses 
</b></p>
<p>53. The questionnaire also asked Governments and other recipients to identify the 
multilateral agreements concerning the prevention and elimination of the sale of children and 
bilateral or regional arrangements that had been elaborated to counter trafficking of organs.  It 
was encouraging to note that respondents shared a common understanding of the issue of sale 
and/or trafficking of organs involving children.  They have for the most part ratified a number 
of the multilateral conventions relating to the subject. 
54. Only a few bilateral or regional arrangements have been adopted.  In the framework of 
the Council of Europe, several conventions have been signed and ratified by a number of its 
member States.  <b>Slovenia</b>,<b> </b>for example, stated that its Government had ratified the Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in April 2006.  <b>Germany </b>also mentioned the 
Eurotransplant International Foundation previously described.  And <b>Chile </b>indicated that it had 
signed a bilateral agreement with Argentina for the cooperation of their respective police 
forces. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>55. One NGO based in West Africa reported some regional and bilateral agreements.  
According to this NGO, several countries have signed bilateral agreements to combat the 
trafficking of children, such as the agreement between Senegal and Mali or that between Mali 
and Guinea.  In a more general context, a multilateral agreement was also signed by nine 
countries of the West African region relating to the same issue.  Unfortunately, since the 
Special Rapporteur did not receive any responses from those specific countries, the signing of 
these agreements could not be ascertained. 
</p>
<p>56. The questionnaire enquired about the national (including regional/provincial/state) 
legislation applicable to prevent, counter and eliminate the sale of children as well as the 
public institutions in charge of these actions.  The Special Rapporteur was pleased to receive a 
great deal of information on the legislations elaborated in several States.  Those quoted in the 
report are intended to be a representative sample to illustrate the different range of standards 
being developed and actions being taken. 
</p>
<p>57. Most of the Governments have penalized the issue of trafficking in human organs in 
their respective Penal Codes, providing sanctions such as imprisonment and/or a fine.  <b>Turkey 
</b>has an article in its new Penal Code on the issue of trafficking of organs and tissues that 
defines all the different scenarios of illegal removal of human organs and tissues as well as 
applicable penalties.  It even includes the case of a person who gives out a notice or 
advertisement regarding the obtaining of human organs or tissue for a particular profit.  Other 
countries have similar provisions in their Penal Codes such as Estonia, Slovenia, Mexico, 
Lithuania, Malta, Canada, Monaco, Finland, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>58.<b> Lithuania</b>, <b>Malta</b> and <b>Finland </b>also provide, in their above-mentioned provisions, 
aggravating circumstances relating to the issue of trafficking of organs or tissue that could 
strengthen the penalty.  In <b>Finland</b>,<b> </b>for example, chapter 21 of the Penal Code stipulates that 
the removal of children&#8217;s organs is considered as an aggravating circumstance. 
</p>
<p>59. Along with the provisions of the Penal Code, some States have also adopted other 
specific provisions or laws pertaining to the issue of trafficking of organs.  <b>Turkey </b>adopted 
Law No. 2238 on Organ and Tissue Taking, Grafting and Transplantation which provides 
specific regulations when minors are involved in organ transplantation.  <b>Germany </b>stated in its 
response the Transplantation Act, specifically section 17 relating to the trafficking of organs.  
The law stipulates that it is not necessary that the transplant has actually taken place in order 
to establish a case of trafficking.  In <b>Chile</b>,<b> </b>the Law on Transplantation also relates to the 
sale of organs articulating that no organs can be the subject of commercial transactions.  The 
<b>United Arab Emirates </b>stated that its Federal Act No. 15 of 1993 regulates the removal and 
transplant of human organs and prohibits any form of sale or purchase of human organs and any 
profiteering therefrom. 
</p>
<p>60. Other States have instead addressed the issue in general national legislations.  The 
General Law on Health in <b>Mexico </b>has included in articles 461 and 462, specific provisions on 
the transportation of organs and tissues outside the Mexican borders and without the Ministry 
of Health or provisions on illegal obtaining, conservation, use and preparation of cadaver or 
fetus organs.  The Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents and the federal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Penal Code do not have any specific legislation on the issue of the sale of children&#8217;s organs, 
but articles 11 to 13 of the Law for the Protection of Children and Adolescents encompass this 
issue.  On the other hand, several federal states have integrated in their respective penal codes 
specific stipulation on the subject.  The District Federal State has developed article 172 in its 
Penal Code and a similar understanding can be found in article 369 of the Penal Code of the 
State of Durango. 
</p>
<p>61. In federal countries such as <b>Mexico</b> and <b>Canada</b>, each level of Government has 
adopted legislations on that matter.  <b>Canada </b>for instance, while providing regulations on the 
matter in the Criminal Code, strictly regulates organ transplantation/donation at the 
provincial/territorial level.  In Quebec, the Civil Code provides specific articles in its chapter 
64 on the issue and in British Columbia, this is in the Human Tissue Gift Act adopted in 2000.  
Both laws prohibit the sale, purchase and dealing in, directly or indirectly, any tissue or body 
parts.  Moreover, the Criminal Code of Canada does not have a specific provision addressing 
the illegal removal of human organs and tissues but any general Criminal Code offences can be 
invoked for any removal that does not comply with the relevant legislation.  Finally, the 
question of consent is dealt with in provincial legislation.  In general, valid consent cannot be 
given directly by persons who are under age or who lack the necessary mental capacity, and 
the consent on behalf of such persons is limited to cases where there are valid therapeutic 
reasons. 
</p>
<p>62. The last question raised by the questionnaire dealt with the different public institutions 
in charge of preventing, countering and eliminating the sale of children&#8217;s organs, their role and 
activities.  A number of countries, such as Estonia, Mauritius, Turkey, Slovenia, Croatia, 
Japan, Venezuela, Malta, Sweden, Canada, Philippines, and Chile conferred responsibility for 
the issue of organ trafficking to the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health (and Social 
Welfare) and the police force.  In <b>Mauritius</b>,<b> </b>the Ministry of Women and Child&#8217;s Rights is 
also responsible in tackling the question of trafficking of women&#8217;s and child&#8217;s organs. 
</p>
<p>63. Several States have elaborated other public institutions specifically related to the issue.  
<b>Croatia </b>established in 2002 the National Committee for the Suppression of Trafficking in 
Persons, composed of representatives of State administrative bodies involved in the prevention 
of trafficking of persons, as well as representatives of legislative and judicial bodies and 
NGOs.  Within this framework, a special Working Group for the Prevention of Trafficking in 
Children prepared the National Plan for the Suppression of Trafficking in Children for the 
period from October 2005 to December 2007.  In <b>Sweden</b>,<b> </b>a similar inter-ministerial Working 
Group was set up in charge of compiling of knowledge about trafficking in human beings for 
the purpose of removal of organs and on that basis will propose a national action plan.  The 
working group will present its results by the end of 2007. 
</p>
<p>64. In the <b>Philippines</b>,<b> </b>several public institutions are in charge in countering the sale of 
children&#8217;s organs.  The National Kidney and Transplant Institute is the designated lead 
government medical centre for organ transplantation in the Philippines.  The Philippines 
Centre for Transnational Crime (PCTC) is the special police institution that pursues trafficking 
cases beyond the Philippines borders.  The Inter-Agency Council against Trafficking (IACAT) 
is the multi-agency body created mainly mandated to coordinate, monitor and oversee the 
implementation of the same law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>Canada </b>stated that specific oversight of processing and transplantation of human 
organs and tissue were undertaken thanks to the Canadian Institute for Health Information 
(CIHI) that acts as a focal point for collaboration between health actors (governments, regional 
health authorities, hospitals, researchers) and health-care professional associations.  
Furthermore, the Canadian Organ Replacement Register is a national database whose mandate 
is to record and analyse the level of activity and outcomes of vital organ transplantation and 
renal dialysis activities. 
</p>
<p>66. In <b>Germany</b>,<b> </b>the institutions involved in the organ donation, allocation and 
transplantation include hospitals and transplantation centres and the <i>Deutsche Stiftung 
Organstransplantation</i> (German organ transplant foundation), which is responsible for the 
coordination or organ donation in Germany, as well as Eurotransplant, which controls the 
mediation part of the allocation of organs. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. RAPID-RESPONSE PROGRAMMES FOR ABDUCTED  
OR DISAPPEARED CHILDREN 
</b></p>
<p>67. The issue of missing children has become a serious concern in a number of States.  In 
fact, disappearances and abductions often constitute the first step for the perpetrators to achieve 
their goal, including sexual exploitation of the kidnapped children.  Because it often involves the 
most vulnerable, the task is even more pressing.  According to the Special Rapporteur, outreach 
on prevention and on fast and effective responses is essential.  Rapid-response programmes 
should be encouraged in cases of abduction and disappearances of children.  In fact, several 
States have already elaborated a number of legislative and administrative measures and 
programmes to tackle this issue.  For example, centres for missing children with up-to-date 
facilities have been created.  To provide standards for other States, the Special Rapporteur will 
provide further details on the different models already created in response to the problem. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  International and regional standards 
</b></p>
<p>68. Several legal instruments have been elaborated at the international and regional levels to 
address this difficult issue.  Articles 9 to 11 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
stipulate that all children have the right to maintain regular personal relations with both 
parents.  Along with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Hague Convention of 
25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction<b>11</b> seeks to ensure the 
immediate return of children who have been unlawfully removed or retained in any of the 
contracting States.  It also ensures that rights of custody and access laid down by the State in 
which the child is habitually resident are effectively respected in other contracting States.  On the 
whole, the provisions of this Convention help to ensure that a child, through a clear and speedy 
process, is returned to his or her habitual domicile within 30 to 45 days, unless exceptions occur, 
such as if the child&#8217;s return entails a risk of exposing him/her to danger.  Furthermore, it is worth 
mentioning several standards developed at the regional level.  The Council of Europe 
Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and 
on Restoration of Custody of Children<b>12</b> defines improper removal as the removal of a child 
across an international frontier.  Lastly, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of 
Human Rights,<b>13</b> particularly its article 8, also ensures the right to family life. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Global initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>69. The International Centre of Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) is a global agency 
founded in 1998 working for the well-being of children through activism, policy development 
and multinational coordination.  It encourages the creation of new national, operational centres 
that are based on a public-private partnership model and established with the support of the 
national Government such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) 
in the United States and Child Focus in Belgium.  The main objective of ICMEC is to develop in 
interested nations those centres including at minimum:  a call centre, a photo distribution system 
and linkages with law enforcement by offering training, model policies and procedures, and 
technical support.  A network comprised of 17 countries has also been developed.  In fact, the 
Global Missing Children Network is a central and multilingual database featuring information 
about and photographs of missing children; 17 websites feed into it. 
</p>
<p>70. A number of countries have also demonstrated their interest in working closely with 
ICMEC, such as Costa Rica, Romania and South Africa.  The South African Centre for Missing 
and Exploited Children (SACMEC) was launched in April 2004.  The scope of its activities is 
broad but its flagship project is the tracing and recovery of missing children.  Reported cases of 
missing children are dealt with following specific operational guidelines.  These cases are 
immediately reported to SACMEC and each case is assigned to a dedicated case manager, who 
reports to the Director, liaises closely with relevant law-enforcement agencies and facilitates the 
sharing of information and resources.  The SACMEC support staff also ensures the rapid 
dissemination of information on cases and assists in the process of repatriation, rehabilitation and 
follow-up counselling.  Finally, cases of cross-border abduction are handled by SACMEC in 
cooperation with Interpol. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National initiatives:  National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children 
</b></p>
<p>71. The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), based in the 
United States of America, is a non-governmental organization founded upon the concept of 
public-private partnership.  Congress provides the core funding but NCMEC remains a private 
entity.  Since 1984, it has handled 2 million calls through its 24-hour call centre, disseminated 
millions of photos of missing children, and trained 211,000 professionals.  Its recovery rate has 
climbed from 62 per cent in 1990 to 96 per cent today.  Several divisions and programmes 
related to missing and abducted children exist within NCMEC. 
</p>
<p>72. The &#8220;AMBER Alert Plan&#8221; (America&#8217;s Missing:  Broadcast Emergency Response) is a 
voluntary partnership between law-enforcement agencies and broadcasters to activate an urgent 
bulletin in the most serious child-abduction cases so as to instantly galvanize the entire 
community.  NCMEC&#8217;s goal is to offer technical assistance and training, in concert with the 
United States Department of Justice, to all AMBER Alert Plans.  A set of criteria have been put 
up in order to ensure a smooth AMBER Alert system.  The main criteria are that the child has to 
encounter an imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death and that there is enough 
descriptive information on him/her.  A toll-free call centre that operates a 24-hour hotline is also 
made available.  The Case Analysis and Support Division works to identify patterns between 
cases from across the United States.  Furthermore, &#8220;Code Adam&#8221; was created and promoted by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a large American retail store.  When a customer reports a missing child to a store employee, a 
&#8220;Code Adam&#8221; is announced over the public-address system.  A brief description of the child is 
obtained and provided to all designated employees, who stop their normal work to search.  If the 
child is not found in 10 minutes, the store personnel contacts local law-enforcement officials for 
assistance.  LOCATER (Lost Child Alert Technology Resource) is another programme, 
web-based, that helps law-enforcement agencies to rapidly distribute images and information by 
creating their own posters.  In addition, several educational resources have been developed, such 
as &#8220;NetSmartz&#8221; for children aged 5 to 17, and training courses are also made available.  Finally, 
it is worth mentioning Team HOPE, whose trained volunteers offer emotional support, 
compassion, and guidance to family members. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Government responses 
</b></p>
<p>73. The first set of questions on this issue (for a list of replies received, see paragraph 24) 
enquired as to the different legislative and administrative measures elaborated in the States to 
prevent children abductions or disappearances.  Furthermore, it asked about legislative or 
administrative measures so as to alert the general population in case of a child abduction or 
disappearance, who were the authorities responsible for their implementation and the targeted 
population.  The second part dealt with the factual context related to this issue.  The 
questionnaire requested information about whether the rate of finding abducted and disappeared 
children had increased since the implementation of the alert measures, and if there had been any 
cases in which, following the implementation of the alert measures, children had been found 
alive and their abductor arrested. 
</p>
<p>74. Among the responses received, a great number of States have elaborated a normative 
framework.  Germany, the Philippines, Canada, Honduras, Japan, Lithuania, Turkey, Monaco, 
Slovenia, Malta, Estonia, Nicaragua, Chile, and Mexico have incorporated offences in their 
respective Criminal Codes.  The Penal Code (Act No. 5237 of 26 September 2004) in <b>Turkey 
</b>stipulates that whoever deprives a person of his/her liberty by illegally taking him/her to a place 
shall be sentenced to 1 or 5 years of imprisonment.  And in the case of the abduction of children, 
the penalty shall be doubled.  The Criminal Code of <b>Canada </b>has also provisions criminalizing 
abductions.  Section 280 of the Code makes it an offence for anyone to take or cause to be taken 
any unmarried person under the age of 16.  Section 281 establishes an offence for anyone who is 
not a parent, guardian or person having the lawful care and control of a person under 14 years of 
age to abduct a child.  Finally, sections 282 to 283 respond to parental child abductions in or 
regardless cases of custody orders. 
</p>
<p>75. Other States have implemented a more general law for the protection of the child or 
adopted specific legislation.  In <b>Lithuania</b>,<b> </b>Order No. 4 provides specific rules for the search for 
disappeared children.  While implementing the Hague Convention, <b>Malta </b>adopted the Child 
Abduction Custody Act and <b>Mauritius</b>,<b> </b>the Act No. 19 of 2000.  On the contrary, the provisions 
pertaining to this issue in <b>Venezuela </b>are included in its Organic Law for the Protection of 
Children and Adolescents. 
</p>
<p>76. Regarding measures to alert the population in cases of abducted or disappeared children, 
some States have also developed interesting programmes.  In the <b>Philippines</b>,<b> </b>for example, when 
a case of abduction comes to the attention of the police authorities, the case is handed on to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Police Anti-Crime Emergency Response (PACER).  If it is assessed as a kidnap-for-ransom case, 
then PACER handles it; otherwise, the local police deal with it.  Furthermore, the Philippines 
Centre for Transnational Crime (PCTC), a special police institution that pursues ransom cases 
beyond the national borders, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the National Bureau of 
Investigation all contribute in responding quickly to cases of abductions.  According to the 
Government&#8217;s response, the creation of PACER has helped to better integrate and coordinate 
proactive efforts of all police units and thus, contributed to a higher success rate in getting the 
victims back safely. 
</p>
<p>77. <b>Mexico </b>has developed a special programme for disappeared and missing minors.  Posters 
identifying the minors missing, abducted or kidnapped are rapidly disseminated and legal and 
psychological counselling are provided to the families enduring the trauma.  Several standards 
have been elaborated, including the Modelo de Orientaci&#242;n Global and Modelo de Conciliaci&#243;n 
Interfamiliar, to help in the reunification process.  Furthermore, since June 2004, a website 
pertaining to missing children was created and a booklet aiming to prevent this problem, entitled 
&#8220;Protect children from disappearance and abduction&#8221;, is currently on its way. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS

<p>78. The Special Rapporteur would like to warmly thank all those who responded to the 
questionnaire.  Although only relevant selections of the experiences and initiatives on which 
information was received are outlined in this report, the Special Rapporteur has found some very 
positive examples of preventive measures, institutions and programmes addressing both issues 
that deserve to be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>79. The issue of sale of organs and tissues, particularly of children&#8217;s organs, remains for 
the moment mostly unsubstantiated.  Although formal reports of organ and tissue trafficking 
are few, the disparity of costs, technologies and legislation related to this issue make it 
indispensable for the authorities to remain vigilant in order to avoid human organs and tissues 
becoming a trade commodity in which profit for some and desperation of other may lead to 
irremediable situations.  Although there are reports of trafficking in organs and tissues 
involving violence against persons and children, diverse unconfirmed rumours persist.  There 
is therefore a need to report and investigate when these allegations appear.  The Special 
Rapporteur urges Governments to investigate thoroughly and ensure criminal sanctions against 
the traffickers and all those involved as child abusers. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur would also like, as a preventive measure, to remind 
Governments of the different safeguards put in place by different international and regional 
mechanisms, such as the Guiding Principles developed by the World Health Organization, the 
Conventions adopted by the Council of Europe and some examples of national legislation cited 
above.  The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to invite all countries to establish 
legislation and standards so as to clearly regulate transplantation of organs and tissues.  They 
should develop institutions to document and monitor all transplants taking place and to avoid 
the development of &#8220;transplant tourism&#8221;, in which medical establishments open, taking 
advantage of disparities between the situation of the donor and the receiver, with significant 
risks for both persons involved in the transplant. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur also considers the phenomenon of child abduction to be of 
particular concern, as these disappearances and abductions often constitute the first step in 
abuses against children that can lead to sexual exploitation of the victims.  The number of States 
having set up organized and effective systems to respond to children abductions is very limited, 
which results that when such a situation occurs, the first hours and days which are key for 
finding a missing child are being lost.  Therefore, a coordinated, comprehensive, and global 
approach is required, where the different State institutions as well as NGOs and private business 
have a role to play.  Among this, outreach on prevention and on fast and effective responses is 
essential.  Rapid response programmes and initiatives taken by international and regional 
organizations such as the ones given as examples above are to be encouraged.  States that have 
already elaborated legislative and administrative measures and programmes to tackle this issue 
are commended for their efforts and their successes in finding abducted children.  These rapid 
response programmes are not only tools to respond to abducted and missing children, but also 
allow considerable improvement between the different organizations for prevention of violence 
against children. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>While noting that most States which responded to the questionnaire have adopted 
legislative measures to combat trafficking and sale of children organs, the Special 
Rapporteur</b> <b>recommends that States adopting or amending their legislation in this regard 
bear in mind</b> <b>the considerations set out below.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>In line with the standards set by the Guiding Principles on human organ 
transplantation of the World Health Organization as well as with the Global Programme 
against Trafficking in Human Beings launched by the United Nations Office on Drug and 
Crime and the European Conventions on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and 
Human Rights and Biomedicine, the Special Rapporteur invites States to incorporate into 
their national legislation prohibitions against any sale and trafficking of children&#8217;s organs 
and tissues and effective safeguards to ensure implementation and to further develop 
bilateral and regional strategies to be able to document any cases should these happen and 
bring perpetrators to justice. 
</b>84. <b>States should, in particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Consider adopting legislation and standards regulating organ and tissue 
transplantation in line with the Guiding Principles developed by the World Health 
Organization and the World Medical Association; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Enforce bilateral and regional cooperation through the elaboration of 
common standards, taking as an example the conventions and recommendations adopted 
by the Council of Europe, and adapt domestic laws and standards in line with these 
common principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish an effective information network that investigates, documents and 
monitors allegations of traffic of organs and tissues, and ensure bilateral, regional and 
international cooperation between the law-enforcement agencies in charge of the fight 
against this traffic;</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<b>d) Establish a centralized transplant agency in charge of coordinating 
receivers&#8217; needs and donors&#8217; situation, establishing transparent and equitable waiting lists 
for each category of organs, regions and all age groups</b>; 
</p>
<p> (<b>e) Clearly prohibit the sale of one&#8217;s organs and tissues so as to eradicate 
demand for this traffic as well as to penalize heavily those who do so; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that all children under the age of 18 are protected from becoming 
donors of organ and tissue transplantation, except in cases where an immediate family 
member is at a life-threatening risk, that no suitable donor has been found, that the donor&#8217;s 
consent has been given, that this transplant will not cause a threat, immediate or future, to 
the donor and that this transplant will bring substantial health improvement to the 
receiver;</b> 
</p>
<p> (<b>g) Ensure that criminal proceedings against sellers, intermediaries and 
traffickers are initiated promptly and can be initiated ex officio.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Regarding the question of abduction of children and the need to address this issue 
in a coordinated, comprehensive and global approach, in line with the examples of 
rapid-response programmes discussed earlier, the Special Rapporteur recommends all 
States to set up rapid-response programmes and specifically: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To incorporate in their national legislation provisions criminalizing 
abduction, and providing stricter penalties or aggravated circumstances in cases where 
victims are children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To establish, taking into account each State&#8217;s capacity, resources and 
constraints, a central institution consisting of operational centres, based on a public-private 
partnership model and established with the support of the national Government which 
should include the following minimum:  a call centre and Internet website that are easily 
accessible, a photo distribution system and linkages with law enforcement by offering 
training, model policies and procedures and technical support as well as a voluntary 
partnership between law-enforcement agencies and broadcasters to activate an urgent 
bulletin in the most serious child-abduction cases so as to instantly galvanize the entire 
local community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To cooperate bilaterally and regionally in establishing common standards 
and allowing unrestricted exchange of information between the different law-enforcement 
agencies of countries involved when addressing the search of a missing or abducted child; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To clearly define the policies and scope of intervention so that when a case of 
an abducted or missing child is reported, the system is immediately activated and not left at 
the discretion of individual actors or other situations that may delay an immediate 
response; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To involve NGOs and private actors in the rapid-response programmes, 
especially media and communication businesses and organizations that will be able to relay 
the alert message quickly and effectively; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) To establish assistance and rehabilitation facilities specifically designed for 
victims of violent abductions and their families in order to help them reintegrate into their 
community.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur stresses finally that educational programmes as well as 
awareness-raising activities are essential in the fight against traffic of organs as well as in 
addressing the issue of abduction of children.  He calls upon States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To develop awareness-raising campaigns among health and law-enforcement 
officials on the issue of traffic of organs, gratuity and consent of the donor; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To raise awareness among law-enforcement officials on the need to work 
together and cooperate fully and totally when investigating cases of children who are 
abducted;</b> 
</p>
<p> (<b>c) To ensure that the school curriculum includes child rights education that 
addresses the issue of abduction of children by strangers, but also by estranged parent or 
family members and provide resources available to help should children be confronted 
with such situations.  Education on programmes and resources available is an essential tool 
to prevent children from becoming victims of such abductions and should be made 
available at all school levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To develop assistance programmes for the reintegration of victims, 
emphasizing on physical, psychological aspects as well as legal assistance.
