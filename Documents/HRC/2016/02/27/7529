  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Morocco</b>*<b> </b>**<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary</i> 
 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention undertook a visit to Morocco from 9 
to 18 December 2013. 
</p>
<p> In the course of its visit, the Working Group noted the ongoing efforts by the 
Government to establish and consolidate a culture of human rights in Morocco. The 
Working Group appreciates the fact that the extensive process of structural reform has 
continued after its visit. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group welcomes the adoption of the Constitution in July 2011, 
marking an important step towards the strengthening of human rights, and the 
establishment of the National Human Rights Council (CNDH) as the independent 
national institution responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * The Working Group also visited La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, on 15 and 16 December 2013. As the 
visit of a group of independent mandate holders, it should not be interpreted as expressing any 
political view concerning the present or future status of the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Western 
Sahara. The territory is subject to the right to self-determination in conformity with the principles 
contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).

</p>
<p> In cases related to State security, such as those involving terrorism, membership 
in Islamist movements or supporters of independence for Western Sahara, the Working 
Group found that there is a pattern of torture and ill-treatment by police officers, in 
particular by agents of the National Surveillance Directorate (DST). Many individuals 
have been coerced into making a confession and sentenced to prison on the sole basis of 
that confession. 
</p>
<p> Whereas article 23 of the Constitution explicitly states that secret or arbitrary 
detention and enforced disappearance are crimes of the utmost gravity, and while noting 
measures undertaken to combat such practices, the Working Group received allegations, 
from sources deemed to be credible, of past and present instances of incommunicado 
detention which would warrant further investigation. The Working Group also received 
allegations that Morocco had served as a departure point, a transit country and a 
destination for illegal extraordinary renditions carried out in the context of the 
international fight against terrorism. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also received allegations of increased mass arrests of and 
violence against migrants and asylum seekers by the security forces, particularly in the 
north of the country. 
</p>
<p> Despite legal provision for access to a lawyer during the first 24 hours after arrest 
in ordinary criminal cases, that period seems not to be fully observed in practice. In 
addition, authorization has to be obtained from the Crown Prosecutor-General. 
Moreover, the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03) provides for police custody for up to 
three consecutive periods of 96 hours, with no right to a lawyer, except for a half-hour, 
monitored visit at the mid-point of those 12 days. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that the Moroccan criminal justice system relies 
heavily on confessions as the main evidence to support conviction. Article 293 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure prohibits the admission of any confession or statement 
made under duress, in accordance with international law. However, complaints indicate 
the use of torture by State officials to obtain evidence or confessions at the stage of 
initial questioning, in particular in counter-terrorism or internal security cases. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also notes the excessive use of detention on remand. In 
general, detention as a means of punishment still seems to be the rule rather than the 
exception. There is a lack of alternatives to detention. Prison overcrowding as a 
consequence of this situation is a serious problem, which needs to be addressed. 
</p>
<p> Although article 460 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judicial 
police officer in charge of juveniles may detain a juvenile in a dedicated place, the 
Working Group found a significant number of children as young as 14 years old in 
ordinary prisons. Reports indicate that the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office rarely requests 
alternative forms of detention, as provided for in articles 501 to 504 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. In addition, juveniles often remain in custody for a long period 
before being admitted to a child protection centre. 
</p>
<p> Regarding La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Working Group received numerous 
complaints of arbitrary detention, complaints that torture and ill-treatment were used to 
extract confessions and complaints indicating a pattern of excessive use of force in 
repressing demonstrations and arresting demonstrators calling for self-determination for 
the Sahrawi population.  
</p>
<p> At the end of the report, the Working Group makes a number of key 
recommendations to the Government.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted an official visit to Morocco 
from 9 to 18 December 2013, at the invitation of the Government. The Working Group also 
visited La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, on 15 and 16 December 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. The delegation was composed of the Working Group&#8217;s Chair-Rapporteur, Mads 
Andenas (from Norway), its former Chair-Rapporteur, El Hadji Malick Sow (from Senegal) 
and Roberto Garret&#243;n (from Chile). They were accompanied by members of the secretariat 
of the Working Group from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, as well as interpreters of the United Nations Office in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Morocco for extending 
an invitation to the Working Group to visit the country and for its full cooperation 
throughout the various stages of the mission. The Moroccan authorities provided the 
delegation with all the necessary information and arranged all the meetings it requested. 
The Working Group would also like to thank the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara 
(MINURSO) for their comprehensive support during the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group benefited from various meetings with State authorities and it 
appreciates the valuable information they provided. The Working Group met with the 
Ministers of Justice, the Interior and Health, the Minister in Charge of Moroccans Living 
Abroad and Migration Affairs, and the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. It also met 
with the First President and the Chairs of the Chambers of the Supreme Court, and the First 
President and the Chairs of the Chambers of the Court of Appeal. It also met with 
representatives of the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration and 
of the Office of the Crown Prosecutor-General before the Court of Cassation; 
representatives of the General Directorate of National Security; the Delegate and personnel 
of the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights; the President and members of the 
National Human Rights Council (CNDH) and representatives of the regional offices of 
CNDH; and the President of the Moroccan Bar Association. It further met with 
representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations and with 
victims of arbitrary detention and their relatives.  
</p>
<p>5. In La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Working Group met with the region&#8217;s Wali 
(Governor) and with representatives of the General Directorate of National Security, the 
Royal Gendarmerie, the General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration 
and the regional commission of CNDH. In addition, it met with representatives of the 
Sahrawi population, representatives of civil society organizations and victims of arbitrary 
detention and their relatives. The Working Group also met with a senior official of 
MINURSO. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group extends its thanks to the Interministerial Delegation for Human 
Rights for facilitating its visit and expresses its appreciation to the Government for 
providing it with unimpeded access to all detention facilities, in accordance with the terms 
of reference for fact-finding missions by special rapporteurs (E/CN.4/1998/45, 
appendix V). 
</p><p>7. The Working Group visited places where persons are deprived of their liberty in 
Casablanca, Rabat, Sal&#233; and Tangiers, and in La&#226;youne, Western Sahara. The facilities 
visited by the Working Group were the Sal&#233; 1 and Sal&#233; 2 prisons, the local prisons in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Tangiers and Tetoyan, the Ain Seba&#226; (&#8220;Oukacha&#8221;) local prison and the Centre for the 
Rehabilitation of Minors in Casablanca. The Working Group also visited the Al Maarif 
National Brigade of the Judicial Police in Casablanca, the transit zone of Mohamed V 
International Airport, the Temara Centre for the Protection of Children and the Ar-Ramzi 
University Hospital Psychiatric Centre. In addition, it made unannounced visits to police 
stations. It also visited the local prison in La&#226;youne. The Working Group would like to 
point out that it was allowed to visit all the places of detention it had requested, and to 
interview in private detainees of its choice, without any restriction.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group shared its preliminary findings with the Government on 18 
December 2013, at the conclusion of its visit. The Working Group also shared an advance 
version of the report with the Government, which provided comments on 6 and 15 July 
2014 that were taken into consideration before the report was finalized.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political, administrative and judicial structure 
</b>9. Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with a bi-cameral parliament. The upper 
house is the Chamber of Counsellors, with 270 seats. Its members are elected indirectly by 
local councils, professional organizations and labour unions to serve nine-year terms. The 
lower house is the Chamber of Representatives. It has 395 seats, and members are elected 
by popular vote to serve five-year terms. The King appoints the Head of Government from 
the party that wins the most seats in parliamentary elections; appoints all members of the 
Government on the basis of the Head of Government&#8217;s recommendations; and may, at his 
discretion, terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the Parliament, call for new 
elections, or rule by decree. 
</p>
<p>10. The highest judicial body is the Supreme Court. Its judges are appointed by the King 
and are supervised by the Superior Council of the Magistrature. Morocco was ranked 80th 
out of 142 countries for judicial independence by Transparency International for 
2011-2012.1  
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>11. According to the preamble to its 2011 Constitution, the Kingdom of Morocco 
commits itself to complying with the international conventions duly ratified by it, within 
the framework of the provisions of the Constitution and the laws of the Kingdom, while 
ensuring respect for its immutable national identity, and, on the publication of those 
conventions, [their] primacy over the internal law of the country, and to harmonize in 
consequence the pertinent provisions of national legislation. 
</p>
<p>12. Morocco has ratified most of the major international human rights instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
Morocco has approved a law providing for accession to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, but has not yet deposited its instrument of ratification.

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. National legislation 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Constitution adopted in July 2011 guarantees the right to security of all persons 
and of their kin (art. 21). Furthermore, the Constitution provides for freedom of opinion, 
expression, speech and the press.  
</p>
<p>14. According to article 23 of the Constitution, no one may be arrested, detained, 
prosecuted or condemned outside of the cases and the forms provided by the law. Arbitrary 
or secret detention and enforced disappearance are crimes of the utmost gravity. They 
expose their authors to the most severe sanctions. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 22 of the Constitution stipulates that everyone shall have the right to physical 
and moral integrity, which shall not be undermined under any circumstances by any person, 
private or public; that no one shall inflict upon another, under any pretext whatsoever, any 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which undermines their dignity; and that the practice 
of any form of torture, by anyone, is a crime punishable by law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive aspects 
</b></p>
<p>16. In the course of its visit, the Working Group noted the important and ongoing efforts 
of the Government to establish and consolidate a culture of human rights in Morocco. The 
Working Group encourages that process and expresses the hope that it will lead to the 
prevention and combating, in law and in practice, of any kind of violation that would 
constitute arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The Working Group appreciates that the 
extensive structural reform undertaken by Morocco to consolidate the promotion and 
protection of human rights has continued since its visit in December 2013. 
</p>
<p>17. The Constitution enshrines the primacy of international human rights law over 
national law, which has resulted in encouraging changes from the normative point of view. 
Such changes have included amendments to the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal 
Procedure and the laws governing the main judicial institutions and the deprivation of 
liberty of women, minors, persons with mental disabilities, irregular migrants and asylum 
seekers. 
</p>
<p>18. It was in that context that Morocco ratified the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; that the Ministry of Justice 
initiated a national dialogue leading to the development of a national charter for the reform 
of the justice system; that the Code of Criminal Procedure was amended by Act No. 35.11 
of 17 October 2011: and that the process for the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture was launched. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group found that CNDH and its various regional offices are making a 
significant contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights in the country. In 
accordance with article 161 of the Constitution, CNDH was established as the independent 
national institution responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights, and the 
preservation of individual and collective freedoms. It replaces the former Advisory Council 
on Human Rights (CCDH), which was established in 1990 and was one of the key 
institutions in the democratic transition in Morocco. The Working Group encourages the 
Government of Morocco and civil society to maintain their commitment to strengthening 
CNDH and to provide it with all the necessary means to ensure its proper functioning.  
</p>
<p>20. Notwithstanding those positive achievements, the Working Group notes a number of 
issues that are of particular concern and to which it would like to draw the Government&#8217;s 
attention.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Cases involving allegations of terrorism or threats against  
national security 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03), adopted in the wake of the Casablanca 
bombings of 16 May 2003, has, as a legal framework, been responsible for numerous 
violations of human rights and it remains in force in its original form.  
</p>
<p>22. The Anti-Terrorism Act extends the time limits on custody to up to 96 hours, 
renewable twice. This means that detainees maybe held for up to 12 days upon written 
consent from the prosecution before being brought before the investigating judge. In 
addition, communication with a lawyer is only possible 48 hours after the renewal of 
custody is granted. Hence suspects may be deprived of all contact with the outside world 
for six days before being allowed to communicate for half an hour with a lawyer and, even 
then, under the control of a police officer (Code of Criminal Procedure, art. 66, para. 6). 
The Working Group notes that those provisions, which restrict crucial safeguards, such as 
early contact with counsel, significantly increase the risk of torture and ill-treatment. The 
Working Group also notes with concern that the definition of the crime of terrorism is 
rather vague. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group heard several testimonies of torture and ill-treatment in cases 
involving allegations of terrorism or threats against national security. In those cases, the 
Working Group concurs with the Special Rapporteur on torture that a systematic pattern of 
acts of torture and ill-treatment during the arrest and detention process can be detected.2 
</p>
<p>24. In such cases, it appears that suspects are often not officially registered, that they are 
held for weeks without being brought before a judge and without judicial oversight, and 
that their families are not notified until such time as the suspects are transferred to police 
custody in order to sign confessions. In many cases, victims are then transferred to a police 
station, where a preliminary investigation is opened, dated from the transfer to avoid 
exceeding the limits placed on the custody period. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group came across numerous cases that had occurred in the aftermath 
of the attacks in Casablanca in May 2003, when thousands of suspects were arrested, often 
by officials of the National Surveillance General Directorate (DST), and held 
incommunicado or at unknown places of detention. According to the Government, all 
places of deprivation of liberty are known, regulated and controlled by the public 
prosecutor or the competent administration they come under. The Working Group also 
heard testimonies of recently arrested terrorism suspects who had allegedly been tortured in 
order to extract confessions from them.  
</p>
<p>26. In May 2011, delegations from Parliament and CNDH reported finding no evidence 
of a detention facility located at the DST headquarters in T&#233;mara. However, testimonies 
indicate that persons are detained incommunicado at that and other locations. Article 23 of 
the Constitution explicitly states that secret or arbitrary detention and enforced 
disappearance are crimes of the utmost gravity. During its meetings with the authorities and 
CNDH, the Working Group was informed that such crimes had now been eliminated. 
However, in the course of its visit, the Working Group received allegations, by sources 
deemed to be credible, of past and present cases of incommunicado detention3 which would 
warrant further investigation.

<p>2
  Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment (A/HRC/22/53/Add.2), para. 14.  
 
</p>
<p>3
 The Working Group wishes to refer to the joint study on global practices in relation to secret 
</p>
<p>detention in the context of countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/42) undertaken by a number of special 
procedures mandate holders. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group also received allegations that Morocco has served as a 
departure point, a transit country and a destination for illegal extraordinary renditions 
carried out in the context of the international fight against terrorism. This has been the 
subject of discussions with the Government. Such extraordinary renditions have allegedly 
been accompanied by incommunicado detention and/or detention in secret places, as well as 
acts of torture and ill-treatment, particularly during the questioning of suspects.  
</p>
<p>28. Most of the detainees convicted for terrorism-related offences are serving their 
sentences in the Sal&#233; 1 and Sal&#233; 2 prisons and the Tulal Prison in Mekn&#232;s. The Working 
Group visited both prisons in Sal&#233;. In this context, it heard allegations that solitary 
confinement is used as a disciplinary measure, for periods ranging from several days to 
several weeks. Following its visit, the Working Group received information that one of the 
individuals interviewed during its visit had reportedly been subjected to solitary 
confinement for several days, allegedly as a form of reprisal.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Confessions obtained under torture 
</b></p>
<p>29. Article 293 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that a confession, like any 
other evidence, is subject to the discretion of the judge and that any confession obtained 
under torture is inadmissible.  
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group notes the considerable importance accorded to confessions in 
the context of a trial. Through interviews with detainees serving long sentences, the 
Working Group found that confessions had often been obtained as a result of torture. Such 
confessions were set out in the police records and served almost exclusively as evidence for 
prosecution and conviction.  
</p>
<p>31. According to the authorities, confessions alone are not sufficient for a conviction 
and the provision of other corroborating material evidence is necessary. However, the 
Working Group learned that the minutes of the preliminary interview, as established by the 
police on the basis of confessions obtained under torture, are in practice rarely rejected by 
the trial court. Testimonies received indicate that many cases that are submitted to the 
courts are based solely on confessions by the accused, in the absence of material evidence.  
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group also learned that courts and prosecutors do not comply with 
their obligation to initiate an ex officio investigation whenever there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that a confession has been obtained through the use of torture and ill-treatment, 
or to order an immediate, independent medical examination (see arts. 74 (8) and 135 (5) of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure) if they suspect that a detainee has been subjected to ill-
treatment. This is the case even if the person recants before the judge and claims to have 
been tortured.  
</p>
<p>33. It appears that judges favour an interpretation of article 291 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure whereby records established by the judicial police are prima facie evidence. Such 
an interpretation is tantamount to reversing the burden of proof by requiring the accused to 
prove his innocence, which is contrary to the principle of the presumption of innocence, as 
stated in article 23 of the Constitution. It also creates conditions that encourage the torture 
and ill-treatment of suspects. 
</p>
<p>34. In its jurisprudence concerning Morocco, the Working Group has consistently 
expressed its concern with regard to convictions on the basis of confessions made in the 
course of a preliminary hearing. The cases of Mohamed Dihani (Opinion No. 19/2013), 
Abdessamad Bettar (Opinion No. 3/2013) and Mohamed Hajib (Opinion No. 40 /2012) 
show a pattern whereby those individuals were convicted solely on the basis of reports 
drawn up by the police while they were in custody, during which time they were subjected 
to torture. It was also on the basis of confessions obtained under torture that Ali Aarrass 
(Opinion No. 25/2013) was sentenced in November 2011 to a 15-year prison sentence, after 
having been extradited from Spain. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>35. In that regard, the Working Group wishes to emphasize that confessions made in the 
absence of a lawyer are not admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings. This applies in 
particular to confessions made during the time spent in police custody.  
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group recalls the concluding observations of the Committee against 
Torture following its consideration of Morocco in 2011, in which the Committee expressed 
its concern that &#8220;under the State party&#8217;s current system of investigation, confessions are 
commonly used as evidence for purposes of prosecution and conviction&#8221;. The Committee 
noted &#8220;with concern that convictions in numerous criminal cases, including terrorism cases, 
are based on confessions, thus creating conditions that may provide more scope for the 
torture and ill-treatment of suspects (arts. 2 and 15)&#8221;.4 
</p><p>37. The guarantees of a fair and equitable trial laid down in article 11 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights exclude self-incrimination and grant the right to legal assistance and 
representation and to other measures of protection in order to ensure that no evidence is 
obtained by confession. Under article 14, paragraph 3 (g), of the Covenant, no person may 
be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p>38. In its jurisprudence, the Human Rights Committee has stated that that provision 
&#8220;must be understood in terms of the absence of any direct or indirect physical or 
psychological coercion from the investigating authorities on the accused with a view to 
obtaining a confession of guilt&#8221;.5 In its views on communication No. 1769/2008, <i>Bondar v. 
Uzbekistan</i>,6 the Committee found violations of article 14, paragraph 3 (b) and (d), on the 
grounds that the victim was not provided with a lawyer during the interrogation and his 
right to have the assistance of a lawyer of his own choosing was denied.7 The Committee 
also found a violation of article 14, paragraph 3 (g), owing to a confession being obtained 
under torture.8 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group also recalls general comment No. 32 (2007) of the Human 
Rights Committee, in which the Committee stated that: 
</p>
<p>article 14, paragraph 3 (g), guarantees the right not to be compelled to testify against 
oneself or to confess guilt. This safeguard must be understood in terms of the 
absence of any direct or indirect physical or undue psychological pressure from the 
investigating authorities on the accused, with a view to obtaining a confession of 
guilt. A fortiori, it is unacceptable to treat an accused person in a manner contrary to 
article 7 of the Covenant in order to extract a confession. Domestic law must ensure 
that statements or confessions obtained in violation of article 7 of the Covenant are 
excluded from the evidence, except if such material is used as evidence that torture 
or other treatment prohibited by this provision occurred, and that in such cases the

<p>burden is on the State to prove that statements made by the accused have been given 
of their own free will. (citations omitted) (para. 41).9 
</p>
<p>40. According to the Special Rapporteur on torture: 
</p>
<p>Interrogation should take place only at official centres and the maintenance of secret 
places of detention should be abolished under law. It should be a punishable offence 
for any official to hold a person in a secret and/or unofficial place of detention. Any 
evidence obtained from a detainee in an unofficial place of detention and not 
confirmed by the detainee during interrogation at official locations should not be 
admitted as evidence in court. No statement of confession made by a person 
deprived of liberty, other than one made in presence of a judge or a lawyer, should 
have a probative value in court, except as evidence against those who are accused of 
having obtained the confession by unlawful means.10 
</p>
<p>41. One of the aims of the provisions of article 11 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is 
to provide guarantees against all forms of direct or indirect, physical or psychological 
pressure by the authorities on the accused with a view to obtaining a confession. The right 
not to be compelled to testify against oneself or to confess guilt, and access to counsel and 
legal aid are not only measures intended for the protection of the interests of the individual, 
but are also measures, in the interest of society as a whole, of the trustworthiness and 
effectiveness of the judicial process, and of the reliability of evidence. Confessions made in 
the absence of legal counsel are not admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings. This 
applies especially to confessions made during the time spent in police custody. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Basic legal safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>42. Moroccan law provides a number of basic safeguards for persons taken into custody 
that are designed to prevent arbitrary detention. Article 23 of the 2011 Constitution 
provides that any detained person has the right to be informed immediately, in a fashion 
which is comprehensible to him, of the reasons for his detention, and of his rights, 
including the right to remain silent. The presumption of innocence and the right to an 
equitable process are also guaranteed in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b>  Access to a lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>43. The issue of confessions obtained under torture or ill-treatment directly affects the 
issue of access to a lawyer during the initial phase of police interrogations, especially 
during police custody and in cases relating to national security or the fight against 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 23 of the Constitution provides that a person in custody must benefit, as soon 
as possible, from legal assistance and the possibility of communicating with relatives, in 
conformity with the law. However, immediate and direct access to a lawyer from the outset 
of detention is neither guaranteed under existing statutory law or in practice. The Code of 
Criminal Procedure (Section 66 of Act No. 35.11 of 17 October 2011) allows access to a 
lawyer during the first 24 hours after arrest, upon the authorization of the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, for only 30 minutes and in the presence of an investigator. At the request of the

</b></p>
<p>investigator, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office can delay contact with a lawyer for another 12 hours 
after the first 24 hours in custody.  
</p>
<p>45. During its meetings with police officers, the Working Group found that some of 
them were reluctant to inform detainees of their right to have access to a lawyer in criminal 
cases. Moreover, the right to have access to a lawyer within the legal time frame may even 
be violated simply by tampering with the record of arrest dates. Furthermore, testimonies 
from lawyers indicate that, in practice, they are often denied access to their clients within 
the legal time frame. Hence, in the majority of cases, lawyers meet their clients only at the 
first hearing before the judge.  
</p><p>46. As mentioned above, under the procedure provided for in the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
police custody can last for three consecutive periods of 96 hours and during that time there 
is no meaningful right to a lawyer except for the monitored half-hour interview that can 
occur at the halfway point of those 12 days. The Working Group takes note of the existence 
of draft legislative amendments aimed at ensuring that a person taken into custody will 
have access to a lawyer more quickly. It calls upon the Government to ensure that access to 
a lawyer is provided from the very outset of arrest or detention, without having to obtain the 
authorization of the Prosecutor currently required by law. That right should be granted as a 
principle of law. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Excessive use of detention on remand 
</b></p>
<p>47. During its visits to detention facilities, the Working Group observed the excessive 
use of detention on remand. Moreover, in general, the use of detention as a means of 
punishment still seems to be the rule rather than the exception. The authorities openly 
acknowledged that prison overcrowding as a consequence of that situation was a problem 
which needed to be addressed. The Government informed the Working Group that, as of 
December 2013, there was a prison population of approximately 67,000 detainees 
(comprising both convicted and pre-trial detainees, who are not always kept separate). The 
Working Group was presented with conflicting figures as to the total capacity of the prison 
system, but the rate of overcrowding would in any case be greater than 30 per cent.  
</p>
<p>48. In Sal&#233; 1, with a total capacity of 3,500 places, there were 4,462 prisoners (3,115 in 
pre-trial detention; 1,347 convicts). In Sal&#233; 2, with a total capacity of 246 places, there were 
194 prisoners (82 in pre-trial detention; 112 convicts). In the Oukacha prison in Casablanca, 
with a total capacity of 6,400 places, there were 8,123 prisoners (1,054 in pretrial detention; 
7,069 convicts). 
</p><p>49. Overcrowding inevitably leads to serious violations, such as denial of or insufficient 
access to medical care, nutrition, sanitation, security and rehabilitation services. The 
Working Group noted that the General Delegation for Prison Administration and 
Reintegration had recently launched a major project to close some of the oldest prisons, 
build new prisons, and expand and renovate others in order to improve prison conditions.  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group urges the Government to encourage the use of alternatives to 
detention, such as judicial or penal mediation. The Working Group recommends that a 
system be devised for arranging bail and making more frequent use of non-custodial 
penalties in the case of less serious offences.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Irregularities in the records 
</b></p>
<p>51. During its visits to police stations and police headquarters, the Working Group noted 
serious irregularities in the records, particularly in the administrative records of custody. 
The Working Group observed corrections that had been poorly made, either by hand or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>using correction fluid, as well as errors such as logging a release date as of a date prior to 
the date of entry, or simple non-recording of the release date. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Juveniles in conflict with the law 
</b></p>
<p>52. Moroccan criminal legislation regarding juveniles provides for a juvenile system 
which operates with specially trained prosecutors and judges. In practice, according to 
information received by the Working Group, any public prosecutor or deputy prosecutor 
may be responsible for the case of a juvenile. 
</p><p>53. Article 460 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judicial police 
officer in charge of juveniles may detain the juvenile in a dedicated place. However, the 
Working Group found a significant number of children,, some as young as 14 years old, in 
ordinary prisons. The conditions of detention of those juveniles were difficult, in part owing 
to the overcrowding described above. The Working Group found that 14-year-old boys 
were often kept in the same cell as 24-year-old men.  
</p>
<p>54. The General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office rarely requests alternative measures of detention, as 
provided for in articles 501 to 504 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In addition, juveniles 
often remain in custody for a long period before being admitted to a child protection centre. 
</p>
<p>55. The Group recommends that the Government ensure that, in the case of juvenile 
offenders, imprisonment remains an exceptional measure and placement in centres for the 
protection of children is considered a priority. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Detention of asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>56. With regard to asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation, Morocco is a 
party to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, of 1951, and the Protocol 
thereto, of 1967. While recognizing the difficult situation for the authorities with regard to 
addressing the flow of irregular migrants, especially in the north, the Working Group 
wishes to express its concerns about that particularly vulnerable group. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group takes note of the legal provisions governing the expulsion of 
undocumented migrants, particularly Act No. 02-03 on the entry and residence of foreign 
nationals in Morocco. However, the Working Group received allegations of mass arrests 
and violence in the context of raids and the detention of migrants and asylum seekers, 
particularly in the north. An increasing number of foreigners have been arrested during 
identity checks since 2009. However, according to the Government, foreign individuals are 
not detained on account of their irregular situation.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group received information that undocumented migrants have been 
escorted to the borders or otherwise expelled, in violation of Moroccan law, without having 
been given the opportunity to exercise their rights. Several allegations have been made that 
hundreds of migrants have been abandoned in the Algerian desert without food or water. 
Morocco has failed to provide information about those allegations or about the places and 
regimes of detention used for foreign nationals awaiting deportation who do not come 
under the authority of the Prison Service. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Group was informed that the Government is striving to elaborate a strategy and 
action plan with a view to devising a comprehensive migration policy based on full respect 
for human rights. To that end, the Government has established commissions on: (a) the 
development of a new legal and institutional framework for asylum, trafficking and 
immigration; (b) refugees; and (c) review and possible regularization of the status of certain 
irregular migrants. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group welcomes the strategic plan of the Ministry of Health and the 
draft law (2012) amending the old Royal Decree No. 1-58-295 with respect to the 
protection of persons in mental health institutions. The Working Group was informed that 
there are 2,042 beds for psychiatric patients throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>61. Article 134 of the Criminal Code stipulates that whoever commits a misdemeanour 
or felony as a result of mental disability must be placed in a psychiatric institution. 
However, perpetrators of minor infractions are handed over to the administrative authority 
if proven to be exempt from criminal liability, which excludes them from medical 
monitoring and the necessary treatment. Reports indicate that, in cases where the placement 
of an individual in a psychiatric institution has been decided upon, the implementation of 
the decision often takes a long time, which leads to situations where persons with mental 
illnesses remain incarcerated for excessively long periods. 
</p>
<p><b> V. La&#226;youne, Western Sahara 
</b>62. The Working Group received numerous submissions and testimonies relating to the 
legal and political status of the territory, as well as complaints concerning a vast array of 
human rights violations other than arbitrary detention. It also received multiple requests for 
interviews, and written submissions on matters within its mandate. Consistent with the 
terms of reference of the mandate, the present report will not deal with allegations of 
human rights violations other than arbitrary detention, nor will it address issues relating to 
the status of Western Sahara as a Non-Self-Governing Territory. 
</p>
<p>63. Regarding cases within its mandate, the Working Group found that torture and ill-
treatment were used to extract confessions and that protestors were subjected to excessive 
use of force by law enforcement officials. The testimonies received indicate that members 
of the Sahrawi population are specifically, but not exclusively, the victims of such 
violations. 
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group received numerous complaints indicating a pattern of excessive 
use of force in repressing demonstrations and in arresting protestors or persons suspected of 
participating in demonstrations calling for self-determination of the Sahrawi population. 
During their transfer to or upon their arrival at a police station, people arrested are beaten, 
insulted and forced to reveal the names of other protestors. The Working Group received 
information about the alleged abandonment of the victims in rural areas after the assaults. 
Reports indicate that those practices are aimed at punishing and intimidating protestors in 
order to prevent further support for the call for independence. On occasion, protests become 
violent and the security forces are attacked by demonstrators. Even on those occasions, it is 
the duty of law enforcement bodies to ensure public order without resorting to excessive 
violence.  
</p>
<p>65. Other allegations indicate that Moroccan police forces regularly raid the private 
homes of alleged or known supporters of independence for Western Sahara, using 
procedures that include beating and ill-treatment of the inhabitants. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group visited the prison of La&#226;youne and the Gendarmerie station in 
the port of La&#226;youne. At the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, there were 368 prisoners in 
the prison, including 36 minors. Although the Working Group was allowed to interview in 
private detainees of its choice in both facilities, without any restriction, the Working Group 
noted with serious concern that some of the interviewees expressed fear of reprisals after 
having spoken to the delegation.  
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group regrets that its meetings with civil society in La&#226;youne were 
monitored.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>68. With regard to the events surrounding the closure of the Gdeim Izik camp in 
November 2010, the Working Group was informed that 25 Sahrawi civilians had been 
convicted by a military court for their alleged role in the violent clashes that occurred in 
Western Sahara. The Working Group met with 22 of those detainees in the Sal&#233; 1 prison.11 
It received testimonies of torture and ill-treatment and observed the deteriorating health 
conditions of some of the detainees due to the prison conditions. The trial has been 
repeatedly postponed, without reasons being provided by the court. On 17 February 2013, 
the military court issued its verdict, rejecting all requests to investigate the allegations of 
torture and refusing to order medical examinations in relation to the allegations of rape 
raised by several of the defendants. The military court did not issue a written judgement. 
The Working Group expresses concern that the allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
during the almost two years of pre-trial detention have not been investigated. The fact that 
the case is before a military, rather than a civilian, court contributes to the lack of 
transparency and the refusal to investigate the allegations of mistreatment.  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group has subsequently been informed that a number of the detainees 
in the Gdeim Izik group have started hunger strikes and that their health conditions are 
further deteriorating.  
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group wishes to express its concern about the broad competence of 
the military court, which can try civilians accused of terrorism, illegal possession of a 
firearm, and so forth. Such courts are composed of military judges and military prosecutors 
and defence lawyers, with the exception of the court president. Information before the 
Working Group indicates that it is not possible to appeal the court&#8217;s decisions. However, 
the Government has subsequently submitted that the military court is not the competent 
court with regard to terrorism cases and that decisions of the military court can be appealed 
to the Supreme Court. Clarification of the practice in this respect will therefore be a topic 
for the visit follow-up process.  
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group reiterates that the court should only be competent to try military 
personnel, for exclusively military offences. In this respect, the Working Group notes that a 
draft law on military tribunals was passed in March 2014 by the Council of Ministers 
presided over by King Mohamed VI. The draft law provides for the exclusion of civilians 
from the jurisdiction of military tribunals, regardless of the offence committed. It also 
allows the withdrawal of military personnel from military jurisdiction when they commit 
common law offences. The draft law (No. 108-13) is currently before Parliament for 
adoption.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b>72. <b>The Working Group welcomes the adoption, in July 2011, of the new 
Constitution, marking an important step towards the strengthening of human rights. 
</b>73. <b>The Working Group believes that the establishment of National Human Rights 
Council (CNDH) as the independent national institution responsible for the protection 
and promotion of human rights is a very positive development. It has the potential to 
become an effective monitoring mechanism and mediator between State and citizens if 
its recommendations are implemented in good faith. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group notes that article 22 of the Constitution stipulates that the 
practice of any form of torture, by anyone, is a crime punishable by law. However, in 
cases related to State security, such as cases involving terrorism, membership in

</b></p>
<p><b>Islamist movements or supporters of independence for Western Sahara, the Working 
Group found that there is a pattern of torture and ill-treatment during arrest and in 
detention by police officers, in particular agents of the National Surveillance 
Directorate (DST). Many individuals have been coerced into making a confession and 
have been sentenced to imprisonment on the sole basis of that confession.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Whereas article 23 of the Constitution explicitly states that secret or arbitrary 
detention and enforced disappearance are crimes of the utmost gravity, and while 
noting measures undertaken to combat such practices, the Working Group received 
allegations of past and present instances of incommunicado detention and allegations 
that Morocco had served as a departure point, a transit country and a destination for 
illegal extraordinary renditions carried out in the context of the international fight 
against terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group also received allegations of an increase in mass arrests and 
violence by security forces against asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular 
situation, particularly in the north of the country.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Despite the legal provision for access to a lawyer in the first 24 hours after 
arrest in ordinary criminal cases, that provision seems not to be fully respected in 
practice. In addition, authorization has to be obtained from the Crown Prosecutor-
General. The Working Group notes with concern that the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 
03-03) provides for police custody for up to three consecutive periods of 96 hours with 
no right to a lawyer, except for a half-hour monitored visit at the midpoint of those 12 
days. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Moroccan criminal judicial system relies heavily on confessions as the 
main evidence to support conviction. Complaints received by the Working Group 
indicate the use of torture by State officials to obtain evidence or confessions during 
initial questioning, in particular in counter-terrorism or internal security cases. The 
Working Group wishes to emphasize that confessions made in the absence of a lawyer 
are not admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings; this applies in particular to 
confessions made during the time spent in police custody.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Working Group observed the excessive use of detention on remand. In 
general, detention as a measure of punishment still seems to be the rule rather than 
the exception and there is a lack of alternatives to detention. Prison overcrowding as a 
consequence of this situation is a serious problem, which needs to be addressed. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Working Group found a significant number of children, some as young as 
14 years old, in ordinary prisons. Reports indicate that the Prosecutor General&#8217;s 
Office rarely requests alternative measures of detention, as provided for in articles 
501 to 504 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In addition, juveniles often remain in 
custody for a long period before being admitted to a child protection centre. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In La&#226;youne, Western Sahara, the Working Group received numerous 
complaints that torture and ill-treatment were used to extract confessions, as well as 
complaints indicating a pattern of excessive use of force in repressing demonstrations 
calling for self-determination of the Sahrawi population.

<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b>83. <b>The Working Group appreciates that the Government of Morocco has already 
taken steps to implement some of the recommendations made by the Working Group 
during its visit. In a spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Working Group 
recommends that the Government continue to take decisive steps to implement the 
following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure, through amendments to legislation, that access to lawyers of a 
suspect&#8217;s own choosing is granted from the moment of apprehension, without the 
presence of an investigator and without requiring the authorization of the prosecutor, 
including in cases of threats against national security and terrorism. It should be 
granted as a matter of law and any official who denies access to a lawyer should be 
sanctioned;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Make certain that all suspects have the right to enjoy, in practice, other 
basic safeguards provided for by law, which include their right to be examined by an 
independent physician; to contact a relative or friend; to be informed of their rights 
and the charges against them; and to be brought before a judge without delay; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Amend the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 03-03) to remedy the vague 
definition of the crime of terrorism and reduce the period of police custody from 96 
hours, renewable twice; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to indicate that, where there is 
an allegation of torture or ill-treatment, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution 
to establish beyond reasonable doubt that any confession made has not been obtained 
by unlawful means. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment should be admitted at any 
stage of the trial and courts should be obliged to launch ex officio investigations 
whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect torture or ill-treatment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take all necessary steps to ensure that criminal convictions are based on 
evidence other than the confession of the persons charged, especially when such 
persons retract their confessions during the trial, and make certain that, except in 
cases involving charges of torture, statements made under torture are not invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, in accordance with article 15 of the Convention against 
Torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that reports prepared by the judicial police during the 
investigative phase remain inadmissible in the trial court until the prosecution meets 
the burden of proving their veracity and legal validity, in accordance with the Code of 
Criminal Procedure; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Review criminal convictions that have been based solely on confessions 
in order to identify cases in which the conviction was based on confessions obtained 
under torture or ill-treatment, and take the appropriate remedial measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure strict adherence to registration from the very moment of arrest, 
in particular in cases involving national security and terrorism suspects; and ensure 
that police station chiefs and investigating officials and police officers, including 
members of DST, are held criminally accountable for any unacknowledged detention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Strengthen efforts to combat incommunicado and secret detention, in 
accordance with article 23 of the Constitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Conduct effective and impartial investigations into all cases of 
extraordinary renditions in which the State may have played a role, bring to light the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>facts surrounding such cases, and prosecute and punish those responsible for such 
renditions;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(k) Reform the judicial system to guarantee that all pretrial detainees 
receive a fair and speedy trial; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) In order to combat the severe overcrowding in prisons, use alternatives 
to pretrial detention, in accordance with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules 
for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules) and study the possibility of 
decriminalizing certain offences and of reducing prison sentences. A system could be 
devised for arranging bail and making more frequent use of non-custodial penalties in 
the case of less serious offences; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Continue the commitment to strengthening CNDH and to providing it 
with all the necessary means to ensure its proper functioning; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Take concrete and sustained measures to finalize the process of 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, and 
subsequently establish an effective national preventive mechanism, in accordance with 
article 17 of the Optional Protocol; and initiate an inclusive consultation process of all 
actors involved, including civil society organizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Ensure budgetary allocations to provide the national preventive 
mechanism with sufficient human and other resources to enable it to inspect all places 
of detention regularly, receive complaints, and initiate prosecutions and follow them 
through to their conclusion; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) With regard to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, work in closer 
cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and other United Nations entities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(q) Take all necessary measures to prevent mass arrests and further violence 
and investigate reports of violence against sub-Saharan migrants, refugees and
