<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its decision 24/117, the Human Rights Council decided to organize a high-level 
panel discussion at its twenty-sixth session on the identification of good practices in 
combating female genital mutilations so that an exchange of views could be held on the 
progress made, good practices and challenges and obstacles encountered in the effort to 
combat this practice, as well as the initiatives undertaken at the national, regional and 
international levels with a view to its eradication.  
</p>
<p>2. The high-level panel discussion was held on 16 June 2014. The panel was composed 
of the First Lady of Burkina Faso, Chantal Compaor&#233;; the President of the Inter-African 
Committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children, Mariam 
Lamizana; the Coordinator of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)/United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Programme on Female Genital 
Mutilation/Cutting, Nafissatou J. Diop; the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, Hiranthi Wijemanne; the Policy Director of the Department for 
International Development of the United Kingdom, Liz Ditchburn; and the Director of the 
Department of Reproductive Health Research of the World Health Organization (WHO), 
Marleen Temmerman. The panel was chaired by Ambassador and Permanent 
Representative of Togo to the United Nations at Geneva, Nakpa Polo. 
</p>
<p>3. In its decision 24/117, the Human Rights Council also called upon the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a summary 
report on the high-level panel discussion. The present report is submitted pursuant to that 
request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening remarks, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
pointed out that female genital mutilation was a form of gender-based discrimination and 
violence; a harmful and degrading practice that infringed on the rights of women and girls 
to physical and mental integrity, the rights to the highest attainable standard of health, 
including sexual and reproductive health, the right to freedom from torture and other cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment and, when it resulted in death, the right to life. 
Furthermore, because it was almost always practiced on young children, female genital 
mutilation was also a violation of the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner noted that as many as 30 million girls were at risk of 
undergoing this practice in the next decade, if current trends persisted. She stated that 
female genital mutilation had no health benefits and was rather a way to exercise control 
over women and to perpetuate harmful gender roles. The practice was in fact traditionally 
considered necessary in order to raise a girl with characteristics of a &#8220;proper&#8221; wife, given 
that female genital mutilation was believed to preserve virginity or to restrain sexual desire. 
The High Commissioner highlighted the fact that economic factors also played a significant 
role, given that the families of girls who had been mutilated often received a higher bride 
price. 
</p>
<p>6. The High Commissioner highlighted some of the steps taken at the national, regional 
and international levels to combat female genital mutilation, in particular General 
Assembly resolution 67/146 on intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female 
genital mutilations, Human Rights Council decision 24/117, by which the Council decided 
to organize the high-level panel discussion, the work of the Commission on the Status of </p>


<p>Women and regional declarations and protocols. These were encouraging signs of the 
international community&#8217;s increased commitment to ending this harmful practice. At the 
national level, several States had adopted legislation and policies to address female genital 
mutilation, which had been accompanied by more culturally sensitive education and 
awareness-raising initiatives. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner pointed out that the global prevalence of female genital 
mutilation had declined by five per cent between 2005 and 2010, and that, based on the 
current annual decrease of 1 per cent, the target of reducing its prevalence by half would 
not be achieved until 2074. Sixty years was too long to wait. The High Commissioner 
therefore called for concerted efforts by national and international stakeholders to address 
female genital mutilation with urgency, adding that, once freed of the terrible pain and 
trauma that such practices cause, girls and women were more able to develop their talents 
and use their skills, and economic, social and political development could surge forward.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Panel presentations and discussions 
</b></p>
<p>8. Chantal Compaor&#233; stated that, aided by awareness-raising campaigns and dissuasion 
measures, the prevalence rate for female genital mutilation had declined at varying rates in 
all countries. Specifically, in Burkina Faso, in the past 20 years, the prevalence rate had 
declined from 20 per cent for children up to 10 years of age to 13.3 per cent for children up 
to 14 years. In the light of the success of awareness-raising and publicity campaigns, it was 
important to continue to support them and for Governments to adopt a zero-tolerance policy 
of female genital mutilation. Some 130 to 140 million girls and women worldwide had been 
subjected to female genital mutilation. Ms. Compaor&#233; highlighted some of the root causes 
of the practice, including cultural and social acceptance of circumcision. In certain settings, 
the clitoris was considered an unhealthy organ, and its excision was thought to be a way to 
preserve the virginity of young girls and to ensure fidelity after marriage. Female genital 
mutilation was therefore a tool for controlling women&#8217;s sexuality. Girls who were not &#8220;cut&#8221; 
were often perceived as carrying a disease. The practice was continued owing to fear of 
social exclusion and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>9. In order to combat the practice, it was necessary to establish institutional 
frameworks. Ms. Compaor&#233; pointed out that, in her three decades of work on the issue, a 
number of policies had proven to be effective in combating the practice, including such 
institutional arrangements as committees, associations and adolescent networks, as well as 
efforts to bring together religious leaders and the introduction of female genital mutilation 
modules to the educational system. It was ultimately important to ensure support for girls 
who had already been subjected to genital mutilation in order to restore their sense of 
dignity. Advocacy through high-level meetings had ensured that female genital mutilation 
was part of the international agenda. 
</p>
<p>10. Hiranthi Wijemanne stated that, from the perspective of children&#8217;s rights, there 
should be zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, which was a discriminatory practice 
that almost always targeted girls and denied their rights to freedom from violence and 
abuse, besides being a violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>11. Ms. Wijemanne pointed out that the Committee on the Rights of the Child had 
advocated for the practice to be abandoned, because it affected the right to health of girls 
and was often a prerequisite for forced marriage. Unfortunately, there were still gaps in 
both law and practice. She called for changes in legislation to be accompanied by access to 
services and legal literacy programmes, the establishment of an enabling environment for 
laws to be enforced, and a coordinated approach that also addressed the issues of gender </p>


<p>equality and non-discrimination. She expressed concern at the trend towards the 
medicalization of female genital mutilation, and called upon States to ensure that health 
officials observed legislation and imposed adequate penalties for those who failed to 
comply. She recommended the use of confidential reporting mechanisms and education for 
girls.  
</p>
<p>12. Mariam Lamizana discussed the role of regional mechanisms in efforts to combat 
female genital mutilation. She stated that, in addition to communities in the 29 countries 
with the highest prevalence rates, it was also important to include immigrant populations 
throughout the world. It was difficult for communities that practiced female genital 
mutilation to renounce the practice, even when they disagreed with it.  
</p>
<p>13. Ms. Lamizana stressed that, given that these practices are conducted without regard 
for borders, there was a need for cross-border and regional approaches, in particular 
awareness-raising and regional networks of religious leaders. The involvement of young 
people and communities as well as public statements or ceremonies where &#8220;cutters&#8221; handed 
over their knives was also important. She recalled the important role that civil society 
organizations had played in combating the practice across the world, and in particular in 
Africa. She recommended that legal provisions be accompanied by implementation 
monitoring integrated into development policies and regional and international strategies. 
Lastly, she stated that Governments and communities would benefit from the dissemination 
and sharing of prior experiences and effective strategies for combating the practice. 
</p>
<p>14. Liz Ditchburn highlighted the efforts made by the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to address female genital mutilation in both 
British and international forums. The first step was to acknowledge that diaspora 
communities in the United Kingdom were at risk and to understand their relations with their 
countries of origin. In the United Kingdom, the Government was currently making efforts 
to obtain more accurate data on the prevalence of female genital mutilation in the country. 
Comprehensive action, including prevention, was a fundamental part of combating the 
practice. A wide range of professionals, including health and child protection officials, 
should be informed of the risks and provided with guidance and tools to facilitate their 
work. Also important were legislative frameworks and prosecutions, and appropriate 
support services for those affected. The media also played a critical role in raising 
awareness, as was community-led information. She reported that, in the United Kingdom, 
the mainstream national media were increasingly interested in the issue and had started to 
raise awareness of this problem, which had inspired non-governmental and civil society 
organizations to lead the way in combating the practice. At the international level, the 
Department for International Development was funding international efforts, including the 
UNFPA/UNICEF Joint Programme. Ms. Ditchburn called for more research into 
mechanisms and successful strategies for addressing the practice. Lastly, she informed 
participants that the Government of the United Kingdom together with UNICEF would host 
a &#8220;girls&#8217; summit&#8221; in London in July 2014. It was hoped that the summit would build on 
global efforts, in particular the Africa-led efforts, to increase momentum and foster further 
efforts to end the practice within a generation. Participants in the summit would also 
discuss the issue of child and forced marriage.  
</p>
<p>15. Marleen Temmerman stated that female genital mutilation was a violation of the 
human rights of girls and women, and had serious implications for their health. WHO 
supported efforts to eradicate the practice through research into prevention and good 
practices, and promoted cooperation between ministries of health. She cited several 
examples of good interventions, in countries such as Burkina Faso, Kenya and Egypt. 
WHO was also working on the development of a clinical atlas to assist in correct 
identification of female genital mutilation. Ms. Temmerman emphasized the need for a 
comprehensive response to female genital mutilation and for combining efforts to prevent </p>


<p>the practice, with care and support for women and girls who had already undergone the 
procedure. In this regard, she highlighted that WHO was developing guidelines for medical 
staff on different types of genital mutilation and their management, and in particular the 
management of acute and chronic complications. It was also encouraging the inclusion of 
female genital mutilation in the curriculum of all health-care service providers.  
</p>
<p>16. Ms. Temmerman pointed out that, in many contexts, parents put pressure on their 
doctors to perform genital mutilation on their daughters in order to avoid risks to their 
health. She stated that 18 per cent of all mutilations were performed by medical 
practitioners, and that this number was on the increase. It was thus critical to have 
guidelines that would enable doctors to refuse to perform female genital mutilation by 
showing that it was a violation of a girl&#8217;s rights. She recommended that States strengthen 
monitoring and accountability, routinely collect data on the practice. She also 
recommended the creation of supportive legislative and regulatory frameworks. Lastly, Ms. 
Temmerman highlighted the importance of ensuring that legal action was part of a broader 
set of initiatives that included the empowerment of practising communities to abandon the 
practice. To this end, there was a need to work with schools, the media and parliaments.  
</p>
<p>17. Nafissatou J. Diop reported on the work of the UNFPA/UNICEF Joint Programme 
on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting, which was launched in 2008 with the goal of 
accelerating the abandonment of the practice of female genital mutilation and cutting in one 
generation. The Programme, which was based on human rights and had a cultural-sensitive 
approach to addressing the issue, had assisted and supported Governments and civil society 
in 15 countries in addressing female genital mutilation in a coordinated and comprehensive 
manner. It had succeeded in changing its perception from that of a cultural tradition to one 
of a harmful practice that violated the rights of the girl concerned. Following intensive 
education and community dialogue sessions, the Programme encouraged public 
declarations by communities as a means to express their commitment to abandon female 
genital mutilation. Ms. Diop gave examples from Kenya and the Sudan. In the case of the 
latter country, she reported on the Saleema programme (subsequently been extended to 
Somalia and Egypt), which promoted positive values associated with women in their 
natural God-given form. <i>Saleema</i> in Arabic in fact means &#8220;whole, healthy in body and 
mind, unharmed, in a God-given condition and perfect&#8221;. The first key objective of the 
initiative was to model and popularize the use of the word <i>saleema</i> itself as a positive term 
to describe uncut girls and women. Other programmes in Ethiopia and Senegal had used 
community empowerment and dialogue strategies to stimulate a widespread grass-roots 
discussion on how certain cultural practices did not uphold human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The Programme had reached some 12,000 communities and more than 10 million 
people, who had publically declared that they had abandoned the practice of female genital 
mutilation. It had supported the enactment and enforcement of laws in Kenya, Uganda and 
Guinea-Bissau. Moving forward, the international community should continue to strengthen 
and expand the network of support to end female genital mutilation. Ms. Diop also shared 
the results of an independent evaluation of the Programme. The evaluators had found that 
the Programme had been relevant with regard to existing national and international 
commitments of national Governments to abandon female genital mutilation/cutting in 
programming countries.  </p>


<p><b> IV. Interventions and responses by representatives of States, 
non-governmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions  
</b></p>
<p>19. In the ensuing discussion, there was widespread agreement that that female genital 
mutilation constituted a serious violation of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights and could not 
be justified by any cultural or religious reason. It was acknowledged that the practice was a 
challenging issue to address, because it varied across cultures and countries, and the reasons 
for practicing it diverse. It did have, however, common underlying factors, in particular 
gender discrimination and gender stereotypes. Speakers agreed that, as a result of the 
concerted efforts of several stakeholders, a decrease had been seen in the prevalence of 
female genital mutilation. It was important to ensure that the practice continue to decrease; 
for that reason, States had to take steps in accordance with international human rights 
standards. A number of speakers referred to legislation criminalizing the practice. In 
addition, it was important to raise awareness of the fact that female genital mutilation was a 
violation of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; rights with no health benefits, but rather serious health 
consequences. Incorporating the issue of female genital mutilation into policies and 
initiatives to combat gender-based violence was also important to decrease the prevalence 
of the practice. 
</p>
<p>20. The role of the media was also particularly important, as was the need for 
information and educational programmes. Speakers agreed that action should be taken at 
multiple levels; specifically, efforts should be community based, focused on behavioural 
change and community action, and involve traditional and religious leaders. The training of 
&#8220;cutters&#8221; to engage in other income-generating programmes was also an important strategy 
that should be pursued. 
</p>
<p>21. A number of State representatives provided examples of good practices in several 
areas, including national and regional legislation criminalizing the practice, plans of action, 
national campaigns that involved community leaders, including migrant communities, as 
well as efforts to promote access to justice for women and girl victims of female genital 
mutilation. With regard to resource mobilization and international support, several speakers 
referred to bilateral support in addition to the financing of programmes by United Nations 
agencies. Speakers provided examples of good practices in combating the practice among 
migrant and refugee communities, such as specialized units in the police force, inclusion of 
the issue of female genital mutilation in family violence programmes, raising awareness in 
migrant communities, support for specialized organizations, and the adoption of targeted 
plans of action. The important contribution made by civil society organizations and United 
Nations agencies and entities in combating the practice was repeatedly highlighted and 
welcomed by speakers.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Concluding remarks</b>  
22.<b> In their concluding remarks, the panellists welcomed the consensus among 
States concerning the need to eliminate female genital mutilation and on the action 
required to address it.  
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> Panellists made several recommendations. At the national level, they 
recommended a greater focus on education for young people on female genital 
mutilation; broader dissemination of international human rights instruments; the 
development of national plans of action based on multi-sectoral approaches; support 
from communities and local role models in advocacy campaigns; and the involvement 
of men and boys. Furthermore, it was also important to focus on regional and national </b></p>


<p><b>networks to address the practice. Regional research into the effects of campaigns and 
other initiatives against female genital mutilation was needed. Panellists also proposed 
that synergies should be established between international and regional organizations 
to ensure better support for field programmes and to strengthen advocacy, as well as 
to ensure international support for long-term planning and strategies. It was also 
recommended that the issue should remain on the political and development agenda, 
including the post-2015 development agenda, and that the international community 
should adequately address the needs of the millions of women and girls with new and 
chronic medical conditions as a consequence of female genital mutilation. Working 
towards ending the medicalization of the procedure was also recommended. A call 
was also made for relevant human rights treaty bodies to integrate female genital 
mutilation into their concluding observations and recommendations to State parties 
and for the issue to remain on the agenda of the Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> The role played by civil society and non-governmental organizations was 
deemed to be critical. One panellist highlighted the results of an external assessment 
conducted in 2013 of the 15 countries supported by the UNFPA/UNICEF Joint 
Programme. National policy and legislation had been adopted in 12 out of the 15 
countries, and civil society and community-led interventions had led to public 
commitments to abandon the practice. Clear changes had taken place in the 15 
countries with the support of the Programme. Lastly, panellists expressed their 
confidence that further progress would be made</b>.<b>
