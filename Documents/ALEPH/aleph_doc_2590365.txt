the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each a "forward-looking statement"). These
forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond our control, which may include statements about our:
•
•business strategies;
•volatility or continued low or further declining commodity prices;
•future financial and operating results;
•our ability to pay distributions;
ability to replace the reserves we produce through acquisitions and the development of our
properties;
•revisions to oil and natural gas reserves estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices;
•future capital requirements and availability of financing;
•technology;
•realized oil and natural gas prices;
•production volumes;
•lease operating expenses;
•general and administrative expenses;
•cash flow and liquidity;
•availability of production equipment;
•availability of oil field labor;
•capital expenditures;
•availability and terms of capital;
•marketing of oil and natural gas;
•general economic conditions;
•competition in the oil and natural gas industry;
•effectiveness of risk management activities;
•environmental liabilities;
•counterparty credit risk;
•governmental regulation and taxation;
•developments in oil producing and natural gas producing countries; and
•plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
All of these types of statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-
Q, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may be found in Item 1.
"Financial Statements," Item 2. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" and other items within this Form 10-Q. In some
cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could,"
"should," "expect," "plan," "project," "intend," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict,"
"potential," "pursue," "target," "continue," "goal," "forecast," "guidance," "might," "scheduled" and
the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.
The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are largely based on our
expectations, which include estimates and assumptions made by our management. These
estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market
conditions and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be
reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are
beyond our control. In addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be
inaccurate. All readers are cautioned that the forward-looking
3
statements contained in this Form 10-Q are not guarantees of future performance and we cannot
assure any reader that such statements will be realized or that the forward-looking events will
occur. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements due to factors described in the "Risk Factors" section included in Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("Annual Report"). This
document is available through our website www.midconenergypartners.com or through the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s ("SEC") Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis
Retrieval System at www.sec.gov. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
made, and other than as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-
looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These cautionary
statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our
behalf.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Organization and Nature of Operations
Nature of Operations
Mid-Con Energy Partners, LP ("we," "our," "us," the "Partnership," the "Company") is a publicly
held Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2011 that engages in the ownership,
acquisition, exploitation and development of producing oil and natural gas properties in North
America, with a focus on enhanced oil recovery ("EOR"). Our limited partner units ("common
units") are traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the symbol "MCEP." Our general partner is Mid-Con
Energy GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Basis of Presentation
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. These financial statements have not
been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, except that the condensed
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 is derived from the audited financial
statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. The results
of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to
be expected for the full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions, meet or
refinance our debt obligations and meet our collateral requirements will depend on our future
cash flows. Our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are
beyond our control, including weather, oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and
maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors. Our primary use of cash has been for debt reduction and
to fund capital spending.
Oil prices have fallen to thirteen-year lows during 2016, impacting the way we conduct business.
We have implemented a number of adjustments to strengthen our financial position. In January
2015, we restructured our commodity derivative contracts and subsequently increased our
revenue security for 2016 and 2017 by executing additional commodity derivative contracts in
November 2015 and April 2016 to provide greater oil price protection over a longer period of
time. Additionally, we indefinitely suspended our quarterly cash distributions beginning with the
third quarter of 2015. We are also aggressively pursuing cost reductions in order to improve
profitability and maximize cash flows. Our primary cost reduction initiatives encompass periodic
economic review of each well within our portfolio along with ongoing scrutiny of lease operating
expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Our liquidity position at June 30, 2016 consisted of approximately $4.0 million of available cash.
Our borrowing base is redetermined in or around April and October of each year. During May
2016, we finalized our spring 2016 redetermination and resulting amendment of the underlying
revolving credit facility. The new borrowing base was effective as of June 1, 2016 and was
comprised of a $110.0 million conforming tranche and a permitted overadvance of $53.0 million.
The permitted overadvance matures on November 1, 2016. In addition, the amendment (i)
required the Partnership to provide a monthly excess cash flow report; (ii) required the
Partnership to make varied minimum monthly principal payments totaling approximately $1.9
million through October 31, 2016; (iii) reduced the borrowing base to $105.0 million upon the
close of the previously announced Hugoton divestiture; (iv) allowed an additional non-scheduled
borrowing base redetermination between September 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 to be
requested by any lender; (v) increased the minimum collateral coverage from 90% to 95% of
proved reserves (and 100% of PDP reserves); (vi) required the Partnership to unwind and early
terminate existing hedges covering production from July 2016 through September 2016 and add
new at-the-market swap contracts to replace these hedge terminations; and (vii) required the net
proceeds from the previously announced Hugoton sale and the early termination of hedge
contracts to be applied to debt reduction.
9
Based on our cash balance, forecasted cash flows from operating activities, the early
monetization of existing hedges and the closing of the previously announced Hugoton
divestiture, we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures budget, meet our debt
service requirements and fund our other commitments and obligations. Although we currently
expect our sources of cash to be sufficient to meet our near-term liquidity needs, there can be no
assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied given current oil prices and
the discretion of our lenders to decrease our borrowing base. Due to the volatility of commodity
prices, we may not be able to obtain funding in the equity or capital markets on terms we find
acceptable. The cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as
many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending
standards and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide any new funding.
Note 2. Equity Awards
We have a long-term incentive program (the "Long-Term Incentive Program") for employees,
officers, consultants and directors of our general partner and its affiliates, including Mid-Con
Energy Operating, LLC ("Mid-Con Energy Operating") and ME3 Oilfield Service, LLC ("ME3
Oilfield Service"), who perform services for us. The Long-Term Incentive Program allows for the
award of unit options, unit appreciation rights, unrestricted units, restricted units, phantom units,
distribution equivalent rights granted with phantom units and other types of awards. The Long-
Term Incentive Program is administered by the members of our general partner (the "Founders")
and approved by the Board of Directors of the general partner. If an employee terminates
employment prior to the restriction lapse date, the awarded units are forfeited and canceled and
are no longer considered issued and outstanding.
On November 20, 2015, the Board of Directors of the general partner approved an amendment to
the Long-Term Incentive Program that increased the number of common units available for
issuance from 1,764,000 to 3,514,000.
The following table shows the number of existing awards and awards available under the Long-
Term Incentive Program at June 30, 2016:

)
)
)
We recognized $0.3 million and $0.7 million of total equity-based compensation expense for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and we recognized $0.4 million and
$2.4 million of total equity-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, respectively. These costs are reported as a component of general and
administrative expense in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.
Unrestricted unit awards
We account for unrestricted awards as equity awards since they are settled by issuing common
units. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we granted 70,000 unrestricted units with an
average grant date fair value of $1.16 per unit. These units were granted to certain directors of
our general partner.
Restricted unit awards
We account for restricted awards as equity awards since they will be settled by issuing common
units. These units vest over a two or three year period. The compensation expense we recognize
associated with our restricted units is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate
based on prior experience and adjust it as circumstances warrant. We did not issue any restricted
units during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

As of June 30, 2016, there were approximately $0.5 million of unrecognized compensation costs
related to non-vested restricted units. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately 10 months.
Equity-settled phantom unit awards
We account for equity-settled phantom units as equity awards since these awards will be settled
by issuing common units. These units vest over a two or three year period and do not have any
rights or privileges of a common unitholder, including right to distributions, until vesting and the
resulting conversion into common units. The compensation expense we recognize associated
with our equity-settled phantom units is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture
rate based on prior experience and adjust it as circumstances warrant. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we granted 24,500 equity-settled phantom units with one-third vesting
immediately and the other two-thirds vesting over two years. These units were granted to certain
employees of our affiliates.

average period of approximately 1.43 years.
Note 3. Derivative Financial Instruments
Our risk management program is intended to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility
and to assist with stabilizing cash flows. Accordingly, we utilize commodity derivative contracts
(swaps, calls, puts and costless collars) to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity prices
and specific delivery points. The commodity derivative contracts that we have entered into
generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price or a floor for a portion of our expected
future oil production over a fixed period of time. We enter into commodity derivative contracts or
modify our portfolio of existing commodity derivative contracts when we believe market
conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so, or as required by our
lenders. These are presented as derivative financial instruments on our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our net commodity derivative contracts were in a net
asset position with a fair value of approximately $3.0 million and $25.6 million, respectively. All of
our commodity derivative contracts are with major financial institutions that are also members of
our banking group. Should one of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize
the benefit of some of our commodity derivative contracts under lower commodity prices and we
could incur a loss. As of June 30, 2016, all of our counterparties have performed pursuant to their
commodity derivative contracts.
11
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our commodity derivative contracts had maturities that
extended through June 2018 and December 2017, respectively, and were comprised of
commodity price swap, call, put and collar contracts.
For commodity price swap contracts, at the time of execution the seller agrees to receive a fixed
price at maturity in exchange for any gains or losses that might be realized from allowing the
price of the underlying commodity to float with the market until maturity. From the perspective of
the seller, these instruments limit exposure to price declines below the price fixed by the swap at
the expense of participating in any price increases above the price fixed by the swap.
For commodity price call contracts, in return for a premium received, which can be effected at
either execution or settlement, the seller is obliged to pay the difference, when positive, between
the market price of the underlying commodity at maturity and the strike price. From the
perspective of the seller, these instruments provide income via the premium received at the
expense of any incremental gains that would have otherwise been received above the strike
price.
For commodity price put contracts, in return for a premium paid, which can be effected at either
execution or settlement, the purchaser has the right to receive the difference, when positive,
between the strike price and the market price of the underlying commodity at maturity. From the
perspective of the purchaser, these instruments limit exposure to price declines below the strike
price at the expense of premiums paid.
For commodity price collar contracts, a collar is the combination of a put purchased or sold by a
party and a call option sold or purchased by the same party. The collar is defined as costless
when the value of the option purchased is approximately offset by the value of the option sold.
We do not designate derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, the mark-to-
market adjustment reflecting the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts is
recorded in current period earnings. When prices for oil are volatile, a significant portion of the
effect of our hedging activities consists of non-cash gains or losses due to changes in the fair
value of our commodity derivative contracts. In addition to mark-to-market adjustments, gains or
losses arise from net payments made or received on monthly settlements, proceeds or payments
for termination of contracts prior to their expiration and premiums paid or received for new
contracts. Any deferred premiums are recorded as a liability and recognized in earnings as the
related contracts mature. Gains and losses on derivatives are included in cash flows from
operating activities. Pursuant to the accounting standard that permits netting of assets and
liabilities where the right of offset exists, we present the fair value of commodity derivative
contracts on a net basis.

2016. In connection with the early termination of our commodity derivative contracts, we received
net proceeds of approximately $11.1 million. We received approximately $5.9 million from selling
calls and paid approximately $19.8 million in premiums to extend the contracts through
September 2016. The restructuring also resulted in approximately $4.1 million in deferred
premium put options. As of June 30, 2016, we had paid approximately $3.4 million of the deferred
premiums in connection with these contract settlements.
In connection with the November 2015 semi-annual redetermination of our borrowing base, we
entered into additional commodity derivative contracts resulting in total commodity derivative
contracts covering at least 80% of our 2016 projected monthly production and at least 50% of our
2017 projected monthly production, calculated based on Proved Developed Producing reserves.
No cash settlements were required and the contracts included deferred premiums of
approximately $7.8 million that will be paid through December 2017. As of June 30, 2016, we
had paid approximately $0.8 million of the deferred premiums in connection with these contract
settlements.

Note 4. Fair Value Disclosures
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts reported in our balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate their fair values. The carrying amount of debt under our revolving credit
facility approximates fair value because the revolving credit facility’s variable interest rate resets
frequently and approximates current market rates available to us. We account for our commodity
derivative contracts at fair value as discussed in "Assets and Liabilities Measures at Fair Value
on a Recurring Basis" below.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Assets and liabilities recorded in the balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to the
valuation technique as follows:
Level 1—Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on unadjusted quoted prices
for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that management has the ability to access.
We consider active markets to be those in which
14
transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an on-going basis.
Level 2—Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets
that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 instruments primarily include swap, call and put
contracts.
Level 3—Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation
techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy in a liquid
environment, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Changes in the
observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or
liabilities. We had no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015.
Our estimates of fair value have been determined at discrete points in time based on relevant
market data. These estimates involve uncertainty and cannot be determined with precision.
There were no changes in valuation techniques or related inputs for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We account for commodity derivative contracts and their corresponding deferred premiums at fair
value on a recurring basis utilizing certain pricing models. Inputs to the pricing models include
publicly available prices from a compilation of data gathered from third parties and brokers. We
validate the data provided by third parties by understanding the pricing models used, obtaining
market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain situations and
confirming that those securities trade in active markets. See Note 3 in this section for a summary
of our derivative financial instruments.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis
We estimate the fair value of our Asset Retirement Obligations ("ARO") based on discounted
cash flow projections using numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such
factors as the existence of a legal obligation for ARO, amounts and timing of settlements, the
credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used and inflation rates. See Note 5 in this section for a
summary of changes in ARO.
We calculate the estimated fair values of reserves and properties using valuation techniques
consistent with the income approach, converting future cash flows to a single discounted amount.
Significant inputs used to determine the fair values of proved properties include estimates of: (i)
reserves; (ii) future operating and developmental costs; (iii) future commodity prices; (iv) a
market-based weighted average cost of capital rate; and (v) the rate at which future cash flows
are discounted to estimate present value. We discount future values by a per annum rate of 10%
because we believe this amount approximates our long-term cost of capital and accordingly, is
well aligned with our internal business decisions. The underlying commodity prices embedded in
our estimated cash flows are the product of a process that begins with Level 1 NYMEX-WTI
forward curve pricing, as well as Level 3 assumptions including: pricing adjustments for
estimated location and quality differentials, production costs, capital expenditures, production
volumes, decline rates, and estimated reserves. The need to test an asset for impairment may
result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of
oil and natural gas reserves. If the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the sum of
estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference
between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of approximately $0.9 million due to a revision of reserve estimates for a property in our
Permian core area. The impairment is included in "Impairment of proved oil and natural gas
properties" in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. On May 26, 2016,
we entered into an agreement to sell our assets in the Hugoton core area. The related assets and
liabilities were classified as held for sale in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets at June 30, 2016. In conjunction with this agreement, we recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of approximately $3.6 million to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their fair
value, based on the agreed upon sales price of $18.0 million, prior to customary post-closing
adjustments. The impairment is included in "Impairment of assets held for sale" in our unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairment charges for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015.

Note 5.  Asset Retirement Obligations
We have obligations under our lease agreements and federal regulations to remove equipment
and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These ARO are primarily
associated with plugging and abandoning wells. We typically incur this liability upon acquiring or
drilling a well and determine our ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flow
related to the estimated future liability. Determining the removal and future restoration obligation
requires management to make estimates and judgments, including the ultimate settlement
amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted risk-free rates, timing of settlement and changes in the
legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. We are required to record the fair
value of a liability for the ARO in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase
in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. We review our assumptions and estimates
of future asset retirement obligations on an annual basis, or more frequently, if an event or
circumstances occur that would impact our assumptions. To the extent future revisions to these
assumptions impact the present value of the abandonment liability, management will make
16
corresponding adjustments to both the ARO and the related oil and natural gas property asset
balance. Over time, the liability is accreted each period toward its future value and is recorded in
our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The discounted capitalized
cost is amortized to expense through the depreciation calculation over the life of the assets
based on proved developed reserves. Upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is
recognized to the extent the actual costs differ from the recorded liability.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our ARO were reported as "Asset retirement
obligations" in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our ARO for
the periods indicated are presented in the following table:

At June 30, 2016, we had $162.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit
facility, comprised of a $110.0 million conforming borrowing base and a $52.0 million permitted
overadvance. At June 30, 2016 maturities of our debt were $52.0 million in 2016 and $110.0
million in 2018.
The borrowing base of our revolving credit facility is collectively determined by our lenders based
on the value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves using assumptions regarding future
prices, costs and other matters that may vary. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled
redeterminations in or around April and October of each year with an additional redetermination,
either at our request or at the request of the lender, during the period between each scheduled
borrowing base determination. An additional borrowing base redetermination may be made at
the request of the lenders in connection with a material disposition of our properties or a material
liquidation of a hedge contract.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on, at our
election: (i) the greater of the prime rate of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the
federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and the one month adjusted London Interbank Offered
Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%, all of which are subject to a margin that varies from 1.00% to
2.75% per annum according to the borrowing base usage (which is the ratio of outstanding
borrowings and letters of credit to the borrowing base then in effect), or (ii) the applicable LIBOR
plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 3.75% per annum according to the borrowing base
usage. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the average effective rate was approximately
4.13%. Any unused portion of the borrowing base will be subject to a commitment fee that varies
from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum according to the borrowing base usage.
17
We may use borrowings under the facility for acquiring and developing oil and natural gas
properties, for working capital purposes, for general partnership purposes and for funding
distributions to our unitholders. The revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and
negative covenants, such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens,
restrictions on certain transactions and payments, including distributions. If we fail to perform our
obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitments may be
terminated and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement, together with accrued
interest, could be declared immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with these
covenants as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
During February 2015, the revolving credit facility was amended to allow our Consolidated
EBITDAX calculation, as defined in section 7.13 of the original revolving credit agreement, to
reflect the net cash flows attributable to the restructured commodity derivative contracts that
occurred during January 2015 for the periods of the first quarter 2015 through the third quarter of
2016.
During the semi-annual redetermination in April 2015, the borrowing base under the revolving
credit facility was reduced to $220.0 million from $240.0 million. No other material terms of the
original credit agreement were amended.
During November 2015, the semi-annual redetermination of our borrowing base and amendment
of the underlying revolving credit facility was completed. This redetermination resulted in a
borrowing base of $190.0 million, consisting of a $165.0 million conforming tranche, which
required six monthly commitment reductions of $2.5 million each through May 2016, and a $25.0
million non-conforming tranche that matured on May 1, 2016. The credit facility amendment also
designated Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as our administrative and collateral agent,
replacing Royal Bank of Canada. This redetermination also required that by December 10, 2015,
we enter into commodity derivative contracts of not less than 80% of our 2016 projected monthly
production and not less than 50% of our 2017 projected monthly production, calculated based on
Proved Developed Producing reserves. These requirements were satisfied during November
2015 with the execution of additional commodity derivative contracts maturing in 2016 and 2017.
In connection with this amendment to our revolving credit facility, we incurred financing fees and
expenses of approximately $0.7 million, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the
revolving credit facility. Such amortized expenses are recorded in "interest expense" on our
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
During May 2016, we finalized our spring 2016 redetermination and resulting amendment of the
underlying revolving credit facility. The new borrowing base was effective as of June 1, 2016 and
was comprised of a $110.0 million conforming tranche and a permitted overadvance of $53.0
million. The permitted overadvance matures on November 1, 2016. In addition, the amendment
(i) required the Partnership to provide a monthly excess cash flow report; (ii) required the
Partnership to make varied minimum monthly principal payments totaling approximately $1.9
million through October 31, 2016; (iii) reduced the borrowing base to $105.0 million upon the
close of the previously announced Hugoton divestiture; (iv) allowed an additional non-scheduled
borrowing base redetermination between September 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 to be
requested by any lender; (v) increased the minimum collateral coverage from 90% to 95% of
proved reserves (and 100% of PDP reserves); (vi) required the Partnership to unwind and early
terminate existing hedges covering production from July 2016 through September 2016 and add
new at-the-market swap contracts to replace these hedge terminations; and (vii) required the net
proceeds from the previously announced Hugoton sale and from the early termination of hedge
contracts to be applied to debt reduction.
Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies
We lease corporate office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Abilene, Texas. We are also allocated
office rent from Mid-Con Energy Operating. Total lease expenses were approximately $0.1
million each for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and approximately $0.2 million
each for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenses are
included in general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations.

We have a service agreement with Mid-Con Energy Operating, pursuant to which Mid-Con
Energy Operating will provide certain services to us, our subsidiaries and our general partner,
including management, administrative and operations services, which include marketing,
geological and engineering services. Under the services agreement, we reimburse Mid-Con
Energy Operating, on a monthly basis, for the allocable expenses it incurs in its performance
under the services agreement. These expenses include, among other things, salary, bonus,
incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for or on our
behalf and other expenses allocated by Mid-Con Energy Operating to us.
Our general partner has entered into employment agreements with the following named
employees of our general partner: Jeffrey R. Olmstead, President and Chief Executive Officer,
and Charles R. Olmstead, Executive Chairman of the Board. The employment agreements
automatically renew for one-year terms unless either we or the employee gives written notice of
termination by at least February 1st preceding any such August 1st. Pursuant to the employment
agreements, each employee will serve in his respective position with our general partner, as set
forth above, and has duties, responsibilities and authority as the Board of Directors of our general
partner may specify from time to time, in roles consistent with such positions that are assigned to
them. The agreement stipulates that if there is a change of control, termination of employment,
with cause or without cause, or death of the executive certain payments will be made to the
executive officer. These payments, depending on the reason for termination, currently range from
$0.3 million to $0.7 million, including the value of vesting of any outstanding units.
We are party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management and our General Counsel, the ultimate resolution of all
claims, legal actions and complaints after consideration of amounts accrued, insurance coverage
or other indemnification arrangements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 8. Equity
Common Units
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Partnership’s equity consisted of 29,784,015 and
29,724,890 common units, respectively, representing approximately a 98.8% limited partnership
interest in us.
On May 5, 2015, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "Agreement") to sell, from
time to time through or to the Managers (as defined in the Agreement), up to $50.0 million in
common units representing limited partner interests. The sales, if any, of common units made
under the Agreement will be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at-the-
market-offering" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), including without limitation, sales made directly on the NASDAQ, on any other
existing trading market for our common units or to or through a market maker. From the period of
the original agreement to June 30, 2016, we did not sell any common units.
Cash Distributions
Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash on a quarterly basis.
Our available cash is our cash on hand at the end of a quarter after the payment of our expenses
and the establishment of reserves for future capital expenditures and operational needs,
including cash from working capital borrowings. There is no assurance as to the future cash
distributions since they are dependent upon our projections for future earnings, cash flows,
capital requirements, financial conditions and other factors.
As of August 3, 2016, cash distributions continue to be indefinitely suspended. Our credit
agreement stipulates written consent from our lenders is required in order to reinstate
distributions and also prohibits us from making cash distributions if
19
any potential default or event of default, as defined in the credit agreement, occurs or would result
from the cash distribution. Management and the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate, on a
quarterly basis, the appropriate level of cash reserves in determining future distributions. The
suspension of cash distributions is designed to preserve liquidity and reallocate excess cash
flow towards capital expenditure projects and debt reduction to maximize long-term value for our
unitholders.
Allocation of Net Income or Loss
Net income or loss is allocated between our general partner and the limited partner unitholders in
proportion to their pro rata ownership during the period.
Note 9. Related Party Transactions
Agreements with Affiliates
The following agreements were negotiated among affiliated parties and, consequently, are not
the result of arm’s length negotiations. The following is a description of those agreements that
have been entered into with the affiliates of our general partner and with our general partner.
Services Agreement. We are party to a services agreement with Mid-Con Energy Operating
pursuant to which Mid-Con Energy Operating provides certain services to us, including
management, administrative and operational services. The operational services include
marketing, geological and engineering services. Under the services agreement, we reimburse
Mid-Con Energy Operating, on a monthly basis, for the allocable expenses it incurs in its
performance under the services agreement. These expenses include, among other things, salary,
bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us
or on our behalf and other expenses allocated by Mid-Con Energy Operating to us. These
expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations.
Operating Agreements. We, various third parties with an ownership interest in the same property
and our affiliate, Mid-Con Energy Operating, are party to standard oil and natural gas joint
operating agreements, pursuant to which we and those third parties pay Mid-Con Energy
Operating overhead charges associated with operating our properties. We and those third parties
pay Mid-Con Energy Operating for its direct and indirect expenses that are chargeable to the
wells under their respective operating agreements. The majority of these expenses are included
in lease operating expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Oilfield Services. We are party to standard oilfield services operating agreements, pursuant to
which Mid-Con Energy Operating bills us for oilfield services performed by our affiliate ME3
Oilfield Service. These expenses are either included in lease operating expenses in our
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations or in oil and natural gas properties
in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

accounts payable-related parties in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Note 10. New Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a comprehensive new
revenue recognition standard that supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic
605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive
Activities-Oil and Gas-Revenue Recognition. The core principle of the new guidance is that a
company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that
20
reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
transferring those goods or services. The new standard also requires significantly expanded
disclosure regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The
standard creates a five-step model that requires companies to exercise judgment when
considering the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and circumstances. The standard allows
for several transition methods: (a) a full retrospective adoption in which the standard is applied to
all of the periods presented, or (b) a modified retrospective adoption in which the standard is
applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, including additional
disclosures of the standard's application impact to individual financial statement line items. This
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that reporting period. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact this
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are intended
to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This
standard is effective for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim
periods within annual period beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. As
of June 30, 2016 the Partnership has not elected early adoption.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which supersedes
current lease guidance. The new lease standard requires all leases with a term greater than one
year to be recognized on the balance sheet while maintaining substantially similar classifications
for finance and operating leases. Lease expense recognition on the income statement will be
effectively unchanged. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact this
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance simplifies the accounting for
employee stock-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes,
forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows.
The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income
statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid in capital pools.
The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares for tax
withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a
policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. The Partnership is
currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements
upon adoption of this standard.
Note 11. Subsequent Events
On July 1, 2016, in connection with our spring 2016 borrowing base redetermination, we
terminated some of our commodity derivative contracts covering July 2016 through September
2016 production, resulting in net receipts of approximately $4.3 million. Per the amendment to the
credit facility, we used the funds received to reduce our outstanding debt. Also on July 1, 2016,
we entered into new commodity derivative at-the-market swap contracts covering 300,000 barrels
of future oil production which extend through September 2016.
On July 20, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 3,932 unrestricted units,
323,000 equity-settled phantom units with one-third vesting immediately and the other two-thirds
vesting over two years, and 27,000 equity-settled phantom units with a three-year vesting period.
The equity-settled phantom units do not have any rights or privileges of a unit holder, including
right to distributions, until vesting and the resulting conversion into common units. These units
were granted to certain employees of our affiliates and founders of our general partner.
On July 28, 2016, we closed on the previously announced sale of oil and natural gas assets
within the Hugoton area. The effective date of the sale was May 1, 2016. Proceeds from the sale
of approximately $17.9 million, inclusive of preliminary post-closing adjustments, were used to
reduce borrowings outstanding under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. These assets, net
of DD&A and impairment, were classified as assets held for sale, net and their corresponding
ARO liabilities were classified as liabilities related to assets held for sale in our unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016.
On July 28, 2016, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to purchase oil and
natural gas assets in Nolan County, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$19.5 million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price
21
adjustments. The effective date of the acquisition is June 1, 2016 and it is expected to close on or
before August 12, 2016. The purchase price will be paid in cash, which is expected to be funded
by the Private Offering described below.
On July 28, 2016, as more fully described in the Partnership’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
August 3, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to issue and sell $20.0 million of Class A
Convertible Preferred Units ("preferred units") in a private offering subject to customary closing
conditions with the Partnership having the option to issue and sell an additional $5.0 million in
additional preferred units. The Partnership will use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the
acquisition of certain properties in Nolan County, Texas, and any excess will be used to reduce
borrowings under our revolving credit facility or general corporate purposes. The preferred units
will be issued at a price of $2.15 per preferred unit (the "unit purchase price"). The Partnership
will pay holders of the preferred units a cumulative, quarterly distribution in cash at an annual rate
of 8.0%, or under certain circumstances, in additional preferred units, at an annual rate of 10%. At
any time after the six month anniversary and prior to the five year anniversary of the closing date,
each holder of the preferred units may elect to convert all or any portion of their preferred units
into common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership on a one-for-one
basis. On the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the offering, each holder may elect to cause
the Partnership to redeem all or any portion of their preferred units for cash at the unit purchase
price, and any remaining preferred units will thereafter be converted to common units on a one-
for-one basis. The agreement requires the Partnership to enter into a registration rights
agreement and has provisions relating to a change of control. The agreement also requires the
Partnership to suspend sales of Common Units pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement,
which is described in Note 8 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, from
the closing date through the fifth anniversary of the closing date and prohibits the Partnership
from incurring any indebtedness (other than under the Partnership’s existing credit facility and
trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business) without the consent of the
majority of the holders of the preferred units.
On July 29, 2016, we entered into new commodity derivative contracts covering 150,000 barrels
of future oil production which extend through December 2018.
On August 1, 2016, we entered into new commodity derivative contracts covering 150,000
barrels of future oil production which extend through December 2018.
On August 1, 2016, we announced that effective upon the closing of the Nolan County, Texas
asset purchase, we have received unanimous lender support to increase the pro forma
conforming borrowing base of our revolving credit facility to $140.0 million subject to execution of
Amendment No. 10 to the credit agreement.
As of August 3, 2016, borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility were
approximately $139.3 million, after total debt payments of approximately $22.7 million from the
June 30, 2016 balance.
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should
be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the
related notes thereto, as well as our Annual Report.
Overview
Mid-Con Energy Partners, LP ("we," "our," "us," the "Partnership," the "Company") is a publicly
held Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2011 that engages in the ownership,
acquisition, exploitation and development of producing oil and natural gas properties in North
America, with a focus on EOR. Our general partner is Mid-Con Energy GP, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company. Our common units are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol
"MCEP."
Our properties are located primarily in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin regions of the
United States in four core areas: Southern Oklahoma, Northeastern Oklahoma, Texas Gulf Coast
and Texas within the Eastern Shelf of the Permian ("Permian"). Our properties primarily consist
of mature, legacy onshore oil reservoirs with long-lived, relatively predictable production profiles
and low production decline rates.
Recent Developments
Operating Performance
Low oil and natural gas prices continue to constrain the Partnership's operating income by
negatively impacting top-line revenues and corresponding operating margins. As detailed below,
the Partnership has responded to this operating environment
22
with numerous cost control initiatives and ongoing portfolio evaluations. During the second
quarter 2016, production declined approximately 5% sequentially. Relative to the first quarter
2016, we reduced lease operating expenses approximately 5% while general and administrative
costs decreased by approximately 29%, largely due to the year-end audit and K-1 tax preparation
fees that occurred during the first quarter. Sequential cash operating expenses declined
approximately 3% quarter-over-quarter to average $25.63/Boe. From operating cash flows we
repaid approximately $7.0 million in debt during the quarter and funded approximately $1.9
million in capital spending.
Development of our large waterflood projects continued in the second quarter of 2016, notably in
our Cleveland Field Unit (Northeastern Oklahoma) and Corsica Bend Conglomerate Unit
(Permian). The Cleveland Field Unit continues to demonstrate a strong waterflood response to
injection. Additional capital is planned for the remainder of 2016 to further expand the waterflood
development at the Cleveland Field Unit. Expansion of our Corsica Bend Conglomerate Unit
continued in the second quarter with the addition of a second injection well in an under-
developed portion of the Corsica Bend Conglomerate Unit characterized by high oil cuts.
Waterflood response from recently established injection is expected in the second half of 2016.
Additional development capital is planned for late 2016 and first half of 2017 pending waterflood
response in the Bend Conglomerate formation.
In the second quarter of 2016, we drilled and completed two wells, one well in the Northeastern
Oklahoma core area and one well in the Permian core area. Nine recompletions (six in the
Northeastern Oklahoma core area and three in the Permian core area) targeting behind pipe pay
were initiated in the second quarter.
Low Price Environment Initiatives
In response to the significant decline in benchmark oil prices that unfolded since November 2014
and have persisted in 2016, we remain focused on cost reductions. Our ongoing cost reduction
initiatives encompass periodic economic review of each well within our portfolio along with
ongoing scrutiny of lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. Wells
that are not economically viable, at prevailing prices, are shut-in provided there are no
contractual, operating or reservoir constraints precluding the suspension of operations. Based on
this assessment, we elected to shut-in approximately 184 uneconomic wells, the majority of
which were shut-in late January 2016, most of which were still shut-in at June 30, 2016. We will
continue to monitor pricing and expenses to determine when to return these wells to production.
Commodity Prices
Our revenues and net income are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices which have been and
are expected to continue to be volatile. In the second quarter of 2016, the front-month NYMEX-
WTI futures price averaged approximately $46 per barrel, compared to approximately $58 per
barrel in the second quarter of 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the front-
month NYMEX-WTI futures price ranged from a low of approximately $36 per barrel to a high of
approximately $51 per barrel.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
In April 2016, we entered into new oil derivative contracts covering a total of 240,000 barrels of
future production which extend from January 2017 through December 2017 with a weighted
average ceiling price of $50.68 per barrel and $40.00 floor price per barrel.
In May 2016, we entered into new oil derivative contracts covering a total of 240,000 barrels of
future production which extend from January 2018 through June 2018 with a weighted average
ceiling price of $58.54 per barrel and $45.00 floor price per barrel.
Distributions
As of August 3, 2016, cash distributions continue to be indefinitely suspended. Our credit
agreement stipulates written consent from our lenders is required in order to reinstate
distributions and also prohibits us from making cash distributions if any potential default or event
of default, as defined in the credit agreement, occurs or would result from the cash distribution.
Management and the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the
appropriate level of cash reserves in determining future distributions. The suspension of cash
distributions is designed to preserve liquidity and reallocate excess cash flow towards capital
expenditure projects and debt reduction to maximize long-term value for our unitholders.
Financing Activities
Effective June 1, 2016, in connection with the semi-annual borrowing base redetermination by
the lenders, the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was reduced to $110.0 million
conforming tranche and a $53.0 million permitted
23
overadvance. The permitted overadvance matures on November 1, 2016. In addition, we and our
lenders reached an agreement on amending certain terms of our revolving credit facility. See
Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding our revolving credit facility.
Appointment of Certain Officers
On April 1, 2016, Mr. Charles L. McLawhorn III was named Vice President, General Counsel and
Secretary of the General Partner, replacing Mr. Nathan P. Pekar whose resignation was effective
on January 8, 2016.
On June 10, 2016, Mr. Matthew R. Lewis was named Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
of the General Partner effective August 1, 2016, replacing Mr. Michael D. Peterson whose
resignation was effective July 31, 2016.
Relocation of Corporate Headquarters
On June 10, 2016, we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Dallas,
Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma and the closing of our Dallas office.
Business Environment
The markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in
the future, which means that the price of oil may fluctuate widely. Sustained periods of low prices
for oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position, our results of operations, the
quantities of oil reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital. Oil and
natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. In
general, average oil and natural gas prices were significantly lower during the comparable
periods of 2016 measured against 2015. For perspective, prices for front month NYMEX-WTI
crude oil futures traded within a range of $35.70 and $51.23 per barrel in the second quarter of
2016, ending the quarter at $48.33 per barrel while front month NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures traded within a range of $1.90 to $2.92 per MMBtu over the same period, ending the
quarter at $2.92 per MMBtu. The continued volatility in commodity prices has had an impact on
our unit price. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our common unit price fluctuated
between a closing high of $3.95 to a closing low of $0.78.
Our risk management program is intended to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility
and to assist with stabilizing cash flows. Accordingly, we utilize commodity derivative contracts
(swaps, calls, puts and costless collars) to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity prices
and specific delivery points. The commodity derivative contracts that we have entered into
generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price or a floor for a portion of our expected
future oil production over a fixed period of time. We enter into commodity derivative contracts or
modify our portfolio of existing commodity derivative contracts when we believe market
conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so, or as required by our
lenders. We conduct our risk management activities exclusively with participant lenders in our
revolving credit facility. In January 2015, we restructured a significant portion of our hedge
portfolio to limit downside and volatility due to the then prevailing commodity price environment.
In November 2015, April 2016 and May 2016, we entered into additional oil commodity derivative
contracts covering a portion of our anticipated oil production in 2016 through 2018.
Our business faces the challenge of natural production declines. As initial reservoir pressures
are depleted, oil production from a given well or formation decreases. Although our waterflood
operations tend to restore reservoir pressure and production, once a waterflood is fully effected,
production, once again, begins to decline. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue
to add reserves in excess of our production. Our focus on adding reserves is primarily through
improving the economics of producing oil from our existing fields and, secondarily, through
acquisitions of additional proved reserves. Our ability to add reserves through exploitation
projects and acquisitions is dependent upon many factors, including our ability to raise capital,
obtain regulatory approvals, procure contract drilling rigs and personnel and successfully identify
and close acquisitions.
We focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling
costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future cash flows from operations
are impacted by our ability to manage our overall cost structure.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our primary business objective is to manage our oil and natural gas properties for the purpose of
generating stable cash flows, which will provide stability and, over time, growth of distributions to
our unitholders. The amount of cash that we can distribute to our unitholders depends principally
on the cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based
on, among other factors:
24
•
•the amount of oil and natural gas we produce;
•the prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas production;
•our ability to hedge commodity prices; and
•the level of our operating and administrative costs.
We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and
natural gas properties, including:
•Oil and natural gas production volumes;
Realized prices on the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effect of our commodity
derivative contracts;
•Lease operating expenses; and
•Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by
external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, rating
agencies and others, to assess:
the cash flow generated by our assets, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or
historical cost basis; and
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.
In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate actual potential cash flow available
to reduce debt, develop existing reserves or acquire additional oil properties and pay
distributions to our unitholders. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not
be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or
any other performance or liquidity measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In
addition, our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to EBITDA or
Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by other companies.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
We reported net loss of approximately $15.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to net loss of approximately $7.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
The $7.9 million change was attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices, lower oil
volumes, the unfavorable net effect of our derivatives and higher impairment charges partially
offset by lower lease operating expenses ("LOE"), lower depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense ("DD&A") and lower production taxes.
Sales Revenues. Revenues from oil and natural gas sales for the three months ended June 30,
2016 were approximately $14.8 million as compared to approximately $21.6 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The revenue decrease was primarily due to lower oil and natural
gas prices driven by market conditions combined with lower oil sales volumes. Our average
sales price per barrel of oil, excluding commodity derivative contracts, for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 was approximately $41.40 compared to approximately $53.51 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Commodity prices continue to be volatile. In the second quarter of 2016,
the front-month NYMEX-WTI futures price averaged approximately $46 per barrel, compared to
approximately $58 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. During the three months ended June
30, 2016, the front-month NYMEX-WTI futures price ranged from a low of approximately $36 per
barrel to a high of approximately $51 per barrel.
On average, our production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were
approximately 371 MBoe, or approximately 4,077 Boe per day. In comparison, our total
production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were approximately 420 MBoe, or
approximately 4,615 Boe per day. The decrease in production volumes was primarily due to the
shut-in of uneconomic wells during the first quarter of 2016, the majority of which remained shut-
in during the second quarter of 2016, and decreased production due to natural declines of our
assets.
Effects of Commodity Derivative Contracts. We utilize NYMEX-WTI derivative contracts to hedge
against changes in commodity prices. To the extent the future commodity prices decrease
between measurement periods, we will have gains on our commodity derivative contracts, net of
deferred premiums. To the extent future commodity prices increase between measurement
periods, we will have losses on our commodity derivative contracts, including deferred premiums.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of approximately $10.1 million
which was composed of approximately $16.3 million non-cash loss on changes in fair value of
commodity derivative contracts and approximately $6.2 million gain on net cash settlements of
derivative contracts. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss of
approximately $8.9 million from our commodity derivative contracts, which was comprised of
approximately $11.3 million non-cash loss on changes in fair value of our commodity derivative
contracts and approximately $2.4 million gain on net cash settlements of commodity derivative
contracts.
Lease Operating Expenses. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, LOE were approximately
$5.8 million, or $15.57 per Boe, compared to approximately $7.6 million, or approximately $18.14
per Boe, for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in total LOE and average
costs per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016 reflects the impact of company wide
cost-savings initiatives including the shut-in of 184 uneconomic wells during the first quarter of
2016. As of June 30, 2016, the majority of these wells remained shut-in for economic reasons.
Production Taxes. Production taxes are calculated as a percentage of our oil and natural gas
revenues and exclude the effects of our commodity derivative contracts. Production taxes for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $0.7 million, or approximately $1.97 per
Boe (effective tax rate of approximately 5.0%), compared to approximately $1.3 million, or
approximately $3.14 per Boe (effective tax rate of approximately 6.1%) for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in production taxes for the three months ended June 30,
2016 was attributable to lower oil and natural gas revenues driven by lower prices and lower
sales volumes and to an EOR Production Tax Exemption for one of our Northeastern Oklahoma
units. The EOR exemption will extend through March 2018. The decrease in production tax per
Boe and the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of Permian
production, which bears a lower state production rate, and the EOR tax exemption in
Northeastern Oklahoma.
Impairment Expense. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded approximately
$0.9 million of non-cash impairment expense due to revisions in reserve estimates for one of our
Permian properties. There were no impairment charges for the three ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenses. DD&A on producing properties for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $5.8 million, or approximately $15.63 per Boe,
compared to approximately $8.2 million, or approximately $19.50 per Boe, for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in DD&A and DD&A per Boe was primarily due to the asset
impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 which reduced the carrying value of our oil and
natural gas properties.
27
General and Administrative Expenses ("G&A"). G&A were approximately $1.5 million, or
approximately $3.98 per Boe, for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to
approximately $1.6 million, or approximately $3.90 per Boe, for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to decreases in equity-based
compensation costs resulting from the lower price of our common units and fewer units issued.
G&A expenses included non-cash equity-based compensation of approximately $0.3 million and
approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately
$2.1 million, compared to approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
The increase in interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2016 is due to a higher
effective interest rate as a result of the higher pricing grip established during the fall 2015
redetermination.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
We reported a net loss of approximately $19.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to a net loss of approximately $12.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The $7.0 million change was primarily attributable to lower oil and natural gas sales prices and
lower oil volumes and higher impairment charges, partially offset by lower LOE, lower DD&A,
lower G&A, and lower production taxes.
Sales Revenues. Revenues from oil and natural gas sales for the six months ended June 30,
2016 were approximately $26.0 million as compared to approximately $39.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. In 2016, revenues were negatively affected by the volatility of
commodity prices and decreased production volumes. Our average sales price per barrel of oil,
excluding commodity derivative contracts, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $35.59,
compared to approximately $48.91 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. In the first six months
of 2016, the front-month NYMEX-WTI futures price averaged approximately $40 per barrel,
compared to approximately $53 per barrel in the same period of 2015. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, the front-month NYMEX-WTI futures price ranged from a low of
approximately $26 per barrel to a high of approximately $51 per barrel.
On average, our production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately
761 MBoe, or approximately 4,181 Boe per day. In comparison, our total production volumes for
the six months ended June 30, 2015 were approximately 832 MBoe, or approximately 4,597 Boe
per day. The decrease in production volumes was primarily due to the shut-in of uneconomical
wells, the majority of which remained shut-in during the second quarter of 2016, and decreased
production due to natural declines of our assets.
Effects of Commodity Derivative Contracts. We utilize NYMEX-WTI derivative contracts to hedge
against changes in commodity prices. To the extent the future commodity prices decrease
between measurement periods, we will have gains on our commodity derivatives, net of deferred
premiums. To the extent future commodity prices increase between measurement periods, we
will have losses on our commodity derivatives contracts, including deferred premiums. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of approximately $7.5 million which was
composed of approximately $24.8 million non-cash loss on changes in fair value of our
commodity derivative contracts and approximately $17.3 million gain on net cash settlements of
our commodity derivative contracts. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a net
loss from our commodity derivative contracts of approximately $7.2 million, which was composed
of approximately $25.5 million non-cash loss on changes in fair value of our commodity
derivative contracts and approximately $18.3 million gain on net cash settlements of our
commodity derivative contracts ($11.1 million for the early termination of contracts and $7.2
million from settled commodity derivatives contracts). The non-cash loss on changes in fair value
of derivative contracts of approximately $25.5 million included an $11.1 million impact of the gain
from early termination of the contracts and a $3.6 million gain upon settlement in January 2015
for contracts that were not early terminated or modified, both of which were previously recognized
in the results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2014.
Lease Operating Expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, LOE were approximately
$11.8 million, or approximately $15.56 per Boe, compared to approximately $16.5 million, or
approximately $19.87 per Boe, for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in total
LOE and average cost per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2016 reflects the operational
decision to shut-in 184 uneconomic wells during first quarter 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the
majority of these wells remained shut-in for economic reasons.
Production Taxes. Production taxes are calculated as a percentage of our oil and natural gas
sales revenues and exclude the effects of our commodity derivative contracts. Production taxes
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were
28
approximately $1.3 million, or approximately $1.74 per Boe (effective tax rate of approximately
5.1%), compared to approximately $2.4 million, or approximately $2.92 per Boe (effective tax rate
of approximately 6.2%), for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in production
taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was attributable to lower oil and natural gas
revenues driven by lower prices and to an EOR Production Tax Exemption for one of our
Northeastern Oklahoma units. The EOR exemption will extend through March 2018. The
decrease in production tax per Boe and the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a
greater proportion of Permian production, which bears a lower state production tax rate, and the
EOR exemption in Northeastern Oklahoma.
Impairment Expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $0.9
million of non-cash impairment expense due to revisions in reserve estimates in one of our
Permian properties. There were no impairment charges for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenses. DD&A on producing properties for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, were approximately $11.9 million, or approximately $15.62 per
Boe, compared to approximately $16.0 million, or approximately $19.28 per Boe, for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in DD&A and DD&A per Boe were primarily due to
the asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 which reduced the carrying value of
our oil and natural gas properties.
General and Administrative Expenses. G&A were approximately $3.6 million or approximately
$4.69 per Boe for the for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to approximately $5.3
million, or approximately $6.34 per Boe, for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease
in G&A for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to lower equity-based
compensation costs resulting from lower price of our common units and fewer units issued. G&A
included non-cash equity-based compensation of approximately $0.7 million and approximately
$2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Interest Expense. Our interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
approximately $4.3 million, compared to approximately $3.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2016 is
due to a higher effective interest rate as a result of the higher pricing grip established during the
fall 2015 redetermination.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions, meet or
refinance our debt obligations and meet our collateral requirements will depend on our future
cash flows. Our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are
beyond our control, including weather, oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and
maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors. Our primary use of cash has been for debt reduction and
to fund capital spending.
Oil prices have fallen to thirteen-year lows during 2016, impacting the way we conduct business.
We have implemented a number of adjustments to strengthen our financial position. In January
2015, we restructured our commodity derivative contracts and subsequently increased our
revenue security for 2016 and 2017 by executing additional commodity derivative contracts in
November 2015 and April 2016 to provide greater oil price protection over a longer period of
time. Additionally, we indefinitely suspended our quarterly cash distributions beginning with the
third quarter of 2015. We are also aggressively pursuing cost reductions in order to improve
profitability and maximize cash flows. Our primary cost reduction initiatives encompass periodic
economic review of each well within our portfolio along with ongoing scrutiny of lease operating
expenses and general and administrative expenses.
Our liquidity position at June 30, 2016 consisted of approximately $4.0 million of available cash.
Our borrowing base is redetermined in or around April and October of each year. During May
2016, we finalized our spring 2016 redetermination and resulting amendment of the underlying
revolving credit facility. The new borrowing base was effective as of June 1, 2016 and was
comprised of a $110.0 million conforming tranche and a permitted overadvance of $53.0 million.
The permitted overadvance matures on November 1, 2016. In addition, the amendment (i)
required the Partnership to provide a monthly excess cash flow report; (ii) required the
Partnership to make varied minimum monthly principal payments totaling approximately $1.9
million through October 31, 2016; (iii) reduced the borrowing base to $105.0 million upon the
close of the previously announced Hugoton divestiture; (iv) allowed an additional non-scheduled
borrowing base redetermination between September 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 to be
requested by any lender; (v) increased the minimum collateral coverage from 90% to 95% of
proved reserves (and 100% of PDP reserves); (vi) required the Partnership to unwind and early
terminate existing hedges covering production from July 2016 through September 2016 and add
new at-the-market swap contracts to
29
replace these hedge terminations; and (vii) required the net proceeds from the previously
announced Hugoton sale and the early termination of hedge contracts to be applied to debt
reduction.
Based on our cash balance, forecasted cash flows from operating activities, the early
monetization of existing hedges and the closing of the previously announced Hugoton
divestiture, we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures budget, meet our debt
service requirements and fund our other commitments and obligations. Although we currently
expect our sources of cash to be sufficient to meet our near-term liquidity needs, there can be no
assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied given current oil prices and
the discretion of our lenders to decrease our borrowing base. Due to the volatility of commodity
prices, we may not be able to obtain funding in the equity or capital markets on terms we find
acceptable. The cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as
many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending
standards and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide any new funding.
Cash Flows
Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity was as follows:
Six Months Ended 
 June 30,
2016
 2015
(in thousands)
Operating activities$24,899  $18,778
Investing activities $(3,488 ) $(8,629 )
Financing activities$(18,007) $(12,592)
Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $24.9 million
and $18.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $6.1
million change from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the positive net impact of our
hedging activities, lower LOE due to the shut-in of uneconomic wells and lower production taxes,
offset by lower oil sales revenues resulting from lower oil prices and lower production in 2016.
Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $3.5 million and
approximately $8.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash
used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 included approximately
$3.5 million of capital expenditures for drilling and completion activities primarily in our Permian
and Northeastern Oklahoma core areas. Cash used in investing activities during the six months
ended June 30, 2015 included capital expenditures of approximately $8.6 million primarily for
drilling and completion activities in our Northeastern Oklahoma and Permian core areas.
Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $18.0 million and
$12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash used in
financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 included payments on our
revolving credit facility of approximately $18.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities during
the six months ended June 30, 2015 included net payments on our revolving credit facility of $5.0
million, cash distributions to unitholders of approximately $7.5 million and approximately $0.1
million of incremental offering costs.
Capital Requirements
Our business requires continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations in order to
increase and maintain our production and the size of our asset base. The primary purpose of
growth capital is to acquire and develop producing assets that allow us to increase our
production and asset base. Given the current commodity pricing situation, we have limited capital
spending to include only the most economically viable development projects. To date, we have
funded acquisition transactions through a combination of cash, available borrowing capacity
under our revolving credit facility and through the issuance of equity.
We currently expect capital spending for the remainder of 2016 for the development, growth and
maintenance of our oil and natural gas properties to be approximately $5.0 million. We will
consider adjustments to this capital program based on surplus operating cash flows in concert
with our evaluation of additional development opportunities that are identified during the year.
Revolving Credit Facility
At June 30, 2016 our borrowing base was $110.0 million, with a permitted overadvance of $52.0
million that matures November 1, 2016, and our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility
were approximately $162.0 million.
30
During May 2016, we finalized our spring 2016 redetermination and resulting amendment of the
underlying revolving credit facility. The new borrowing base was effective as of June 1, 2016 and
was comprised of a $110.0 million conforming tranche and a permitted overadvance of $53.0
million. The permitted overadvance matures on November 1, 2016. In addition, the amendment
(i) required the Partnership to provide a monthly excess cash flow report; (ii) required the
Partnership to make varied minimum monthly principal payments totaling approximately $1.9
million through October 31, 2016; (iii) reduced the borrowing base to $105.0 million upon the
close of the previously announced Hugoton divestiture; (iv) allowed an additional non-scheduled
borrowing base redetermination between September 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016 to be
requested by any lender; (v) increased the minimum collateral coverage from 90% to 95% of
proved reserves (and 100% of PDP reserves); (vi) required the Partnership to unwind and early
terminate existing hedges covering production from July 2016 through September 2016 and add
new at-the-market swap contracts to replace these hedge terminations; and (vii) required the net
proceeds from the previously announced Hugoton sale and the early termination of hedge
contracts to be applied to debt reduction.
See Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our revolving credit facility.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
Our risk management program is intended to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility
and to assist with stabilizing cash flows. Accordingly, we utilize commodity derivative contracts
(swaps, calls, puts and costless collars) to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity prices
and specific delivery points. The commodity derivative contracts that we have entered into
generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price or a floor for a portion of our expected
future oil production over a fixed period of time. We enter into commodity derivative contracts or
modify our portfolio of existing commodity derivative contracts when we believe market
conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so, or as required by our
lenders. At June 30, 2016, we had commodity derivative contracts covering approximately 81%
of the remainder of our 2016 average daily production and approximately 64% and 33%,
respectively, of our 2017 and 2018 average daily production (calculated based on the mid-point
of our production guidance released on August 1, 2016). At June 30, 2016, our open commodity
derivative contracts were in a net asset position with a fair value of approximately $3.0 million.
See Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our commodity derivative contracts.
Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we expect to materially impact our
financial statements. See Note 10 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk and
credit risk. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and
qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The disclosures are not
meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably
possible losses.
Commodity Price Risk
Our primary market risk exposure is the pricing we receive for our oil and natural gas sales.
Historically, energy prices have exhibited, and are generally expected to continue to exhibit,
some of the highest volatility levels observed within the commodity and financial markets. The
prices we receive for our oil and natural gas sales depend on many factors outside of our control,
such as the strength of the global economy and changes in supply and demand.
Our risk management program is intended to reduce exposure to commodity price volatility and to
assist with stabilizing cash flows. Accordingly, we utilize commodity derivatives contracts (swap,
calls, puts and costless collars) to manage a portion of our exposure to commodity prices and
specific delivery points. The commodity derivative contracts that we have entered into generally
have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil production
over a fixed period of time. We enter into commodity derivative contracts or modify our portfolio of
existing commodity derivative
31
contracts when we believe market conditions or other circumstances suggest that it is prudent to
do so, or as required by our lenders.
Our commodity derivative contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties. While we do not require the counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts
to post collateral, it is our policy to enter into commodity derivative contracts only with
counterparties that are major, creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as
competent and competitive market makers. We evaluate the credit standing of such
counterparties by reviewing their credit ratings. The counterparties to our commodity derivative
contracts currently in place are lenders under our revolving credit facility and have investment
grade ratings. We expect to enter into future commodity derivative contracts with these or other
lenders under our revolving credit facility whom we expect will also carry investment grade
ratings.
Our commodity price risk management activities are recorded at fair value and thus changes to
the future commodity prices could have the effect of reducing net income and the value of our
securities. The fair value of our oil commodity derivative contracts at June 30, 2016 was a net
asset of approximately $3.0 million. A 10% change in oil prices, with all other factors held
constant, would result in a change in the fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future
net cash flows from such instruments) of our oil commodity derivative contracts of approximately
$5.2 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for
additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts.
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. At June 30, 2016,
we had debt outstanding of $162.0 million, with an effective interest rate of 4.15%. Assuming no
change in the amount outstanding, the impact on interest expense of a 10% increase or decrease
in the average interest rate would be approximately $0.7 million on an annual basis. At June 30,
2016, our revolving credit facility allowed for borrowings up to $162.0 million bearing interest at a
floating rate based on, at our election: (i) the greater of the prime rate of the Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and the one month adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.0%, all of which are subject to a margin that
varies from 1.00% to 2.75% per annum according to the borrowing base usage (which is the ratio
of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit to the borrowing base then in effect), or (ii) the
applicable LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 2.00% to 3.75% per annum according to the
borrowing base usage. See Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility.
Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk
We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our revenues attributable to a small
number of customers for our current 2016 production. The inability or failure of any of our
customers to meet its obligations to us or its insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our
financial results. We monitor our exposure to these counterparties primarily by reviewing credit
ratings and payment history. As of June 30, 2016, our current purchasers had positive payment
histories.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision
and with the participation of our chief executive officer (principal executive officer) and chief
financial officer (principal financial officer), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
June 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we filed under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
In the course of our ongoing preparations for making management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, from time
to time we have identified areas in need of improvement
32
and have taken remedial actions to strengthen the affected controls as appropriate. We make
these and other changes to enhance the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting, which do not have a material effect on our overall internal control over financial
reporting.

against us, or contemplated to be brought against us, under the various environmental protection
statutes to which we are subject.
