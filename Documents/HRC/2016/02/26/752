<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/2, 
in which the Council invited the Secretary-General to submit an annual report to the 
Council on alleged reprisals for cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights. Since the adoption of that resolution, I have 
reported on the latest developments within the United Nations system in relation to acts of 
intimidation and reprisal by States and non-State actors vis-&#224;-vis individuals and groups for 
their cooperation with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, and alleged cases that 
cover a wide range of violations, from threats, travel bans and arbitrary detention to torture 
and, sadly, death. I have repeatedly stated that such acts are unacceptable and undermine 
the functioning of the United Nations as a whole, including that of its human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>2. I welcome General Assembly resolution 68/181 of 18 December 2013 on promotion 
of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms: protecting women human rights defenders, in which the Assembly called upon 
States to refrain from, and ensure adequate protection against, any act of intimidation or 
reprisal against women human rights defenders who cooperate, have cooperated or seek to 
cooperate with international institutions and reaffirmed the right of everyone to unhindered 
access to, and communication with, international bodies, in particular the United Nations 
and its human rights mechanisms.<footnote name="1">6 
 CED/C/3, paras. 25&#8211;<footnote name="2">4 
 A/HRC/27/72, case CHN 6/2014. </footnote>6. </footnote> I also welcome General Assembly resolution 68/268 of 
9 April 2014on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights 
treaty body system, in which the Assembly condemned all acts of intimidation and reprisals 
against individuals and groups for their contribution to the work of the human rights treaty 
bodies and urged States to take appropriate action.2  
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 24/24 of 27 September 2013 on cooperation with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, the Human Rights 
Council urged States to take preventive steps against reprisals, ensure accountability once 
they had occurred and encouraged States to establish national focal points. It also requested 
me to designate a United Nations-wide senior focal point on reprisals.<footnote name="3">7

and action on Council resolution 24/24 was deferred by the General Assembly to allow 
time for further consultations, with the Assembly deciding to conclude its consideration of 
the resolution before the end of its sixty-eighth session.4 On 19 March 2014, at the twenty-
fifth session of the Human Rights Council, Botswana made a statement on behalf of 54 
countries, stressing the need to address reprisals and expressing the hope that Council 
resolution 24/24 would be followed through at the General Assembly.<footnote name="5">4
 A/HRC/27/72, case VNM 7/2014. </footnote> The Council 
adopted other resolutions addressing the issue of reprisals, including resolution 24/7 on 
arbitrary detention6 and resolution 24/21 on civil society space: creating and maintaining, in 
law and in practice, a safe and enabling environment. 
</p>
<p>4. On several occasions during the reporting period, I expressed grave concern about 
reprisals, including during the high-level segment of the Human Rights Council on 3 March

<p>2014 and during a panel discussion on the protection of civil society on 11 March 2014. At 
the latter event, the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights and I stressed the fact 
that civil society is an indispensable partner of the United Nations and indicated that civil 
society actors must be able to do their work freely, independently and safe from fear, 
retaliation or intimidation. In his concluding remarks at the end of the twenty-fifth session, 
the President of the Human Rights Council condemned reprisals and acts of intimidation, 
emphasizing that all measures must be taken to prevent such unacceptable acts.<footnote name="7">9
 A/HRC/25/60/Add.2. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>5. During the High-Level Event on Supporting Civil Society, on 23 September 2013, 
the Deputy Secretary-General, on my behalf, expressed concern at the growing pressures 
and restrictions facing civil society in many countries, including through the introduction of 
new legislation.8 I wish to reiterate the concerns raised in last year&#8217;s report that new laws 
and regulations have made the receipt of funds from abroad, including from the United 
Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and the United Nations Voluntary Fund on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery, more difficult for some non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs).9 Such difficulties persisted in the period covered by the present report in at least 
four countries. In some cases, restrictive regulations may prevent civil society 
representatives accessing United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>6. During the 2013 annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders, the Chair of 
its Coordination Committee reported that several special procedures had raised the subject 
of reprisals during their interactive dialogues with the Human Rights Council and that he 
had discussed the issue with several stakeholders, asking them to maintain a strong stance 
on reprisals.10 On 10 December 2013, in a joint statement, special procedures mandate 
holders expressed serious concern at acts of reprisal against anyone cooperating with them 
and stated that they were looking forward to the designation of the focal point on 
reprisals.11 The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders indicated in 
her latest report to the Council that during her tenure she had sent out approximately 50 
communications on cases of reprisals.12 In November 2013, the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearances and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances issued 
a joint statement making clear that they were vigilant with respect to any form of 
intimidation and reprisals and welcoming the decision of the Council to request the 
Secretary-General to designate a United Nations-wide senior focal point.13 
</p>
<p>7. On 16 December 2013, the Committee against Torture set out a procedure for 
reacting to alleged reprisals on the basis of article 13 of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.14 At its fifth session, in 
November 2013, the Committee on Enforced Disappearances appointed a rapporteur on 
reprisals15 and issued a document on the relationship of the Committee with civil society 
actors, which refers to reprisals.16  
</p>
<p>8. The Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations considers applications for 
consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. At its resumed session, in May 
2014, the Committee had before it 343 applications for consultative status, including

<p>applications deferred from earlier sessions. The Committee recommended 158 NGOs for 
consultative status, deferred consideration of the applications of 153 others until its regular 
session in 2015, closed consideration of 29 applications without prejudice and took note of 
the withdrawal of the applications of two NGOs.17 Consultative status confers access to the 
United Nations and many of its mechanisms and several stakeholders have raised concerns 
about the large number of deferrals and perceived lack of transparency in decisions on 
consultative status. I note how important it is that the Committee applies the criteria for 
assessing NGOs in a transparent and fair manner. 
</p>
<p>9. I reiterate my view that a consistent approach by all regional and international 
human rights bodies vis-&#224;-vis reprisals and intimidation is essential. In this context, I 
welcome the adoption of resolution 273 by the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights at its fifty-fifth session, held from 28 April to 12 May 2014, in which it 
decided to extend the scope of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
defenders in Africa to include issues relating to reprisals against human rights defenders 
cooperating with the African human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Information received on cases of reprisal for cooperation 
with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms 
in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Methodological framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 12/2, the present report 
contains information regarding acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Seek to cooperate, or have cooperated with, the United Nations, its representatives 
and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who have provided testimony or 
information to them 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avail or have availed themselves of procedures established under the auspices of the 
United Nations for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and all 
those who have provided legal or other<b> </b>assistance to them for that purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Submit or have submitted communications under procedures established by human 
rights instruments, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them 
for that purpose<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Are relatives of victims of human rights violations or of those who have provided 
legal or other assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>11. The present report covers the period from 16 June 2013 to 31 May 2014. The 
information received has been verified with the primary sources and corroborated by other 
sources. In most cases, reference is made to the public United Nations documentation in 
which the information included in the present report was first published. Follow-up 
information, including relevant correspondence, is included on those cases in which victims 
of intimidation or reprisals for cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights were mentioned in my previous two reports.  
</p>
<p>12. It should be stressed that the cases included in the present report are only the tip of 
the iceberg. In line with the principle of do no harm, some cases have not been included 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>because of concern that the alleged victims might be subjected to further acts of 
harassment, intimidation or reprisal if their complaints were published. 
</p>
<p>13. Information has been received about acts of intimidation and reprisals following 
cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), including its field presences, the Human Rights Council, special procedures, 
human rights treaty bodies, the universal periodic review mechanism, the Commission of 
Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the Independent 
International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and human rights 
components of United Nations peace missions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Summary of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>14. On 28 June 2013, three special rapporteurs raised allegations of acts of intimidation 
and reprisals against Yahia Bounouar, an independent journalist and President of the 
Algerian Observatory for Human Rights, for documenting and submitting information on 
human rights violations against human rights defenders, bloggers and trade unionists to 
several special procedures.18 On 23 May 2013, following his coverage of the In Amenas 
hostage crisis, Mr. Bounouar, who had been under surveillance since the establishment of 
the Observatory in July 2012, was reportedly detained for several hours by State security 
officials at Constantine airport without being informed of the reason. At the time of 
finalization of the present report, no reply had been received from the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Cameroon 
</b></p>
<p>15. Several members of the Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association 
were allegedly subjected to reprisals following the submission of their report to the United 
Nations in relation to the second universal periodic review of Cameroon.19 On 1 July 2012, 
an assassination attempt against Mr. Jeidoh Duni, legal representative of the Association, 
was reported. After they had acted as witnesses in the investigation of that incident, 
Mr. Duni and five other members of the Association, Adamou Isa, Sali Haman, Dahiru 
Beloumi, Njawga Duni and Musa Usman Ndamba, were summoned to appear before the 
military tribunal of Bafoussam on 23 April 2013, for illegal possession of firearms. On 10 
May 2013, Mr. Ndamba, Vice-President of the Association, appeared before the Court of 
First Instance in Bamenda on the charge of spreading false information. His trial was first 
adjourned to 27 May 2013, then to 19 August 2013. At the time of finalization of the 
present report, no reply had been received from the Government to the joint communication 
sent on 4 September 2013 by five special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>16. Reports were received by special procedures of the murder of a human rights 
defender and a journalist, and intimidation and reprisals against several others defending 
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, in relation to their 
participation in the second universal periodic review of Cameroon. On 5 July 2013, the 
Director of the Cameroonian Foundation for AIDS, who had contributed to the report of 
Human Rights Watch that had addressed recommendations to the second review of 
Cameroon, was found dead at his home in Yaound&#233;. Although the police opened an 
investigation, no crime scene investigation or autopsy had reportedly been carried out. 
Subsequently, three colleagues of the deceased were detained in relation to the 
investigation. In the month preceding the murder, a series of burglaries and arson attacks

<p>had been reported on buildings of persons and organizations working with the Foundation 
on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights, including Alternatives-
Cameroun.20 At the time of finalization of the present report, no reply had been received 
from the Government to the joint communication sent on 13 August 2013 by a group of 
special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. China 
</b></p>
<p>17. From mid-July 2013 onward, four joint urgent appeals were sent and two press 
releases issued by several United Nations human rights experts regarding Cao Shunli, a 
prominent Chinese human rights lawyer who had been campaigning for transparency and 
greater participation of civil society in the universal periodic review of China.21 Since 
December 2008, a group of human rights activists, including Ms. Cao, Chen Jianfang and 
Peng Lanlan, had been requesting the Chinese authorities to allow their participation in the 
preparation of the national report of China for its first and later its second universal periodic 
review. Ms. Peng was detained in August 2012 and charged with obstructing official 
business on 8 June 2013. On 18 June 2013, approximately 150 activists demanding civil 
society participation in the review process started a sit-in outside the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. On 1 July 2013, the police detained many of the protestors. On 14 September 2013, 
while boarding a flight to Geneva to attend a training session on United Nations human 
rights mechanisms, Ms. Cao was reportedly stopped and transferred to an unknown location 
by security agents. A number of other human rights activists and lawyers from several 
Chinese cities were reportedly interrogated and warned in connection with the training 
programme. They included Ms. Chen, who was stopped from boarding a flight to Geneva at 
Baiyun International Airport.  
</p>
<p>18. On 21 October 2013, five weeks after she was first taken into custody and one day 
before the consideration of China by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
the authorities confirmed that Ms. Cao had been detained at Chaoyang District Detention 
Centre. Ms. Cao&#8217;s health deteriorated progressively. Medication for her liver condition was 
reportedly taken away and a medical examination, conducted at the request of her lawyer 
on 18 November 2013, confirmed that she had tuberculosis in her lungs, liver effusion and 
uterine myomas and cysts. Her lawyer applied for medical parole several times, which was 
reportedly orally denied by officials of the detention centre. Ms. Cao died on 14 March 
2014.22 At the time of finalization of the present report, the Government of China had 
replied to three communications, sent on 23 September 2013, 7 January 2014 and 
24 January 2014 respectively, indicating that careful investigations into those cases had 
shown that the information contained in the communications was not consistent with the 
facts.23  
</p>
<p>19. On 5 May 2014, several special procedures mandate holders raised the case of Ge 
Zhihui.24 In early 2014, Ms. Ge, a petitioner assisting other petitioners in seeking justice for 
the demolition of their homes, participated in a training course outside China on United 
Nations human rights mechanisms. After her return, on 1 March 2014, Ms. Ge was arrested 
at her home in Beijing by agents of the Fengtai District Public Security Bureau, detained at 
Fengtai District Detention Centre and allegedly subjected to ill-treatment and torture, which 
led to her being hospitalized on two occasions. Although she had been charged with, inter 
alia, creating a disturbance, the interrogations in detention reportedly focused on Ms. Ge&#8217;s

finalization of the present report, no reply had been received from the Government to the 
joint communication sent. 
20. On 18 March 2014, Ti-Anna Wang, the daughter of Wang Bingzhang, founder of 
the overseas Chinese Democratic Movement and imprisoned since July 2002, testified 
under agenda item 4 of the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council on the 
situation of human rights in China in general, and on the detention of her father specifically. 
The following day, prior to the scheduled adoption of the second universal periodic review 
report of China, an individual wearing a badge of the China Association for Preservation 
and Development of Tibetan Culture took photographs of Ms. Wang, her computer screen 
and belongings. United Nations security officers escorted the individual from the room 
where the Council session was taking place. The individual&#8217;s ground pass was subsequently 
withheld for the rest of the session.25 At the time of finalization of the present report, no 
reply had been received from the Government to a joint communication sent by several 
special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the fifty-fifth session of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, Laritza Diversent and Yaremis Flores, two representatives of the NGO 
Cubalex, were reportedly subjected to harassment, intimidation and reprisals. As they 
arrived at Geneva airport on 7 July 2013, an individual, later identified as a staff member of 
the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Cuba to the United Nations Office at Geneva and 
other international organizations in Switzerland, took pictures of them without permission, 
telling them that he knew who they were. The following day, during a private NGO 
briefing, members of NGOs allegedly linked to the Government of Cuba harassed and 
insulted Ms. Diversent and Mr. Flores. The same individual who had photographed them at 
the airport took pictures of them during the Committee&#8217;s informal public NGO briefing, 
saying, among other things, &#8220;I know what they are doing&#8221;. The Chair of the Committee and 
four special rapporteurs drew attention to those events in separate letters,26 to which the 
Government of Cuba replied on 29 July 2013 and 19 August 2013 respectively. In its reply 
to the special rapporteurs, the Government provided detailed information on the case and 
rejected the allegations.27 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>22. The work of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was hampered as a result of fear of reprisals against anyone 
cooperating with the Commission, or their relatives still residing in the country. The fear of 
reprisals was experienced by alleged victims, experts on the situation in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, aid workers, journalists and diplomats. As a result, the 
Commission heard publicly only from alleged victims and witnesses who had no close 
family left in the country and were otherwise deemed not to be at too high a risk.28 The 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, via its official news agency, described the 
testimonies before the Commission as &#8220;slander&#8221; against the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea, put forward by &#8220;human scum&#8221;.29

<p><b> 6. Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>23. On 24 December 2013, several special procedures mandate holders raised 
allegations of intimidation and reprisals by Egyptian State security forces against 
representatives of the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, in the form of a 
raid and arrests, for their cooperation with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the universal periodic review of Egypt.<footnote name="3">3
 A/HRC/25/74, case ISR 7/2013. </footnote>0 On 18 December 2013, around 
midnight, more than 60 police officers and security agents reportedly raided the offices of 
the Centre, holding staff at gunpoint. After damaging equipment and confiscating several 
laptops, officers arrested and blindfolded Mostafa Eissa, Head of the Documentaries Unit, 
Mahmoud Bilal, a lawyer at the Centre, Mohamed Adel, a volunteer, and three other staff 
members. The following morning, all of them, except Mr. Adel, were released and their 
property returned to them. It is alleged that during their detention, the men were blindfolded

disappeared in the context of a joint operation by the military and police known as &#8220;Okoa 
Maisha&#8221; against the Sabaot Land Defence Force in March and April 2008, in the Mount 
Elgon District of Kenya, to report to the police station. The police allegedly questioned the 
families about their engagement with United Nations human rights mechanisms in Geneva, 
and compelled them to sign written statements, the contents of which they were not allowed 
to read. On 5 July 2013, a local NGO issued a press release calling for investigations into 
the reported harassment and for protection of the families. Subsequently, several members 
of the NGO were subjected to harassment by and threats from the police. Some of the 
military personnel who were allegedly responsible for the disappearances were reported to 
have been redeployed to the area, causing families of victims to feel intimidated. Following 
those events, at least 28 families reportedly left their houses for fear of reprisals.34 At the

allegedly distributed 70,000 leaflets on the &#8220;masterminds&#8221; behind COMANGO which 
included their images, and announced that it would launch a nationwide campaign against 
them. On 20 November 2013, the Minister for Islamic Affairs stated in an opening speech 
at the Forum on Universal Fundamental Rights that human rights as espoused by the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights might cause discordance in the society. On 8 
January 2014, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a press statement declaring COMANGO 
illegal. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, through her

communication sent by special procedures was received on 20 November 2013, in which 
the Government indicated that the allegations were highly inaccurate and misleading.74 In 
opinion No. 60/2013, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found the detention of 61 
individuals of UAE 94 arbitrary and called for their release.75 Reportedly, following 
beatings by prison guards of Mohamed al-Mansoori, one of the UAE 94, 18 of the 69 
individuals went on hunger strike between August 2013 and October 2013 to protest about 
their conditions of detention.76

<p><b> 6. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b>46. Concern has been raised in my previous reports at the situation of Judge Maria 
Lourdes Afiuni.77 In its latest report, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention expressed 
concern at the continued detention under house arrest of Judge Afiuni, who was arrested in 
2009 for ordering the conditional release of Eligio Cede&#241;o, after the Working Group had 
declared his detention arbitrary in opinion No. 10/2009.78 The Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in his report on 
observations and communications transmitted to Governments and replies received, stated 
that no investigation into the reports of torture of Judge Afiuni had taken place, and 
reiterated that the Government must ensure the investigation and prosecution of the alleged 
perpetrators.79

<p><b>representatives. I remain deeply concerned about those acts, which range from 
threats, harassment, smear campaigns, fines, travel bans, the forced closure of 
organizations, arbitrary arrests, prosecution and lengthy prison sentences to torture 
and, sadly, death. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>I reiterate my firm position that any act of intimidation or reprisal against 
individuals or groups, or anyone linked to them, for cooperating with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights is 
unacceptable and must be stopped. We must collectively denounce reprisals, defend 
the right to cooperate freely with the United Nations and protect those targeted. I 
recall my speech at the Human Rights Council panel on the protection of civil society 
space: &#8220;the space for civil society is a reflection of an entire society&#8217;s respect for 
human rights within its own borders and indeed around the globe&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>I welcome steps taken to address cases of reprisal in a coherent and systematic 
manner at the national, regional and international levels, including through the 
adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 24/24. In that resolution, the Council 
reaffirmed the right of everyone to unhindered access to, and communication with, 
international bodies, and requested that a United Nations-wide senior focal point on 
issues related to reprisals be designated to engage with all stakeholders and encourage 
a prompt, effective and unified response. I echo the High Commissioner&#8217;s statement at 
the opening of the twenty-fifth session of the Council and commend the fact that the 
Council adopted a forward-looking resolution on reprisals and ask for your support to 
ensure that it is followed through at the General Assembly.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>It is primarily the obligation of States to protect those who cooperate with the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights and to 
ensure that they may do so safely and without hindrance. I call on States to take 
action at the national level: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To prevent and refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against 
individuals and groups who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To take all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of 
intimidation or reprisals, including, where necessary, by adopting and implementing 
specific legislation and policies, and by issuing appropriate guidance to national 
authorities in order to protect effectively those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or 
have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the 
field of human rights from any act of intimidation or reprisal; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure accountability for any acts of intimidation or reprisal against 
those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights by ensuring impartial, 
prompt and thorough investigations of any alleged acts of intimidation or reprisal in 
order to bring the perpetrators to justice; provide access to effective remedies for 
victims in accordance with the international human rights obligations and 
commitments of States; and prevent any recurrence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To consider the establishment of a national focal point to address acts of 
intimidation and reprisal against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate, 
cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To provide information, as appropriate, to the Human Rights Council on 
all measures taken to prevent and address acts of intimidation or reprisal against 
those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its </b></p>


<p><b>representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, including on cases 
mentioned in the present report. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The United Nations Secretariat stands ready to provide technical support to 
efforts by Member States to implement the aforementioned recommendations, in 
particular recommendation 50 (d).  
</b>52. <b>I also call on all parts of the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To seek and facilitate engagement with all stakeholders, in particular 
States and civil society, in relation to acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who 
seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To provide a coordinated and consistent response to all cases of 
intimidation and reprisal brought to the attention of the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>I encourage all stakeholders, including international and regional 
organizations, Member States, national human rights institutions, civil society and 
academic institutions, to continue to contribute to the future consideration of this 
issue by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations as a whole.
