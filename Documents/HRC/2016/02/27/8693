<p><b>  Report of the Secretary-General 
</b></p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
12/22, in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Council, at its 
fifteenth session, an analytical report on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. On 8 January 2010, the Secretary-General sent a note verbale to Member States 
seeking their views and information. As at 12 March 2010, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights had received responses, summarized below, from 
the Governments of Argentina, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Jamaica, 
Serbia, Slovakia and the Russian Federation. Responses received from the Governments of 
Algeria and Qatar for the twelfth session of the Human Rights Council on the same item 
and which were not included due to their late submission are also included. The full text of 
the submissions is available from the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Algeria 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: French] 
 [3 July 2009] 
</p>
<p>3. The Government of Algeria stated that unilateral coercive measures were contrary to 
international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and the 
norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States. It further indicated that the 
adoption of unilateral coercive measures constituted a violation of human rights, in 
particular of the right to dignified life and the right to development, and a violation of the 
sovereignty of other States. 
</p>
<p>4. The Government underlined that economic, social and cultural rights of populations 
guaranteed under the International Covenants were violated by unilateral coercive measures 
with a negative impact on well-being, development and international cooperation. It also 
pointed out that unilateral coercive measures created obstacles to free trade relations among 
sovereign States and, as a result, impeded full enjoyment of all human rights, as reiterated 
at the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993. 
</p>
<p>5. The Government affirmed that Algeria respected the principles of international law 
and subscribed to the Charter of the United Nations, declarations and relevant resolutions 
adopted by the United Nations, and in particular to the Human Rights Council resolutions 
on human rights and unilateral coercive measures. It also indicated that with respect to the 
sovereignty, equality and non-interference in domestic affairs of other States, the right of all 
peoples to self-determination and their free choice of their political, economic, and cultural 
system constituted the core principles of the foreign policy of Algeria. 
</p>
<p>6. The Government was of the view that unilateral coercive measures were not 
favorable to peaceful and friendly international relations or to guaranteeing to peoples their 
inalienable right to development. The extraterritorial application of national laws disturbed 
international peace and security. The Government also requested the Secretary-General to 
give special attention to the implementation of the resolutions of the Human Rights Council 
on this issue in the light of the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and inter-
relatedness of human rights, including the right to development. </p>


<p><b>  Argentina 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [21 January 2010] 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to support for Human Rights Council resolution 12/22 under its 
domestic law, the Government of Argentina drew attention to Act 24.871 of 1997. 
According to the Government, under that Act, foreign legislation that seeks, directly or 
indirectly, to restrict or impede free trade or the free movement of capital, goods or persons 
to the detriment of a particular country or group of countries shall not be applicable or 
entail any legal effects in Argentine territory. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government also pointed out that according to article 1 of the above-mentioned 
Act, foreign legislation designed to produce extraterritorial legal effects through the 
imposition of an economic blockade or limits on investment in a given country, with a view 
to bringing about a change in the Government of the country or to undermine its right to 
self-determination, shall also be absolutely inapplicable and devoid of legal effect. 
</p>
<p><b>  Belarus 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [1 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>9. The Government stated that Belarus consistently rejected the practice of unilateral 
coercive measures and considered them as a tool for political coercion of sovereign States, 
which impeded the realization by their people of the economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government noted that unilateral coercive measures contradicted international 
law, the Charter of the United Nations as well as the norms and principles governing 
peaceful relations among States. 
</p>
<p>11. The Government indicated that it was necessary to consider establishing effective 
mechanisms to monitor the usage of unilateral coercive measures, including their negative 
impact and consequences for the State concerned. Such monitoring mechanisms could be 
established in the framework of the Human Rights Council or treaty-based bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>  Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: French] 
 [24 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>12. The Government of Burkina Faso pointed out that, despite the resolutions adopted 
on this issue by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on 
Human Rights and at United Nations conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year 
reviews, and contrary to norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, 
unilateral coercive measures continued to be promulgated, implemented and enforced by, 
inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with all their negative implications for social-
humanitarian activities and the economic and social development of developing countries. 
</p>
<p>13. In that context, the Government of Burkina Faso confirmed its support for the 
resolutions and acts that prohibit those measures, notably General Assembly resolution 
61/170, Human Rights Council resolution 6/7, the final document of the fourteenth Summit 
Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, the 
recommendations of the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in June 1993, 
and more recently, Human Rights Council resolution 12/22. </p>


<p>14. The Government highlighted that Burkina Faso had adhered to almost all of the 
agreements concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union. It 
considered that international organizations were the appropriate framework for the culture 
and the promotion of peace through an ultimate expression of international solidarity. The 
Government was of the view that the mechanisms established by certain organizations, 
including the Security Council of the United Nations and the African Union, were the only 
authorities which could decide on these issues. Accordingly, any coercive measure adopted 
unilaterally by one State against another, whatever the purpose, was contrary to 
international law, and as such should be prohibited. The Government of Burkina Faso 
stated that States must therefore conform to the norms and principles governing the 
peaceful settlement of disputes. For this reason, Burkina Faso had been actively involved in 
the settlements of disputes in Africa, particularly in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Guinea and Togo. 
</p>
<p><b>  Costa Rica 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [9 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>15. The Government indicated that Costa Rica, as a member of the World Trade 
Organization, respected and fulfilled the principles that govern the World Trade 
Organization, including the rejection of unilateral coercive economic measures. The 
Government further mentioned that, as a State Member of the United Nations, it respected 
international law, favoured the freedom of international trade and would endorse a 
limitation to such freedom only if it were imposed in accordance with international law and 
within the framework of the United Nations or the World Trade Organization.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [10 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>16. The Government of Guatemala expressed its view that it had complied with Human 
Rights Council resolution 12/22 and as such it had not adopted unilateral coercive measures 
that would be contrary to international human rights law and the Charter of the United 
Nations, and to the principles of a State that was taking action to strengthen its democracy 
and respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Jamaica 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [10 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>17. The Government of Jamaica remained opposed to the adoption of unilateral coercive 
measures as they impeded the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. It noted that 
in addition to being contrary to the principles of international law, unilateral coercive 
measures also contravened the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in the internal 
affairs of States and peaceful coexistence.  
</p>
<p>18. In that context, the Government confirmed that it had not promulgated any law, 
legislation or measure, or taken any other action that would infringe on the sovereignty of a 
State or its lawful national interests. </p>


<p><b>  Qatar 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Arabic] 
 [8 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>19. The Government of Qatar reaffirmed that unilateral coercive measures were contrary 
to international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and 
the norms and principles governing relations among States and constituted gross violations 
of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, the right to a decent life 
and the right to development.  
</p>
<p>20. The Government indicated that Qatar had adopted numerous measures designed to 
highlight the risk that unilateral coercive measures posed on society as a whole. In the 
legislative area, the Government underlined that the Constitution of the State of Qatar 
stipulates that the country&#8217;s foreign policy is based on the principle of consolidation of 
international peace and security through encouragement of the peaceful settlement of 
international disputes, support for the right of peoples to self-determination, non-
intervention in the internal affairs of States and cooperation with peace-loving nations. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government also reaffirmed the need to give precedence to dialogue and to 
have recourse in all cases to international law for the settlement of disputes or 
disagreements at both the regional and international levels. The Government highlighted 
that in accordance with its belief in these principles, it had offered its services as a mediator 
in the settlement of international disputes and disagreements, such as in the Lebanese crisis, 
the dispute between the Sudan and Chad and the current negotiations to address the Darfur 
issue. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government highlighted its efforts to sensitize the international community to 
the risks that such measures posed for human rights, development and free trade, including 
through numerous international conferences and seminars on the subject as well as by 
convening the annual Doha Forum on Democracy, Development and Free Trade since 
</p><p>2001. It also hosted the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development 
to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus in December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>  Serbia 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [3 March 2010] 
</p>
<p>23. The Government of Serbia confirmed that in accordance with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights treaties it had ratified, 
Serbia did not undertake any legal, administrative and economic coercive measures against 
any State Member of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Slovakia 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [4 February 2010] 
</p>
<p>24. The Government of Slovakia stated that it &#8220;supports necessary and inevitable 
unilateral coercive measures which do not contradict international law or international 
human rights standards&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>  Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Russian] 
 [12 February 2010] 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of the Russian Federation expressed its strong opposition to the 
application of unilateral coercive measures. The Government considered that the 
application of unilateral coercive measures destabilized international relations, provoked 
and deepened intergovernmental tensions, threatened the security of other States, increased 
strains in inter-civilization relations and violated human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
It pointed out that the application of the coercive measures in violation of the Charter of the 
United Nations and the resolutions of the Security Council would not eradicate socio-
economic, interethnic and other tensions that formed the basis of conflicts. According to the 
Government, such measures undermined the foundation of international law and led to the 
extension of conflicts. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government stated that it would continue advocating for a multilateral approach 
in international affairs. It further noted that such an approach could be based upon 
acknowledgment by the international community of the principles of indivisibility of 
security and of diversity in today&#8217;s world. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Analysis 
</b></p>
<p>27. As summarized above, 11 States submitted their views on human rights and 
unilateral coercive measures. Most States responded with reference to the requirements of 
international law. Most also reconfirmed their adherence to Human Rights Council 
resolution 12/22 and other international standards relevant to unilateral coercive measures, 
including through their national legislation and foreign policy. Some States expressed the 
view that under some circumstances, some unilateral coercive measures might be 
acceptable, provided that they comply with international law. A few States stressed the 
importance of solving international disputes through regional and international 
mechanisms. One State suggested the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the 
application of unilateral coercive measures within the framework of the Human Rights 
Council or the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies.
