<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
provides an overview of the activities of the mandate since the submission of the previous 
report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/22/51). 
 In his observations, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the need to tackle 
manifestations of collective religious hatred. The question of how States and other 
stakeholders can appropriately tackle manifestations of collective religious hatred has 
become more and more pressing in recent years. In the present report, the Special 
Rapporteur focuses on the root causes of religious hatred and aggravating political factors 
in order to better understand this disquieting phenomenon and develop effective prevention 
and coping strategies. Above all he recommends trust-building activities, both at the level 
of establishing trustworthy public institutions and in the broad area of promoting 
meaningful communication, in particular between different religious or belief communities. 
Such activities should always be systematically based on respect for freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief, as enshrined in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
other international instruments. Moreover, the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence (A/HRC/22/17/Add.4, annex, appendix), which was launched by the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in February 2013, provides a 
nuanced and practical framework for effective efforts in this area, which should be 
employed by all relevant stakeholders in a coordinated manner.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief was created 
by the Commission on Human Rights pursuant to its resolution 1986/20 and renewed by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolutions 6/37, 14/1 and 22/20. The Council appointed 
Heiner Bielefeldt as the mandate holder as from 1 August 2010; in 2013, Mr. Bielefeldt&#8217;s 
appointment as Special Rapporteur was renewed for a further three-year term  
</p>
<p>2. In chapter II, the Special Rapporteur provides a brief overview of his activities since 
the submission of his previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/22/51). The 
Special Rapporteur focuses in chapter III on the need to tackle manifestations of collective 
religious hatred. In chapter IV, he provides conclusions in this regard and addresses 
recommendations to various stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>3. The Special Rapporteur has conducted various activities pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolutions 6/37, 14/11 and 22/20. In this chapter, he presents a brief overview of 
his mandate activities from 1 December 2012 to 30 November 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur undertook two country visits during the reporting period: to 
Sierra Leone, from 30 June to 5 July 2013, and to Jordan, from 2 to 12 September 2013.1 
He expresses his appreciation to all interlocutors and to the Government officials of Jordan 
and Sierra Leone for the excellent cooperation they extended to him during his visits.  
</p>
<p>5. Additional country visits are currently being scheduled. This includes an agreed visit 
to Kazakhstan during the first quarter of 2014 and an agreed visit to Viet Nam later in 2014. 
Updated information about the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visits and related requests is available 
on the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR).2 
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur deals with individual cases or issues of concern brought to 
his attention. He seeks to clarify allegations of certain actions possibly incompatible with 
the provisions of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and 
of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief by sending allegation letters and urgent 
appeals to States. Since the creation of the mandate, the Special Rapporteurs have sent 
more than 1,290 allegation letters and urgent appeals to a total of 130 States. The 
communications sent by the Special Rapporteur between 1 December 2012 and 30 
November 2013 are included in the latest communications reports (A/HRC/23/51, 
A/HRC/24/21 and A/HRC/25/74).

<p><b> C. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 12 and 13 December 2012, the Special Rapporteur attended the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Dialogue on Protection 
Challenges, entitled &#8220;Faith and Protection&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. During the session of the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against 
women in law and in practice, held on 17 and 18 January 2013, a preliminary discussion 
was held with the Special Rapporteur on the issue of gender equality and freedom of 
religion and belief. 
</p>
<p>9. On 21 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur took part in the high-level event, held 
in Geneva, to launch the Rabat Plan of Action. On 22 February, he also participated in the 
seminar on &#8220;Preventing incitement to atrocity crimes: policy options for action&#8221; organized 
by the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide. 
</p>
<p>10. On 27 and 28 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur attended the fifth Global 
Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, held in Vienna, which focused on 
the theme &#8220;Responsible leadership in diversity and dialogue&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. From 4 to 8 March 2013, the Special Rapporteur attended the twenty-second session 
of the Human Rights Council. During that week, he also participated in several events 
organized by various civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur held many meetings with Government representatives, 
religious or belief communities, civil society organizations and academic experts working 
in the area of freedom of religion or belief. In this context, he participated in national and 
international conferences and workshops, including in Berlin, Colombo, F&#232;s, Geneva, 
Helsinki, London, Lusaka, Luxembourg, Oslo, Oxford, Rabat, Richmond (Virginia), 
Salzburg, Stockholm, Tbilisi, Uppsala, Vienna and Yerevan. In addition, he held video 
conferences with stakeholders across different continents. 
</p>
<p>13. On 12 September 2013, the Special Rapporteur participated in the first interreligious 
round table held in Cyprus, organized by the Office of the Religious Track of the Cyprus 
Peace Process, under the auspices of the Embassy of Sweden, and in cooperation with 
OHCHR.3  
</p>
<p>14. On 29 October 2013, the Special Rapporteur presented his interim report to the 
General Assembly (A/68/290) at its sixty-eighth session; the report focused on the interplay 
between freedom of religion or belief and equality between women and men. During that 
week, he also participated in several initiatives organized by civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>15. On 27 November 2013, the Special Rapporteur participated in the sixth session of 
the Forum on Minority Issues, held in Geneva, as well as in a number of related side events. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Tackling manifestations of collective religious hatred 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks 
</b></p>
<p>16. Manifestations of collective hatred poison relationships between communities, 
threaten individuals and groups and are a source of innumerable human rights violations 
perpetrated by State agencies and/or non-State actors. The various forms of collective 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See paragraph 44 for further information regarding this round table. </p>


<p>hatred also include religious hatred. While a generally agreed definition of this 
phenomenon does not exist, the Special Rapporteur understands by &#8220;collective religious 
hatred&#8221; any joint manifestations of intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity 
and animosity towards a specific target group or individual4 that are proclaimed in the name 
of a particular religion or belief. Such manifestations may be made with the intention of 
defending certain religious or belief-related truth claims, practices, norms or identities 
against perceived or imagined threats.5 While frequently targeting believers of a competing 
persuasion, or non-believers, religiously motivated hatred may also affect internal critics, 
dissidents, &#8220;heretics&#8221;, or converts from within one&#8217;s own religious community.  
</p>
<p>17. In practice, manifestations of collective religious hatred frequently overlap with 
national, racial, ethnic or other forms of hatred, and in many situations it may seem 
impossible to clearly separate these phenomena. As a result, the label &#8220;religion&#8221; can 
sometimes be imprecise and problematic when used to describe complex phenomena and 
motives of collective hatred. Nevertheless it remains obvious that religions and beliefs can 
serve as powerful demarcators of &#8220;us-versus-them&#8221; groupings. Unfortunately, there are 
many examples testifying to this destructive potential of religion. At the same time, one 
should always bear in mind that anti-hatred movements exist within all religions and that 
most adherents of the different religious and belief traditions are committed to practising 
their faith as a source of peace, charity and compassion, rather than of hostility and hatred. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s rationale for focusing the present thematic report on 
manifestations of collective religious hatred is twofold. On the one hand, collective 
religious hatred is a source of many violations of the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief as enshrined in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
other international human rights instruments. A better understanding of this disturbing 
phenomenon is required in order to prevent human rights abuses in this area. On the other 
hand, securing freedom of religion or belief alongside other human rights can help 
eliminate the root causes of collective religious hatred by establishing trust within societies 
and between communities on the basis of respect for everyone&#8217;s religious or belief-related 
convictions and practices.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Collective religious hatred and its root causes 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Not a &#8220;natural phenomenon&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p>19. Manifestations of collective hatred, including religious hatred, can set in motion a 
seemingly unstoppable negative dynamic. However, manifestations of hatred do not &#8220;erupt&#8221; 
like a volcano. Rather, they are caused by human beings, that is, by human action and 
omission. For instance, populist politicians attract followers by offering simplistic 
explanations for complex societal problems; advocates of hatred poison intergroup relations 
by stirring up resentment for short-sighted political or economic gains; lack of trust in 
public institutions may exacerbate an existing atmosphere of suspicion in society; and parts 
of the population may be all too willing to replace political common sense with the snappy 
slogans of hatred.  
</p>
<p>20. What renders policies of hatred so unfortunately &#8220;attractive&#8221; in the eyes of their 
followers is that they provide scapegoats on whom to project multiple fears. Obviously, fear

<p>is a basic emotion and feature of human life. Unlike animals, whose fears are triggered by 
imminent dangers to their physical survival, human beings can imagine a broad range of 
potential threats &#8212; even far-fetched or statistically unlikely ones &#8212; to which they feel 
directly or indirectly exposed. Moreover, given the complexity of the human condition, 
fears can be connected to many different interests, such as social and economic status, the 
educational prospects of one&#8217;s children or the long-term development of one&#8217;s community. 
People may also fear for their religious identities &#8212; both as individuals and as 
communities. For instance, rapid changes in societies may cause feelings of a gradual 
dissolution of one&#8217;s familiar religious lifeworld and concomitant fears of a decline in 
religious values.  
</p>
<p>21. Fear is a necessary and useful sentiment as long as it is balanced by common sense 
and realistic analysis. However, fear is often quite a &#8220;narcissistic emotion&#8221;.6 Unlike 
compassion, which requires openness to the perspectives of others and a readiness to move 
beyond one&#8217;s own selfish interests, fear can breed narrow-mindedness among individuals 
and groups. The emotional under-complexity of fear, combined with an over-complexity of 
imagined reasons for being fearful, creates a demand for answers which are at the same 
time simplistic and all-encompassing. People wish to know &#8212; and sometimes pretend to 
know &#8212; on whom they can project their multiple fears.  
</p><p>22. Objects of fear are typically imagined as both powerful and, at the same time, 
deserving of contempt. For example, the Special Rapporteur once heard malicious rumours 
that members of a religious minority running an underwear factory allegedly contaminate 
female underwear with a chemical substance in order to reduce the fertility rate of the 
majority population. As a result of those rumours, the factory was likely to be driven into 
bankruptcy. However bizarre this example may sound, this type of rumour-mongering is in 
fact quite typical of hate propaganda, in that religious or belief minorities &#8212; including even 
tiny minorities &#8212; are frequently portrayed as wielding some surreptitious power by which 
they allegedly pose a threat to the majority society. Moreover, the way in which they are 
said to exercise their mysterious power is imagined as clandestine, unfair and utterly 
contemptible. In the above-mentioned case, the suggestion of surreptitious attacks against 
women may furthermore evoke atavistic male attitudes of wishing to protect female 
community members from external threats &#8212; this is only one example indicating that hate 
propaganda also needs to be studied systematically from a gender perspective (see 
A/68/290). 
23. The combination of fear and contempt occurs regularly in hate propaganda, 
including in manifestations of collective religious hatred. Fear can even escalate into 
collective paranoia, and contempt can lead to acts of public dehumanization. Anti-Semitic 
conspiracy theories may be the most intensively studied and one of the most malign 
examples. While ascribing to the Jews some manipulative power by which they would 
allegedly threaten societies, the Nazis at the same time maliciously portrayed Jews as being 
allegedly driven by greed, malevolence and other primitive motives, an approach also 
employed by other promoters of anti-Semitism, both past and present.  
</p>
<p>24. The peculiar pattern of combining fear and contempt displays itself in numerous 
hate manifestations targeting members of religious minorities or individual dissenters who 
are imagined as clandestinely operating in the interest of foreign powers or otherwise 
exercising some pernicious influence. In response to these combined sentiments of fear and 
contempt, two sources of aggressiveness can merge into a toxic mix, that is, aggressiveness

<p>stemming from imagined threats and aggressiveness stemming from the pretence of one&#8217;s 
own collective superiority.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Aggravating political circumstances  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Endemic corruption 
</i>25. The likelihood of collective manifestations of religious hatred largely depends on the 
general climate, and the overall context, of a society. One widespread negatively 
contributing factor is that of endemic corruption, that is, corruption pervading a society to 
such a degree that it largely shapes social interaction and expectations in general. In a 
country in which people experience corruption as affecting all sectors of societal life, they 
can hardly develop a reasonable trust in the fair functioning of public institutions. However, 
public institutions play an indispensable role in facilitating the peaceful coexistence of 
people of diverse religious and belief-related orientations. Without reasonable trust in 
public institutions, a public space to which everyone has equal access and in which 
religious, philosophical, ethical and political pluralism may freely unfold cannot be 
sustained. Moreover, persons living in a society characterized by endemic corruption may 
not have many alternatives to organizing their lives within their own more or less narrow 
networks, groups or communities. This can foster an inward-looking mentality, in which 
people strongly cling to their own groupings while largely avoiding meaningful 
communication with people outside of their own circles. There are many examples of 
religion becoming a defining feature of such groupings, thus further contributing to the 
overall fragmentation of society and the hardening of &#8220;us-versus-them&#8221; demarcations. By 
undermining the institutional and legal foundations of society, and providing a sense of a 
moral and legal vacuum, uncertainty and insecurity, endemic corruption may create a 
breeding ground for collective religious narrow-mindedness in which religious diversity is 
generally perceived as threatening the position of one&#8217;s own group. This may explain some 
of the extreme hostility that religious communities at times display towards the admission 
of other religions or beliefs, even minority ones, into the existing infrastructure of their 
society.7  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Political authoritarianism 
</i>26. Another aggravating factor is a climate of political authoritarianism which 
discourages people from communicating openly and participating actively in public 
debates. Indeed, the most important antidote to existing, or emerging, mistrust between 
groups of people is the reality check facilitated by frank intergroup communication and 
open public discourse. Without an encouraging communicative atmosphere in society, there 
is always the danger that negative anecdotal evidence associated with unfamiliar religious 
communities, minorities or dissenting individuals will remain exclusively within closed 
circles, including Internet chat rooms, while never being exposed to any open 
communication and public critical discussions. Rumours and gossip which remain 
unchecked by any counter-evidence and counterarguments can easily escalate into fully 
fledged conspiracy theories against unwelcome religious competitors or other religious 
groups. This increases the likelihood of religious hatred becoming an influential factor in 
social and political life. Moreover, when attempting to curb public criticism of their own 
political performance, authoritarian Governments may easily succumb to the temptation to 
blame existing problems and obvious political failures on religious or belief minorities, thus 
further contributing to an atmosphere of paranoia and scapegoating.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 A/HRC/19/60, paras. 20&#8211;73.  </p>


<p><i> (c) Narrow identity politics 
</i>27. Governments may also instrumentalize religion as a means of shaping and 
reinforcing narrow concepts of national identity, tapping into feelings of religious 
belonging for the purposes of strengthening political loyalty. No religion or belief is per se 
immune from being utilized in such a way. Moreover, such instrumentalization of religion 
can occur in many different political or constitutional settings. Not only in countries that 
profess an official State religion but also in many formally secular States, religion has been 
harnessed to promote national unity and societal homogeneity through the invocation of 
one predominant cultural and/or religious legacy to which all citizens are supposed to relate 
in a positive manner. However, utilizing religion for the purposes of fostering national 
identity politics harbours serious risks of increased discrimination against members of 
religious minorities, as well as hostility towards those perceived as not belonging to the 
mainstream national-religious identity. Besides being viewed as religiously different, 
members of minorities, or individuals with dissenting religious views, may thus 
additionally be suspected of undermining national unity and endangering the future 
development of the nation. This can increase the likelihood of manifestations of collective 
religious hatred occurring in which national and religious hatred blend into one another. 
Typical target groups are members of immigrant religious communities or new religious 
movements who are often stigmatized as not fitting into the prevailing religious and 
national makeup of the country or even characterized as potential traitors. But members of 
long-standing religious minorities in a country, many of which simultaneously constitute 
ethnic minorities, can similarly be subject to stigmatization and accused of threatening 
national unity.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Counter tendencies from within religions and beliefs: religious and belief communities 
as positive factors of societal resilience 
</b></p>
<p>28. The three above-mentioned aggravating political factors &#8212; endemic corruption, an 
authoritarian atmosphere and the harnessing of religion for narrow identity politics &#8212; serve 
as salient examples. While not constituting an exhaustive list of negative factors, they can 
mutually reinforce one another, thus possibly further speeding up the vicious cycle of 
mistrust, narrow-mindedness, hysteria, scapegoating and rumours that arouse contempt 
against certain religious or belief groups.  
</p>
<p>29. However, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that this vicious circle does 
not have the status of a natural law. It should never be treated as something that is 
unavoidable. Although he experiences many negative examples of religious hatred in his 
daily work, the Special Rapporteur also regularly meets with people from different religious 
or belief-related backgrounds &#8212; religious leaders as well as ordinary community members 
 &#8212; who successfully and actively work to overcome these destructive tendencies. Indeed, 
many people understand their religion or belief as a source of broad-mindedness rather than 
narrow-mindedness, and of open-heartedness and compassion rather than fear and 
contempt. The Special Rapporteur has witnessed numerous positive examples, such as 
during his country visit to Sierra Leone in July 2013, where he was impressed by how 
amicably religious communities &#8212; Muslims, Christians and others &#8212; work together and 
cooperate on a daily basis in rebuilding the country after a recent history of civil war. This 
is possible since religious community leaders had successfully managed to keep religion 
out of the dynamics of fragmentation and escalation of violence (see A/HRC/25/58/Add.1). 
Likewise, during his country visit to Jordan in September 2013, the Special Rapporteur 
witnessed much good will and commitment to preserve the positive climate of 
interreligious harmony within an increasingly difficult regional environment (see 
A/HRC/25/58/Add.2).  </p>


<p>30. In general, the Special Rapporteur has the impression that the potential of religious 
or belief communities to become positive factors of societal resilience against 
manifestations of collective hatred still requires further exploration in order to be fully 
understood. He thinks this is a fascinating area for research, practical experimentation and 
exchange of experiences.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Building trust on the basis of freedom of religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Respecting everyone&#8217;s right to freedom of religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>31. If it is true that collective hatred typically originates from combined sentiments of 
unreasonable fear and contempt, then it follows that policies of countering hatred must 
invest in trust-building based on universal respect for human dignity. Building trust with 
the purpose of overcoming unreasonable fears requires well-functioning public institutions, 
as well as activities that encourage and facilitate communication. Both levels are 
intertwined: whereas public institutions necessarily presuppose a certain level of public 
communication, the prospects of meaningful and sustained communication generally 
increase with an infrastructure of institutions that provide a public sphere to which 
everyone can have equal access.   
</p>
<p>32. In policies specifically addressing religious hatred and its root causes, freedom of 
religion or belief has a pivotal function. Like other human rights, freedom of religion or 
belief is a part of the development of an infrastructure of public institutions at national, 
regional and international levels, including courts, ombudsman institutions, national human 
rights institutions and international monitoring bodies. At the same time, freedom of 
religion or belief has far-reaching implications for communication &#8212; which, incidentally, 
also accounts for its close interrelatedness with freedom of expression. Finally, freedom of 
religion or belief institutionalizes due respect for all human beings as potential holders of 
profound, identity-shaping convictions and conviction-based practices.  
</p>
<p>33. Respect is a key term for the understanding of human rights in general and in 
particular for freedom of religion or belief. In the human rights framework, respect always 
relates to human beings, as evidenced in the opening sentence of the preamble of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims the &#8220;recognition of the inherent 
dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family&#8221;. In the 
face of widespread misunderstandings, it cannot be emphasized enough that freedom of 
religion or belief does not provide respect to religions as such; instead it empowers human 
beings in the broad field of religion and belief. The idea of protecting the honour of 
religions themselves would clearly be at variance with the human rights approach (see 
A/68/290).  
</p><p>34. For many people around the world, religious convictions, spiritual values, a sense of 
sacredness, community-related ceremonies and other religious norms and practices 
constitute an essential part of their daily lives and may be the backbone of their individual 
and communitarian identities. Working on behalf of freedom of religion or belief requires 
an appreciation of the deep emotional attachment and loyalty that many believers feel to 
their religion or belief. However, to take religions and beliefs seriously in all their 
dimensions also implies taking pluralism seriously, including sometimes irreconcilable 
differences in world views and practices. What is sacred for one community may remain 
opaque to another community, and the values that one group holds in high esteem may 
appear incomprehensible to some others. This is one of the reasons why respect in the 
framework of human rights cannot immediately be accorded to the particular contents of 
religions or beliefs &#8212; that is, religious truth claims, norms, practices or identities &#8212; but 
only to human beings as those who hold, cherish, develop and try to live up to such 
convictions and norms. </p>


<p>35. Moreover, as the Human Rights Committee has pointed out in its general comment 
No. 22 (1993), freedom of religion or belief applies to a broad variety of convictions and 
conviction-based practices, beyond any predefined lists of &#8220;classical&#8221; religions. In the 
words of the Committee: &#8220;Article 18 protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as 
well as the right not to profess any religion or belief. The terms belief and religion are to be 
broadly construed. Article 18 is not limited in its application to traditional religions or to 
religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices analogous to those of 
traditional religions.&#8221;8  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trust-building through public institutions 
</b></p>
<p>36. Sustainable trust within a society presupposes an infrastructure of public institutions 
operating in the interest of all. In connection with other human rights, freedom of religion 
or belief is important for the progressive development of society and requires the 
development of public institutions at international, regional and national levels. These 
institutional implications of the right to freedom of religion or belief constitute an important 
aspect of its comprehensive trust-building function in society.  
</p>
<p>37. Under international law, States serve as the formal guarantors of human rights, 
including freedom of religion or belief. In order to operate as trustworthy guarantors of 
freedom of religion or belief for everyone, States should provide an open, inclusive 
framework in which religious or belief pluralism can unfold freely and without 
discrimination. This requires overcoming any exclusivist settings. Above all, what must be 
overcome is an understanding in which the State identifies itself with one particular religion 
or belief at the expense of an equal and non-discriminatory treatment of followers of other 
persuasions. Such exclusivist settings do not only occur in States which have formally 
embraced an official religion or a State religion. Even in many supposedly religiously 
neutral or secular States, Governments may be tempted to invoke one particular religion as 
the basis of its political legitimacy or with the purpose of mobilizing followers by tapping 
into emotions of religious loyalty. Ample experience demonstrates that the use of religion 
in the context of national identity politics always harbours increased risks of discrimination 
against minorities, in particular against members of immigrant religious communities or 
new religious movements, who often are stigmatized as allegedly endangering national 
cohesion. As elaborated above, this can become the breeding ground for manifestations of 
collective religious hatred stoked by State agencies, non-State actors or a combination of 
both.  
</p>
<p>38. International human rights law does not prescribe one particular model of how the 
relationship between State and religion should be organized, and State religions or official 
religions are not per se prohibited under international human rights law. However, as the 
Human Rights Committee has pointed out, States should ensure that having an official 
religion &#8212; or making reference in constitutional or legal provisions to the historical role of 
a particular religion &#8212; does not lead to a de jure or de facto discrimination against 
members of other religions and beliefs. In its general comment No. 22, the Committee 
insisted that &#8220;the fact that a religion is recognized as a State religion or that it is established 
as official or traditional or that its followers comprise the majority of the population, shall 
not result in any impairment of the enjoyment of any of the rights under the Covenant, 
including articles 18 and 27, nor in any discrimination against adherents of other religions 
or non-believers.&#8221;9

<p>39. Notwithstanding, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of an application 
of the concept of an official &#8220;State religion&#8221; that in practice does not have adverse effects 
on religious minorities, thus discriminating against their members.10 
</p>
<p>40. An open constitutional framework that allows free manifestations of existing or 
emerging religious pluralism on the basis of equal respect for all is a sine qua non of any 
policy directed towards eliminating collective religious hatred by building trust through 
public institutions. This in turn requires a disentangling of any exclusivist relations between 
the State and particular religions or beliefs. Of course, this does not mean that all States will 
end up having the same structure of relations with religious communities. Moreover, the 
process of disentanglement may take time, and there remains space for experimentation and 
institutional diversity in this field, including in response to different historical legacies. In 
practice, however, States will hardly be able to function as trustworthy guarantors of 
freedom of religion or belief for everyone as long as exclusivist settings remain 
unchallenged.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Trust-building through communication  
</b></p>
<p>41. The communicative aspects of trust-building are no less important than the 
institutional aspects. In the context of religious diversity, communication activities should 
cover at least three different dimensions: (a) intergroup communication; (b) outreach 
activities of the State towards religious communities; and (c) creation of an atmosphere in 
which public debates on religious issues can flourish. Freedom of religion or belief has to 
play a role across all these dimensions.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Intergroup communication 
</i>42. Regular communication across religious boundaries is the most important 
precondition for fostering understanding and preventing or overcoming mistrust between 
religious or belief groups (which is one of the root causes of collective religious hatred). 
When conducted on an equal footing and in a sustained manner, that is, in ways that go 
beyond mere superficial brief encounters, interreligious communication can help replace 
stereotypes and prejudices by real experiences. Even though these experiences may not 
always be positive, they can nonetheless challenge stereotypical us-versus-them 
demarcations which are unlikely to ever do justice to the complex realities of human 
beings. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize in this context that, in his view, the 
potential of interreligious communication to lead to policies that contribute to the 
elimination of religious hatred still needs to be fully explored. He has often observed an 
attitude of merely lukewarm support for systematic activities in this field. Whereas hardly 
anyone would express a straightforward opposition to interreligious communication, its 
political significance typically remains underestimated.  
</p>
<p>44. However, the Special Rapporteur has had the opportunity to directly experience the 
beneficial impact of a highly developed culture of inter- and intrareligious communication, 
for instance during his country visit to Sierra Leone, where the Interreligious Council has 
become a key factor in a reunited country that until a decade ago had been torn by civil war 
(see A/HRC/25/58/Add.1). Likewise, during his visit to Jordan he met with many people 
from the Government, religious communities and civil society organizations whose 
commitment in this field helps to keep society together in an increasingly volatile region 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 See the 2012 report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (A/HRC/19/60), 
</p>
<p>para. 66, and his 2012 interim report (A/67/303), para. 47. </p>


<p>(see A/HRC/25/58/Add.2). In addition, there seems to be an improved climate of 
interreligious communication and cooperation in Cyprus, which the Special Rapporteur 
witnessed during the ground-breaking interreligious round tables held in Nicosia in 
September 2013.11 
</p>
<p>45. Under freedom of religion or belief, States have an obligation to promote 
interreligious communication and take active measures in this area. One should not 
underestimate the possible symbolic impact of interreligious communication being publicly 
acknowledged and promoted by State representatives. Governments can support 
interreligious dialogue in a number of ways, for example by providing financial support for 
existing projects or for the creation of new forums. In addition, Governments have the 
possibility to directly invite religious or belief groups to meetings. The &#8220;neutral&#8221; space 
provided by State institutions can help facilitate dialogue even between groups which, 
perhaps due to a history of conflicts or other negative factors, would not be likely to meet 
on their own initiative. For example, when visiting the Republic of Moldova (in 2011), the 
Special Rapporteur attended a meeting of representatives of different religious leaders 
convened by the Ministry of Justice. It was evident from the uneasy atmosphere between 
participants of different communities that a culture of interreligious communication still 
needs to be further developed in that country and that this is unlikely to happen, unless the 
State undertakes more proactive initiatives in this field (see A/HRC/19/60/Add.2).  
</p><p>46. As pointed out in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic report on the role of the State in 
this area (A/66/156, paras. 21&#8211;69), State activities should cover both formal and informal 
interreligious communication, that is, dialogue projects undertaken explicitly under the 
auspices of religious differences as well as forms of communication in which people meet 
without necessarily displaying their respective religious identities. State commitment in the 
field of interreligious communication should always take into account the existing and 
emerging diversity, including intrareligious differences, while also ensuring the substantive 
participation of women (who continue to be largely discriminated against in many dialogue 
projects). Moreover, school education also deserves special attention in this context, since 
the school is arguably the most influential institution in which interreligious communication 
(both formal and informal) can be experienced on a daily basis, during the formative years 
of young people and with the prospects of promoting sustained open-mindedness within the 
younger generation.12 Fair information and real experiences with religious or belief 
pluralism, as part of normal public and private life, are among the most important 
preconditions for developing societal resilience against manifestations of collective 
religious hatred.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Early warning and outreach by the State towards religious communities  
</i>47. While interreligious communication can build trust between communities, outreach 
activities by the State should also aim to establish trustful relations between representatives 
of the State administration and representatives or members of various religious 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 On 22 October 2013 the Special Rapporteur hailed a key breakthrough in interfaith communication 
</p>
<p>reached by a cross section of religious leaders in Cyprus. The agreement allowed Muslim and Greek 
Orthodox religious leaders to cross the Green Line dividing the island. The Special Rapporteur 
praised the religious leaders, and encouraged them to create an inclusive institutional framework to 
promote ongoing communication, such as an interreligious council for peace in Cyprus. The 
breakthrough became possible after the first interreligious round table held in Cyprus on 12 
September 2013, organized by the Office of the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process, under 
the auspices of the Embassy of Sweden, and in cooperation with OHCHR.

<p>communities. Communication channels should be a two-way process. On the one hand, it is 
important for Government agencies to be able to reach out to communities, in particular 
during crisis situations when public manifestations of collective hatred increase the risks of 
escalation into intergroup or other forms of violence. On the other hand, it is equally 
important for religious communities to have easy access to persons acting as focal points 
within the administration so they can alert them to emerging hostilities before a crisis 
situation fully unfolds its destructive dynamics.  
</p>
<p>48. During the first conference held in the context of the Istanbul Process for Combating 
Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief in December 2011 in 
Washington D.C.,13 the Special Rapporteur had the chance to witness how civil servants 
operating as focal points within the administration worked together with members of 
various religious communities. They simulated a fictitious crisis situation in order to 
demonstrate how to communicate quickly and efficiently and how to decide on practical 
measures if the need were to arise. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the degree of 
professionalism with which participants interacted. Obviously, they had known one another 
for quite some time and had established trustful working relations. For outreach activities to 
be successful it seems imperative that communication channels do not only exist in theory; 
they must also be regularly used in practice. During an informal visit to Sweden, the 
Special Rapporteur heard some positive examples of how Government agencies and 
municipalities maintain regular contact with faith-based communities in Sweden on issues 
relating to crisis preparedness and security, and of how they cooperate together to help 
forge greater societal trust and prevent incidents of religious violence.14   
</p>
<p>49. Manifestations of collective hatred do not usually occur without prior warning 
signals, and they are quite often even publicly announced by those orchestrating them. 
However, even if all the early warning signs are visible, this does not often lead to 
appropriate early action, perhaps due to a lack of experience or to a lack of imagination 
about how to react appropriately and in due time. In order to close the gap between early 
warning and early action, regular outreach meetings are recommended between focal points 
in the administration and influential members of religious communities. Such meetings can 
include practical exercises, similar to the manoeuvres conducted by fire brigades or other 
crisis response agencies. It is important for States to be proactively prepared for crises 
resulting from manifestations of collective hatred and to keep the necessary communication 
channels open by using them on a regular basis. Practical training manoeuvres could be 
conducted at national and municipal levels, and it might also be useful to exchange both 
negative and positive experiences in this area within appropriate United Nations forums 
such as the Alliance of Civilizations.  
</p>
<p>50. Early warning signs identified by the different human rights mechanisms need to 
reach the political and conflict-prevention bodies of the United Nations. Effective channels

 Linked to Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 on combating intolerance, negative stereotyping 
</p>
<p>and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based 
on religion or belief, agreed by consensus, the Istanbul Process started a number of activities to 
explore appropriate policies and measures in this area.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 Sweden has created a national-level advisory group for faith communities, where the Swedish Civil 
</p>
<p>Contingencies Agency and the Swedish Commission for Government Support to Faith Communities 
are responsible for maintaining contacts with faith communities in Sweden on crisis-related issues. 
This advisory group meets several times per year, and it played a key role in facilitating interreligious 
dialogue following the attacks on immigrants in Malmo in 2010. At the local level, crisis 
preparedness is organized by the Swedish municipalities, which are responsible for building networks 
involving governmental agencies, business, volunteer and community organizations and religious 
communities, to ensure functioning cooperation between all relevant parties whenever a crisis occurs.  </p>


<p>of communication are needed between different parts of the United Nations system to 
enable decision makers to take appropriate and timely action. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur commends a recent document on preventing atrocity crimes, prepared by the 
Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect, in particular its 
paragraphs on the need to prepare contingency plans.15 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> (c) Atmosphere in which public debates on religious issues can flourish 
</i>51 As outlined earlier, an authoritarian climate that discourages people from publicly 
expressing their various concerns tends to increase the likelihood of manifestations of 
religious hatred occurring in a country. Where a culture of free public discourse does not 
exist, negative rumours are likely to remain within closed circles and to avoid sufficient 
exposure to critical public scrutiny. Even worse, those who have lived for a long time in a 
repressive climate may develop a distorted &#8220;mentality of suspicion&#8221;, where they assume 
hidden agendas. As a consequence, the dichotomy between thinking and speaking, which 
people may have experienced in their own personal behaviour, is often also ascribed to 
other individuals or groups. Likewise, the dichotomy between private narratives and public 
propositions may become the interpretative background for any public statements made by 
individuals, groups or organizations, resulting in a society that is marked by general 
mistrust and suspicion. As a result, trustful communication may become increasingly 
difficult and may yield more and more to mere tactical rhetorical manoeuvres. In extreme 
cases this may culminate in a total breakdown of any meaningful intergroup 
communication, a collapse of the culture of public discourse and in unchecked prejudices 
and misconceptions.  
</p>
<p>52. The most promising antidote to a society beleaguered by a combination of paranoia 
and contempt is a well-developed culture of public discourse in which people feel 
encouraged to exercise their freedom of expression. Such a culture should also allow for the 
expression of any concerns, worries, anxieties and less pleasant experiences in the area of 
religious pluralism. Living together in a pluralistic society can certainly be enriching, but it 
is not always easy and at times can even become quite challenging. When people feel they 
have the freedom to publicly express any frustrations and irritations that may arise from 
their adverse experiences, instead of merely telling negative stories in private circles, there 
remains a good chance that counter-evidence and the promulgation of alternative narratives 
may help restore realistic proportion and perspective. This may prevent negative 
experiences from hardening into fixed prejudices. A culture of public discourse should thus 
enable people to conduct controversial discussions in the area of religious diversity, which 
naturally must also accommodate criticism of certain religions or even of religion in 
general.  
</p>
<p>53. Attempts to replace negative stereotypes about other religious communities or 
minorities by superficially imposing positive language and discouraging the articulation of 
adverse experiences are only likely to raise suspicion in the long run. A more promising 
strategy aims at overcoming misperceptions by facilitating the articulation of real 
experiences in the interaction of human beings, both as individuals and as communities. 
After all, sustainable trust can develop only on the basis of realism and by taking seriously 
the experiences that people have. Inter alia, such a realist strategy presupposes the 
availability of differentiated information by nuanced research and reporting, including on 
religious community issues. Investigative journalism, which is often wrongly suspected of 
undermining social peace, can serve as a necessary ingredient of trust-building policies,

<p>since it may help to promote a climate of experience-based common sense in public life. 
Moreover, it is imperative that members of minorities, including religious or belief 
minorities, have access to fair opportunities to articulate their own experiences, interests 
and perspectives in the public domain through the existence of community media, as well 
as through effective participation in media that caters for more mainstream audiences 
(including new digital and online media).  
</p>
<p><b> D. Responding to advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The genesis of the Rabat Plan of Action 
</b></p>
<p>54. Sentiments expressing hatred can escalate into real acts of discrimination, hostility 
or violence. This often happens as a result of deliberate incitement to such acts. The 
question of how States and other stakeholders should prevent, or react to, incidents 
motivated by hatred has attracted the increased attention of the international community. It 
seems obvious that States have to tackle this problem by developing effective preventive 
and coping strategies. In extreme situations this may also include restrictive measures, such 
as prohibiting certain speech acts. However, when resorting to prohibitions and other 
restrictive measures, States should always make sure that this does not have a chilling effect 
on people&#8217;s willingness to communicate freely and frankly, including on controversial 
religious issues. Any limitations to freedom of expression or other human rights deemed 
necessary in this respect must comply with all the criteria laid down in respective 
international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>55. In order to find appropriate solutions, OHCHR conducted a series of regional expert 
workshops, with broad participation of representatives from Governments, civil society, 
academia, United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures.16 A wrap-up expert 
workshop was convened in Rabat in October 2012 and led to the elaboration of the Rabat 
Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.17 OHCHR launched the Rabat 
Plan of Action publicly in Geneva in February 2013.  
</p>
<p>56. The title of the Rabat Plan of Action includes a quote from article 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which in its second paragraph 
provides: &#8220;Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.&#8221; It cannot be emphasized 
enough that this provision does not demand a prohibition of sharp or even hostile speech in 
general; instead it concentrates on such forms of hatred advocacy that constitute 
&#8220;incitement&#8221; to real acts of discrimination, hostility or violence. One of the main purposes 
of the Rabat Plan of Action is to raise awareness and understanding of article 20, paragraph 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 The expert workshops took place in Vienna, Nairobi, Bangkok and Santiago in 2011. Participants 
</p>
<p>included representatives from Governments, representatives from intergovernmental organizations, 
civil society organizations (in particular the organization Article 19: Global Campaign for Free 
Expression), academics of different disciplines, experts working within OHCHR, members of the 
Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. All

<p>2, of the Covenant, while interpreting it consistently in conjunction with other human 
rights, in particular article 18 (freedom of religion or belief) and article 19 (freedom of 
expression) of the Covenant.18  
</p><p>57. The Rabat Plan of Action acknowledges that &#8220;there has been a number of incidents 
in recent years, in different parts of the world, which have brought renewed attention to the 
issue of incitement to hatred.&#8221;19 As one of the reasons for this renewed attention, the text of 
the plan cites the challenge &#8220;to contain the negative effects of a manipulation of race, ethnic 
origin and religion and to guard against the adverse use of concepts of national unity or 
national identity, which are often instrumentalized for, inter alia, political and electoral 
purposes.&#8221;20 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The interdependence between freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Rabat Plan of Action places great emphasis on the need to uphold a climate of 
free communication and public discourse based on freedom of expression, freedom of 
religion or belief and various other freedoms. It establishes a high threshold for imposing 
limitations on freedom of expression, for identifying incitement to hatred and for the 
application of article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It 
furthermore underlines that &#8220;freedom of expression is essential to creating an environment 
in which constructive discussion about religious matters could be held.&#8221;21 The Rabat Plan 
of Action explicitly endorses what the Human Rights Committee has clarified in its general 
comment No. 34, namely that prohibitions enacted under article 20, paragraph 2, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must comply with the strict 
requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26 of the 
Covenant.22 Accordingly, the guarantees of freedom of expression as enshrined in article 19 
of the Covenant can never be circumvented by invoking article 20. Prohibitions must be 
precisely defined and must be enacted without any discriminatory intention or effect. In 
addition, the Rabat Plan of Action presents a six-part test for assessing whether concrete 
acts of speech that are aggressive or antagonistic to certain religious or ethnic groups 
actually amount to &#8220;incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221; and are serious 
enough to warrant prohibitive measures.23 The six test questions concern: (a) the social and 
political context; (b) the speaker, for example his or her status and influence; (c) the intent 
of a speech act, as opposed to mere negligence; (d) its content or form, for example style or 
degree of provocation; (e) the extent of the speech, for example its public nature and the 
size of its audience; and (f) the likelihood and imminence of actually causing harm.24  
</p><p>59. In its assessment of existing legislation and jurisprudence on this issue, the Rabat 
Plan of Action observes a broad variety of statutes and case law, often enacted on an ad hoc 
basis and lacking in consistency. This can lead to arbitrary reactions and also to 
overreactions, with chilling effects on freedom of expression or on free manifestations of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 In this context, the Rabat Plan of Action, inter alia, refers to Human Rights Council resolution 16/18. 
</p>
<p>The Plan of Action furthermore draws on the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 34 
(2011) on the freedoms of opinion and expression. Both documents have also dealt with article 20, 
paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which constitutes the main 
reference norm within the Rabat Plan of Action, as already indicated in its title.

<p>religious or belief convictions, in particular as regards religious minorities or people with 
dissenting views. In this context, the Rabat Plan of Action provides: &#8220;At the national level, 
blasphemy laws are counter-productive, since they may result in de facto censure of all 
inter-religious or belief and intra-religious or belief dialogue, debate and criticism, most of 
which could be constructive, healthy and needed. In addition, many blasphemy laws afford 
different levels of protection to different religions and have often proved to be applied in a 
discriminatory manner.&#8221;25 The Rabat Plan of Action therefore recommends that &#8220;States that 
have blasphemy laws should repeal them, as such laws have a stifling impact on the 
enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief, and healthy dialogue and debate about 
religion.&#8221;26 The Special Rapporteur would like to confirm that, according to his 
experiences, blasphemy laws typically have intimidating effects on members of religious 
minorities as well as on critics or dissenters.  
</p>
<p>60. The Rabat Plan of Action certainly contributes to an understanding of article 20, 
paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in full appreciation 
of the significance of freedom of expression and other freedoms. This implies that 
restrictive legal measures can play a necessary, but only limited, role in preventing or 
reacting to incidents of incitement. As a consequence, States and other stakeholders should 
develop more holistic policies that include non-restrictive and non-prohibitive activities: 
&#8220;To tackle the root causes of intolerance, a much broader set of policy measures is 
necessary, for example in the areas of intercultural dialogue &#8212; reciprocal knowledge and 
interaction &#8212;, education on pluralism and diversity, and policies empowering minorities 
and indigenous people to exercise their right to freedom of expression.&#8221;27  
</p>
<p>61 Indeed, one of the most remarkable messages contained in the Rabat Plan of Action 
is that what we require above all in order to prevent and respond to incidents of incitement 
to hatred are policies which promote a creative and productive use of freedom of 
expression. For instance, in order to challenge advocates of religious hatred in their claims 
to speak in the name of &#8220;the silent majority&#8221;, it is important that the majority does not 
remain silent. Civil society activities which visibly and audibly reject advocacy of religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence can have very 
practical effects in discouraging such advocacy, while at the same time showing solidarity 
and support for their targets. In any such activities, the gender dimension warrants special 
attention, as women frequently suffer from complex and intersectional stigmatization which 
renders them particularly vulnerable to hate propaganda and concomitant manifestations of 
contempt. 
</p>
<p>62. The Rabat Plan of Action specifically calls upon political and religious leaders to 
speak out firmly and promptly against intolerance, discriminatory stereotyping and 
instances of hate speech.28 They should also refrain from using messages of intolerance or 
expressions which may incite to religious violence and lead to manifestations of collective 
religious hatred. Religious leaders can play a critical role in societies at risk of large-scale 
violence, by spreading positive messages of acceptance, reconciliation, peace and respect 
for diversity.29 
</p>
<p>63. Other measures recommended in the Rabat Plan of Action include voluntary ethical 
guidelines for media reporting and self-regulatory supervision, support for community 
media, facilitation of a non-discriminatory participation of religious minorities within

 Report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (A/HRC/13/40), para. 60.  </p>


<p>mainstream media and encouragement of interreligious and intrareligious dialogue 
initiatives, public awareness-raising campaigns and educational efforts in schools. It is 
worth noting that actors in the area of new information technologies can also play an 
important role through the promotion of religious tolerance in the digital space. Artists, 
journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders can help to make a difference as well, 
especially when their statements and actions transcend religious boundaries and denounce 
religious intolerance.30 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur would like to conclude by reiterating that freedom of 
religion or belief and freedom of expression, as enshrined respectively in articles 18 and 19, 
respectively, of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, are &#8220;neighbouring rights&#8221; in a literal as well as 
metaphorical sense.31 They are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and can serve as 
complementary safeguards of communicative freedom. This positive interrelation between 
freedom of religion or belief and freedom of expression should guide policies designed to 
combat negative stereotypes, prejudice and other narrow-minded attitudes, which can best 
be tackled in an environment that enables more meaningful intergroup communication, 
communicative outreach activities and public discussion of any controversies.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>65.<b> Manifestations of collective religious hatred, albeit sometimes leading to a 
seemingly unstoppable destructive dynamic, are not natural phenomena; they are 
caused by human action and/or omission. States and other stakeholders therefore 
have a shared responsibility to combat collective religious hatred, which presupposes 
an understanding of its root causes and of any aggravating political circumstances.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Sentiments of collective religious hatred are often caused by a combination of 
fear and contempt, which can trigger a vicious circle of mistrust, narrow-mindedness, 
collective hysteria, contempt-filled rumours and fear of imaginary conspiracies. 
Aggravating political factors that further increase the likelihood of manifestations of 
collective religious hatred include: (a) endemic corruption, which typically 
undermines reasonable trust in public institutions, thus creating inward-looking 
mentalities and possibly breeding collective narrow-mindedness; (b) an authoritarian 
political atmosphere that stifles free and frank public debate, creates a &#8220;mentality of 
suspicion&#8221; and undermines trust between individuals and groups; and (c) the 
harnessing of religion for the purposes of national identity politics, which typically 
leads to the political marginalization of religious minorities whose members may 
become easy scapegoats or subjects of prejudice and misperception.   
</b>67.<b> Policies intended to counter manifestations of religious hatred must invest in 
trust-building based on universal respect. By ensuring respect for all human beings as 
holders of profound, identity-shaping convictions, freedom of religion or belief plays a 
pivotal role in such anti-hatred policies, both in the area of trust-building through 
public institutions as well as in the area of trust-building through communication.

 Articles 18 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 18 and 19 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights fit into a pattern also widely found elsewhere, 
including in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (arts. 9 and 10), the American Convention on Human Rights (arts. 12 and 13), the African 
Charter of Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (arts. 8 and 9), and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union (arts. 10 and 11), as well as in numerous national constitutions. </p>


<p>68.<b> Trust-building through public institutions presupposes that the State operates 
as a trustworthy guarantor of freedom of religion or belief for everyone. Dissolving 
any exclusivist arrangements in the State&#8217;s relation to religions or beliefs and 
overcoming all forms of instrumentalization of religion for the purposes of national 
identity politics serves as a precondition for providing an open, inclusive framework 
in which religious or belief-related pluralism can unfold freely and without 
discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> Trust-building through communication implies at least three dimensions: (a) 
intergroup communication with the aim of replacing stereotypical perceptions and 
ascriptions by real experience and regular encounters with human beings belonging to 
different religious or belief communities; (b) outreach activities by the State towards 
religious communities with the purpose of establishing trustful relations and 
communication channels that can be used in crisis situations as part of contingency 
planning; and (c) the development of a public culture of open discourse in which 
rumours, stereotypes and misperceptions can be exposed to the test of public criticism. 
In all these dimensions States must take an active role in promoting respect for 
everyone&#8217;s freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> Against this background, the Special Rapporteur would like to formulate the 
following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States and other stakeholders should base their policies of prevention, or 
response to, manifestations of collective religious hatred firmly on respect for freedom 
of thought, conscience, religion or belief &#8212; a human right which requires a broad 
understanding and an inclusive implementation, in conjunction with other human 
rights, in particular that of freedom of expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should develop an open constitutional and infrastructural 
framework to facilitate free and non-discriminatory manifestations of the existing and 
emerging diversity of religion and belief in the society; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) States should actively foster the inclusion and integration of religious 
and other minorities as part of their responsibility to combat religious intolerance and 
tackle advocacy and manifestations of collective religious hatred;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) States should implement the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence. When developing strategies concerning the 
implementation of this plan of action, they should invite relevant stakeholders to 
participate, including religious communities, national human rights institutions, civil 
society organizations, media representatives and professionals working in education, 
with the purpose of joining forces and establishing an effective division of labour;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Policies of preventing, or reacting to, incidents of incitement to acts of 
discrimination, hostility or violence, should include a broad range of measures. 
Restrictive measures, if deemed necessary, should be the last resort and must comply 
with all the criteria set out in the respective international human rights standards, 
including in articles 18, 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. States should repeal blasphemy laws, which typically have a stifling effect on 
open dialogue and public discourse, often particularly affecting persons belonging to 
religious minorities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Political and religious leaders, as well as civil society organizations, 
should actively support and encourage an atmosphere of religious tolerance and help 
to build societal resilience against manifestations of religious hatred. As stressed in the 
Rabat Plan of Action, they should refrain from using messages of intolerance or </b></p>


<p><b>expressions which may incite to religious violence and manifestations of collective 
religious hatred. They also have a crucial role to play in speaking out firmly and 
promptly against intolerance, discriminatory stereotyping and instances of hate 
speech;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States and other stakeholders should facilitate a culture of frank public 
discourse in which people can express their concerns, worries, anxieties and less 
pleasant experiences in the area of religious or belief pluralism. Encouraging people to 
express their fears and negative experiences in public, instead of confining them to 
private circles, opens up opportunities for counter-evidence and alternative narratives 
that can put things into realistic proportion and perspective. This may help to prevent 
adverse experiences from hardening into fixed prejudices;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States and other stakeholders should encourage inter- and intrareligious 
communication and take practical initiatives to engage all relevant stakeholders, in 
full recognition of the existing and emerging pluralism in society. This should also 
include intergenerational pluralism. A main purpose of inter- and intrareligious 
communicative efforts should be to replace negative stereotypes and preconceptions 
with real encounters between real human beings, both as individuals and within their 
communities. Women (often heavily underrepresented) must always have a 
substantive share in such initiatives, which should be promoted at the local, national 
and international levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should create accessible focal points within the administration in 
charge of developing relationships of trust with representatives of different religious 
or belief communities. Regular meetings &#8212; at the municipal, national and regional 
levels &#8212; can help to keep the communication channels open. Such meetings may 
include practical &#8220;manoeuvres&#8221; in which fictitious crisis situations are played out to 
test and develop de-escalation strategies. This may help close the gap between early 
warning and early action;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) International forums, such as the United Nations Alliance of 
Civilizations, as well as existing United Nations mechanisms for the protection and 
promotion of human rights, should be used to exchange positive experiences of human 
rights-based de-escalation strategies aimed at preventing, or coping with, 
manifestations of collective religious hatred and at combating advocacy of religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Public and private media should be encouraged to help overcome 
religious or belief-related stereotypes by replacing these with more accurate and 
nuanced information. By promoting more balanced representations, professional 
journalism, including investigative journalism, can contribute to a public atmosphere 
of common sense, realism and experience, serving as an antidote to conspiracy 
theories, misperceptions and public hysteria. As new social media and the Internet 
have become major tools for fostering advocacy of religious hatred and incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence in many countries, specific efforts should be 
directed towards understanding and addressing this phenomenon appropriately;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) The media is encouraged to develop voluntary guidelines for reporting 
on religious issues, in particular as regards situations of (alleged or factual) religious 
conflicts. Self-regulatory supervision mechanisms, such as regular peer review, can 
help to implement such guidelines in ways that fully respect the human right to 
freedom of expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Those responsible in public and private media should ensure a fair 
participation of religious or belief minorities within the media, so that their voices can </b></p>


<p><b>be heard and become a part of the public discourse. The Camden Principles on 
Freedom of Expression and Equality can provide guidance in this regard;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) School education should include fair information on religious and belief-
related issues as part of the mandatory curriculum. Such information should take 
seriously the self-understandings of the respective religious communities, including 
internal pluralism, thus overcoming mere external descriptions, which often remain 
stereotypical. School education can also facilitate daily encounters between students of 
different religious or belief persuasions, thus helping them to experience diversity as 
something quite natural and serving to inhibit the formation of emotions of disgust 
towards groups of fellow citizens. Education can also encourage students to better 
imagine the experience and self-perception of others, especially those from diverse 
religious, ethnic and cultural contexts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) National human rights institutions are encouraged to use the Rabat Plan 
of Action as a reference document when planning their activities towards overcoming 
the root causes of collective religious hatred;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) The implementation of the Rabat Plan of Action and of Human Rights 
Council resolution 16/18 at the national level should also be systematically scrutinized 
in the context of the universal periodic review of each State.
