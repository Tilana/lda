<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of the Comoros was held at the 9th 
meeting on 31 January 2014. The delegation of the Comoros was headed by Abdou 
Ousseni, Minister of Justice, Civil Service, Administrative Reform, Human Rights and 
Islamic Affairs. At its 14th meeting, held on 4 February 2014, the Working Group adopted 
the report on the Comoros. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Comoros: Benin, the Czech Republic and 
Germany. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of the 
Comoros: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/COM/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/COM/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/COM/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Comoros through the troika. Those 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Comorian delegation, led by Mr. Abdou Ousseni, recalled the importance of 
human rights in the governance strategy of Comoros. The Minister had been keen to lead 
the delegation and presented the report himself. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stressed the political stability, national cohesion and ongoing efforts 
to strengthen the rule of law in the country, which had enabled the Government to 
implement the 52 recommendations that had been accepted in 2009 and to reconsider the 7 
recommendations that Comoros had not supported.  
</p>
<p>7. The report for the universal periodic review was the outcome of inclusive 
consultations with stakeholders that had addressed the difficulties in furthering and 
realizing human rights caused by the country&#8217;s lack of human and financial resources, 
despite strong political will.  
</p>
<p>8. Since 2009, the requested ratifications had been made. Several instruments of 
ratification had not reached the United Nations Secretariat, but the necessary steps would 
be taken to remedy the situation. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-13136 
</p>
<p>9. Comoros had strengthened civil and political rights. A national human rights policy 
had been adopted in November 2012. 
</p>
<p>10. Comoros was working to combat torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment and punishment. Torture was criminalized under the bill to revise the Criminal 
Code, which also prohibited trafficking in persons and abolished the death penalty. It was 
recalled that, in compliance with the United Nations moratorium on the use of the death 
penalty, no prisoners had been executed since 2009.  
</p>
<p>11. Progress had been made in improving the living conditions of prisoners. Huge 
progress had been made in developing the infrastructure and capacity of the justice system, 
particularly with regard to dealing with minors. However, it was difficult to achieve the 
required level given the Government&#8217;s limited financial resources. 
</p>
<p>12. Good governance was a major area of concern. A National Committee for Human 
Rights and Freedoms, a National Commission to Prevent and Combat Corruption a 
Procurement Commission and an audit chamber in the Supreme Court had recently been set 
up.  
</p>
<p>13. Many women had participated in free, democratic and transparent elections in 2010. 
</p>
<p>14. Genuine efforts were being made to strengthen economic, social and cultural rights. 
They had been endorsed by the international financial community, and had qualified 
Comoros for support under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government supported the private sector and the business environment had 
improved. The Investment Code had been amended and investors enjoyed certain 
advantages over five years.  
</p>
<p>16. The tourism sector, which was a major source of employment, had been revived. 
Technical education was encouraged.  
</p>
<p>17. Labour legislation had been strengthened to enhance protection for workers. The 
legislation governing the social insurance fund had been amended to provide greater clarity 
and facilitate access to health benefits. 
</p>
<p>18. The constitutional right to form and join trade unions was regulated by the Labour 
Code. The Administrative Court and the Labour Inspectorate had jurisdiction to hear 
disputes between workers and employers. 
</p>
<p>19. Food self-sufficiency was a priority. The Government facilitated access to credit for 
fishermen, livestock farmers and crop farmers. Their respective trade unions were involved 
in drafting all public policies that affected them.  
</p>
<p>20. The standard of Comorian housing was generally decent even though it was not of a 
high standard. There had been a significant improvement in the standard of housing in 
recent years. 
</p>
<p>21. The right to health was basic. A strategic plan to strengthen capacity over the period 
2010&#8211;2014 had been adopted. Important measures had been adopted to reduce child and 
maternal mortality. Since 2012, free access to emergency care had been introduced and the 
fee for caesarean sections had been halved. New health facilities had also been established. 
</p>
<p>22. Education was one of the drivers of socioeconomic development. The Educational 
Policy Act had been supplemented by four important documents: a report on the national 
education system, a sectoral framework paper on education, an educational policy paper, a 
mission statement from the head of State to the Minister for Education, Research, Culture 
and Arts with responsibility for Youth and Sport outlining government policy in the area of 
education, and the Education Master Plan for the period 2015&#8211;2020. Cross-cutting </p>


<p>GE.14-13136 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>strategies guaranteeing better access to education for all children had been developed as 
part of the interim education plans 2015&#8211;2020. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to culture, the Government had established and supported cultural 
centres. 
</p>
<p>24. In an effort to enhance the protection of children, counselling services for children 
and women victims of abuse and ill-treatment had been strengthened. There were no 
shelters or reintegration centres for vulnerable children. Youth and vice units had been set 
up in police stations. A wing for minors had been built during the restoration of a prison.  
</p>
<p>25. The awareness-raising campaign on systematic birth registration was continuing. 
The systematic registration of all newborns was ensured thanks to the establishment of 99 
civil registration centres in 2012. 
</p>
<p>26. As part of the fight against child labour, the National Committee for Human Rights 
and Freedoms had organized workshops on the worst forms of child labour for Koranic 
teachers in September 2013. The Government had organized national conferences on the 
worst forms of child labour in November 2013 and on sexual violence and all other forms 
of violence in March 2012. In partnership with the Indian Ocean Commission, the 
Government had organized regional conferences on violence against women and children in 
October 2013. 
</p>
<p>27. The draft revised Criminal Code included provisions prohibiting paedophilia, 
pornography, child trafficking, the worst forms of child labour, procuring, child abduction 
and child enslavement and trafficking. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government&#8217;s work included public policy for persons with disabilities. The 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol were in the 
process of being ratified. Discussions were under way on adapting certain facilities for 
persons with disabilities. A fund had been set up to provide assistance to persons with 
disabilities. There was no discrimination against persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>29. The environment, protection of biodiversity and climate change were major areas of 
concern for the Government. The State had adopted a manifesto committing it to 
sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>30. Between 2009 and 2013, despite its limited resources, Comoros had addressed the 
issue of the interdependence of economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political 
rights. 
</p>

<p>GE.14-13136 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>64. In response to the question from Kuwait, the Comorian delegation stated that 
freedom of expression was guaranteed and that there was freedom of the press. Freedom of 
the press was reflected in the proliferation of media outlets. Powerful trade unions in almost 
all sectors were a vital component of civil society. 
</p>
<p>65. In response to questions from Djibouti, Germany, Mexico, Morocco, Senegal and 
Thailand, the Comorian delegation said that the Government was making the necessary 
effort to increase the financial resources of the National Committee for Human Rights and 
Freedoms, and that the independence of the Committee was guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>66. In response to questions from Kuwait, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco 
and Senegal, the Comorian delegation said that creating jobs and reducing unemployment 
were major concerns. That concern was reflected in the promotion of the private sector, 
which generated the most wealth and employment. The establishment of the Employment 
Centre was an important step. Microfinance was being developed and access to credit 
facilitated.  
</p>
<p>67. In response to questions from Algeria, Morocco and the United Kingdom, the 
Comorian delegation said that the small size of the territory facilitated access to justice and 
that mobile hearings were held regularly. The Government planned to provide legal 
assistance for anyone without adequate means. There were also plans for a community-
based justice system.  
</p><p>68. In response to questions from Botswana, Montenegro, Spain and the United States 
of America, the Comorian delegation said that the bill on the revision of the Criminal Code 
provided for the abolition of the death penalty. The moratorium on executions was 
observed.

delegation said that corruption was a fact of life. Administrative and judicial measures were 
taken regularly in cases where corruption was found. A National Commission to Prevent 
and Combat Corruption had been set up. The high turnover of ministers of justice was not 
related to corruption but to specifically political problems.  
</p>
<p>70. In response to the questions from Djibouti, Libya, Madagascar, Montenegro, 
Morocco, Qatar, Singapore and Thailand, the Comorian delegation stated that the 
Government&#8217;s health policy prioritized maternal and child health. Huge progress had been 
made in ensuring that vulnerable persons had access to health care.  
</p>
<p>71. In response to the questions from Djibouti, Portugal and Thailand, the delegation 
said that women in Comoros had power and did not have lower social status. They were 
protected by traditional mechanisms. For example, in the event of divorce, the husband left 
the marital home and let the wife occupy it. In keeping with tradition, women were given 
preference in inheritance. Women played a powerful role in various community 
associations, particularly in relation to tontines, agriculture and livestock farming. They did 
well in business and had a major influence on political decisions. In the home, they had an 
influence on decision-making. Women figured prominently in public decision-making 
bodies and strategic administrative positions. The minimum age for marriage was 18. The 
Family Code and the Criminal Code prohibited early marriage. 
</p>
<p>72. In response to the questions from Germany, Ghana, Mexico, the United Kingdom 
and the United States of America, the delegation said that Comoros had a very long 
tradition of religious tolerance. There was an unwritten rule of mutual respect between all 
religious communities, and they refrained from proselytizing. Sects were not permitted. On 
that basis, no one was punished for their religious beliefs. However, the Government was 
vigilant against attempts to exploit religion for political motives.  </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-13136 
</p>
<p>73. In response to the questions from Brazil, the Netherlands and Spain, the Comorian 
delegation said that homosexuality was punished under the Criminal Code. There was not 
currently a political majority in the Assembly to amend the law.  
</p><p>74. Uruguay applauded the acceptance of most recommendations made during the first 
UPR cycle and the endeavours to implement them. It noted the creation of government 
departments to promote gender equality and efforts to harmonize national legislation with 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It noted 
the construction of new schools and increased school enrolment. Uruguay made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomed the constitutional reform and the 
development of a national human rights policy. It noted the increased school enrolment and 
the Interim Education Plan for the period 2013&#8211;2015 and that health-related strategies had 
led to free emergency care, nutrition programmes and malaria campaigns. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>

situation and the challenges faced. It welcomed the ratification of, accession to or signing

welcomed the policies to promote human rights and the measures to improve the situation 
of vulnerable people, children, women and persons with disabilities. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
