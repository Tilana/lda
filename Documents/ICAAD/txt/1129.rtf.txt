Lepani Temo, you are charged with the offence of murder in that on the 19th day of November, 2011 at Soqulu in Taveuni you murdered Susanna Niubalavu.

After trial in this Court you have been found guilty in the unanimous opinion of three assessors. In directing myself in my own summing up I agree with the assessors and find you guilty.

The evidence against you is overwhelming. You were seen and identified at the scene of the crime with a cane knife and you admitted your guilt to the Police when being interviewed.

You are convicted of the offence and that is the judgment of the Court.
