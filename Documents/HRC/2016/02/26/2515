<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and affirming that these human rights instruments must be respected in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the recent reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Council on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
as well as of other relevant recent reports of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights 
and ensure respect for international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-
10/17 of 15 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting in particular</i> the Court&#8217;s reply, including that the construction of the wall 
being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated regime are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
force, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further</i> the obligation of the States parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, grave breaches 
and responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all States have the right and the duty to take actions in conformity 
with international law and international humanitarian law to counter deadly acts of violence 
against their civilian population in order to protect the lives of their citizens, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for full compliance with the Israeli-Palestinian agreements 
reached within the context of the Middle East peace process, including the Sharm el-Sheikh 
understandings, and the implementation of the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> the need to end the closure of the Gaza Strip and for the full 
implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for 
the Rafah Crossing, both of 15 November 2005, to allow for the freedom of movement of 
the Palestinian civilian population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip, taking into 
account Israeli concerns, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing systematic violation of the human 
rights of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including that arising from 
the excessive use of force and military operations causing death and injury to Palestinian 
civilians, including children, women and non-violent, peaceful demonstrators; the use of 
collective punishment; the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and 
expansion of settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
departure from the Armistice Line of 1949; the destruction of property and infrastructure; 
and all other actions by it designed to change the legal status, geographical nature and 
demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Gravely concerned</i> <i>in particular</i> about the critical humanitarian and security 
situation in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting from the prolonged closures and severe 
economic and movement restrictions that in effect amount to a blockade and the military 
operations between December 2008 and January 2009, which caused extensive loss of life 
and injury, particularly among Palestinian civilians, including children and women, 
widespread destruction and damage to Palestinian homes, properties, vital infrastructure 
and public institutions, including hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities and the 
internal displacement of civilians, as well as about the firing of rockets into Israel, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> <i>deep concern</i> about the short- and long-term detrimental impact of such 
widespread destruction and the continued impeding of the reconstruction process by Israel, 
the occupying Power, on the human rights situation and on the socioeconomic and 
humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian civilian population,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing deep concern</i> <i>also</i> at the Israeli policy of closures and the imposition of 
severe restrictions, checkpoints, several of which have been transformed into structures 
akin to permanent border crossings, and a permit regime, all of which obstruct the freedom 
of movement of persons and goods, including medical and humanitarian goods, throughout 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and impair the Territory&#8217;s 
contiguity, and at the consequent violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and 
the negative impact on their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed at rehabilitating 
and developing the Palestinian economy, which remains that of a humanitarian crisis in the 
Gaza Strip, while taking note of recent developments with regard to the situation of access 
there, </p>


<p><i> Expressing deep concern</i> <i>further</i> that thousands of Palestinians, including many 
children and women and elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, continue 
to be detained and held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under harsh conditions, 
including, inter alia, unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, lack of proper medical 
care, denial of family visits and denial of due process, that impair their well-being, and 
expressing deep concern also about the ill-treatment and harassment of any Palestinian 
prisoners and all reports of torture, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> about the possible consequences of the enactment by Israel, the 
occupying Power, of military orders regarding the detention, imprisonment and deportation 
of Palestinian civilians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and recalling in this regard the prohibition under international humanitarian law of the 
deportation of civilians from occupied territories, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> <i>of the need</i> for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population and to 
help the parties implement the agreements reached and, in this regard, recalling the positive 
contribution of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the continued efforts and tangible progress made in the security 
sector by the Palestinian Government, calling upon the parties to continue cooperation that 
benefits both Palestinians and Israelis, in particular by promoting security and building 
confidence, and expressing the hope that such progress will be extended to all major 
population centres, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the right of all people in the region to the enjoyment of human rights as 
enshrined in the international human rights covenants, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reiterates</i> that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in violation of the relevant 
provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time 
of War, of 12 August 1949, and contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, 
are illegal and have no validity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all practices and actions that 
violate the human rights of the Palestinian people, including the killing and injury of 
civilians, the arbitrary detention and imprisonment of civilians and the destruction and 
confiscation of civilian property, and that it fully respect human rights law and comply with 
its legal obligations in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> over the conditions of the Palestinian prisoners and 
detainees in Israeli jails and detention centres, demands that Israel, the occupying Power, 
fully respect and abide by its international law obligations towards all Palestinian prisoners 
and detainees in its custody, and further expresses its concern about the continued extensive 
use of administrative detention, calls for a full implementation of the agreement reached in 
May 2012, for a prompt and independent investigation into all cases of death custody, and 
also calls upon Israel to release any Palestinian prisoner whose detention is not in 
accordance with international law; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with the provisions 
of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and cease immediately all measures and actions 
taken in violation and in breach of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all of its settlement 
activities, the construction of the wall and any other measures aimed at altering the 
character, status and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in and around East Jerusalem, all of which have, inter alia, a grave and </p>


<p>detrimental impact on the human rights of the Palestinian people and the prospects for a 
peaceful settlement; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Condemns</i> all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation, 
incitement and destruction, especially the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying 
forces against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, which have caused 
extensive loss of life and vast numbers of injuries, including among children, massive 
damage and destruction to homes, properties, vital infrastructure and public institutions, 
including hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities, and agricultural lands, mosques 
and private media institutions, and internal displacement of civilians; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also condemns </i>the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas resulting in 
loss of life and injury; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal obligations 
under international law, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by 
the International Court of Justice and as demanded in General Assembly resolutions ES-
10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003, and that it immediately cease the 
construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East 
Jerusalem, dismantle forthwith the structure situated therein, repeal or render ineffective all 
legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and make reparation for all damage caused 
by the construction of the wall, which has had a grave impact on the human rights and the 
socioeconomic living conditions of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reiterates</i> the need for respect for the territorial unity, contiguity and 
integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and for guarantees of the freedom of 
movement of persons and goods within the Palestinian territory, including movement into 
and from East Jerusalem, into and from the Gaza Strip, between the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip, and to and from the outside world; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to cease its imposition of prolonged 
closures and economic and movement restrictions, including those amounting to a blockade 
on the Gaza Strip, and, in this regard, to fully implement the Agreement on Movement and 
Access and the Agreed Principles for the Rafah Crossing, in order to allow for the sustained 
and regular movement of persons and goods and for the acceleration of long overdue 
reconstruction in the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>Member States to continue to provide emergency assistance to the 
Palestinian people to alleviate the financial crisis and the dire socioeconomic and 
humanitarian situation, particularly in the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to preserve and develop the Palestinian institutions and

and the promotion of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the present 
resolution to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session;
