<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At its sixth session, the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent 
examined the theme of racial profiling.  The Working Group acknowledged that racial profiling 
is a violation of the right to non-discrimination and recalled that international and regional norms 
make clear that racial discrimination in the administration of justice is unlawful.  The Working 
Group urged States to clearly define and adopt explicit legislative provisions banning racial 
profiling; to take positive action to secure the real participation of people of African descent and 
other vulnerable groups at all levels throughout law enforcement agencies; and invited States to 
establish disaggregated data collection and oversight mechanisms to combat racial profiling.  
The Working Group also welcomed the General Assembly decision to convene in 2009 a review 
conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent held its sixth session 
from 29 January to 2 February 2007 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, opened the session.  The 
Working Group elected Peter Lesa Kasanda as its Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report reflects the general course of the debate. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the sixth session, the Working Group held six public meetings and three 
private meetings.  It was attended by the following members:  Peter Lesa Kasanda 
(Chairperson-Rapporteur), Joe Frans, Georges Nicolas Jabbour, and Irina Moroianu-Zl&#259;tescu; 
observers for 60 Member States and 1 observer from a non-member State, 12 non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), and 2 intergovernmental organizations.  The list of participants and the 
agenda are contained in the annexes.  All working papers submitted by the experts and 
participants are available at the Secretariat or can be found on the OHCHR web site.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUBSTANTIVE SUMMARY OF DELIBERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General statements 
</b></p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner for Human Rights delivered the opening address. 
</p>
<p>6. The High Commissioner stated that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
not only records a solemn commitment by States to work together but also offers a functional 
common agenda for the international community to counter racism in all its manifestations. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner stressed the important achievement of the Durban Conference, 
which addressed the appalling tragedy of slavery.  She saluted the adoption of General Assembly 
resolution 61/19, unanimously declaring 26 March 2007 a day for the worldwide 
commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave 
trade, as a confirmation of the commitment undertaken in Durban to repudiate slavery as a major 
human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner voiced her concern over the practice of racial profiling, which 
violates certain fundamental human rights guarantees.  She stressed that the practice of racial 
profiling violates the principle of equality before the law, as well as international legal norms 
aimed at eliminating racism and racial discrimination.  She reaffirmed the fundamental premise 
enshrined in article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and re-emphasized the 
incompatibility of the practice of racial profiling with respect for human rights and the principle 
of non-discrimination.  She encouraged the Working Group to adopt concrete recommendations 
to assist Governments in tackling the problem of racial profiling.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group elected Peter Lesa Kasanda as its Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the High Commissioner for the support given to the 
mandate of the Working Group.  The provisional agenda and programme of work were adopted. 
</p>
<p>11. In introducing item 5 of the agenda, the Chairperson-Rapporteur submitted that people of 
African descent continue to be victims of racial discrimination and exclusion in many parts of 
the world, in particular as regards access to health, livelihood, social security, education and 
income-generating activities. 
</p>
<p>12. The Chairperson-Rapporteur saluted the adoption of General Assembly resolution 61/149 
in which it decided to convene by no later than in 2009 a review conference on the 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  It also requests the 
Human Rights Council to undertake preparations for this event, as well as to formulate a 
concrete plan and provide updates and reports on an annual basis starting in 2007. 
</p>
<p>13. He recalled that the Working Group had so far pursued the implementation of its mandate 
by undertaking a substantial thematic analysis of issues of relevance for people of African 
descent, including measures to overcome their social exclusion, as well as actions and policies 
fostering their participation in the basic political, economic and social functioning of the society 
in which they live. 
</p>
<p>14. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stressed that the Working Group would be devoting its 
attention during the sixth session to making concrete recommendations on the elimination of 
racial profiling that affects people of African descent and Africans in all parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>15. During the general debate, several government observers and NGOs shared information 
on activities and measures undertaken at the national level to implement the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action, and on the thematic issue to be discussed during the sixth session. 
</p>
<p>16. The observer for Algeria, on behalf of the African Group, underlined the importance of 
the work of the Working Group.  He reiterated the support of the African Group for the Working 
Group and encouraged it to increase the number of country visits, during which members would 
have the chance to discuss important issues with relevant authorities such as representatives of 
public services, schools, hospitals and law enforcement agencies, amongst others.  He stressed 
that people of African descent, despite various international efforts, continue to pay a high price 
for past practices and there is a lack of real integration.  He pointed out that the effective 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is a long process and, to 
this day, there are only a few effective efforts towards implementation.  He stressed that the IMF 
and World Bank should be involved in the process of devising effective measures in the fight 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  He added that it is also 
very important that Governments put in place national action plans and strategies to fight racism, 
racial profiling, xenophobia and related intolerance.  He added that special attention should be 
devoted to women of African descent. 
</p>
<p>17. An observer for an NGO emphasized that in the past years, in the Americas, the 
frequency of the practice of racial profiling has increased.  She underlined that it is important </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that Member States and other representatives realize that there are no participants from NGOs 
and civil society representing people of African descent from Latin America at the session, due 
to lack of funding. 
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Frans recalled the remark of the High Commissioner concerning General Assembly 
resolution 61/19 on the commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the 
trans-Atlantic slave trade.  He made public his solemn request to Member States to raise 
awareness of the abolition of slavery and use it as a stepping stone for further discussions on 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  He stated that Governments 
should do their best to ensure that children learn about the past and that the history of slavery and 
the slave trade must be included in school curricula.  With regard to the envisaged review 
conference on the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, Mr. Frans stressed that it is 
essential that the various stakeholders take their time to reflect on the issue and submit concrete 
recommendations to the Working Group, thus contributing in a constructive way to the effective 
organization of the review conference.  Mr. Frans also stressed that there is a need for further 
research on slavery.  He underlined that it is extremely important to have representatives of 
NGOs and civil society participating in the sessions of the Working Group.  He added that it 
would be very useful if, over the following days, States and NGOs could inform the experts on 
the Working Group as to the progress of implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>19. An observer for an NGO supported Mr. Frans&#8217; statement that it is essential to have NGOs 
and civil society involved in such consultative meetings. 
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Jabbour stated that with regard to the review conference, regional organizations have 
a special role to play.  They should organize regional meetings in order to review what has been 
implemented in the context of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Zl&#259;tescu appealed to the Working Group to work hard in order to produce a better 
definition of racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>22. The observer for South Africa supported the statement of the representative of Algeria.  
She emphasized that racial profiling is a serious problem, as well as the victimization and social 
exclusion of people of African descent.  After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the 
occurrences of racial profiling have increased around the world.  In addition to skin colour and 
descent, religious symbols and religion have been added to the grounds for racial profiling.  
There are many unreasonable police interrogations, arrests, imprisonments and other actions due 
to suspicions of terrorism.  She stressed that international instruments are not enough and added 
that it is important to remember that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action also refer 
to &#8220;political will&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. One observer for an NGO pointed out that Member States are reluctant to implement 
international standards and the occurrence of racial profiling is the outcome of this reluctance.  
He recommended that the Working Group collaborate closely with the respective treaty bodies.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. Mr. Kasanda recalled that more and more States have signed and ratified the respective 
international treaties, which demonstrates the increasing importance they attach to ending 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  He made the point that it 
would be very helpful if participants could report on the implementation of Durban. 
</p>
<p>25. The observer for Egypt pointed out that the recommendations of the Working Group are 
sometimes not clear enough or not addressed to a relevant authority.  In this regard, it is 
important that the Working Group collaborates closely with the treaty monitoring mechanisms so 
as to facilitate the effective implementation of recommendations.  He added that he supported the 
statement of the observer for Algeria. 
</p>
<p>26. An observer for an NGO read a declaration of support and recommendations to the 
Working Group on behalf of all NGOs present at the sixth session.  He began his comments by 
emphasizing the need to bring to the attention of the international community the increasing 
number of violations of the human rights of people of African descent around the world.  He 
stressed that the Working Group must become the voice of the international community in 
identifying and promoting relevant, sustainable and effective solutions towards the elimination 
of all forms of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia affecting people of African descent 
all over the world.  He noted the importance of the work done by the Working Group and 
emphasized that it must maintain its work on the human rights of people of African descent.  He 
underlined that the budget of the Working Group should come from a regular United Nations 
fund.  Currently, a lack of funding restricts the ability of the Working Group to work directly 
with the victims of racism in their own countries.  He added that the involvement of civil society 
in the sessions of the Working Group was important and to this end there was a need for a fund 
to help with the travel expenses of participants, so as to permit greater participation by people of 
African descent. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Thematic analysis:  discussion on and analysis of racial profiling 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced agenda item 6 by calling the attention of the 
Working Group to the need to make concrete recommendations on the elimination of racial 
profiling.  He stated that racial profiling existed in all regions of the world and that the absence 
of information is not an indication that the phenomenon does not exist. 
</p>
<p><b> Item 6 (a): The definition of racial profiling and the international  
  framework prohibiting racial profiling 
</b></p>
<p>28. Le&#239;la Zerrougui, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
presented a paper focused on the definition of racial profiling.  She stressed that racial profiling 
is a violation of the right to non-discrimination, which is firmly anchored in international law, as 
it is considered to be an integral part of customary international law.  She explained that a 
problematic issue with regard to racial profiling is the lack of one widely accepted definition.  
Instead, there are several definitions, which makes it more difficult to prove the occurrence of 
racial profiling.  She pointed out that two very different definitions of racial profiling have 
emerged, one narrow and restrictive, and the other fairly broad.  Under the restrictive definition, 
racial profiling is defined as an activity on the part of law enforcement officers based exclusively 
on race.  The other category is comprised of broad definitions, where all possible grounds for 
discrimination, in addition to race, are taken into consideration.  Furthermore, Ms. Zerrougui </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>underlined that there is a difference between racial profiling and criminal profiling.  The main 
difference is that racial profiling relies on race while criminal profiling relies on behaviour.  She 
underlined the importance of statistics on racial profiling to determine the magnitude of the 
problem, general trends and the methods that can be best used to combat it. 
</p>
<p>29. Irina Moroianu-Zl&#259;tescu, member of the Working Group on People of African Descent, 
began her presentation by providing an overview of the United Nations international framework 
applicable to the prohibition of racial profiling, including instruments, mechanisms and 
procedures.  She explained that the provisions contained in international human rights 
instruments are only a general framework for approaching the issue of racial profiling.  She 
underlined that for effective prohibition of such practices, aimed at eradicating the phenomenon, 
there is a need for specific legislative measures.  Good practice also needs to be circulated, in 
particular to law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>30. Georges Jabbour, member of the Working Group on People of African Descent, reviewed 
two definitions of racial profiling:  one by police and one in the administration of justice.  He 
stressed that the practice of racial profiling is ineffective in fighting crime, in addition to being 
contradictory to international human rights law.  He stressed that racial profiling ought to be 
criminalized in national legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (b):  The problem of racial profiling in the administration of justice 
</b>31. R&#233;gis de Gouttes, Chairman of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD), provided a detailed overview of CERD general recommendation XXXI 
on the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal 
justice system.  He explained that people of African descent are covered by the general 
recommendation and that it covers not only racial profiling but all manifestations of racial or 
ethnic discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal justice system.  Racial 
profiling is explicitly addressed in paragraph 20 of the general recommendation.  He explained 
that the definition of racial profiling contained in paragraph 72 of the Durban Programme of 
Action is larger in scope than that contained in paragraph 20 of the general recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (c):  Regional work on and experience of the issue of racial profiling 
</b>32. Claudia Lam, a lawyer at the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance 
(ECRI), made a presentation on the work of ECRI in relation to the issue of racial profiling.  
This started with a country-by-country approach and will now deal with the issue by means of its 
general policy recommendations.  A provisional draft definition of racial profiling used by ECRI 
focuses on the use of racial profiling by law enforcement officials.  ECRI has chosen to use the 
notion of racial profiling and not ethnic profiling as this term would be too narrow.  ECRI 
defines racial discrimination as discrimination on grounds of race, colour, language, religion, 
nationality, or national or ethnic origin.  This definition stresses that racial profiling is a form of 
racial discrimination, based on the ECRI definition of racial discrimination, itself based on the 
case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  The definition does not refer to stereotypes, 
as do many other definitions.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>33. Ms. Lam stated that the draft general policy recommendation contains the following 
recommendations:  to clearly define and prohibit racial profiling; to collect data and carry out 
research and monitoring on racial profiling; to introduce a reasonable suspicion standard; and 
to provide police with training on the definition of racial profiling.  She clarified that prohibition 
does not necessarily imply criminal law provisions, as constitutional law, civil and/or 
administrative law can be more appropriate tools in some cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (d):  The human impact of racial profiling 
</b>34. G&#233;r&#244;me Topka, secretary-general of the Carrefour de r&#233;flexion et d&#8217;action contre le 
racisme anti-noir, Switzerland, made a presentation on racial profiling against people of African 
descent in Switzerland.  Mr. Topka stressed that racism against people of African descent was a 
specific form of racism.  He discussed the current state of affairs in Switzerland with reference to 
certain high profile cases in the Swiss courts and the attitude of the Swiss media towards racism.  
He also discussed racial bias against and stereotyping of people of African descent and spoke of 
the trivialization of racism against people of African descent.  He recommended, inter alia, more 
education on the issue of racism in schools, police forces, the public sector and the justice 
system; greater racial diversity in police forces; the creation of an anti-discrimination charter; the 
creation of a racism monitoring body; greater innovation in the fight against racist attitudes 
towards people of African descent; and for measures to be taken to generate greater awareness in 
society of the problem of racism against people of African descent.  He discussed the positive 
work the Carrefour had achieved in collaboration with the media and police but stressed that 
further collaboration was necessary to improve the situation of people of African descent in 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>35. Joe Frans, member of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, made 
a presentation on the impact of racial profiling on people of African descent in Europe.  He noted 
that racial profiling is a serious human rights problem affecting millions of people of African 
descent residing in Europe.  In his opinion, there is a sufficient constitutional and legal 
framework in most European countries to challenge the legality of racial profiling against people 
of African descent.  He stressed that there is incontrovertible proof that racial profiling does not 
give law enforcement officials an advantage in fighting crime.  Profiling is counterproductive 
insofar as it misdirects law enforcement resources and alienates some of the very people whose 
cooperation is necessary for effective crime detection. 
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Frans stressed the psychological, social and economic effects of racial profiling on its 
victims.  Furthermore, it is quite clear that one of the most significant and potentially 
long-lasting impacts of racial profiling is its effect on children and youth.  He pointed out that a 
possible side effect of the practice of racial profiling is the risk of criminalizing entire 
communities.  He explained that the true extent and nature of racial profiling remains difficult to 
gauge because of the absence or ineffectiveness of official data collection in several European 
countries.  Many countries do not have adequate official data collection mechanisms in place to 
record and make information publicly available on racial profiling.  The consequences of racial 
profiling are felt far beyond the law enforcement sector.  It impacts unfavourably in an 
aggregated manner as racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>37. Mr. Frans put forward the following recommendations to be considered by the 
Working Group:  the systematic collection of disaggregated data on racist crimes and profiling; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the development and adoption of legal norms prohibiting profiling; the development and 
implementation of a strategy to recruit people of African descent residing in Europe to the law 
enforcement field; the strengthening of community relations; and the commissioning of a special 
study on the phenomenon of the impact of racial profiling on people of African descent residing 
in Europe. 
</p>
<p>38. Peter Lesa Kasanda, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group of Experts on People 
of African Descent, made a presentation focused on the human impact of racial profiling.  He 
stressed that racial profiling is a violation of human rights law.  He also stressed that its practice 
is not only limited to people of African descent.  He further stressed that racial practices occur in 
many contexts.  He then presented an overview of studies on racial profiling in different 
countries. 
</p>
<p>39. Mr. Kasanda said that racial profiling is an attack on human dignity, inflicting 
psychological and emotional pain on its victims.  Racial profiling leaves its victims angry, 
frustrated and humiliated.  He stressed that racial profiling erodes public confidence in law 
enforcement agencies, especially among youths.  Racial profiling diminishes the sense of 
citizenship of its victims, as they feel alienated from society.  It disrupts the relationship between 
the community and law enforcement officers by branding whole communities as suspects and 
encouraging prejudice against law enforcement agencies by the targeted population. 
<b> Item 6 (e): The problem of impunity and accountability  
  relating to acts of racial profiling 
</b></p>
<p>40. Robert L. Wilkins, partner at Venable LLP, Washington D.C., made a presentation on 
fighting impunity and forcing accountability within law enforcement with regard to racial 
profiling in the United States of America.  He stressed that, although there have been 
improvements in some areas, racial profiling is still a serious problem in the United States.  
Mr. Wilkins focused his attention on traffic stops and automobile searches.  He recalled an 
incident of racial profiling of which he and his family were the victims and the legal action his 
family took thereafter against the law enforcement authorities.  He then proceeded to propose 
what would be in his view essential components of a successful campaign for accountability.  
According to him, a successful strategy would include three key components:  first, there must 
be a concerted effort to engage the citizenry, the political leadership, and the law enforcement 
community on the problem of racial profiling and to make the issue a priority; second, it is 
essential to have data collection; third, any effective strategy must strive to create a culture of 
accountability within law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>41. Margaret Parsons, African Canadian Legal Clinic, made a presentation focusing on the 
problem of accountability relating to acts of racial profiling.  She stressed the importance of 
independent accountability mechanisms that address organizational change and hold institutions 
and individuals accountable, to counter impunity for racial profiling.  Ms. Parsons spoke of the 
measures taken by the African Canadian community to increase the accountability of public 
institutions and State actors, notably by raising awareness of racism within the police forces, 
providing the police with anti-racism training, and requiring a clear definition of reasonable 
suspicion.  She discussed best practice with regard to accountability, emphasizing the need for 
oversight mechanisms, diversity in the police forces and clearer police guidelines on reasonable 
suspicion.  She stressed that anti-racist auditing is an important means of making police forces </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>fulfil public and legislative expectations.  Without audits, law enforcement agencies lose 
perspective on the impact they have on the communities they serve.  To be effective, anti-racist 
auditing must focus on producing an overall culture shift within police forces.  Ms. Parsons 
explained that audits can also be useful in assessing the usefulness and impact of police 
education and training.  She added that the only way to move the discussion about racial 
profiling from rhetoric and anecdotal experiences to a more rational dialogue that supports 
accountability and transparency, is to collect disaggregated information that will allay 
community concerns and help people of African descent and law enforcement agencies ascertain 
the scope and magnitude of the problem. 
</p>
<p>42. Ignacio Cano, professor at the Department of Social Sciences, State University of 
Rio de Janeiro, made a presentation on racial bias in lethal police action in Brazil.  Mr. Cano 
explained that Brazil is a society sharply structured by socio-economic differences and the 
debate on inequality and discrimination has often centred on whether these differences originate 
in class or in race.  He discussed racial prejudice in the public security system in Brazil and gave 
an overview of the different manifestations of racial bias.  He then went on to present the 
findings of a study he had carried out.  He highlighted the need for data collection to determine 
the existence and impact of racial profiling in law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (f): De jure discrimination and the institutional dimension 
of the discrimination ascribed to the police and other 
law enforcement services 
</b></p>
<p>43. Le&#239;la Zerrougui, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
made a presentation on de jure discrimination and the institutional dimension of the 
discrimination ascribed to the police and other law enforcement services.  Ms. Zerrougui noted 
that discrimination is frequently practised in judicial and law enforcement systems in many 
countries around the world.  Identifiable discrimination practices are often linked to endemic 
forms of racism.  An analysis of discriminatory practices in the administration of justice reveals 
that discrimination is not only the result of the behaviour of individuals who have the authority 
to apply laws, but can also be de jure and institutional, structurally integrated in the organization 
and functioning of police forces, judicial systems and prison services.  She explained that 
policies can be either explicitly discriminatory (direct and de jure discrimination) or indirect 
(institutional).  Indirect discrimination has the effect of direct discrimination in practice.  She 
pointed out that there is a need to look beyond the formal idea of equality to the effect of a policy 
in practice.  Ms. Zerrougui stressed that it is with the help of statistics that the institutional 
dimension of racial profiling has been shown in practice.  She commented that the weakness of 
minority representation in law enforcement helps perpetuate stereotypes founded on race, ethnic 
origin, colour or religion. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (g): Terror, crime and suspect communities:  evidence of 
and solutions to ethnic profiling by police 
</b></p>
<p>44. Rachel Neild, Open Society Justice Initiative, presented a paper on ethnic profiling by 
police in Europe.  What prevails in Europe is ethnic profiling on the grounds of race, ethnicity, 
nationality or religion.  She pointed out that, although it is widespread in Europe, it is not 
sufficiently documented and not explicitly prohibited under European law.  Furthermore, she 
noted that terrorist profiling is mainly based on religious affiliation.  Another issue of concern </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that she raised was the concept of radicalization, where the objective is to detect people who are 
in the process of &#8220;radicalizing&#8221;.  Ms. Neild noted that before putting in place a discriminatory 
measure it is important to estimate its proportionality - cost and effectiveness.  Some of the 
negative effects of profiling that were mentioned include stigmatization of entire suspect 
communities, increase of crime and disorder due to reduced trust in police and the reduced 
cooperation of citizens with police.  She pointed out that profiles are quite predictable, and 
terrorist groups have demonstrated that they manage to avoid them.  She stressed the need for 
legal prohibition, ethnic data collection, improving the treatment of minorities and furthering 
police-minority relations. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (h):  Profiling in countering terrorism 
</b>45. Martin Scheinin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, raised once more the importance of 
the issue of definition in regard to profiling.  He explained that, in his view, profiling is an 
acceptable means of law enforcement activity when profiles are statistically proven.  
Mr. Scheinin explained that in the context of counter-terrorism, permissible profiling should be 
based on the principle of proportionality and legitimacy of aim.  He also clarified that, as in 
many cases religion is not readily identifiable, law enforcement officers use profiling based on 
ethnicity and nationality.  He emphasized that any profiling is counter-productive and ineffective 
against terrorism, as terrorist groups are adaptive and manage to pass undetected under the usual 
stereotypes.  He suggested that universal or random searches, done in a professional way, are 
more efficient than profiling, as they are non-discriminatory and impossible for terrorists to 
evade.  Mr. Scheinin stressed that profiling, if used, should be based on behaviour rather than 
ethnic or religious characteristics.  In this regard, States need to establish clear guidelines for law 
enforcement on the measures that are permissible in counter-terrorism operations.  He also 
explained the need to document and monitor terrorist profiling practices, to establish oversight of 
law enforcement agencies, and ensure their compliance with human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (i): The meaning of racial profiling in the  
context of the increase of racism 
</b></p>
<p>46. Edna Santos Roland, independent eminent expert on the follow-up to Durban, stated that 
racial profiling does not necessarily manifest itself in the same way in all regions.  She said that 
in Latin America, societies have been racist for a long time and people of African descent have 
suffered the most from racism.  The Durban Conference has created opportunities for a dialogue 
between people of African descent and Governments.  Despite this dialogue, people of African 
descent continue to be the victims of racial discrimination and their representatives have not 
been monitoring the increase in racial profiling resulting from the implementation of the war 
against terror. 
</p>
<p>47. Doudou Di&#232;ne, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, noted that racial profiling is an indicator 
of the extent of racism, discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  He explained that 
certain communities became visible as their groups became the target of racial profiling.  He 
pointed out that racism is based on the social construction of the concept of identity.  
Furthermore, the &#8220;naturalization&#8221; of racism which makes people believe that racism is part of 
human nature is a most dangerous, ideological, and manipulative tool.  He explained that the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sources of each trend in racism can be traced to the social construction of identity and it is 
essential to deconstruct it.  He believes that the upsurge of racism in the past years is due to the 
return of old stereotypes.  According to him, identity crises are the reason for the increase of 
racial profiling.  With regard to immigration, he stressed that host countries often put in place 
policies which force people to forget and abandon their past cultural identity to prove that they 
have integrated into their host society.  He suggested that the construction of multiculturalism in 
an interactive, democratic and non-discriminatory process is the way to overcome racism and 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (j): Measures to combat racial profiling, including 
preventive positive measures 
</b></p>
<p>48. &#214;m&#252;r Orhun, Personal Representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Combating Intolerance and Discrimination 
against Muslims, made a presentation focusing on preventive positive measures to combat racial 
profiling, with specific reference to Muslims.  He stressed that the rise of Islamophobia is of 
great concern.  To remedy this negative and disturbing phenomenon, sound strategies and 
educational approaches must be developed and vigorously implemented.  Increasing 
understanding and respect for cultural and religious diversity would be the first step in 
identifying and developing criteria for good practice in combating intolerance and discrimination 
against Muslims.  In order to effectively achieve this, condemnation of such behaviour must be 
accompanied by effective legislative and judicial measures, as well as education. 
</p><p>49. Anastasia Crickley, Personal Representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE on 
Combating Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination, also focusing on intolerance and 
discrimination against Christians and members of other religions, and Chairperson of the 
European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), began her 
presentation by emphasizing that there is no room for complacency in fighting racism and much 
more needs to be done.  She spoke of the struggle to achieve a multicultural society that is just 
and equal.  She stressed that maximum use needs to be made of existing international and 
regional conventions in the fight against racial profiling.  In this regard, she made reference to 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and commented on the importance of national 
plans of action in addressing racial profiling.  She spoke of the need to address direct and 
indirect discrimination by mainstreaming it into the legal framework within countries and 
through education.  In this regard, political will and leadership is paramount in effectively 
combating racial profiling. Ms. Crickley added that in addressing racial profiling, there is a need 
to go beyond police forces to the immigration and prison services and the judiciary.  There needs 
to be a mainstreaming of the whole institutional approach to racial profiling, to include not only 
pre-service but also in-service training.  Furthermore, the promotion of the culture of leadership 
needs to be built on anti-racist values.  She spoke of the need to embed action on racial profiling 
in laws to address racism and racial discrimination, recognizing in particular the ways in which 
direct and indirect racism are embedded in the structures of our various systems.  She added that 
there is a need to take positive action in law enforcement agencies to secure real participation of 
targeted minorities at all levels.  Furthermore, stakeholders at all levels need to be engaged in the 
development of actions to address racial profiling.  She explained that any action on racial 
profiling needs to be supported by independent data collection mechanisms.  In conclusion, 
Ms. Crickley spoke of the need to go beyond racism and discrimination and look at the parallels </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>between racial profiling and poverty and exclusion.  In addition, she emphasized the need to 
recognize that the complexities of racial discrimination and racial profiling may be experienced 
differently by different groups and require different responses. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (k):  Data collection on ethnic profiling 
</b>50. Panagiotis Dimitrakopoulos, head of unit, Research and Data Collection at the European 
Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, made a presentation on the work and research of 
the Centre.  The focus of his presentation was on the collection of data on ethnic profiling in 
Europe.  He gave a brief overview of the EUMC and stated that its prime objective was to collect 
and analyse data and information on the phenomena of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in 
order to support the Community and its member States when they take measures or formulate 
courses of action within their respective spheres of competence.  He stressed the importance of 
statistical data in the fight against racism in order to document the extent and nature of racism 
and inform on the development and implementation of policies combating racism.  He noted that 
ethnic profiling has come to increasing prominence in the European Union in recent years, 
primarily as a reflection of terrorism threats, security measures and concerns about rising illegal 
immigration. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 6 (l): The benefits from overall representativeness in 
the police and criminal justice systems 
</b></p>
<p>51. Tom Hadden, Professor of Law, Queen&#8217;s University, Belfast, focused his presentation on 
developing preventive strategies in the fight against racial profiling.  He stressed that it was more 
useful to approach a practice such as racial profiling by seeking to reform institutions rather than 
simply condemning and prohibiting the practice.  His presentation drew on the experience of 
institutional racism in the British police and communal problems in Northern Ireland.  He 
stressed that the practice of racial profiling is clearly discriminatory and counter-productive.  He 
underlined the fact that profiling or differential treatment does not necessarily constitute 
unlawful discrimination.  In cases where there is an underlying objective and rational 
justification for differential treatment, whether statistical or other, differential treatment is 
acceptable. 
</p>
<p>52. Mr. Hadden offered some general comments on strategies that might be developed to 
prevent acceptable forms of criminal profiling and security risk assessment from degenerating 
into unacceptable forms of racial or communal profiling. <b> </b> He highlighted the need for data 
collection to establish whether police powers are being used in a racially or communally 
discriminatory manner.  He stressed the importance of ensuring that law enforcement agencies 
are fully representative of the communities which they serve.  Where this cannot be achieved in 
practice, there is a need to develop structures for discussion and liaison with representatives of 
minority communities<i>.</i>  A further measure of accountability with regard to minorities can be 
achieved by the creation of national or regional mechanisms to monitor and oversee the full 
range of policing of security policies and to undertake more detailed investigations into 
particular incidents or issues. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group acknowledges that racial profiling is a violation of the right to 
non-discrimination, which is firmly anchored in international law.  Racial profiling breaches 
several rules of international law, since the prohibition of discrimination is mentioned in 
Article 55 (c) of the Charter of the United Nations, and in almost all international instruments on 
the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group recalls that international and regional norms make clear that racial 
discrimination in the administration of justice is unlawful.  The Working Group urges States to 
clearly define and adopt explicit legislative provisions banning racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group reiterates the definition of racial profiling in paragraph 72 of the 
Durban Programme of Action which comprises the practice of police and other law enforcement 
officers relying, to any degree, on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the basis 
for subjecting persons to investigatory activities, or for determining whether an individual is 
engaged in criminal activity. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group stresses that racial profiling has been recognized as a specific 
problem as a result of the systematic and historic targeting of persons of African descent, with 
severe consequences in creating and perpetuating a profoundly negative stigmatization and 
stereotyping of persons of African descent as having a propensity to criminality. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group acknowledges that religion should be included as one of the 
prohibited grounds on which racial profiling can be manifested. 
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group affirms that in most cases where racial profiling has been applied, no 
significant results have been achieved in terms of enhanced security and great harm has been 
done to people of African descent and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group welcomes the General Assembly decision to convene in 2009 a 
review conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group is convinced that States must take action and pursue policies that 
reduce de facto inequalities and help groups facing deep-rooted discrimination to overcome their 
adverse situation vis-&#224;-vis other members of the community. 
</p>
<p>61. The Working Group believes that Governments should implement and enforce 
appropriate and effective legislation to prevent acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group believes that States should review and reform immigration laws and 
practices in order to ensure that they are in accordance with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group reaffirms that diversity is an asset.  It believes that mutual 
understanding and interaction are important tools for combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and can prevent the occurrence of racial profiling. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group believes that anti-racist auditing and monitoring, both internal and 
external, are essential means of making sure that law enforcement agents respect the principle of 
non-discrimination, which will increase the trust and cooperation of the population and boost the 
efficiency of their actions. 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group believes that tolerance and coexistence are the lowest common 
denominators for a society free of racism and discrimination.  States should adopt appropriate 
measures that aim to create and/or strengthen cohesive communities, where every individual has 
a real sense of belonging to his or her community and State, as well as a stake in its well-being. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group condemns the utilization of racist and discriminatory concepts by 
political and community leaders.  Their leadership is essential for prioritizing issues related to 
the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group believes that States should prioritize, in the short-term, the 
improvement of the professional conduct of law enforcement officers during stop and search 
actions.  The Working Group recognizes that in conjunction with this, and to prove a real 
commitment to accountable and equitable policing, must go the creation of effective complaints 
mechanisms that include external, civilian-led components. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group is convinced that complaints mechanisms should be strengthened 
and that complaints about discrimination against people of African descent by law enforcement 
officers must be investigated with the utmost seriousness by the relevant bodies. 
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group condemns institutionalized discrimination and believes that States 
should eradicate such practices as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group emphasizes the need for relevant, disaggregated and detailed data in 
order to monitor the occurrence of racial profiling and to propose corrective measures.  In this 
respect, the Working Group urges States and relevant agencies to collect and publicize data on 
their actions and on the profile of those subject to these actions, while complying with 
international best practice in the protection of personal data. 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group encourages research, both by law enforcement organizations and by 
external and independent actors, in order to detect and prove the existence of racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group believes the utilization of criteria such as race, religion, ethnicity, 
nationality or skin colour in police procedures, aimed at identifying trends in criminal acts or 
establishing a propensity for legal violations, leads to the stigmatization of people of African 
descent and other groups which have historically been discriminated against and assigned 
inferior status in society.  The Working Group reaffirms that such practices violate the principles 
of non-discrimination and equality. 
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group affirms that terrorist profiling practices that are based on race violate 
international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group affirms that discrimination and intolerance against Muslims have 
devastating effects not only on the daily lives of Muslim communities, but also on the societies 
where they live.  To remedy this negative and disturbing phenomenon, sound strategies and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>educational campaigns must be developed and vigorously implemented.  Increasing 
understanding and respect for cultural and religious diversity would be the first step in 
identifying and developing good practice in combating intolerance and discrimination against 
Muslims. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group urges States:</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To design and implement a system of education and training for law 
enforcement officers and military personnel that will ensure that they are 
familiar with international human rights norms against racism, discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and where racial profiling is a violation of 
certain international law provisions;</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To ensure that issues of racial profiling and non-discrimination are integrated 
into all aspects of training and education, including ongoing training and 
professional development, for law enforcement agencies.  This should include 
thorough training in standards and alternatives to racial profiling;</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; <b>To abolish and prohibit any discrimination in legislation within their 
jurisdiction and to criminalize racial profiling, envisaging sanctions for those 
who violate the law and ensuring remedies for the victims.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group invites States to establish disaggregated data collection and 
oversight mechanisms to monitor and combat racial profiling.  These mechanisms should 
include both procedures that are internal to law enforcement agencies and also those for 
external oversight bodies, which have the participation of the community.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The Working Group urges law enforcement agencies to take positive action to 
secure real participation of people of African descent and other vulnerable groups at all 
levels throughout law enforcement agencies.  This should include specific recruitment, 
retention and promotion goals for positions of responsibility in such institutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The Working Group reiterates the importance of the recommendation made by the 
independent eminent experts on the follow-up to Durban to develop a racial equality index 
as a tool to better assess the discrimination that affects people of African descent and other 
vulnerable groups, and to guide the adoption of policies to remedy their situation.</b> </p>
