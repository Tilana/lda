PART III - NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, 11-K, 20-F,
10-Q, N-SAR, or other transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed
within the prescribed period.
The Registrant is unable to file, without unreasonable effort and expense, its
Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the period ended May 31, 2015 because the
Registrant's auditor has not completed their review of the Form 10-Q. It is
anticipated that the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report, along with the interim
financial statements, will be filed on or before the 5th calendar day following
the prescribed due date of the Registrant's Form 10-Q.
