Newmont Announces First Quarter 2013 Results 
Consolidated spending1down $217 million or 13% vs. prior year quarter; 
2013 capital expenditure guidance lowered by $100 million 
 
This release should be read in conjunction with Newmont’s First Quarter 2013 Form 10-Q filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2013 (available at www.newmont.com).
DENVER, April 29, 2013 – Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (“Newmont” or the “Company”) 
today reported attributable net income from continuing operations of $315 million, or $0.63 per basic 
share, down 44% from $561 million, or $1.13 per basic share in the first quarter of 2012. As previously 
reported, results for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 were influenced by 
lower grade and recovery at Carlin and lower grade at Twin Creeks in Nevada, and shipping delays 
resulting in lower concentrate sales.  Adjusted net income2 was $354 million, or $0.71 per basic share, 
compared with $578 million, or $1.17 per basic share, for the prior year quarter.
Quarterly Highlights3
  Attributable gold and copper production of 1.165 million ounces and 38 million pounds, down 11%
and up 9%, respectively, from the prior year quarter; attributable gold and copper sales of 1.142 
million ounces and 31 million pounds, down 11% and 16%, respectively, from the prior year quarter;
  Attributable all-in sustaining costs1 down 7% or $92 million vs. prior year quarter; 
  Gold and copper costs applicable to sales (“CAS”) of $758 per ounce and $2.19 per pound, up 22%
and up 11%, respectively, from the prior year quarter;
  Consolidated spending1 down $217 million, or 13% vs. prior year quarter; 
  Lowering 2013 capital expenditure guidance by $100 million;  
  Maintaining attributable gold and copper production and CAS guidance for the year; and 
  Second quarter dividend payable of $0.35 per share in accordance with the Company’s gold-price-
linked dividend policy and consistent with the prior year quarter.
"We made progress on our plans to build long-term shareholder value through disciplined capital 
allocation and cost and efficiency improvements,” said Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive 
Officer.  “We cut planned 2013 capital expenditure guidance by $100 million and reduced our 
consolidated spending by $217 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. This drove our all-in 
sustaining cost per ounce to the lower end of guidance despite some production challenges. We continue 
to build on this and the $130 million savings we realized last year by streamlining operating and overhead

costs and investing in more profitable production to improve shareholder returns. We expect first 
production at Akyem in Ghana later this year, and the ramp up Phase 6 ore mining at Batu Hijau in 
Indonesia late next year, to enhance free cash flow in 2014 and 2015," added Goldberg.

The Company continues to expect full year 2013 attributable gold and copper production of 4.8 – 5.1 
million ounces and 150 – 170 million pounds, respectively.  Planned production is expected to increase in 
the second half of the year primarily as a result of greater mill throughput in Nevada and the ramp up of 
first production at Akyem in Ghana.
Operations
Newmont is lowering its 2013 attributable and consolidated capital expenditure outlook by $100 million to 
$2.0 to $2.2 billion, and to $2.3 to $2.5 billion, respectively.   
 
As previously announced, Newmont’s Board of Directors approved a second quarter gold price-linked 
dividend in accordance with the Company’s gold price-linked dividend policy of $0.35 per share4 based 
upon the average London P.M. Gold Fix for the first quarter.   
 
  
 
North America  
 
Nevada – Attributable gold production in Nevada was 381,000 ounces at CAS of $774 per ounce during 
the first quarter. Gold production decreased 12% from the prior year quarter due to lower grade and 
recovery at Mill 5 and Mill 6 and lower grade at the Twin Creeks autoclave, partially offset by new 
production at Emigrant and higher throughput at Phoenix. CAS per ounce increased 25% due to lower 
ounces sold and lower capitalized mine development activities in 2013 compared to 2012.  
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 1.7 million and 1.8 million 
ounces at CAS of between $600 and $650 per ounce and is lowering its 2013 capital expenditure outlook 
range by $50 million to between $550 to $600 million, consolidated and attributable. The Board also 
recently approved full funding of $398 million for the Turf/Leevile vent shaft scheduled for completion in 
2015. 
 
La Herradura – Attributable gold production at La Herradura in Mexico was 55,000 ounces at CAS of 
$717 per ounce during the first quarter.  Gold production increased 2% from the prior year quarter due to 
higher leach placement and grade. CAS per ounce increased 23% due to mining additional waste tons 
compared to 2012. 
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 225,000 and 275,000 
ounces at CAS of between $650 and $700 per ounce. 
 
South America  
 
Yanacocha – Attributable gold production at Yanacocha in Peru was 147,000 ounces at CAS of $568 per 
ounce during the first quarter. Gold production decreased 22% from the prior year quarter due to lower 
mill grade and lower leach ore placement from Chaquicocha. CAS per ounce increased 24% due to lower 
production and lower silver by-product credits. 
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 475,000 and 525,000 
ounces at CAS of between $600 and $650 per ounce. 
 
La Zanja – Attributable gold production during the first quarter at La Zanja in Peru was approximately 
15,000 ounces.

Boddington – Attributable gold and copper production during the first quarter at Boddington in Australia 
was 177,000 ounces and 18 million pounds, respectively, at CAS of $873 per ounce and $2.35 per 
pound, respectively.  Gold and copper production increased 9% and 29%, respectively, from the prior 
year quarter due to higher mill grade. CAS increased 12% per ounce and increased 21% per pound from 
the prior year quarter due to a higher strip ratio, higher mill maintenance costs, and the impact of the 
carbon tax which took effect in July 2012. Copper costs applicable to sales were also affected by the 
higher co-product cost allocated to copper compared to the prior year quarter.  
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 700,000 and 750,000 
ounces at CAS of between $850 and $950 per ounce and attributable copper production of between 70 
and 80 million pounds at CAS of between $2.45 and $2.65 per pound. 
 
Other Australia/New Zealand – Attributable gold production5 during the first quarter was 258,000 ounces 
at CAS of $962 per ounce. Gold production decreased 4% from the prior year quarter due to lower mill 
grade at Jundee, Kalgoorlie, and Tanami coupled with lower throughput at Tanami and partly offset by 
higher throughput at Waihi. CAS per ounce increased 27% primarily due to lower production, higher 
operating costs, and the impact of the carbon tax.  
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 925,000 and 975,000 
ounces at CAS of between $950 and $1,050 per ounce and is lowering its 2013 capital expenditure 
outlook range by $25 million to between $200 to $250 million, consolidated and attributable.
Indonesia
Batu Hijau – Attributable gold and copper production during the first quarter at Batu Hijau in Indonesia 
was 7,000 ounces and 20 million pounds, respectively, at CAS of $993 per ounce and $2.05 per pound, 
respectively. Gold and copper production decreased 36% and 5%, respectively, due to lower grade and 
recovery as a result of processing lower grade stockpiled material as Phase 6 stripping continues. CAS 
increased 9% per ounce and 3% per pound, respectively, due to lower production partially offset by lower 
mill maintenance costs.  
 
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production of between 20,000 and 30,000 
ounces at CAS of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce and attributable copper production of between 75 
and 90 million pounds at CAS of between $2.20 and $2.40 per pound.
Africa
Ahafo – Attributable gold production during the first quarter at Ahafo in Ghana was 125,000 ounces at 
CAS of $555 per ounce. Gold production decreased 29% from the prior year quarter due to an increase of 
in-process inventory and lower milled grade, partly offset by higher recovery. CAS per ounce decreased 
2% from the prior year quarter due to lower mining and milling costs compared to the prior year quarter.
The Company continues to expect 2013 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 525,000 and 
575,000 ounces at CAS of between $550 and $600 per ounce.  
 
The Company is lowering its 2013 capital expenditure outlook range for Africa by $25 million to between 
$625 to $675 million, consolidated and attributable.
5 Includes 14,000 and 4,000 attributable ounces in the first quarter 2013 and 2012, respectively, from our interest in Duketon.

All-in Sustaining Costs Update
Consolidated spending is down $217 million, or 13% vs. prior year quarter. Consolidated all-in sustaining 
costs were $1,086 per ounce during the first quarter, or $1,115 per ounce on an attributable basis, due to 
lower gold and copper production, partially offset by lower advanced projects, exploration and sustaining 
capital spending. The Company continues to expect all-in sustaining costs of between $1,100 to $1,200 
per ounce on both a consolidated and attributable basis for 2013.

Capital Update
Capital  expenditures  in  North  America  during  the  first  quarter  of  2013  were  primarily  related  to  the 
construction  of  the  Phoenix  Copper  Leach  project,  the  development  of  the  Turf/Leeville  vent  shaft, 
surface and underground mine development in both Nevada and Mexico and infrastructure improvements 
in  Nevada.  Capital  expenditures  in  South  America  were  primarily  related  to  the  Conga  and  Merian 
projects,  surface  mine  development  and  equipment  purchases.  The  majority  of  capital  expenditures  in 
Australia and New Zealand were for underground mine development, tailings facility construction, mining 
equipment purchases and infrastructure improvements. Capital expenditures in Batu Hijau were primarily 
for  equipment  and  equipment  component  purchases  and 
improvements.  Capital 
expenditures  in  Africa  were  primarily  related  to  Akyem  development  and  the  Subika  expansion  project, 
equipment purchases and surface mine development at Ahafo.
infrastructure
We remain focused on the progression  of our next generation of mining  projects. Approximately 40% of 
our 2013 capital expenditures will be allocated as development capital,  including the Akyem project, the 
Phoenix Copper Leach project, the Ahafo Mill Expansion, the Conga project and other expansion projects
Page 4 of 16
in  Nevada  and  at  La  Herradura,  with  the  remaining  60%  expected  to  be  spent  on  sustaining  capital. 
Additional  capital  investment  is  also  possible  at  the  Merian  project  in  Suriname  in  2013  pending  the 
outcome  of  further  dialogue  with  the  government  and  project  economic  evaluation.  We  continue  to 
manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with 
our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement 
availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the 
timing and costs of certain opportunities.

a All-in sustaining cost is a non-GAAP metric defined by the Company as the sum of costs applicable 
to sales, copper by-product credits, G&A, exploration expense, advanced projects and R&D, other 
expense, and sustaining capital.
b All-in sustaining cost per ounce is calculated by dividing all-in sustaining cost by the midpoint of 
estimated sales, less non-consolidated interests in La Zanja and Duketon and development ounces.
c The Company's methodology for calculating all-in sustaining costs was developed independently, 
and is subject to change due to a number of factors including the possible adoption of formal industry 
guidelines from the World Gold Council.

Supplemental Information  
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any 
standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These measures 
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in 
accordance with GAAP. 
 
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to GAAP Net Income  
Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company’s operating 
performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use 
of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of 
the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to 
similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. 
Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and 
based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. 
 
Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CAS per Ounce/Pound  
CAS per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the 
CAS of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are 
calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to 
Newmont basis. Attributable CAS is based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For 
operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of 
gold or copper production attributable to the non-controlling interest. We include attributable CAS per 
ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our 
performance to other gold producers. CAS per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional 
information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be 
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with 
GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as 
determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.  
 
Net attributable CAS per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a 
credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their costs net of the 
contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure of this basis 
provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to 
other gold producers, and to better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this 
measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold 
revenues to our cost structure.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, Including 2013 Outlook:  
 
This release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities 
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which 
are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.  Such 
forward-looking statements may include, without limitation: (i) estimates of future production and sales; (ii) 
estimates of future costs applicable to sales; (iii) estimates of future consolidated and attributable capital 
expenditures, CAS, and all-in sustaining cost; and (iv) expectations regarding the development, growth 
and exploration potential of the Company’s projects. Estimates or expectations of future events or results 
are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect.  Such assumptions, include, but 
are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological 
and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Company’s 
projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (iii) political developments in any 
jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain 
exchange rate assumptions for the Australian dollar to the U.S. dollar, as well as other the exchange 
rates being approximately consistent with current levels; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper 
and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; and (vii) the 
accuracy of our current mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates. Where the Company expresses 
or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in 
good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis.  However, such statements are subject to risks, 
uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results 
expressed, projected or implied by the “forward-looking statements”.  Such risks include, but are not 
limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and 
variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, political and operational 
risks, community relations, conflict resolution and outcome of projects or oppositions and governmental 
regulation and judicial outcomes.  For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the
