JUDGMENT

MORTGAGE ACTION  MORTGAGEE SALE  ORDER FOR VACANT POSSESSION.


The Cause
1.      
The plaintiff filed a mortgage action seeking relief that the first defendant deliver to the plaintiff vacant possession of all that piece or parcel of land situated in the District of Naitasiri in the province of Naitasiri comprised and described in Lease No. 222328 being Lot 12 on Deposited Plan No. 3290 located at off Sarosaro Place, Kinoya together with all improvements thereon, as charged by the defendants to the plaintiff by mortgage no. 493002 dated the 29th day of November, 2000. 

2.      
The plaintiff also seeks that the defendants and their servants and agents be restrained from interfering with the improvements on the said property in any way so as to deplete its value.

The Grounds 

3.      
The application was made on the basis that the defendants were inconsistent with the loan repayments. The loan account fell in arrears. The total debt due and outstanding at the date of 31st January, 2009 is in the sum of $43,748.30 and interest accrues on the said amount on daily basis.

4.      
The plaintiff served on the defendants' demand notice calling up for the entire debt to be paid up but the notice was not adhered to. The notice indicated that the defendants had 30 days time to pay the entire debt failing which they were to quit and give vacant possession of the said property.

5.      
The defendants failed to pay the said monies and the plaintiff had no option but to advertise the said property by way of mortgagee sale.

6.      
The plaintiff has received numerous tender pursuant to the mortgagee sale and it will be required to give vacant possession of the said property.

7.      
On 23rd day of June 2009, the plaintiff served notice to quit dated the 10th day of June, 2009 on the defendants but the defendants have failed or neglected to abide by the said notice.

The Analysis
8.      
The defendants have neglected to perform their obligations under the mortgage which is an 'on demand' facility.

9.      
The arrears of payment entitled the mortgagee to call up for the entire debt due and owing which the plaintiff did. No payments were made.

10.     
The mortgagee is empowered under the mortgage to realize its security by way of mortgagee sale. It must be permitted to do so but for any sale to successfully take place, an order for vacant possession is required and must be given.

11.     
There is always a danger of the improvements on the property being interfered with and so it is proper for some orders to be put in place to prohibit such action.
12.     
The defendants must also pay cost of this proceeding which could have been avoided.

Final Orders
13.     
The defendants must give vacant possession of the property contained in Lease No. 222328 being Lot 16 on DP 3290 together with all improvements thereon.

14.     
The defendants must not interfere with the improvements on the said property.

15.     
The defendants must pay costs in the sum of $550 to the plaintiff.
