to withhold or deduct such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental 
charges. In such event, the Transocean Parties will pay such additional amounts 
as will result, after such withholding or deduction, in the receipt by each
Underwriter and
each person controlling any Underwriter, as the case may be, of the amounts that
would otherwise have been receivable in respect thereof, except to the extent 
such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges (i)&nbsp;were 
imposed by
reason of any present or former connection between an Underwriter and any such 
non-U.S. jurisdiction, otherwise than solely from the execution of this 
Agreement or the receipt of payments hereunder or thereunder; or (ii)&nbsp;would
not have been
imposed but for the failure of such Underwriter to comply with any 
certification, identification or other reporting requirements concerning 
nationality, residence, identity or connection with such non-U.S. jurisdiction 
of such Underwriter if such
compliance is required or imposed by law as a precondition to an exemption from,
or reduction in, such tax, duty or charge. The Transocean Parties further agree 
to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriters against any documentary, stamp, 
value
added, sales, financial transaction or similar issuance or recordation tax, 
including any interest and penalties, on the placement of the Units and on the 
execution and delivery of this Agreement.<I> </I></P>

Membership Interests deemed owned by the Transocean Member) that would be

a meeting shall

Non-Transocean Members for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting

occurrence of, and throughout the continuance of, any Event of Default, each 
Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower and each other Loan Party at any 
time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrower or any other Loan 
Party or other
Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to 
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, 
but not limited to, Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether 
matured or
unmatured, but not including trust accounts, and in whatever currency 
denominated) and any other Indebtedness at any time owing by that Lender to or

against and on account of the due and unpaid obligations and liabilities of the

the Credit Documents, irrespective of whether or not that Lender shall have made
any
demand hereunder, or the obligations are owed to a branch or office of such 
Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or other 
obligation. Each Lender shall promptly give notice to the Borrower of any action
taken by it under
this Section&nbsp;9.6(a), <I>provided</I> that any failure of such Lender to

the Lenders hereunder, then such Lender shall (i)&nbsp;notify the other Lenders 
of such
fact, and (ii)&nbsp;purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, 
ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Revolving Loans held 
by each such other Lender as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share 
such excess
payment ratably with all the other Lenders; <I>provided, however</I>, that if 
any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part 
thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related 
purchases from the
other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to 
the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. The 
provisions of this Section&nbsp;9.6(b) shall not be construed to apply to 
(x)&nbsp;any payment
made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of 
this Agreement, or (y)&nbsp;any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration 
for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans 
to any assignee
or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to 
which the provisions of this Section&nbsp;9.6(b) shall apply). Each Loan Party 
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so 
under applicable
law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing 
arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and 
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were 
a direct creditor of each
Loan Party in the amount of such participation.<I> </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-

not be entitled
to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.3 or 8.2 with respect to any

Loan or other Obligation is in registered form under Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c) of
the

Indemnity Agreement (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made by and between 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n
bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, a

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">A. The Company recognizes that competent and 
experienced persons are increasingly reluctant to serve as Directors, officers 
or employees of
companies unless they are protected by comprehensive liability insurance or 
indemnification, or both, due to increased exposure to litigation costs and 
risks resulting from their service to such companies, and due to the fact that 
the exposure
frequently bears no reasonable relationship to their compensation; </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-
family:Times New Roman">B. The statutes and judicial decisions regarding the 
duties of
Directors and officers are often difficult to apply, ambiguous, or conflicting, 
and therefore fail to provide such Directors and officers with adequate, 
reliable knowledge of legal risks to which they are exposed or information 
regarding the proper
course of action to take; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">C. The Company and 
the Indemnitee recognize that plaintiffs often seek damages in such large 
amounts and the
costs of litigation may be so expensive (whether or not the case is 
meritorious), that the defense and/or settlement of such litigation is often 
beyond the personal resources of Directors, officers and employees; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">D. The Company believes that it is often unfair for
its Directors, officers and employees to assume the risk of judgments and other 
expenses
which may occur in cases in which the Director, officer or employee has acted in
good faith and in a manner the Director, officer or employee reasonably believes
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">E. The Company desires the Indemnitee to serve or 
continue to serve as an Agent of the Company and recognizes that the Indemnitee
may not be
willing to serve or continue to serve the Company without additional 
indemnification and insurance to protect against claims for damages arising out 
of or related to such services to the Company; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">F. The Company believes that the interests of the 
Company and its shareholders would best be served by a combination of 
Directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance and the indemnification by the Company of the
Directors, officers and employees of the Company; and </P> <P STYLE="margin-

The Board of Directors has determined that contractual indemnification as set

the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. </P>
