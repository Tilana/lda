REAPER: THIRD NEW DRILL TARGET IDENTIFIED SO FAR
AT ROSEBY SOUTH
  Third new Roseby South soil anomaly is the largest to date 
  2.5 kilometre long copper-in soil anomaly with anomalism up to 0.54% copper 
  Comparable to the anomaly at Altona’s Little Eva deposit 
  Rockchip samples up to 0.8% copper and 1.54g/t gold 
  Drilling planned to commence in October at Reaper, Hobby and Harvest
Altona  Mining  Limited  (“Altona”  or  the  “Company”)  has  defined  a  third,  high-tenor  copper-in-soil 
anomaly, the largest identified so far (Figure 1) at its 100% owned Roseby South Project (“Roseby 
South”) near Mt Isa in Queensland.  
 
Roseby  South  immediately  adjoins  the  southern  boundary  of  the  Company’s  Cloncurry  Project  and 
MMG's major underground zinc mine development at Dugald River (Figures 2 and 3). The Cloncurry 
Project  is  the  subject  of  a  US$235.5  million  proposed  joint  venture  (“JV”)  with  Sichuan  Railway 
Investment  Group  (“SRIG”).  Please  refer  to  ASX  release  dated  2  June  2016  for  further  information 
regarding the SRIG JV. 
 
Altona has expanded its exploration activities in the Mt Isa inlier. Field work this year has focussed on 
high  resolution  soil  sampling,  prospecting  and  geological  mapping.  The  large  Harvest  and  Hobby 
anomalies were identified and were reported in ASX release dated 1 August 2016. Altona has also 
increased its tenement holdings and applications in the Mt Isa inlier to 3,231 square kilometres (ASX 
release dated 15 August 2016).  
 
The  new  Reaper  anomaly  (Figure  1)  is  the  largest  of  the  targets  defined  so  far  and  is  located  6.5 
kilometres north of the Hobby anomaly. It sits on a major north-south structure which extends through 
Hobby in the south and through the Companion copper-gold prospect in the north. Reaper was missed 
by previous exploration having a different surface visual expression to ‘typical’ copper anomalies of 
similar tenor in the region.  
 
At Reaper, multiple copper-in-soil anomalies greater than 1,000ppm (0.1% copper) have been defined 
within broader anomalism over a strike extent of 2.5 kilometres (Figure 1). Peak values range up to 
5,426ppm (0.54%) copper. The anomalism is of similar size and tenor to that at the Cloncurry Project's 
Little Eva deposit (546,000 tonnes contained copper and 295,000 ounces of gold, Appendix 3).  
 
Two very small old workings are located within the southern part of the anomaly. Overall the copper 
mineralisation  has  a subtle  surface  expression  and  is  finely  disseminated within  the  rocks.  Outcrop 
rockchip  samples  in  the  south  of  the  target  returned  up  to  0.8%  copper  and  up  to  1.54g/t  gold. 
(Appendix 1, Table 1). 
 
Gold-in-soil  was  not  routinely  assayed,  however  gold  was  assayed  from  one  line  in  the  south  and 
values up to 0.1g/t in soil were obtained coincident with peak copper values.

The anomaly occurs within a range of hills with relief up to 70 metres. The broader anomaly trends 
north-south while the internal high tenor zones trend northeast and northwest cutting across steeply 
dipping, north-striking ridges of metasedimentary rocks (pink feldspar and amphibole).  
 
No drilling has been undertaken at the prospect to date.  An RC drilling programme at Reaper, Hobby 
and Harvest will commence in 3-4 weeks. Third party agreements and Aboriginal heritage clearances 
required prior to any drilling have been secured.

APPENDIX 2:  TABLE 1 OF THE 2012 EDITION JORC CODE
The  table  below  is  a  description  of  the  assessment  and  reporting  criteria  used  in  reporting  the 
Exploration  Results  that  reflects  those  presented  in  Table  1  of  The  Australasian  Code  for  the

Commentary 
Soil samples are surface samples (top 20cm) sieved to -2mm to obtain a ~100g 
sample size. Sampling is conducted only when dry. 
Rockchip  samples  were  collected  from  patchy  surface  rock  subcrop  or  outcrops 
and are typically chip samples across exposed rock faces over an area <1m2  and 
are commonly selective targeting mineralised or altered rock exposures. 
All  rockchip  and  duplicate  (referee)  soil  analyses  were  analysed  at  ALS 
laboratories in Townsville.
Not applicable, no new data reported.
Not applicable, no new data reported.
Not applicable, no new data reported.
Not applicable, no new sub-sampled data reported.
Soil Samples 
Soil samples were routinely analysed for copper (and a suite of other elements) 
using a Niton XL3tGOLDD+ hand-held XRF instrument. Analyses are conducted 
routinely under controlled conditions in the site office.
Quality  Control  included:  standards  (certified  reference  materials)  from  Geostats 
Ltd.  Standards  were  inserted  into  the  sampling  sequence  at  1:20  ratio  and 
included representative material for copper. Whenever a bias has been detected it 
has  been  found  to  be  consistent  against  the  reference  data  and  therefore  no 
corrections have been made.  
Umpire soil samples were submitted to ALS laboratories in Townsville for analysis 
using Trace Level method by four acid “near total” digest (method code ME-ICP61; 
copper range 1 -10,000ppm) for 33 elements; and; gold using Super Trace Level 
method by aqua regia digestion with 50g sample weight (method code: Au-ST44; 
gold  range  0.1ppb  –  1ppm).  The  umpire  samples  were  selected  from  traverses 
across  each  anomaly;  these  displayed  no  bias  and  an  acceptable  level  of 
precision for the purpose.
Rock Samples 
All rock samples were analysed at ALS laboratories in Townsville for a standard 
suite of elements.
Samples were analysed by Aqua Regia or a four acid digest (HF-HNO3 -HClO4

Criteria
Commentary 
acid digestion, HCl leach) digest using ICP-AES and ICP-MS (method code: ME-
MS41  or  ME-MS61;  copper  range  0.2  –  10,000ppm))  for  51  elements.  This 
included copper, with a detection limit of 0.2ppm. Data reported from Aqua Regia 
digestion  should  be  considered  as  representing  only  the  leachable  portion  of  a 
particular analyte while the four acid digestion is a “near-total” digestion. 
On return of copper values of greater than 1% a second series of analyses were 
undertaken. This involved an ore grade Aqua Regia digestion (method code: ASY-
AR01) followed by ICP-AES analysis optimised for accuracy and precision at high 
concentrations (method code: ME-OG46).
Gold was analysed via a fire assay (30g) with an AAS finish, with a lower detection 
limit of 0.01ppm and upper detection limit of 100ppm.
Verification of 
sampling and 
assaying
Results were checked by several Altona personnel. 
All field logging or field sampling data was done using a laptop and uploaded into 
the company Datashed database and validated by company database personnel.
All  assay  files  were  received  in  digital  format  from  ALS  Laboratories.  All  Niton 
handheld  XRF  soil  data  was  downloaded  from  the  instrument  in  digital  format. 
Data was uploaded into the Altona Datashed database and validated by company 
database personnel. No manual data inserts took place. 
No adjustments have been applied to the results.
Location of data 
points
Soil  sample  locations  are  surveyed  using  handheld  GPS’s  (Garmin  GSMAP78s) 
with an approximate 5 metre horizontal accuracy.  
No drilling.
The Grid is GDA94 MGA Zone 54.
Data spacing and 
distribution
The soil sample grid spacings are 20 x 20. In the areas surrounding the anomalies 
spacing steps out typically to 40 x 80 metres and 20 x 200 metres.
Orientation of 
data in relation to 
geological 
structure 
Sample security
Audits or reviews
AOH0788
Not applicable, no new drill data reported.
Soil samples are collected and bagged into pre-numbered plastic clip-lock bags. 
Unique sample numbers were retained during the whole process.
Samples were collected and delivered to the Altona field office daily as they were 
collected.  
Soil  samples  were  retained  for  reference  and  stored  in  Altona  facilities  in 
Cloncurry. 
All  rock  and  umpire  soil  samples  were  then  catalogued  and  sealed  prior  to 
dispatch to the laboratory by Altona staff.
Internal  audits  and  reviews  of  key  datasets  collected  by  Altona  have  been 
undertaken.  Past  exploration  data  by  other  explorers  has  only  been  validated 
against the source references. 
Analysis  of  the  results  from  the  QA/QC  samples  are  routinely  analysed  by  the
8.
Criteria
Commentary 
database manager and geologist on a batch and campaign basis.   
For laboratory analyses, the accuracy of key elements such copper and gold, was 
acceptable  and  the  field  duplicate  assay  data  was  unbiased  and  shows  an 
acceptable level of precision. 
For handheld Niton XRF analyses the data may display a consistent bias against 
the  reference  data.  In contrast  laboratory  umpire samples  from  the  reported soil 
anomalies displayed no bias and an acceptable level of precision for the purpose.  
No external audits or reviews have been undertaken.

Commentary 
Reaper sits within EPM 25761, 100% owned by Altona Mining Ltd.   
No joint ventures apply. 
There are agreements in place with the native title holders, the Kalkadoon people 
and with landholders. 
No  significant  historic  sites  or  national  parks  are  located  within  the  reported 
exploration sites.
The EPM was granted in late 2015 and is in good standing.
Very  small  historical  surface  workings  on  narrow  high  grade  copper  oxide 
veins/gossans exist at Reaper. 
At the Reaper anomaly a small number of rockchip samples had been collected by 
pervious explorers; the tenor of copper assays from these samples are similar to 
those collected by Altona no gold assays are available; these are not reported as 
their locations could not be verified and may be incorrect with assays anomalous 
in  copper  from  rocks  outside  the  strongly  anomalous  areas.  No  systematic  soil 
sampling, ground geophysics or drilling has been undertaken.
Mineralisation is considered to be similar to other IOCG deposits in the area and 
exhibits feldspar-quartz-amphibole alteration.  
Not applicable, no new drill data reported.
Exploration results are not being reported for the Mineral Resource area.

Commentary 
Reaper prospect has been included. Whilst the soil anomalies are attractive and 
similar in size and tenor to response over the Little Eva deposit, the main text of 
the release notes that the tenor of surface anomalism is not a reliable guide to the 
nature of any potential underlying mineralisation. 
A  single  line  of  shallow  geochemical  drilling  by  Altona  in  2013  transected  the 
Reaper area completely missing the anomalies.
Exploration results are not being reported for the Mineral Resource area.
Additional work in the future will consist of RC exploration drilling, prospect scale 
mapping  and  further  soil  sampling.  Heritage  clearance  surveys  having  been 
completed ahead of drilling and are planned.
