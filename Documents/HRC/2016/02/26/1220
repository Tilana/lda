</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of 
migrants, the relevant resolutions of the World Health Assembly, in particular its resolution 
61.17 of 24 May 2008, and the work of the various special mechanisms of the Council that 
have reported on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that 
everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each 
State and the right to leave any country, including his or her own, and to return to his or her 
country, 
</p>
<p>` United Nations A/HRC/RES/26/21
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also </i>that everyone is entitled to all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, without distinction of any kind, wherever the person is and regardless of his or 
her immigration status, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that States are responsible for promoting and protecting the human 
rights of all persons, including irregular migrants, who are in their territory and subject to 
their jurisdiction, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, including women 
and children, who have lost their lives or have been injured in attempting to cross 
international borders, including those without the required travel documents, and 
recognizing the obligation of States to protect and respect the human rights of those 
crossing their borders, regardless of their immigration status, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
those that refer to border control and the orderly management of migration, must be in 
accordance with international human rights obligations in order to uphold the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> at measures that, including in the context of policies aimed at 
reducing irregular migration, treat irregular migration as a criminal rather than an 
administrative offence, where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants the full enjoyment 
of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health is a human right, as reflected in, inter alia, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as, with respect 
to non-discrimination, in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the need to continue to pursue adequate and sustainable health 
financing to promote the progressive realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the importance in this regard of 
national resource mobilization and international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the important results of the second High-level Dialogue on International 
Migration and Development, held on 3 and 4 October 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Declaration of the High-Level Dialogue on International Migration 
and Development, adopted by the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session,1 which 
acknowledges the important contribution of migration in realizing the Millennium 
Development Goals and recognizes that human mobility is a key factor for sustainable 
development, which should receive due consideration in the elaboration of the post-2015 
development agenda<b>,</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the seventh Global Forum on Migration and Development, which 
highlighted that migrants&#8217; access to basic services, including health services, is one way to 
ensure that migrants are not excluded from the goals that will be articulated by the 
international community for the post-2015 development agenda, and emphasized the 
importance of facilitating access to regular forms of migration and, where applicable, to 
social services, including health goods, services and conditions, that contribute to the 
prosperity of countries of origin, transit and destination and to the strengthening of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>empowerment and personal development prospects and outcomes for migrants and their 
families, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the important role that migrants play as partners in the development 
of origin, transit and destination countries, and recognizing the need to improve public 
perceptions of migrants and migration, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the observation made by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, in his report 
submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session,2 that States should adopt 
and implement an effective national health policy that does not discriminate against non-
nationals and that addresses the needs of irregular and regular migrants, at all stages of the 
migration process, and that States should ensure the availability and accessibility of quality 
health facilities, goods and services, including existing health insurance schemes, to 
migrants, on the basis of equality with other nationals, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the fact that, in the fulfilment of their obligations to protect human rights, 
States of origin, transit and destination can benefit from schemes of international 
cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> <i>also </i>that migrant access to health services may help to mitigate the risk of 
widening inequalities, and recognizing that health contributes to the full enjoyment of 
human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants,<footnote name="3">A/HRC/26/35. </footnote> invites States to give due consideration to the recommendations

<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying

General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms</i> the duty of States to effectively promote and protect the human

services, disease prevention and care for migrants, subject to national laws and practice, 
without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Expresses concern</i> at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, including the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Reaffirms </i>that, when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement 
migration and border security measures, States have the duty to comply with their

<p> 
</p>
<p>2

<p>(<i>c</i>) To the effect that domestic law and administrative provisions and their 
application facilitate the work of medical personnel and staff, humanitarian workers, human

human rights of irregular migrants, including by avoiding any criminalization, 
stigmatization, impediments, obstructions or restrictions thereof contrary to international 
human rights law; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To ensure that no person engaged in medical activities is penalized in any
