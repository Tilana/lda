Analysis

[21]    
You therefore stand convicted of 21 counts of burglary, 18 counts of theft, three counts of larceny and one count of housebreaking, entering and larceny. You have 110 previous convictions, nearly all of which are for burglary but three previous for escape from lawful custody. It was after escaping from prison in 2008 that you embarked on this "orgy" of crime. On the nights of 11th and 12th April 2010 you broke in six different houses, a burglary "binge". None of the property stolen has been recovered in any of these cases. You are 47 years old and you tell me that you are a farmer. However you had not had time to be a farmer on anything else since 1982 when you commenced your career as prison inmate. Even taking into account your previous convictions since mid 2000 which must be convictions relevant to your present sentencing  they number 67 previous; all of them, bar two, being in Labasa. Your record is shocking.

[22]    
It will not be a surprise to you or to anyone else for that matter, that I now classify you as an "habitual offender" pursuant to section 11 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009. As you are an habitual offender I must have regard to the protection of the community and to effect that purpose I am empowered to impose a sentence longer than would otherwise be the case.

[23]    
By way of mitigation you have begged for mercy. You plead full co-operation with the Police in identifying these particular crimes and you are anxious not to waste the Court's time. You regret not being able to be settled like your siblings. Most important of all, you have pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. This Court will take into account your pleas of guilty, your co-operation and your remorse.

[24]    
However the Court cannot ignore its responsibility to the community to protect it from wanton crime. People should be free to enjoy their homes with impunity and without uninvited invasion and to maintain their possessions without fear of theft. The people in the urban areas of Fiji are presently terrified of robberies and unwanted invasions, and it is the Court's duty to attempt to alleviate those fears by keeping "career burglars" such as you off the streets.

[25]    
The maximum offence for burglary under the Penal Code was life imprisonment, with the accepted tariff being two to three years after trial. Under the Crimes Decree 2009 it is now a maximum of 13 years. The maximum penalty for theft under the Crimes Decree is a term of 10 years, and for larceny under the Penal Code (after previous convictions) was also ten years.

[26]    
The State submits orally that the accused is beyond reform and that a substantial sentence should be imposed to remove him from society. Mr. Sovau submits that the sentences should be in the main consecutive, with a suggested total term of about 13 years after plea, a submission that is not realistic. Even the most hopeless of criminals should be afforded some prospect of liberty, and especially this tragic convict who tells me he has every intention to reform given his advanced years. While it is difficult to believe that pathetic submission, he must nevertheless have the reasonable expectation of release from his addiction.

[27]    
For each of the burglary offences, I take a starting point of three years, which should be the accepted tariff for domestic burglary. For the seriously aggravating features such as:

(i)     
Invasion at night,

(ii)    
destruction of fixtures to the property,

(iii)   
offending whilst escaping from custody,

I add a further 2 years making an interim total of 5 years. Although I cannot sentence you on the basis of your appalling criminal record, I do take into account your 'status' as an habitual offender and for that, to this interim total I therefore add another 3 years making a total of 8 years. For your plea of guilty and your co-operation and remorse I deduct 3 years which means that in each of the burglary counts on which you stand convicted, you are sentenced to a term of five years.

[28]    
The counts of theft are varied. Property stolen ranges from $30 to $4,100 and it even included others' prepared food. I take as a starting point for each theft charge a term of three years and as you are an habitual offender I add a further term of 2 years. I deduct 2 years for your pleas of guilty and co-operation and you will therefore serve a total term of 3 years for each of your theft charges. In addition I apply this term to each of your larceny convictions and to the one count of housebreaking entering and larceny.

[29]    
Obviously I cannot make all of these terms consecutive because you would then be serving a total sentence of 171 years. I therefore make the following adjustments.

(i)     
in each of the specified cases herein, I make the sentences concurrent; be they burglary and theft or burglary and larceny.

(ii)    
each of the sentences for each case are again to be served concurrently.

[30]    
Your sentences are therefore as follows:


	(a)	HAC 95 of 2010:	Burglary - 5 years
Larceny - 3 years concurrently
			
	(b)	HAC 96 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(c)	HAC 97 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(d)	HAC 98 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(e)	HAC 99 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(f)	HAC 100 of 2010:	Housebreaking entering & larceny- 3 years
			
	(g)	HAC 101 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(h)	HAC 102 of 2010:	4 counts of burglary  5 years on each, concurrent
4 counts of theft- 3 years on each concurrent, to be served concurrently with the burglary sentences
	(i)	HAC 103 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(j)	HAC 104 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Two charges of Theft - 3 years each to be served concurrently with each other and with the burglary
	(k)	HAC 105 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(l)	HAC 106 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(m)	HAC 107 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(n)	HAC 108 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(o)	HAC 109 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(p)	HAC 110 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Larceny in a dwelling house  3 years concurrent
			
	(q)	HAC 111 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Larceny in a dwelling house  3 years concurrent
			
	(r)	HAC 112 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent
			
	(s)	HAC 113 of 2010:	Burglary  5 years
Theft  3 years concurrent


All of these sentences except HAC 100 of 2010 to be served concurrently.

[31]    
This means that you will be serving 18 concurrent terms of five years. However the sentence in the housebreaking entering and larceny case of HAC 100 of 2010 dating back to 2008 will be served consecutively to the other sentences, meaning you will serve a total sentence of eight years. You will not be eligible to considered for parole for 6 years from today.
