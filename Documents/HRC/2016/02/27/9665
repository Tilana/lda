<p><b>I. RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
AT ITS SECOND SPECIAL SESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>S-2/1. The grave situation of human rights in Lebanon caused by 
Israeli military operations 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, 
 <i>Reaffirming also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action, and recalling the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars of 
the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 in which the Assembly 
decided that the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Should address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and 
systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon; and 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Shall respond promptly to human rights emergencies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, relevant human rights instruments and 
international humanitarian law, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 on the 
Laws and Customs of War on Land which prohibit attacks and bombardment of civilian 
populations and objects and lay down obligations for general protection against dangers arising 
from military operations against civilian objects, hospitals, relief materials and means of 
transportation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the commitments of the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions 
of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that each High Contracting Party to the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) is under obligation 
to take action against persons alleged to have committed or to have ordered the commission of 
grave breaches of the Convention, and recalling the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> Israeli military operations in Lebanon, which constitute gross and 
systematic human rights violations of the Lebanese people, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-2/2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Appalled</i> at the massive violations of the human rights of the people of Lebanon by Israel 
resulting in the massacre of thousands of civilians, injuries, extensive damage to civilian 
infrastructure, displacement of 1 million people, and outflows of refugees fleeing heavy shelling 
and bombardment against the civilian population, 
</p>
<p> <i>Strongly condemning</i> the indiscriminate and massive Israeli air strikes, in particular on 
the village of Qana on 30 July 2006, and the targeting of United Nations peacekeepers at the 
United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon on 25 July 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the strong condemnation by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights of the killing of civilians in Qana, her call to take measures to protect civilian 
lives and civilian objects and her reiteration of the need for independent investigation, with the 
involvement of international experts, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting the extreme concern</i> expressed by the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food about the continuing adverse impact on the human rights and the 
humanitarian situation of the civilian population in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that attacks and killings of innocent civilians and the destruction of houses, 
property and infrastructure in Lebanon are a breach of the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, international law and international humanitarian law as well as are flagrant 
violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the urgent need to address the dire humanitarian situation in Lebanon, 
including through the immediate lifting of the blockade of Lebanon imposed by Israel, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the environmental degradation caused by Israeli strikes against 
power plants and their adverse impact on health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the targeting of the communication and media networks in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> <i>Outraged</i> at the continuing senseless killings by Israel, with impunity, of children, 
women, the elderly and other civilians in Lebanon, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the grave Israeli violations of human rights and breaches of 
international humanitarian law in Lebanon; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> the massive bombardment of Lebanese civilian populations, especially 
the massacres in Qana, Marwaheen, Al Duweir, Al Bayadah, Al Qaa, Chiyah, Ghazieh and other 
towns of Lebanon, causing thousands of deaths and injuries, mostly among children and women, 
and the displacement of 1 million civilians, according to a preliminary assessment, thus 
exacerbating the magnitude of the human suffering of the Lebanese; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also condemns</i> the Israeli bombardment of vital civilian infrastructure resulting in 
extensive destruction and heavy damage to public and private properties; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-2/2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to abide, immediately and scrupulously, by its obligations under 
human rights law, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and international 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>all concerned parties to respect the rules of international humanitarian law, 
to refrain from violence against the civilian population and to treat under all circumstances all 
detained combatants and civilians in accordance with the Geneva Conventions of 
12 August 1949; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Calls upon</i> Israel to immediately stop military operations against the civilian 
population and civilian objects resulting in death and destruction and serious violations of human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 7.<b> </b><i>Decides</i> to urgently establish and immediately dispatch a high-level commission 
of inquiry comprising of eminent experts on human rights law and international humanitarian 
law, and including the possibility of inviting the relevant United Nations special procedures to be 
nominated to the Commission: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To investigate the systematic targeting and killings of civilians by Israel in 
Lebanon; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To examine the types of weapons used by Israel and their conformity with 
international law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To assess the extent and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human life, property, 
critical infrastructure and the environment; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to provide all administrative, technical and logistical assistance required to enable 
the Commission of Inquiry to fulfil its mandate promptly and efficiently; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community urgently to provide the Government of 
Lebanon with humanitarian and financial assistance to enable it to deal with the worsening 
humanitarian disaster, rehabilitation of victims, return of displaced persons and restoration of the 
essential infrastructure; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Commission of Inquiry to report to the Council no later 
than 1 September 2006 on progress made towards the fulfilment of its mandate.

the Permanent Representative of Tunisia to the United Nations Office at Geneva, on behalf of 
the Group of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, requested that a 
special session of the Council be convened immediately &#8220;to consider and take action on the 
gross human rights violations, by Israel in Lebanon, including the Qana massacre, the 
countrywide targeting of innocent civilians and the destruction of vital civilian 
infrastructure&#8221;(A/HRC/S-2/1).

<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>ESTIMATED ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMME BUDGET  
IMPLICATIONS OF DRAFT RESOLUTION A/HRC/S-2/L.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Oral statement by the Secretariat in connection with draft resolution A/HRC/S-2/L.1 
</b></p>
<p> This statement is made in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the 
General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>1. Under the terms of operative paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 of draft 
resolution A/HRC/S-2/L.1, the Human Rights Council would: 
</p>
<p>(a) Dispatch, urgently, a high-level commission of inquiry comprising 
relevant human rights special procedures and experts of international 
humanitarian law to: 
</p>
<p>(i) Investigate the systematic targeting and killing by Israel of civilians 
in Lebanon; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Examine the types of weapons used by Israel and their conformity 
with international law; and 
</p>
<p>(iii) Assess the extent and deadly impact of Israeli attacks on human 
life, property, critical infrastructure and environment. 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to provide all administrative, technical and logistical assistance 
required to enable the Commission to fulfil its mandate promptly and 
efficiently; 
</p>
<p>(c) Request the Commission to report on progress towards the fulfilment of its 
mandate no later than 1 September 2006. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, total 
full costs of the activities envisaged would amount to US$ 417,800 under 
section 23, Human rights, in the biennium 2006-2007.  
</p>
<p>3. It will be recalled that under the procedures established by the General Assembly 
in its resolutions 41/213 and 42/211, a contingency fund is established for each 
biennium to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative 
mandates not provided for in the programme budget.  Under this procedure, if 
additional expenditures are proposed that exceed the resources available from the 
contingency fund, the activities concerned can be implemented only through the 
redeployment of resources from low-priority areas or the modification of existing 
activities.  Otherwise, such additional activities must be deferred to a later 
biennium. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-2/2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>4. The additional provisions cannot be met from the contingency fund, as other 
activities in the biennium 2006-2007 charged against the fund are expected to 
exhaust the contingency fund prior to the sixty-first session of the General 
Assembly.  It is not possible at this stage to identify activities under section 23 of 
the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 that could be curtailed, 
deferred, terminated or modified in order to meet the net additional requirement 
of US$ 417,800 although preliminary review leads the Secretariat to assume that 
some absorption of the estimated requirements is possible.  The Secretariat will 
seek in the coming months to identify areas from which resources can be 
redeployed to meet the requirements for the high-level Commission of Inquiry in 
the biennium 2006-2007.  At the time the General Assembly reviews the question 
of the Commission of Inquiry at its sixty-first session, it is anticipated that 
sufficient time would have elapsed to inform the General Assembly on how to 
meet the additional requirements. </p>
