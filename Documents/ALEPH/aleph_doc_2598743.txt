NOTE TO READER
In  contrast  to  the  certificate  required  under  Multilateral  Instrument  52-109  Certification  of  Disclosure  in  Issuers’ 
Annual and Interim Filings (MI 52-109), this Venture Issuer Basic Certificate does not include representations relating 
to the establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) and internal control over financial 
reporting (ICFR), as defined in MI 52-109.  In particular, the certifying officers filing this certificate are not making 
any representations relating to the establishment and maintenance of: 
 
(i)      controls  and  other  procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  information  required  to  be 
disclosed  by  the  issuer  in  its  annual  filings,  interim  filings  or  other  reports  filed  or  submitted  under  securities 
legislation  is  recorded  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  securities 
legislation; and
(ii)  a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.
The issuer’s certifying officers are responsible for ensuring that processes are in place to provide them with sufficient 
knowledge to support the representations they are making in this certificate. 
 
Investors should be aware that inherent limitations on the ability of certifying officers of a venture issuer to design and 
implement on a cost effective basis DC&P and ICFR as defined in MI 52-109 may result in additional risks to the 
quality, reliability, transparency and timeliness of interim and annual filings and other reports provided under securities 
legislation.
