<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>23/8, provides an account of the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>human rights of internally displaced persons, during the period since the submission of his 
</p>
<p>previous report to the Council. It also provides a thematic analysis of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>The objective of ensuring a life of dignity for all lies at the heart of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>are frequently deprived of their human rights, stripped of the elements of their lives that 
</p>
<p>provide dignity: their homes, a livelihood and income, a sense of belonging and of what the 
</p>
<p>future holds, security and justice, the knowledge that they will be able to feed, clothe and 
</p>
<p>educate their children, and the ability to make decisions about their lives. The displacement 
</p>
<p>experience is one of trauma, dependency and survival, with the average conflict-induced 
</p>
<p>displacement lasting a staggering 17 years. Ensuring durable solutions for internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons is a complex process which requires that they be included in sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals and strategies that seek to restore to them conditions of normality in 
</p>
<p>circumstances of dignity and safety, and a secure future.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report by the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 23/8. The first part provides an overview of his activities over the reporting 
</p>
<p>period since his last report to the Council.  
</p>
<p>2. The second part considers the human rights of internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>(IDPs) in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable 
</p>
<p>development goals. It urges greater attention to IDPs within the framework of development 
</p>
<p>processes, targets and activities relating to durable solutions. States are urged to include 
</p>
<p>IDPs, in particular those in protracted displacement situations, as beneficiaries of and 
</p>
<p>contributors to their development programmes and strategies.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 23/8, mandated the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to address internal displacement, in particular by mainstreaming the human 
</p>
<p>rights of IDPs into all relevant parts of the United Nations system, working towards 
</p>
<p>strengthening the international response to internal displacement, engaging in coordinated 
</p>
<p>international advocacy and action for improving protection and respect of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of IDPs, and continuing and enhancing dialogue with governments, intergovernmental, 
</p>
<p>regional and non-governmental organizations and other relevant actors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Engagement with countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>4. During his follow-up visit to Kenya from 29 April to 7 May 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur stressed that finding durable solutions for IDPs was a long-term process 
</p>
<p>requiring humanitarian, development and peacebuilding action. Although progress had been 
</p>
<p>made in supporting durable solutions for those displaced by the post-election violence of 
</p>
<p>2007&#8211;2008, significant obstacles persisted, most notably regarding socioeconomic and 
</p>
<p>political participation. In Moyale, in northern Kenya, he highlighted the situation of those 
</p>
<p>newly displaced due to ethnic and intercommunal violence or natural disasters. He urged 
</p>
<p>the Government to implement fully its progressive legislation adopted in 2012 on assistance 
</p>
<p>and protection for IDPs and affected communities, and to ratify the African Union 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (the 
</p>
<p>Kampala Convention). 
</p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan 
</b></p>
<p>5. From 18 to 24 May 2014, the Special Rapporteur visited Azerbaijan, including 
IDP settlements in and around Baku and in the western district of Agdam. He welcomed the 
</p>
<p>progress made by the authorities in improving the living conditions of IDPs. He noted that 
</p>
<p>reaching a peaceful settlement to the unresolved conflict in and around the Nagorno-</p>


<p>Karabakh region1 was critical to resolving the protracted situation of internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>He emphasized that the inclusion of IDPs in development planning strategies in areas such 
</p>
<p>as housing, education, health and employment was necessary to strengthen their resilience, 
</p>
<p>livelihood opportunities and self-reliance. He stressed that IDPs must be fully involved in 
</p>
<p>development planning decisions and processes and recommended that a survey of intent 
</p>
<p>and a needs-based assessment be carried out in preparation for durable solutions 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/34/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b>  </b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire <b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. From 16 to 20 June 2014, two years after his official mission to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur visited Abidjan to assess the progress made in fostering durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for IDPs. While the majority of IDPs had returned to their area of origin, he 
</p>
<p>stressed the need for continued support to secure their basic needs and to rebuild their lives 
</p>
<p>sustainably. IDPs in need of durable solutions must not be forgotten at a time when 
</p>
<p>humanitarian actors were drawing down their activities. He stressed that the ratification by 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire of the Kampala Convention in 2014 provided a framework for concerted 
</p>
<p>action and he pointed out that IDPs must participate in national elections in 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>  Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>7. From 29 June to 5 July 2014, the Special Rapporteur visited Port-au-Prince to 
</p>
<p>assess the overall situation of IDPs in Haiti, four years after the earthquake. He called for a 
</p>
<p>transition from a largely humanitarian approach to development strategies that would 
</p>
<p>include durable solutions for IDPs in the context of addressing vulnerability and extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty. He reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government to work towards 
</p>
<p>rights-based development approaches to alleviating poverty while incorporating durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for IDPs (A/HRC/29/34/Add.2).  
</p>
<p><b>  Ukraine  
</b></p>
<p>8. From 16 to 25 September 2014, the Special Rapporteur visited Ukraine, 
</p>
<p>including the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in eastern Ukraine. He urged the Government 
</p>
<p>to intensify its efforts to meet the needs and protect the human rights of IDPs from the 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected eastern region and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Noting the lack 
</p>
<p>of comprehensive data on the number, location and needs of displaced persons, he stressed 
</p>
<p>that full registration and profiling of IDPs, including needs assessments, were essential. 
</p>
<p>Registration procedures should be harmonized to ensure access for IDPs to essential 
</p>
<p>services, employment and livelihood opportunities, and to enable them to vote in future 
</p>
<p>elections (A/HRC/29/34/Add.3).  
</p>
<p><b>  Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>9. From 10 to 14 February 2015, the Special Rapporteur visited the Central African 
Republic on a joint mission with the Assistant Secretary-General of the Office for the 
</p>
<p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Director of Operations of the Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission. The delegation visited 
</p>
<p>Bambari, Yaloke, Mpoko and PK5 in Bangui. The Special Rapporteur stressed the need to 
</p>
<p>ensure the safety and freedom of movement of IDPs, while protecting the way of life of 
</p>
<p>nomadic groups. He welcomed the ratification by the Central African Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Kampala Convention, but urged that consultations for the national dialogue (the Bangui 
</p>
<p>Forum on National Reconciliation) be truly inclusive of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Any reference to the territories in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region should be understood to 
</p>
<p>be in full compliance with General Assembly resolution 62/243 of 14 March 2008.  </p>


<p><b>  Requests for country visits 
</b></p>
<p>10. Since his previous report, the Special Rapporteur has made or reiterated requests 
</p>
<p>to visit Colombia, Iraq, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with regional and international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur engaged closely with the African Union to promote 
</p>
<p>ratification and implementation of the Kampala Convention. He visited the African Union 
</p>
<p>headquarters in March 2014 to activate a joint continent-wide action plan on 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention. He called upon States parties to establish or strengthen 
</p>
<p>internal mechanisms promoting the engagement and participation of local authorities, 
</p>
<p>communities, civil society organizations and the private sector. In November 2014, as 
</p>
<p>keynote speaker at the African Union Humanitarian Symposium in Nairobi, he discussed 
</p>
<p>effective humanitarian interventions and assistance in conflict-induced displacement 
</p>
<p>situations. In December 2014, he took stock of and urged greater progress on the 
</p>
<p>Convention at an event organized by the Permanent Delegation of the African Union to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Office at Geneva marking the second anniversary of the entry into force of 
</p>
<p>the Convention.  
</p>
<p>12. In July 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in a joint initiative of the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including delegations from 
</p>
<p>participating States, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR), to promote a more collaborative approach to addressing displacement, using the 
</p>
<p>Protection Checklist elaborated jointly by OSCE, UNHCR and his mandate. The Checklist 
</p>
<p>is a tool for ensuring the protection of displaced populations and affected communities at 
</p>
<p>all stages of a conflict. He also informed the OSCE participating delegations of his findings 
</p>
<p>in OSCE States affected by displacement.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur maintained a strong partnership with civil society 
organizations. Among such collaboration, he appreciates the support provided by the 
</p>
<p>Brookings-London School of Economics Project on Internal Displacement, and the 
</p>
<p>strategic partnership with the Joint IDP Profiling Service, the Danish Refugee Council and 
</p>
<p>the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Civil society has played a vital role in 
</p>
<p>supporting him, including during his country visits. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mainstreaming the human rights of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur continued to support the mainstreaming of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of IDPs within the United Nations system and the wider humanitarian community by 
</p>
<p>participating actively in the work of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the Global 
</p>
<p>Protection Cluster and the humanitarian affairs segment of the Economic and Social 
</p>
<p>Council. He drew on his recent missions to illustrate the importance of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>principles in responding to the protection and assistance needs of IDPs, both in the 
</p>
<p>emergency phase of conflicts and in the search for durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>15. In May 2014, the Special Rapporteur addressed the Security Council in an 
&#8220;Arria formula&#8221; meeting on &#8220;Protection of internally displaced persons: challenges and role 
of the Security Council&#8221;,2 focusing on common goals of the Council and its partners, inter 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/ArriaFormula_SC_on_protection_of_IDPs.pdf. </p>


<p>alia: protection of civilians, including IDPs in areas of refuge, during flight and upon 
</p>
<p>return; and durable solutions involving humanitarian and development challenges, but also 
</p>
<p>peacebuilding challenges. He addressed the Council again in October, in a debate on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Women, peace and security &#8212; displaced women and girls: leaders and survivors&#8221;. He 
stressed that internally displaced women often faced double discrimination as IDPs and 
</p>
<p>women. They experienced unique human rights challenges due to the intersection of gender 
</p>
<p>with factors such as age, group affiliation, disability and their civil or socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>situations. Despite positive developments, responses to internal displacement still did not 
</p>
<p>adequately address the specific concerns of women and girls. 
</p>
<p>16. In June 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in a Central and West African 
</p>
<p>consultation, in Abidjan, in preparation for the World Humanitarian Summit, and from 2 to 
</p>
<p>6 March 2015, he participated in a Middle East and North African regional consultation in 
</p>
<p>Amman. At those consultations, he highlighted approaches to mitigating protracted 
</p>
<p>displacement, building more coherence between governments, development partners and 
</p>
<p>the humanitarian community, and support for communities affected by displacement. 
</p>
<p>Stressing the lack of preparedness of regional and national actors in responding rapidly to 
</p>
<p>IDP needs, he stated the necessity to adopt regional instruments and national laws and 
</p>
<p>policies on internal displacement and urged that effective partnerships be entered into in 
</p>
<p>order to respond to emergency needs in urban areas. 
</p>
<p>17. In September 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel on &#8220;Durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for post-crisis development&#8221;, in the context of the World Reconstruction 
</p>
<p>Conference 2 organized by the World Bank. He stressed the importance of the involvement 
</p>
<p>of development partners to attain durable solutions. Drawing on examples from his 
</p>
<p>missions, he shared challenges and opportunities encountered in developing durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for post-crisis displacement. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Internally displaced persons in the context of the post-2015 
development agenda  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and overview 
</b></p>
<p>18. The phenomenon of displacement is currently, more than ever before, a global 
</p>
<p>crisis. As at December 2013, an estimated 33.3 million persons were internally displaced by 
</p>
<p>conflict and violence globally. In addition, in 2013 alone, some 22.4 million people were 
</p>
<p>newly displaced within their own countries by disasters. Given new and ongoing crises, 
</p>
<p>these figures are likely to have increased in 2014, with displacement at its highest level 
</p>
<p>since the Second World War. 
</p>
<p>19.  Displacement, whether caused by conflict, violence or disaster, usually leads to 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty and renders IDPs highly vulnerable. It typically results in loss of land, 
</p>
<p>homes and property, loss of employment or livelihood, food insecurity, lack of access to 
</p>
<p>basic services, including water and sanitation and health care, and poor access to education. 
</p>
<p>Displacement may cause IDPs to be more at risk of violence, including sexual and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, trafficking and other forms of abuse, either in the context of ongoing 
</p>
<p>conflicts or due to the perilous and poor conditions in which IDPs find themselves. 
</p>
<p>Displacement causes disintegration of community and family cohesion, and of 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic networks and support mechanisms. </p>


<p>20. While the numbers of IDPs are shocking, an even more surprising statistic is that 
</p>
<p>the average duration of conflict-induced displacement is now a staggering 17 years.3 While 
</p>
<p>some IDPs are able to return to their homes relatively quickly and with all the necessary 
</p>
<p>assistance, for many, displacement is a protracted and life-changing experience which may 
</p>
<p>last decades. 
</p>
<p>21. The challenges facing IDPs have long been recognized internationally. In 1998,  
</p>
<p>Kofi Annan, then United Nations Secretary-General, noted that internal displacement had 
</p>
<p>emerged as one of the great human tragedies of our times and that internally displaced 
</p>
<p>people were among the most vulnerable of the human family. The former United Nations 
</p>
<p>Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and 
</p>
<p>current Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, has stated that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;something is going terribly wrong in how we are responding and dealing with this issue&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Ant&#243;nio Guterres, has affirmed that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;we have a shared responsibility to act to end this massive suffering. Immediate protection 
</p>
<p>and assistance for the internally displaced is a humanitarian imperative.&#8221;5 
</p>
<p>22. Internal displacement must also be recognized as a development imperative 
</p>
<p>requiring sustainable solutions. If not appropriately addressed through durable solutions, 
</p>
<p>internal displacement can strain the capacities of the communities in which IDPs live, 
</p>
<p>potentially leading to further instability, strife and displacement. Internal displacement 
</p>
<p>crises can impede the achievement of national development goals and may destabilize the 
</p>
<p>regions affected, particularly in conflict or fragile post-conflict settings. However, where 
</p>
<p>development-based durable solutions are implemented, the positive contributions of IDPs to 
</p>
<p>their own and to their hosts&#8217; communities can be significant as IDPs adapt to new lives and 
</p>
<p>new livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>23. The challenges posed by, and the increasingly protracted duration of, internal 
</p>
<p>displacement mean that it must be recognized as a development challenge for the 
</p>
<p>international community and all nations facing internal displacement situations. Failing to 
</p>
<p>do so potentially leaves many millions of IDPs neglected and excluded from development 
</p>
<p>processes. Regrettably, IDPs frequently fall outside the net of development action, in large 
</p>
<p>part due to the perception that the issues of displaced persons require primarily 
</p>
<p>humanitarian rather than development solutions. While humanitarian assistance is essential 
</p>
<p>to support IDPs through the immediate crisis and its aftermath, development approaches 
</p>
<p>and the engagement of development actors as well as peacebuilding actors from the very 
</p>
<p>outset ensure that durable solutions are made available to IDPs.  
</p>
<p>24. Rather than being included in development initiatives, over time IDPs often lose 
the attention and support of national authorities and international actors. This is particularly 
</p>
<p>true for those living outside collective centres or camps, dispersed and hosted within 
</p>
<p>families and displacement-affected communities, for instance in urban areas. However, it 
</p>
<p>can also be witnessed when long-term IDP camps become established, semi-permanent 
</p>
<p>settlements where, due to necessity, coping mechanisms improve and economic and social 
</p>
<p>functions begin to emerge and take root.  
</p>
<p>25. There is a danger of camps and their populations becoming &#8220;invisible&#8221; or an 
</p>
<p>inconvenience that national authorities seek to remove by closure or demolition of facilities. 
</p>
<p>Regrettably, some governments have taken the view that the closure of camps and/or the 
</p>
<p>provision of cash grants to IDPs without linking the grants to livelihood and other 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>sustainable strategies, constitute a solution to displacement that absolves them of further 
</p>
<p>responsibilities. Such measures may be forced upon IDPs or accepted by them, since they 
</p>
<p>are frequently unaware of their rights under international law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Progress towards ensuring a place for internally displaced persons in 
</b></p>
<p><b>development agendas  
</b></p>
<p>26. With displacement at its highest levels since the Second World War, it is 
</p>
<p>important to revisit the fundamental premises on which the post-war order is based, in the 
</p>
<p>context of displacement. The 1945 Charter of the United Nations (Arts. 55 and 56) created 
</p>
<p>an obligation for the United Nations and Member States to create conditions of stability and 
</p>
<p>well-being based on respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to 
</p>
<p>promote and pledge to achieve, inter alia, higher standards of living, full employment, and 
</p>
<p>conditions of economic and social progress and development. Those obligations also 
</p>
<p>pertain to IDPs and require their inclusion in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>27. The 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development (General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 41/128, annex) underscores that development is an inalienable human right. It 
</p>
<p>establishes that: &#8220;States have the right and the duty to formulate appropriate national 
</p>
<p>development policies that aim at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire 
</p>
<p>population and of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful 
</p>
<p>participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefits resulting therefrom.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, IDPs have frequently been neglected in or excluded from development 
</p>
<p>strategies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>28. A 2014 European Commission paper on &#8220;Development, refugees and IDPs&#8221;6 
</p>
<p>states:  
</p>
<p>While refugees and IDPs frequently benefit from humanitarian assistance, they are often 
</p>
<p>excluded from programmes and activities carried out by development actors, with the result 
</p>
<p>that their developmental needs may be neglected and efforts to achieve sustainable solutions 
</p>
<p>receive inadequate attention. At the same time, host populations might not benefit from 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance provided to refugees and IDPs, paving the way to potential conflicts 
</p>
<p>between the two communities. In addition, the development needs of returnees and long-term 
</p>
<p>strategies to address them have often been overlooked once back in the country or area of 
</p>
<p>origin.  
</p>
<p>29. UNHCR highlights that approximately three quarters of displaced persons, both 
</p>
<p>refugees and IDPs, are in situations of protracted displacement. It has stated: 
</p>
<p>the perception that displacement challenges can only be addressed by humanitarian means is 
</p>
<p>ill-conceived which has either impeded or delayed in achieving the sustainability of solutions 
</p>
<p>or resulted in protracted displacements finding difficulties to break from the cycle of 
</p>
<p>dependence on humanitarian assistance and to move on with their lives and livelihoods.7  
</p>
<p>30. In his report to the General Assembly (A/68/225), in which he addressed the role 
</p>
<p>of humanitarian and development actors in achieving durable solutions for IDPs through 
</p>
<p>peacebuilding in the aftermath of conflict, the Special Rapporteur identified initiatives 
</p>
<p>aimed at bridging the gap between relief and development. For instance, the Solutions 
</p>
<p>Alliance was launched in April 2014 when humanitarian actors, development organizations,

<p> 7 UNHCR, &#8220;Concept note: Transitional Solutions Initiative&#8221;, p. 1. </p>


<p>States, donors and civil society gathered in Copenhagen to discuss solutions to protracted 
</p>
<p>displacement and its management. On that occasion, it was emphasized that the 
</p>
<p>displacement of refugees and IDPs presents significant development opportunities and 
</p>
<p>challenges, in addition to the humanitarian needs and the humanitarian &#8216;imperative&#8217;&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>31. In recent years, some development actors have increasingly paid attention to 
</p>
<p>IDPs. In 2012, the World Bank developed <i>Guidelines for Assessing the Impacts and Costs 
</i></p>
<p><i>of Forced Displacement</i> in order to meet the need for enhanced understanding and 
</p>
<p>evaluation of the economic and social aspects of forced migration. In a more recent report 
</p>
<p>of the Global Program on Forced Displacement of the World Bank, <i>Political Economy and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Forced Displacement: Guidance and Lessons from Nine Country Case Studies</i>, a political 
</p>
<p>economy analysis was used as a tool to demonstrate the development impacts of 
</p>
<p>displacement and to advance arguments for development initiatives to assist IDPs and host 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>32. The positive achievements of the Millennium Development Goals demonstrate 
</p>
<p>that significant progress by States is possible, in collaboration with international 
</p>
<p>development partners. Lessons can be learned, for example, from what has been achieved 
</p>
<p>in poverty reduction and providing access to education in the least developed countries. 
</p>
<p>However, lessons must also be learned about where and why the Goals failed to benefit the 
</p>
<p>poorest and most vulnerable groups. It is essential to intensify efforts to reach those 
</p>
<p>individuals, communities and population groups, including IDPs, who have been bypassed, 
</p>
<p>neglected or failed.  
</p>
<p>33. Despite the explicit commitments made in the United Nations Millennium 
</p>
<p>Declaration to protect the vulnerable and &#8220;to help all refugees and displaced persons to 
</p>
<p>return voluntarily to their homes, in safety and dignity and to be smoothly reintegrated into 
</p>
<p>their societies&#8221;,9 millions of IDPs globally are amongst those who were left behind as 
</p>
<p>others were brought out of poverty. All durable solutions, not just return, but also local 
</p>
<p>integration or settlement elsewhere within the country, must be considered as options 
</p>
<p>available to IDPs. They all require the involvement of development processes, strategies, 
</p>
<p>and actors for their achievement. 
</p>
<p>34. Over the Millennium Development Goal period, millions of people in numerous 
</p>
<p>countries have been plunged into extreme poverty and vulnerability as a direct result of 
</p>
<p>internal displacement. The United Nations <i>Millennium Development Goals Report 2014</i>10 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that &#8220;every day in 2013, 32,000 people had to abandon their homes to seek 
</p>
<p>protection due to conflict&#8221;. The number of newly displaced persons11 has tripled since 2010, 
</p>
<p>representing a significant setback to achievements under the Goals and demonstrating a 
</p>
<p>disturbing trend towards increasing displacement that must be recognized in the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda.

</p>
<p>36. There is much to praise in the approach of the international community to the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals. While IDPs are not 
</p>
<p>explicitly referred to in the currently proposed goals and targets, several have the potential, 
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly, to have a positive impact on IDPs, including through new or 
</p>
<p>enhanced focus areas, for example, to reduce inequality; to make cities and human 
</p>
<p>settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; and to take urgent action to combat 
</p>
<p>climate change and its impacts. Nevertheless, it is essential that broad references to and 
</p>
<p>definitions of &#8220;vulnerable&#8221;, &#8220;marginalized&#8221; and &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; groups explicitly include 
</p>
<p>IDPs.  
</p>
<p>37. That having been said, it is not sufficient to simply include IDPs in a list of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups. In a joint note sent to the United Nations Secretary-General in October 
</p>
<p>2014, the Special Rapporteur, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
</p>
<p>UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) expressed concern that, 
</p>
<p>despite strong support from many Member States, a dedicated displacement target was 
</p>
<p>omitted from the final report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>Goals (A/68/97).12 A dedicated target on reducing the number of IDPs and refugees by 
</p>
<p>providing durable solutions, contained under proposed sustainable development goal 16 on 
</p>
<p>achieving peaceful and inclusive societies would be a valuable step towards that end. 
</p>
<p>38. In December 2014, the synthesis report of the Secretary-General on the post-
2015 sustainable development agenda13 highlighted &#8220;gap issues&#8221;, and included explicit 
references to internal displacement. It calls for a transformative shift away from business as 
</p>
<p>usual and proposes six &#8220;essential elements&#8221;: (a) dignity: to end poverty and fight 
inequalities; (b) people: to ensure healthy lives, knowledge and the inclusion of women and 
</p>
<p>children; (c) prosperity: to grow a strong, inclusive, and transformative economy; (d) 
</p>
<p>planet: to protect our ecosystems for all societies and our children; (e) justice: to promote 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 A previous draft of the proposed goals contained a specific target on IDPs and refugees, but did not 
</p>
<p>find consensus. During the thirteenth session of the Open Working Group, in July 2014, more than 
</p>
<p>20 countries argued for an IDP/refugee target under goal 16. 
</p>
<p> 13 The road to dignity by 2030: ending poverty, transforming all lives and protecting the planet 
</p>
<p>(A/69/700). </p>


<p>safe and peaceful societies and strong institutions; (f) partnership: to catalyse global 
</p>
<p>solidarity for sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>39. The synthesis report recognizes increasingly negative displacement trends. In the 
</p>
<p>section on &#8220;dignity&#8221; it states that no society can reach its full potential if whole segments of 
</p>
<p>that society are excluded from participating in, contributing to, and benefiting from 
</p>
<p>development. It notes that the agenda &#8220;must not exclude migrants, refugees, displaced 
</p>
<p>persons, or persons affected by conflict<b> </b>and occupation&#8221;. The chapter entitled &#8220;A synthesis&#8221; 
</p>
<p>states that particular attention should be given to countries in situations of fragility and 
</p>
<p>conflict and the specific conditions of each country should be addressed. There is a 
</p>
<p>consistent call to &#8220;leave no one behind&#8221; and ensure equality, non-discrimination, equity and 
</p>
<p>inclusion. The report states: &#8220;We must pay special attention to the people, groups and 
</p>
<p>countries most in need. We need to include the poor, children, adolescents, youth and the 
</p>
<p>aged, as well as the unemployed, rural populations, slum dwellers, persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, migrants, <i>refugees and displaced persons, vulnerable groups</i> and 
</p>
<p>minorities. These also include those affected by climate change.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>40. On &#8220;justice&#8221;, the report highlights the need &#8220;to rebuild and reintegrate societies 
</p>
<p>better after crises and conflicts. We must address State fragility, <i>support internally 
</i></p>
<p><i>displaced persons</i> and contribute to resilience of people and communities. Reconciliation, 
</p>
<p>peacebuilding and State-building are critical for countries to overcome fragility and develop 
</p>
<p>cohesive societies and strong institutions. These investments are essential to retaining the 
</p>
<p>gains of development and avoiding reversals in the future&#8221;. Finally, the report emphasizes 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;we must, inter alia, address inequalities in all areas, agreeing that <i>no goal or target be 
</i></p>
<p><i>considered met unless met for all social and economic groups.</i>&#8221; 
</p>
<p>41. The synthesis report provides a clear call to include IDPs. Political negotiations 
</p>
<p>continue in 2015 and will culminate in a Special Summit on Sustainable Development, to 
</p>
<p>be attended by Heads of State and Government, in New York from 25 to 27 September, at 
</p>
<p>which the post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable development goals will be 
</p>
<p>adopted. The Special Rapporteur stresses the need for the ongoing discussions to address 
</p>
<p>displacement. Displacement concerns must also be addressed in the formulation of 
</p>
<p>indicators for targets whose implementation can affect the well-being of IDPs, including 
</p>
<p>those relating to resilience and disaster risk reduction; equal opportunity; and social, 
</p>
<p>economic political inclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Durable solutions and development for internally displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>42. Durable solutions for IDPs and sustainable development goals are inherently 
</p>
<p>linked and mutually reinforcing. Durable solutions envisage three scenarios: sustainable 
</p>
<p>reintegration in the place of origin (return); sustainable local integration in areas where 
</p>
<p>IDPs take refuge (local integration); or sustainable integration in another part of the 
</p>
<p>country.14 IDPs must be able to make decisions voluntarily, through informed choice, on 
</p>
<p>solutions that meet their needs. Freeing IDPs from the cycle of dependency is the key goal 
</p>
<p>of durable solutions and is best achieved by their inclusion in development strategies and 
</p>
<p>rights-based approaches that recognize and respond to their unique situations. Walter K&#228;lin, 
</p>
<p>former Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons, stated in his 2009 report: &#8220;A durable solution is achieved when internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that are 
</p>

</p>
<p> 14 Inter-Agency Standing Committee, <i>IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced 
</i></p>

</p>
<p>Displacement, 2010).  </p>


<p>linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on 
</p>
<p>account of their displacement.&#8221;15  
</p>
<p>43. States and other national and international actors frequently misunderstand what 
</p>
<p>constitute durable solutions. Neither return to place of origin nor establishing permanent 
</p>
<p>settlement elsewhere constitute, on their own, durable solutions. In places of origin, homes, 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and livelihoods may be destroyed and development projects are essential for 
</p>
<p>early recovery and reconstruction. Property may have been occupied or sold creating 
</p>
<p>significant obstacles to be resolved. IDPs opting for local integration require development 
</p>
<p>assistance to overcome barriers to integration. Improved housing provision or cash grants, 
</p>
<p>for example, do not constitute durable solutions if not combined with strategies to address 
</p>
<p>livelihood and integration objectives. Host communities affected may also require sustained 
</p>
<p>development assistance.  
</p>
<p>44. As highlighted in the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally 
Displaced Persons, achieving durable solutions entails responding to key development 
</p>
<p>challenges in addition to guaranteeing security and non-discrimination. They include 
</p>
<p>ensuring access to livelihoods, education and health care in areas of return, local integration 
</p>
<p>or other settlement areas, helping to establish or re-establish local governance structures 
</p>
<p>and the rule of law, and supporting the rebuilding of houses and infrastructure. International 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and development actors must have rapid and unimpeded access to assist IDPs 
</p>
<p>in finding durable solutions. Such actors have a complementary role alongside national 
</p>
<p>authorities and they should all work together to set up a rights-based process to support 
</p>
<p>durable solutions for IDPs.  
</p>
<p>45. Humanitarian responses to displacement are frequently short-term and focused 
</p>
<p>on immediate needs despite the fact that chronic and protracted crises have become the 
</p>
<p>norm and are to a large extent predictable. Humanitarian actors commonly focus on 
</p>
<p>narrowly defined mandates and objectives, for example the provision of shelter, water, 
</p>
<p>sanitation and hygiene, food, health care or education. Humanitarian coordination has 
</p>
<p>vastly improved, including through the use of thematic clusters, and in some situations 
</p>
<p>working groups on durable solutions. However, responses rarely meet durable solutions 
</p>
<p>criteria for protracted displacement situations. Holistic development approaches have long-
</p>
<p>term and sustainable objectives which recognize, for example, the fundamental 
</p>
<p>interconnection between shelter and livelihood, and their importance for health, food 
</p>
<p>security and education. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Why should internally displaced persons be a priority within 
</b></p>
<p><b>development agendas?  
</b></p>
<p>46. Due to conflict and political, social or other factors, including failure to 
</p>
<p>implement international standards, many IDPs in all regions find themselves in protracted 
</p>
<p>displacement situations. What were originally &#8220;temporary&#8221; solutions may regrettably 
</p>
<p>become more permanent places of settlement. According to the Office for the Coordination 
</p>
<p>of Humanitarian Affairs, when governments and international agencies understand that 
</p>
<p>reality they must recognize that &#8220;internal displacement is not only a humanitarian issue 
</p>
<p>but ultimately and most importantly a long-term development issue that requires the full 
</p>
<p>and sustained engagement of a diversity of national and international actors&#8221; .16

<p>47. As the Special Rapporteur pointed out in the joint note to the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>in October 2014 with Valerie Amos, Ant&#243;nio Guterres and William Lacy Swing:  
</p>
<p>The displaced are often excluded from longer-term development and institutional planning. If 
</p>
<p>left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates further marginalization, inequality, 
</p>
<p>fragility, vulnerability and erodes people&#8217;s resilience. This poses a serious impediment to all 
</p>
<p>present pillars of sustainable development both for the displaced persons and host 
</p>
<p>communities. Development actors need to increase their engagement from the onset of a crisis 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the development dimensions of displacement are addressed. The post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda therefore needs to address protracted displacement by ensuring effective 
</p>
<p>support for durable solutions.17 
</p>
<p>48. Displacement commonly leaves homes, infrastructure, businesses and 
</p>
<p>livelihoods in ruins, and requires extensive reconstruction and socioeconomic development 
</p>
<p>projects. The impacts on communities and the psychological well-being of IDPs also 
</p>
<p>require attention to rebuild functioning communities. Where IDPs return to environments of 
</p>
<p>previous conflict, development actors can introduce elements of community cohesion, 
</p>
<p>justice and reconciliation into development projects that work across previously conflict-
</p>
<p>affected communities as key development and peacebuilding initiatives. 
</p>
<p>49. A consideration of some of the proposed sustainable development goals through 
an internal displacement lens, informed by IDP standards, and the work and visits of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur and his predecessors, demonstrates the clear rationale for dedicated 
</p>
<p>attention to IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 
</b></p>
<p>50. IDPs often lose their homes, land, possessions, livelihoods and their financial 
resources. They are among the poorest of the poor and may be made more vulnerable by 
</p>
<p>hostility and insecurity, as well as by the trauma of displacement and the breakdown of 
</p>
<p>community cohesion. They are likely to have weaker and less established coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms than other poor communities, and what resources they do have are likely to be 
</p>
<p>targeted towards basic survival. Owing to their unique circumstances, while their coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, employment and income-generating activities may improve over time, the 
</p>
<p>poverty experienced by IDPs is likely to be more extreme and persistent than poverty 
</p>
<p>experienced by others in society and requires dedicated programmes to address it. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the target to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 
</p>
<p>will be impossible to meet without tackling the situation of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>51. During his visit to Haiti in July 2014, the Special Rapporteur noted that one of 
</p>
<p>the main obstacles in the search for durable solutions for IDPs remained the extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty from which a large portion of the population suffered and which particularly 
</p>
<p>affected those displaced by the 2010 earthquake. In that context, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>further reaffirmed the primary responsibility of the Government to work towards  rights-
</p>
<p>based development approaches to alleviating poverty that incorporated durable solutions for 
</p>
<p>IDPs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>52. Hunger and food insecurity are frequently the most pressing problems for IDPs. 
</p>
<p>Having lost access to lands and livelihoods, their ability to produce or purchase food may 
</p>
<p>be limited, leaving them heavily reliant on humanitarian aid or the charitable donations of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 Joint note from OCHA, UNHCR, IOM and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons to the United Nations Secretary-General (October 2014). </p>


<p>host families and communities, who may also face food insecurity. Where displacement 
</p>
<p>becomes protracted, without durable solutions in place, food security and nutrition 
</p>
<p>problems may be particularly pronounced, especially where humanitarian aid has 
</p>
<p>diminished or ended. Often lacking adequate coping mechanisms, IDPs are amongst the 
</p>
<p>most vulnerable communities in terms of food security.  
</p>
<p>53. While humanitarian aid staples often consist of rice, beans, oil and tinned 
</p>
<p>produce, as well as products to meet the nutritional needs of children, there is frequently a 
</p>
<p>shortage of higher value or perishable foodstuffs, such as meat, fish and vegetables. A 
</p>
<p>restricted diet over any significant period can result in inadequate nutrition and 
</p>
<p>malnutrition, with a lasting effect on the health of individuals and their susceptibility to 
</p>
<p>illness. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of taking into account 
</p>
<p>the specific needs of children, breastfeeding mothers and groups with specific dietary 
</p>
<p>habits, such as nomadic peoples. Systematically implementing an approach to hunger and 
</p>
<p>food security that recognizes the need for availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
</p>
<p>quality, means also including IDPs.  
</p>
<p>54. During his joint visit to the Central African Republic in February 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur deplored the living conditions of nearly 500 members of the Peulh 
</p>
<p>minority group, trapped in an enclave in Yaloke.18 According to reports, the food being 
</p>
<p>distributed in Yaloke does not meet the cultural and nutritional needs of the Peulh minority 
</p>
<p>group. The Peulh, living largely on a diet of beef and milk from cattle, are not used to the 
</p>
<p>rice and beans that humanitarian agencies distribute. As of December 2014, over 40 Peulh 
</p>
<p>had died from malnutrition and other diseases, the majority of them children. 
</p>
<p>55. In many displacement situations access to land, livestock and employment are 
</p>
<p>essential elements of durable solutions and development that must be put in place to enable 
</p>
<p>IDPs to reduce or eliminate their dependency on humanitarian aid. Furthermore, where 
</p>
<p>large numbers of IDPs are sheltered within host communities they can be a heavy burden 
</p>
<p>on the food security of such non-IDP communities, whose food resources must be spread 
</p>
<p>further. 
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages  
</b></p>
<p>56. IDPs frequently lose access to health care and medicines and rely heavily on 
</p>
<p>humanitarian health-care assistance. The situation is particularly acute in the least 
</p>
<p>developed countries where health-care provision is generally poor and in rural areas where 
</p>
<p>facilities are sparse. In cases of large-scale displacement, the capacity of existing health-
</p>
<p>care services is often inadequate to respond to the psychological and  physical health-care 
</p>
<p>needs of IDPs. In urban settings, the challenges are also acute and include lack of capacity 
</p>
<p>of health-care services, and challenges relating to documentation and possible 
</p>
<p>discrimination. The costs of services and medicines frequently put adequate health care out 
</p>
<p>of the reach of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>57. M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res has highlighted the health-care challenges facing 
</p>
<p>IDPs, especially in the context of conflict, noting that &#8220;while programmes exist to provide 
</p>
<p>surgical and other care to these victims, the vast majority will not receive the care they need 
</p>
<p>because they live in regions where the health-care system has collapsed and where it is too 
</p>
<p>dangerous for independent aid agencies to operate&#8221;.19 To achieve that target &#8220;for all at all 
</p>
<p>ages&#8221;, requires resolving the health-care and well-being challenges experienced by IDPs.

<p>58. During his visit to Azerbaijan in May 2014,20 the Special Rapporteur highlighted 
</p>
<p>the difficulties IDPs encountered in accessing health services due to limited availability and 
</p>
<p>supplies in IDP communities. Limited access to reproductive health services was also 
</p>
<p>raised. During his visit to Ukraine in September 2014,21 the Special Rapporteur learned that 
</p>
<p>IDPs lacked access to essential medicines, which were not available free of charge. Those 
</p>
<p>IDPs requiring urgent medical care or maternal health care and those with chronic health 
</p>
<p>conditions are particularly vulnerable. Congested or cramped living conditions, poor 
</p>
<p>hygiene and sanitation breed and spread diseases. The psychological impact of 
</p>
<p>displacement and proximity to conflict often requires specialist care, rarely available to 
</p>
<p>IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
</b></p>
<p><b>learning opportunities for all  
</b></p>
<p>59. For many children in displacement situations, exclusion from education can be a 
</p>
<p>long-term problem. Particularly in less developed countries, lack of resources, buildings, 
</p>
<p>teachers and education materials may all create barriers to education. Lack of 
</p>
<p>documentation, including birth certificates, may be a factor in States in which students must 
</p>
<p>demonstrate their citizenship or residence in a region to have access to services. 
</p>
<p>Discrimination may also be a factor, with schools and local authorities being reluctant to 
</p>
<p>accept displaced children from different ethnic, linguistic or religious groups.  
</p>
<p>60. Education also provides routine, normality, a protective function, support and 
</p>
<p>information and can be an important step towards community integration in displacement 
</p>
<p>locations. For IDPs, education may be a low priority in the face of survival needs. Children 
</p>
<p>may contribute economically to displaced communities, which can be another barrier to 
</p>
<p>their schooling. Internally displaced parents may exclude children from school in the belief 
</p>
<p>that they will quickly return to their original homes, only for their displacement to become 
</p>
<p>protracted. Parents may also hesitate to send their children to school in conflict zones which 
</p>
<p>may be targeted for forced recruitment of children. 
</p>
<p>61. On his visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 2012,22 the Special Rapporteur noted that in some 
</p>
<p>western regions, an estimated 140,000 children had missed out on their education in 2011, 
</p>
<p>due to insecurity and the destruction and pillaging of school buildings. Education was also 
</p>
<p>disrupted in the centre and east of the country, and in Abidjan. He stressed that urgent 
</p>
<p>measures were needed to ensure that children, some of whom had seen their education 
</p>
<p>repeatedly disrupted, were provided with support to resume their education and make up 
</p>
<p>the years of lost schooling.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls  
</b></p>
<p>62. As women and mothers, poor and frequently from minorities, internally 
</p>
<p>displaced women face multiple and intersectional challenges. Women are frequently 
</p>
<p>separated from men in conflict-related displacement situations, sometimes permanently due 
</p>
<p>to the death of men, or to men joining the armed conflict or being forced to flee the conflict 
</p>
<p>without their families. Women also frequently have the primary responsibility of caring for 
</p>
<p>children and the elderly and are less able to seek employment or income-generating 
</p>
<p>activities. Despite these obstacles, internally displaced women frequently take on family 
</p>
<p>and community leadership roles.  
</p>

<p>63. As highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in his address to the Security Council23 
as well as in a press statement marking the International Day for the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Violence Against Women,24 internally displaced women and girls are often 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affected by displacement. The Special Rapporteur on violence against 
</p>
<p>women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, has said: &#8220;They flee to escape 
arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, forced recruitment or 
</p>
<p>starvation, but too often, they encounter the same level of insecurity, violence and threats of 
</p>
<p>violence, reinforced by a climate of impunity, at their destination.&#8221;25 
</p>
<p>64. In his 2013 report on internally displaced women, the Special Rapporteur noted 
</p>
<p>that discussions of gender issues within host and return communities and how particular 
</p>
<p>durable solutions could backstop protection for internally displaced women remained 
</p>
<p>relatively nascent.26 Addressing them required more concerted attention, as well as 
</p>
<p>cooperation between humanitarian and development actors.27 Amongst his 
</p>
<p>recommendations, he urged States to facilitate the active participation of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced women in the development and implementation of national and regional action 
</p>
<p>plans on women, peace and security, and the integration of their diverse concerns into such 
</p>
<p>plans.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all  
</b></p>
<p>65. Secure access to safe water and sanitation can be a matter of life or death for 
IDPs. While national and international actors have achieved much in terms of emergency 
</p>
<p>humanitarian provision of water, sanitation and hygiene for all, barriers to the provision of 
</p>
<p>safe water and sanitation continue to create and exacerbate disease, illness and death among 
</p>
<p>IDPs. Once humanitarian actors leave or step down their activities following conflict or 
</p>
<p>disaster, the degradation of emergency water and sanitation systems remains a significant 
</p>
<p>challenge for many IDPs.  
</p>
<p>66. Humanitarian programmes have achieved essential results. In the Darfur region 
</p>
<p>of the Sudan displacement has affected an estimated 2.7 million Darfurians since 2013. A 
</p>
<p>647 million euro project from April 201228 provided IDPs in targeted camps with 15 litres 
</p>
<p>of safe water per day; established water collection points within safe walking distance; 
</p>
<p>ensured access to adequate sanitation facilities and latrines; and ensured that targeted 
</p>
<p>communities had knowledge of waterborne diseases and their prevention. Some 182,890 
</p>
<p>people were beneficiaries of the 12-month programme. While such results are impressive, 
</p>
<p>the challenge remains to ensure sustainability and to transition from humanitarian responses 
</p>
<p>to durable, development-led solutions as early as possible.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and 
</b></p>
<p><b>productive employment and decent work for all 
</b></p>
<p>67. Seeking and obtaining employment or livelihood activities are commonly more 
</p>
<p>difficult for displaced persons in unfamiliar localities who may face additional barriers,

<p>including discrimination, loss of documents, and the psychosocial impact and pressures of 
</p>
<p>displacement. Where they find refuge in areas of existing unemployment or economic 
</p>
<p>hardship they are likely to be the last to gain work if it does become available. Women and 
</p>
<p>mothers are likely to face unique challenges and restrictions to their income-generating 
</p>
<p>activities, including childcare issues and the threat of violence if they leave the camps.  
</p>
<p>68. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Sri Lanka in December 2013, he noted 
obstacles to durable solutions for IDPs in their lack of access to their original land, which 
</p>
<p>prevented their return and their having sustainable livelihoods. He stressed that significant 
</p>
<p>efforts were required to ensure that the livelihoods of IDPs were restored.29 During his visit 
</p>
<p>to Ukraine in September 2014, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the difficulty faced 
</p>
<p>by IDPs in finding employment and income-generating opportunities. Some IDPs described 
</p>
<p>problems with their residence registration in their places of origin, their work records which 
</p>
<p>remained with former employers, and discrimination when they identified themselves as 
</p>
<p>IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries  
</b></p>
<p>69. IDPs frequently face gross and persistent inequality that significantly worsens 
</p>
<p>their displacement and hampers their ability to integrate fully into new or host societies. 
</p>
<p>Reducing inequality and discrimination within countries helps prevent displacement as well 
</p>
<p>as contributing to achieving durable solutions for IDPs. Respect for the principle of equal 
</p>
<p>rights ensures the well-being of IDPs. Social, economic and political inclusion of all, 
</p>
<p>including IDPs, is thus key to the prevention of displacement by achieving equality within 
</p>
<p>and among countries. For some ethnic, religious or national minorities, their government is 
</p>
<p>the perpetrator of violence, their homes are not safe and integration into new localities may 
</p>
<p>be particularly difficult. 
</p>
<p>70. IDPs frequently belong to national, ethnic or religious minorities who, due to 
</p>
<p>historical, geopolitical, social and other factors, may face varying degrees of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>social and economic marginalization and sometimes violence on the basis of their identity. 
</p>
<p>They may be excluded or marginalized in national development programmes, even during 
</p>
<p>periods of peace. During times of instability and conflict, they are vulnerable to violence 
</p>
<p>and displacement by larger population groups, members of which may dominate the 
</p>
<p>government, the police and military forces and other public bodies, including those with 
</p>
<p>responsibility for national development goals.  
</p>
<p>71. During his follow-up visit to Kenya in May 2014, the Special Rapporteur noted 
</p>
<p>that, although progress had been made in supporting durable solutions for those displaced 
</p>
<p>following the post-election violence of 2007/08, significant obstacles to achieving that goal 
</p>
<p>remained, most notably regarding socioeconomic and political integration. In accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the IASC Framework on Durable 
</p>
<p>Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons, he recalled that IDPs should be able to exercise 
</p>
<p>their right to participate in public affairs at all levels and without discrimination on the basis 
</p>
<p>of their displacement.  
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable  
</b></p>
<p>72. While IDPs living in camp settings are more visible, alternative coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including living with host families, are now the norm for a majority of IDPs.30 
</p>
<p>An implicit assumption is often made that IDPs living outside camps are less in need of 
</p>
<p>protection and assistance and have found solutions of their own. While host communities 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 30 See A/HRC/19/54. </p>


<p>may initially welcome and assist IDPs, when their stay is protracted, the strain on resources 
</p>
<p>may lead to an eventual breaking point, and may require IDPs to look for alternative 
</p>
<p>assistance or living arrangements, often resulting in secondary displacement. For economic, 
</p>
<p>security and anonymity reasons, IDPs often move to the outskirts of cities, where they mix 
</p>
<p>with the urban poor.31 While such areas may provide better livelihood opportunities, they 
</p>
<p>are often most violent or hazardous areas and IDPs are at greater risk of being displaced a 
</p>
<p>second time or of facing additional human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>73. Despite the challenges, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that a more 
</p>
<p>effective and systematized management of IDPs outside camps, and more specifically of 
</p>
<p>IDPs in urban areas, can improve the overall response to internal displacement, anchor it 
</p>
<p>within a human rights-based approach and contribute to durable solutions. He also 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the need to address the specific needs of displaced populations in urban 
</p>
<p>planning and policies and to consult them in their design and implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 
</b></p>
<p>74. Changes in the environment and climate have an important impact on human 
</p>
<p>mobility and are predicted to significantly increase displacement and alter its patterns.32 In 
</p>
<p>2013 alone, some 22.4 million people were newly displaced by disasters triggered by 
</p>
<p>natural events. In 2010, the Cancun Agreements expressly acknowledged &#8220;climate-induced 
</p>
<p>displacement&#8221;, which the Special Rapporteur addressed in his report to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in 2011.33 Preparedness, environmental risk assessment, mitigation and disaster 
</p>
<p>risk reduction are development imperatives in the context of the challenges posed by 
</p>
<p>climate change-induced displacement. The consequences of climate change, such as 
</p>
<p>environmental degradation and loss of livelihood, are a driver of increased rural-to-urban 
</p>
<p>migration, often to urban slums and informal settlements offering precarious living 
</p>
<p>conditions. Climate change-induced displacement must be addressed in humanitarian and 
</p>
<p>development terms, to alleviate immediate suffering, but also to ensure lasting, 
</p>
<p>development-based solutions for affected persons that avoid the precariousness, 
</p>
<p>marginalization and instability associated with protracted displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>  Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development 
</b></p>
<p>75. Armed conflict, generalized violence and human rights abuses are major causes 
</p>
<p>of internal displacement. Indeed, internal displacement can be seen as an indicator of 
</p>
<p>whether societies are peaceful and inclusive. In line with the Guiding Principles on Internal 
</p>
<p>Displacement and the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced 
</p>
<p>Persons, securing effective remedies for the violations of international human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law which cause displacement, or which occur during displacement, can have 
</p>
<p>a major impact on prospects for durable solutions for IDPs. IDPs who have been victims of 
</p>
<p>violations must have full and non-discriminatory access to effective remedies and justice, 
</p>
<p>including, where appropriate, access to transitional justice mechanisms and reparations. 
</p>
<p>Failure to secure effective remedies may cause further displacement, impede reconciliation 
</p>
<p>processes, create a prolonged sense of injustice or prejudice among IDPs and undermine the 
</p>
<p>achievement of durable solutions. Securing justice for IDPs is an essential component of 
</p>
<p>long-term peace and stability.34

<p><b> F. Implementing sustainable development goals for internally displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>76. Clear references to IDPs should be included in the post-2015 goals and targets. 
</p>
<p>While explicit references to IDPs may be lacking, many proposed goals and targets have 
</p>
<p>the potential to directly or indirectly have a positive impact on IDPs at the national level. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is essential to look beyond international cooperation and focus on the 
</p>
<p>importance of national implementation. The report of the Open Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals states that &#8220;targets are defined as aspirational global 
</p>
<p>targets, with each government setting its own national targets guided by the global level of 
</p>
<p>ambition but taking into account national circumstances&#8221; (A/68/970, para. 18). National 
</p>
<p>authorities are responsible for providing protection and development for all and for 
</p>
<p>implementing strategies and programmes to meet internationally agreed targets and goals. 
</p>
<p>Countries affected by internal displacement must set their own national targets and include 
</p>
<p>IDPs in national development strategies. 
</p>
<p>77. The IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons 
</p>
<p>points to the &#8220;need to ensure at a minimum that the necessary legal and/or policy 
</p>
<p>frameworks are in place to secure the rights of IDPs, to establish effective government 
</p>
<p>structures to coordinate the national and local response, to facilitate provision of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and development assistance, and to ensure that adequate funding, through 
</p>
<p>national budgets as well as international aid, is allocated to support the process&#8221;.35  
</p>
<p>78. Indicators to help to assess the implementation of the sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals at the international level are still under consideration at the time of writing. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur strongly advocates the indicators to systematically address the specific 
</p>
<p>situation of IDPs by mentioning them explicitly as beneficiary groups. Displacement, 
</p>
<p>whether due to conflict or disaster, is truly a &#8220;global&#8221; issue, potentially affecting rich and 
</p>
<p>poor countries, northern and southern States, and international indicators should 
</p>
<p>consequently specifically address displacement. Equally, countries should develop their 
</p>
<p>own national-level indicators, taking into account, where relevant, their actual or potential 
</p>
<p>displacement situation. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Essential steps for the inclusion of internally displaced persons in 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development goals 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National leadership, good governance and political will 
</b></p>
<p>79. National leadership and good governance are essential to both preventing 
</p>
<p>conflict-induced displacement and appropriately responding to all displacement situations. 
</p>
<p>Deficits in good governance and the rule of law frequently ignite tensions and result in 
</p>
<p>conflict and displacement. Good and inclusive governance is a cornerstone of sustainable 
</p>
<p>development activity at the national level and actions to appropriately address the rights of 
</p>
<p>IDPs. The first essential step towards ensuring implementation of sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals for IDPs is for national governments to recognize IDPs as legitimate targets of 
</p>
<p>development initiatives. If left unaddressed by development actors, displacement can 
</p>
<p>generate further longer-term marginalization, inequality, fragility and vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>Addressing internal displacement through a development lens has the potential to prevent 
</p>
<p>further marginalization and potential secondary displacement. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>  35 Ibid., p. 11. </p>


<p><b> 2. Data, profiling and needs assessment 
</b></p>
<p>80. Official IDP figures advanced by governments tend to differ significantly from 
those of international agencies and non-governmental organizations due to factors that 
</p>
<p>include data-gathering and registration deficiencies and, in some cases, the desire to 
</p>
<p>downplay the issue and the number of people affected by internal displacement. The latter 
</p>
<p>is particularly true in situations of conflict or violence and when the national authorities are 
</p>
<p>complicit in a displacement situation. Deficiencies in registration procedures and reluctance 
</p>
<p>of displaced persons to register due to fear, lack of information or other factors can all 
</p>
<p>contribute to underestimation of the actual number of displaced persons. The Internal 
</p>
<p>Displacement Monitoring Centre highlights that figures often reflect only those living in 
</p>
<p>camps, while 60 per cent of IDPs are dispersed in other locations and with host families, 
</p>
<p>and are often not officially counted.36 Even when officially counted, the concerns and 
</p>
<p>perceptions of IDPs are frequently not captured by official statistics and require more 
</p>
<p>sophisticated data-gathering and household surveys.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Full and meaningful consultation with and participation of internally displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons  
</b></p>
<p>81. Efforts to ensure durable solutions and effective sustainable development 
</p>
<p>programmes must involve full consultation with and the meaningful participation of IDPs. 
</p>
<p>It is imperative that they not be considered simply as beneficiaries of development policies 
</p>
<p>and programmes, but as full partners in the design, implementation and monitoring of such 
</p>
<p>activities. IDPs have a right to full participation in decisions affecting them, and measures, 
</p>
<p>including their return or relocation, should be undertaken with their full consent. Measures 
</p>
<p>that do not meet those criteria violate their rights and do not constitute durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>Participation of IDPs is also essential to ensuring effective accountability mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Engagement of development actors on issues relating to internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>82. National and international development actors must engage with IDPs at the 
</p>
<p>earliest stages of displacement and recognize that, even in cases where early return to 
</p>
<p>places of origin or integration in host communities is possible and desired, the challenges 
</p>
<p>facing IDPs are likely to be considerable and complex, requiring medium and long-term 
</p>
<p>development-centred solutions. It may take years to fully rebuild displacement-affected 
</p>
<p>communities or to integrate them fully into new communities to the extent that they achieve 
</p>
<p>conditions of full equality, access to services and participation in the economic, social and 
</p>
<p>public and political aspects of society. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Establishment of national laws and policies on internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>83. In December 2012, the African Union Convention for the Protection and 
Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons (the Kampala Convention) entered into force. 
</p>
<p>The first legally binding instrument specifically for IDPs, it sets obligations for States in 
</p>
<p>their responses to internal displacement and aims to &#8220;establish a legal framework for 
preventing internal displacement, and protecting and assisting internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>in Africa&#8221;. So far, 24 African Union member States have ratified and a further 37 have 
signed the Convention. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for all African States to 
</p>
<p>ratify and implement the Convention, as a key step towards ensuring durable solutions for 
</p>
<p>IDPs and their inclusion in development. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, <i>Global Overview 2014: people internally displaced by 
</i></p>
<p><i>conflict and violence</i>.   </p>


<p>84. While national governments have the primary responsibility towards IDPs, their 
</p>
<p>responses are often ad hoc, uncoordinated and, therefore, ineffective. National laws, 
</p>
<p>policies or strategies on internal displacement can assist national authorities in addressing 
</p>
<p>the challenges of displacement in a planned manner, and improve short-term and long-term 
</p>
<p>responses. Such national instruments may serve to clarify who is an IDP and what such a 
</p>
<p>person's corollary rights are, establish budgets directed towards them and create 
</p>
<p>administrative and response structures and responsibilities, as well as creating confidence 
</p>
<p>amongst regional and international development partners.  
</p>
<p>85. National instruments can grant IDPs entitlements based on their situation, rights 
</p>
<p>and needs, and enshrine those entitlements in laws and policy, including their right to be 
</p>
<p>included in development assistance programmes as citizens or habitual residents of the 
</p>
<p>State. Where possible, national instruments on internal displacement should be explicitly 
</p>
<p>linked to national development documents, strategies and targets, and ideally result in 
</p>
<p>dedicated national strategies and action plans for IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Implementation of effective governance structures  
</b></p>
<p>86. Appropriate and effective governance and response structures are essential from 
</p>
<p>the earliest stages of displacement, but also in the medium and longer term to ensure 
</p>
<p>sustained attention to IDPs. The Special Rapporteur notes that such structures are 
</p>
<p>frequently absent or inadequate in practice and governments rely on existing bodies, 
</p>
<p>including emergency response bodies, existing government institutions with limited 
</p>
<p>technical and staffing capacity, the United Nations and national and international civil 
</p>
<p>society to lead responses to displacement. This can result in a lack of specialist, targeted 
</p>
<p>attention and insufficient policy and programme responses to the longer-term needs of 
</p>
<p>IDPs.  
</p>
<p>87. Examples of positive governance structures include dedicated ministries, 
</p>
<p>departments or units responsible for IDP issues and for ensuring that attention to IDPs is 
</p>
<p>mainstreamed across relevant governmental and other bodies in areas such as education, 
</p>
<p>employment, health, housing and development policy. Such bodies can work to ensure that 
</p>
<p>greater attention to IDPs is paid by development actors, and should be appropriately 
</p>
<p>resourced and funded. High-level leadership, for example specialist bodies under the office 
</p>
<p>of the president or prime minister, can ensure that IDPs are given and maintain high priority 
</p>
<p>at the national level and by development actors. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Addressing conflict, its causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>88. Attention to preventing and resolving conflict, and stabilizing fragile States is 
</p>
<p>essential to achieving sustainable development worldwide, as well as to prevent further 
</p>
<p>displacement. Poverty, exclusion and discrimination are drivers of conflict and 
</p>
<p>displacement. Development initiatives should be used both as preventive measures and as 
</p>
<p>early recovery and reconstruction tools to help build peaceful and inclusive societies, as 
</p>
<p>well as achieve long-term stability. In conflict and post-conflict situations, protection risks, 
</p>
<p>access issues and an unreliable government partner at a time when governments may be 
</p>
<p>fighting for their existence may also create an environment that is not conducive to 
</p>
<p>development actors&#8217; actions. Peace agreements should contain specific provisions for IDPs 
</p>
<p>and for resolving internal displacement issues. Consultation with and the participation of 
</p>
<p>IDPs in peace processes, peace agreements and peacebuilding are essential.37

<p><b> H. Mitigating the impact of development-induced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>89. Historically, development projects have been a major cause of displacement. 
</p>
<p>Important questions relating to their impact must always be asked and the principles of 
</p>
<p>informed consultation, participation and consent respected. For example, while proposed 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goal 7 calls for States to ensure access to affordable, reliable, 
</p>
<p>sustainable and modern energy services for all, the impact in terms of displacement of 
</p>
<p>communities to make way for hydroelectric and other development projects must be taken 
</p>
<p>into account. The sustainable development goals must not be achieved at the cost of forced 
</p>
<p>displacement.  
</p>
<p>90. Development projects, including dams, irrigation projects, pipelines, highways, 
urbanization, mining, and conservation of nature, can all create displacement. The 
</p>
<p>Brookings Institution report, &#8220;Risks and rights: the causes, consequences, and challenges of 
development-induced displacement&#8221;,38 states that it is &#8220;problematic at best, even when a 
State has the best interests of the entire population at heart. The effects can be catastrophic 
</p>
<p>when such displacement occurs in the midst of conflict and human rights abuse, or when a 
</p>
<p>State deliberately or arbitrarily targets some of its people to bear a disproportionate share of 
</p>
<p>the costs of development and denies them a proper share of the benefits&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>IDPs must be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda if it is to 
</b></p>
<p><b>live up to its pledge to secure a life of dignity for all and to </b>&#8220;<b>leave no one behind</b>&#8221;<b>. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Many currently proposed goals and targets have the potential to have a positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on the situation of IDPs, either by helping to ensure durable solutions or by 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing further displacement. However, their potential will only be fulfilled if IDPs 
</b></p>
<p><b>are clearly recognized as development targets, partners and beneficiaries. </b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Resolving internal displacement is essential for peaceful and inclusive 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies for sustainable development. The post-2015 development agenda can help 
</b></p>
<p><b>States achieve durable solutions for IDPs. Equally, in countries with no displacement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive development policies address poverty, discrimination and exclusion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent conflict and displacement.</b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>One element of the Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s call for a transformative agenda 
</p>
<p><b>must be to transform protracted displacement situations from neglect and reliance on 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian assistance to durable solutions and sustainable development. </b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Informed by the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Kampala 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention, the IASC Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons, and by his experience in dealing with situations of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>worldwide, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations to:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  States affected by displacement  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Develop national legal frameworks and policies on internal displacement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on international law, and specifically identify and address obstacles to durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions for IDPs, including access to justice mechanisms; housing, land and property 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights; and livelihood opportunities. </b> 
</p>
<p>

<p>96. <b>Make adequate budgetary provisions and ensure human resource capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>in all relevant ministries and local authorities to implement such legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b>and policies.</b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>Ensure that IDPs are fully included as target populations and partners in 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies, programmes and national action plans to implement the post-2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development goals. Ensure the inclusion of durable solutions for IDPs in 
</b></p>
<p><b>national plans for local development, poverty reduction, economic reconstruction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>urban development. </b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Improve disaggregated data collection on, and profiling and needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments of, IDPs. Improve methodologies and the capacity of national statistical 
</b></p>
<p><b>offices to ensure accurate data on numbers, demographic characteristics, locations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and needs, while ensuring the confidentiality of data, to inform appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes and solutions, and monitor progress over time on the basis of key 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>Ensure national tailoring of targets to address IDPs and displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations and closely monitor and evaluate the impact of development programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>on IDPs including via the use of national indicators and research methodologies.</b> 
</p>
<p>100. <b>Implement livelihood programmes and vocational training to bridge the 
</b></p>
<p><b>gap between the existing skills of IDPs and those required for entry into the labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>market in their place of displacement to make the sustainable development goals a 
</b></p>
<p><b>reality for IDPs.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Donor States 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Recognize the prevention and resolution of internal displacement as an 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment in development and an essential element of conflict prevention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>peacebuilding.</b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>Ensure that areas/regions where IDPs seek durable solutions attract 
</b></p>
<p><b>development support, notably by ensuring regional equity in access to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>Increase the length of the funding cycle to allow actors to meet immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and long-term needs, and consider bridging the gap in aid budgets between 
</b></p>
<p><b>emergency relief and development aid to allow more comprehensive development-led 
</b></p>
<p><b>responses to internal displacement.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  The international community 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The definition of vulnerable, marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>post-2015 development agenda must encompass IDPs which will partially ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>as progress is being made towards achieving goals and targets, IDPs are not left 
</b></p>
<p><b>behind. Under proposed sustainable development goal 16 on achieving peaceful and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive societies, a target for reducing the number of IDPs would ensure national 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international attention to achieving durable, development-led solutions for IDPs. </b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Guidance on how to implement durable solutions and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes for IDPs should be provided by regional and international organizations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as technical assistance for operationalizing the IASC Framework on Durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons in national contexts. </b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>International and regional development actors, development donors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>others should ensure that IDPs are targeted in their country programmes, including </b></p>


<p><b>through policies, strategies and funding decisions that support durable solutions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development goals. </b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>Humanitarian and development actors should systematically interact to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop solution strategies for IDPs and identify mechanisms to promote integrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches from the early stages of displacement. </b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>The Kampala Convention pays the necessary attention to IDPs and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provides legally binding standards and guidance on their treatment and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance. Other regional bodies should develop such IDP frameworks.</b> 
</p>
<p>109. <b>On the basis of agreed sustainable development goals and targets, clear and 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted indicators and data disaggregation specific to IDPs should be developed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist States and development actors in their national implementation efforts. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>means developing indicators for targets whose implementation will affect the well-
</b></p>
<p><b>being of IDPs. </b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>The United Nations system, international development actors and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations should monitor, by country, region or globally, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of the implementation of the sustainable development goals on the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs.</b>
