<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the crucial role that parliaments play in, inter alia, translating 
</p>
<p>international commitments into national policies and laws, and hence in contributing to the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment by each State Member of the United Nations of its human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments and to the strengthening of the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since 
</p>
<p>2010, in particular its resolutions 65/123 of 13 December 2010, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>recognized the importance of continued parliamentary support for the work of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, and 66/261 of 29 May 2012, in which it encouraged the Inter-Parliamentary 
</p>
<p>Union, as the world organization of national parliaments, to strengthen its contribution to 
</p>
<p>the Council, particularly with regard to the universal periodic review, as well as resolution 
</p>
<p>68/272 of 19 May 2014, in which the Assembly welcomed the contribution of the Inter-
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Union to the work of the Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 22/15 of 21 March 2013 and 26/29 of 27 June 2014 on the 
</p>
<p>contribution of parliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the summary report of the United Nations High 
</p>

</p>
<p>activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on parliamentary capacity-building, as well as 
</p>


<p>on its activities with regard to the work of the Human Rights Council and its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, as requested by the Council in its resolution 26/29,

<p>contribution of parliaments to the work of the Council and its universal periodic review and 
</p>
<p>to identify ways to enhance further that contribution; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to organize the panel discussion and to liaise with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 
</p>
<p>States Members of the United Nations and relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, as 
</p>
<p>well as with civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions, with a view to ensuring their participation; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the panel discussion 
</p>
<p>in the form of a summary and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-fifth
