Operations Update
We currently plan to complete our 12 Eagle Ford well inventory in the third and fourth quarters of
2016.  These wells are in four units located in Karnes County, Texas (33% operated working
interest) and Fayette County, Texas (50% working interest), two of which are held by production
and the other two are in the primary term of leases.
In addition, pending commodity prices, we plan to drill five to six gross Eagle Ford wells (33% to
50% operated working interest) in southwestern Gonzales County, Texas, beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2016.

Rig Idle and Termination Expense
In the second quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a non-recurring expense of $3.8 million
associated with the termination of a drilling rig contract that was entered into in mid-2014 and
utilized in our Eagle Ford operations from April 2015 through January 2016.  The Company
temporarily idled the rig in January 2016, and subsequently, the Company and its rig contractor
agreed to terminate the contract. The total financial obligation was $5.1 million, of which $1.3
million was recognized in the first quarter while the rig was temporarily idled and $3.8 million was
recognized in the second quarter of 2016. To fulfil this obligation, the Company issued the rig
contractor a $5.1 million unsecured promissory note.  The note amortizes over a 3-year period
concluding in July 2019 with no pre-payment penalty.  The note has an interest rate of 8.0% for
the first 12 months, 10.0% for the second 12 months, and 12.0% for the last 12 months. As of
June 30, 2016, $1.6 million was recorded as a current liability and $3.5 million was recorded as a
long-term liability.
Hedging Update
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into additional hedge transactions
associated with its oil and natural gas production for the remainder of 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The
Company has now hedged for the second half of 2016 approximately 2,010 Boepd, or 44%, of
the mid-point of its
2016 production guidance at average oil and natural gas prices of $49.35/Bbl and
$2.604/MMBtu, respectively.  Further details of the Company’s hedge transaction are provided in
its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.
Acquisition of Lynden Energy Corp.
As previously announced, the Company closed its acquisition of Lynden Energy Corp. on May
18, 2016, for approximately $77.8 million, financed by the issuance of approximately 3.7 million
shares of Earthstone common stock and the assumption of Lynden’s net financial
obligations.  The acquisition provides the Company with approximately 5,900 net acres in the
Midland Basin, current net production of 1,130 Boepd, and 100 gross horizontal locations.
Guidance Reaffirmed
The Company reiterates guidance previously disclosed on June 15, 2016.  This guidance is
subject to significant and material changes, including commodity prices and industry conditions.

Management Comments
Frank A. Lodzinski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Earthstone Energy, Inc.,
commented, “We had a number of significant accomplishments in the second quarter of
2016.  Notably, the closing of the Lynden acquisition has increased our production and places
the Company in a premier basin that is characterized by numerous zones, high recoveries, and a
low cost structure.  We welcome Lynden’s stockholders to the Company.  In addition, we
successfully completed the Company’s first equity offering, raising approximately $50.0 million
from institutional investors.  We initially used some of these proceeds to reduce indebtedness
under our revolving credit facility from $47.8 million to $10.0 million.  With increased financial
flexibility and preservation of capital demonstrated in the first half of
2016, we believe now is an opportune time to complete our inventory of 12 Eagle Ford wells and
will likely do so in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  In addition, we may drill five to six wells
in southwestern Gonzales County in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017;
however, the recent decline in commodity prices gives us caution, and as such, we continue to
judge the merits of resuming drilling activities.”

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Statements that are not strictly
historical statements constitute forward-looking statements and may often, but not always, be
identified by the use of such words such as “expects,” “believes,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,”
“estimates,” “potential,” “possible,” or “probable” or statements that certain actions, events or
results “may,” “will,” “should,” or “could” be taken, occur or be achieved. The forward-looking

looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and analyses made by
Earthstone and its management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current
conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate under the
circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to expectations
is subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the risks of
the oil and gas industry (for example, volatile oil prices and operational risks in exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of
oil and gas deposits); the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and
projections relating to future oil and gas prices, production, costs and expenses; potential delays
or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures;
health, safety and environmental risks and risks related to weather; inability of management to
execute its plans to meet its goals; unavailability of gathering systems, pipelines and processing
facilities; and the possibility
that government policies may change. Earthstone’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, recent current reports on Form 8-K,
and other Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings discuss some of the important
risk factors identified that may affect Earthstone’s business, results of operations, and financial
condition. Earthstone undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Unaudited
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDAX, as
calculated by us below, are intended to provide readers with meaningful information that
supplements our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles). These disclosures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Further, these non-GAAP measures should only be
considered in conjunction with financial statements and disclosures prepared in accordance with
GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as
net income or loss, operating income or loss, or any other GAAP measure of financial position or
results of operations.
I. Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
Adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate performance,
prior to non-cash gains and losses and non-recurring items after applying adjusted income tax
expense.  Non-cash gains and losses may include, when applicable, accretion, impairment
expense, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, non-cash stock compensation
expense, and items that management considers non-recurring. We believe adjusted net income
helps investors compare our results with other oil and natural gas companies.
The following presents a reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes to adjusted net
income (loss):

(1)Adjusted income tax expense is calculated by applying an estimated effective tax rate of
34.5%.
II. Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by
external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and others, to
assess our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, without
regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical costs basis.  It is also used to assess
our ability to
incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.  We define “Adjusted EBITDAX” as net
income (loss) plus, when applicable, (gain) loss on sale of assets; accretion; impairment
expense; depletion, depreciation, and amortization; exploration expense; idle rig expense;
interest expense; interest income; unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives; non-cash stock
compensation expense; and income tax expense (benefit).
Our Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating
income (loss), cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of
financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our Adjusted EBITDAX
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies
may not calculate Adjusted EBITDAX in the same manner.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAX for the
periods indicated:
