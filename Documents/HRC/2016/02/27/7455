<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Angola was held at the 8th meeting on 30 
</p>
<p>October 2014. The delegation of Angola was headed by Rui Jorge Carneiro Mangueira. At 
</p>
<p>its 14th meeting, held on 4 November 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on 
</p>
<p>Angola. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Angola: Chile, the Congo and France. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Angola:

</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/AGO/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was 
</p>
<p>transmitted to Angola through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the promotion and protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms was a permanent feature of Government policy, internally and 
</p>
<p>externally. In 2007, Angola had been elected to the Human Rights Council and had served 
</p>
<p>two consecutive terms, from 2007 to 2013. Angola had had the privilege of participating in 
</p>
<p>the negotiations and approval of the institution-building package. Angola considered the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review mechanism as an excellent opportunity to assess the performance 
</p>
<p>of Governments on human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as to exchange 
</p>
<p>experiences, best practices and challenges, based on universally accepted standards.  
</p>
<p>6. Angola had been engaged in a long period of armed conflict, the consequences of 
</p>
<p>which were still being felt in various fields. However, the past 12 years of effective peace 
</p>
<p>had allowed the realization of legislative elections in 2008 and general elections in 2012, 
</p>
<p>which had taken place peacefully and were considered free and fair by the international 
</p>
<p>community. 
</p>
<p>7. The legal framework for human rights was characterized by a set of legal 
</p>
<p>instruments, particularly the Constitution of the Republic of Angola, which enshrined 
</p>
<p>international law, thus demonstrating the particular interest Angola attached to the human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in key international instruments.  </p>


<p>8. During its first universal periodic review, Angola had accepted 
</p>
<p>166 recommendations. The status of implementation of those recommendations was 
</p>
<p>contained in the national report that had been submitted to the Human Rights Council. The 
</p>
<p>report had been prepared by the intersectoral commission for human rights reporting, with 
</p>
<p>the active participation of Angolan civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that in 2010, the Committee on the Rights of the Child had 
</p>
<p>examined the second to fourth consolidated periodic reports of Angola on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention. The next consolidated report would be submitted in 
</p>
<p>October 2015. In February 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) had considered the country&#8217;s sixth periodic 
</p>
<p>report. In March 2013, the Human Rights Committee had considered the initial report on 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In 
</p>
<p>April 2013, the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had visited 
</p>
<p>Angola. While the High Commissioner had noted challenges, she also acknowledged the 
</p>
<p>progress that had been made.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that in 2010, the Government had taken concrete steps to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the national system of human rights protection with the merger of the then 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Secretary of State for Human Rights, resulting in 
</p>
<p>the establishment of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>11. The National Assembly had approved for discussion the draft law on the 
</p>
<p>organization and functioning of the courts, which provided for the establishment of 
</p>
<p>60 district courts and 5 courts of appeal, making access to justice faster, more accessible 
</p>
<p>and less costly.  
</p>
<p>12. The efforts to achieve the main objectives of the Millennium Development Goals 
</p>
<p>had halved the extreme poverty rates. The Government had established the National Plan of 
</p>
<p>Development for 2013&#8211;2017, creating conditions to enable the growth of the economy and 
</p>
<p>for the better distribution of wealth. 
</p>
<p>13. The preliminary results of the census held in May indicated that the country had 
</p>
<p>24,383,301 inhabitants, of whom 52 per cent were female. Women were by far the majority 
</p>
<p>in the population. However, their representation corresponded to 21 per cent in government 
</p>
<p>jobs, 36 per cent in parliament, 30 per cent in the judicial system and 50 per cent in 
</p>
<p>diplomacy.  
</p>
<p>14. The Government was implementing the National Programme on Housing and Urban 
</p>
<p>Development, with the main focus on building 35,000 houses and ensuring the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing. Evictions occurred only by court order and people were resettled. About 
</p>
<p>20,000 homes built in the Province of Luanda (Zango project) had been given free of 
</p>
<p>charge to citizens who had been evicted. Also, efforts had been made to improve the 
</p>
<p>distribution of energy and water, and the delegation mentioned the three main programmes 
</p>
<p>in that regard.  
</p>
<p>15. In response to the advance questions, the delegation stated that Angola was 
</p>
<p>examining the compatibility of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court with 
</p>
<p>its own legal system. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the Optional Protocol thereto (OP-CAT), 
</p>
<p>together with other instruments, had been signed in 2013, and was going through the 
</p>
<p>process of ratification. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government had invited the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
</p>
<p>component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in this context, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association to visit Angola. </p>


<p>However, the visits did not take place because of the timing, but there was political will to 
</p>
<p>have those visits and they may occur next year. The delegation emphasized that freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression was a fundamental right enshrined in article 40 of the Constitution in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with Law No. 7/06 of 15 May (Press Law), as well as other international legal 
</p>
<p>instruments ratified by Angola, including ICCPR (art. 19) and the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, provided such expression did not violate the respect for a 
</p>
<p>citizen&#8217;s honour, good name, reputation, image and private life. The delegation explained 
</p>
<p>that the national service for criminal investigation and instruction, the Attorney General and 
</p>
<p>the courts had standing to proceed with alleged violations only if the victim considered that 
</p>
<p>his honour had been offended and proceeded to lodge a formal complaint. If the victim 
</p>
<p>decided to drop the case, for any reason, including agreement with the defendant, the case 
</p>
<p>was closed. 
</p>
<p>17. Angola was a member of the United Nations and a party to the African Union 
</p>
<p>Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption. It was also a founding member of 
</p>
<p>the Kimberley Process on the buying and selling of diamonds. A technical team comprising 
</p>
<p>members drawn from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Geology and Mines 
</p>
<p>and the Ministry of Petroleum was considering the Extractive Industries Transparency 
</p>
<p>Initiative.  
</p>
<p>18. A comprehensive programme of reform in the health-care sector had been carried 
</p>
<p>out, including rehabilitation of the health-care infrastructure. There was also the expansion 
</p>
<p>of the municipal health-care network and the creation of new specialized reference services. 
</p>
<p>Angola continued to show improvement in the areas of pregnancy health care, the 
</p>
<p>prevention of diseases through vaccination, and the reduction or stabilization of the 
</p>
<p>incidence and mortality of endemic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS. The health indicators 
</p>
<p>showed remarkable progress in the areas of maternal and infant mortality.  
</p>
<p>19. Through Cabinet Presidential Decree No. 52/12 of 26 March 2012, Angola had 
</p>
<p>established the Regulation for the National Commission on the Prevention and Audit of 
</p>
<p>Maternal and Perinatal Deaths, and a project on strengthening municipal health services in 
</p>
<p>order to enhance health care and management at the primary care level, with 267 Cuban 
</p>
<p>technicians, and approved two projects on tuberculosis and malaria. The campaigns of 
</p>
<p>provincial and national vaccination were frequent and had contributed to the reduction of 
</p>
<p>preventable diseases.  
</p>
<p>20. The Constitution established several principles in safeguarding the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>In 2008, the executive branch ratified 11 commitments to children and set out a plan of 
</p>
<p>action for monitoring their implementation, which is assessed every two years at the 
</p>
<p>National Children&#8217;s Forum. 
</p>
