<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report is divided into two sections. In the first, the independent expert 
presents a summary of the answers to the questionnaire on human rights and international 
solidarity sent to States, United Nations departments and bodies, specialized agencies, other 
international organizations, non-governmental organizations and special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council. In the second, the expert identifies salient 
elements of a conceptual and normative framework for human rights and international 
solidarity, drawing from the above responses and his review and observations, and 
highlights significant areas of focus and emerging approaches in international cooperation.

<p> To conclude, the independent expert underlines the value and significance of 
international solidarity in an interdependent world, and how it may eventually guide the 
progressive development of international law on human rights and international solidarity.

framework based on international solidarity, perhaps in the form of a convention, for the 
prevention of natural disasters, and the mitigation of their consequences. Several 
respondents felt that there should be a greater focus on ex ante disaster prevention, risk 
reduction, emergency preparedness and improved and sustainable rehabilitation. Greater 
predictability of assistance and increased funds for the United Nations emergency relief 
coordination are desirable. Adequate investment is required firstly to reduce vulnerability to </footnote>0-14914

<p> I. Introduction.............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="4">. The independent expert focuses on three major areas, namely, international 
cooperation; global responses to natural disasters, agricultural pests and diseases; and third 
generation rights. In your view, are the main areas of focus sufficiently representative of 
today&#8217;s issues, challenges and crisis situations?  
</footnote> 3 
</p>
<p> II. Responses to the questionnaire on human rights and international solidarity.........  5&#8211;<footnote name="3">8. According to some respondents, international solidarity creates moral and ethical 
obligations only, and implementation depends on political will. However, it was felt that 
these obligations are not enough in the light of crises affecting the expectations of people 
around the world, which require legally-binding obligations. One view was strongly 
expressed that solidarity is purely a moral, not a legal, obligation. Other respondents, on the 
other hand, advocated a convention on solidarity. They also pointed out, however, that 
States often do not have the ability to provide the resources and means to ensure this right. 
In times of global interdependence, it is necessary to recognize extraterritorial State 
obligations, as circumstances are often beyond the control of individual States. In the 
realization of the right to food, it has been recognized that, in a globalized, interconnected 
world, actions taken by one Government may have a negative impact on the right to food of 
individuals living in other countries. All countries should therefore ensure that their policies 
do not contribute to human rights violations in other countries.  </footnote>9 3 
</p>
<p>  A. International solidarity as a principle of international law .............................  6&#8211;<footnote name="13">. Almost all respondents supported a legal framework for human rights and 
international solidarity. Some made specific suggestions for the strengthening of the 
definition, understanding and implementation of international solidarity, for instance that </footnote> 3 
</p>
<p>  B. International solidarity as a response to global challenges .............................  14&#8211;<footnote name="3">7. The development of the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity 
depends on the full acceptance of the concept of shared responsibility. Efforts must 
therefore be made by all countries in order for the international community to increase 
resources for technical and financial cooperation and fulfil the commitment made by 
developed countries to allocate the agreed share of gross national income to ODA, under 
the Monterrey Consensus. The primary stakeholders &#8212; United Nations, States, specialized 
agencies and non-governmental organizations &#8212; solemnly undertook, in various 
resolutions, to implement a new global strategy against poverty, which also led to the 
creation by the United Nations of the World Solidarity Fund. Owing to a lack of measures 
for financing, the programmes relating to poverty and human rights have yet to be 
implemented. For some respondents, it is clear that the responsibility of States with regard 
to specifically international solidarity should be redefined in order to reinforce it in 
international law.  
</footnote>4 6 
</p>
<p>  C. Obligations in international solidarity ...........................................................  35&#8211;<footnote name="3">6. Several respondents had the view that State obligations with respect to international 
or global solidarity are already established under the Charter of the United Nations, where 
countries pledge individually and collectively to achieve the purposes and principles of the 
Charter through cooperation. The issue is one of political will at the international level to 
ensure that there is a more robust approach to reducing and removing inequitable trade 
relations and other inequalities between developed and developing countries. The present 
body of international law on human rights based on equality, development, peace and 
solidarity is sufficient with the inclusion of clearly established definitions and the political 
will to uphold them.  
</footnote>9 11 
</p>
<p> III. Salient elements of a conceptual and normative framework...................................  40&#8211;<footnote name="5">7. On the basis of the above, the independent expert proposes that the definition of 
international solidarity be refined to denote the union of interests, purpose and actions 
among States and social cohesion between them, based on the interdependence of States 
and other actors to preserve the order and very survival of international society, and to 
achieve common goals that require international cooperation and collective action. Global </footnote>6 12

<p>  C. Emerging approaches in international cooperation ........................................  50&#8211;<footnote name="5">0. The above discussion makes it clear that there are shared responsibilities for 
development through States&#8217; national obligations and the obligations of international 
cooperation. Sustainable development is today universally recognized as a goal of the 
global community and as a principle of international law. Economic globalization, while </footnote>6 15

<p>GE.<footnote name="1">6. There is a considerable amount of international law and policy in place for those 
affected by disasters to receive timely and dignified humanitarian assistance. The guiding 
principles of humanitarian assistance provide for assistance that is closely linked with the 
principles of humanity, neutrality and fairness, with full respect for the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and national unity of States under the Charter of the United Nations. 
Some respondents stressed that humanitarian assistance must only be given with the 
consent of the affected country and, in principle, on the basis of a request by the same, and 
should be linked with the efforts of the State concerned. The principle of solidarity is 
closely connected to the principles of international humanitarian assistance, as reflected in 
the 1949 Geneva Conventions and relative protocols, international humanitarian law, 
human rights law and the agreements of the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 2005/55, the Commission on Human Rights appointed the 
independent expert on human rights and international solidarity to study the issue of human 
rights and international solidarity, to prepare a draft declaration on the right of peoples to 
international solidarity, taking into account outcomes of all major United Nations and other 
global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social fields and seeking 
views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, relevant 
organizations and non-governmental organizations, and to report annually on the progress 
made in the fulfilment of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. The mandate of the independent expert was renewed by the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 7/5 for a period of three years.  
</p>
<p>3. The Council, in its resolution 12/9, requested the independent expert to continue his 
work in the preparation of a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, and in further developing guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right, by addressing, inter alia, 
existing and emerging obstacles to its realization.  
</p>
<p>4. On 7 May and 20 October 2009, the independent expert distributed a questionnaire 
on human rights and international solidarity (see annex) to Member States, United Nations 
departments and bodies, specialized agencies, other international organizations and non-
governmental organizations, as well as special procedures mandate holders of the Council. 
The present report contains a summary of the answers to the questionnaire, identifies salient 
elements of a conceptual and normative framework drawing from the responses and his 
review and observations, and highlights significant areas of focus and emerging approaches 
in international cooperation. In concluding the report, the independent expert underlines the 
value and significance of international solidarity in an interdependent world, and how it 
may eventually guide the progressive development of international law on human rights 
and international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Responses to the questionnaire on human rights and 
international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>5. Responses to the questionnaire were received from Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Brazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic (on behalf of the European Union), El Salvador, 
Guyana, Iraq, Montenegro, Senegal, Serbia, Slovenia, Suriname and Tunisia; the Egyptian 
National Council for Human Rights, the National Human Rights Committee of Qatar and 
the Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights of Ukraine; the United Nations 
departments and bodies, specialized agencies and other international organizations, the 
Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Interregional 
Crime and Justice Research Institute and the United Nations World Tourism Organization; 
the non-governmental organizations, the Amman Centre for Human Rights Studies, the 
Association Comunita Papa Giovanni XXIII, the International Association of Schools of 
Social Work and New Humanity; and the special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia, Shamsui Bari. 
</p>
<p><b> A. International solidarity as a principle of international law 
</b></p>

<p><b>4</b> GE.<footnote name="1">5. Respondents pointed out that natural disasters are to date the main focus of 
international solidarity. In recent years, an alarming increase in major natural disasters has 
been witnessed. Many occurred in developing countries, which have difficulty in 
responding adequately, and ensuring appropriate protection for people, animals and 
property. Various mechanisms exist for the coordination of international humanitarian and 
rescue assistance when disasters strike. Countries have demonstrated their readiness to 
assist, as witnessed for example in the aftermath of cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, the 
tsunami in South-East Asia, and the earthquakes in Pakistan, China and, more recently, 
Haiti. To some extent, the provision of international humanitarian and rescue assistance is 
achieved, although it is still fragmented. 
</footnote>0-14914 
</p>
<p>nation which is free from egoism and is aware of its duties as well as its rights and does not 
only take advantage of benefits, but meets the obligations and the risks of solidarity, 
discovers in itself an unexpected capacity for expansion that enriches its individuality and, 
at the same time, turns this new capacity into a means of progress for other nations&#8221;.<footnote name="1">2. The development of international law recognizing people as subjects of the law, with 
a clear-cut role for people in global responses to disasters, should be a goal. A common 
guideline could, for example, be developed for people helping others across borders in 
times of natural or man-made disasters. Over time, this dual approach of people and States 
helping each other would strengthen the principle of international solidarity as a genuine 
principle of international relations and law. The revolution in international news 
transmission and information technology has brought the people of the world together, 
leading to manifestations of solidarity across borders through the expression of genuine 
grief and sympathy, and help for disaster victims, indicating a sense of unity among all. 
There is a gap between people&#8217;s sense of solidarity and that among States, which continues 
to be guided primarily by national interests. Bridging this gap further is possible by 
extending the scope of the principle of solidarity.  
</footnote> Many 
viewed international solidarity as the cornerstone of our responsibility to humanity and 
entry point for building a better society, and as a glue for social cohesion and guarantee 
against marginalization, exclusion and excessive disparities. Preserving the order and the 
very survival of international society should be based on the principle of solidarity and 
mutual assistance, particularly in the face of natural disasters, poverty, terrorism or post-
conflict situations. There is a large gap between assertions of international solidarity in 
theory and their reflection in practice. 
</p>
<p>7. The view was expressed that the world is driven by the profit motivation of the 
market, where human values are fast declining, giving rise to inequities within and between 
countries. On the other hand, a society based on solidarity is rooted in social justice and 
human dignity, where a person has a value for being, rather than having or producing. The 
fact that more than 1 billion people suffer from poverty and hunger is an indicator that, as 
the human race, we are failing to live as one family. The multiple global crises make the 
relevance of solidarity phenomenal, and present an opportunity for world leaders to 
recognize international solidarity as an inescapable necessity. Since solidarity has been 
described as the tenderness of the people, it is a key to the implementation and 
interpretation of human rights. It entails the negation of selfishness, in favour of a global 
world vision, across all borders and distinctions, and therefore has no space for 
discrimination in any form. The universal value of solidarity requires global issues to be 
addressed collectively in a way that ensures that costs and duties are equitably shared. 
</p>
<p>8. Some described international solidarity as a superior right that includes or supports 
all other rights, and as a value embodied in principles that serve the human person, that also 
contributes to the autonomy, independence, economic and social freedom of less developed 
countries. International solidarity is seen as a means essential to the international 
community&#8217;s pursuit of peace, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. In 
this context, Tunisia took an initiative that culminated in the creation of the World 
Solidarity Fund, after having given a constitutional character to this principle at the national 
level. According to one respondent, international cooperation finds its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre in the 
universal principles of solidarity among peoples, the respect for and protection of human 
rights, and the pursuit of better conditions for the welfare of all.  
</p>
<p>9. The global partnership for development can take guidance from the numerous 
commitments made by States, including at major United Nations conferences and summits, 
in the economic, social and related fields. Most importantly, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, in its very first article, states that &#8220;all human beings are born free and equal 
in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards 
one another in a spirit of brotherhood&#8221;. Under article 28, everyone is entitled to a social and 
international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration can be fully 
realized; and according to article 29, everyone has duties to the community. The Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993 identified increased and sustained efforts of 
international cooperation and solidarity as essential to substantial progress in human rights. 
In its resolution 8/5, the Council calls for a democratic and equitable international order. In 
its general comment No. 12, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
requested States to bear in mind the right to food when concluding international

<p>GE.<footnote name="1">1. The view was expressed that international solidarity is conceived as a product of 
social history, with the understanding that, as time progresses, new, justified claims that 
need to be addressed arise within the international community. Some respondents felt that 
solidarity rights or third generation rights are not yet established in the minds and hearts of 
many leaders and people at the grass-roots level, and much sensitization is needed in this 
regard. Numerous issues were listed as appropriate for treatment as solidarity rights, 
including bridging global imbalances in the levels of development among countries, closely 
related to poverty alleviation; promoting an international economic order based on equal 
participation in decision-making processes; technology transfer; the fair distribution of 
costs and burdens; transparent, democratic, just and accountable international institutions; 
the equitable participation of all, without discrimination, in domestic and global 
governance; equitable regional and gender-balanced representation in the composition of 
the staff of the United Nations system; respect for cultural diversity, cultural heritage and 
cultural rights; friendly relations among States; and equitable access to benefits from the 
international distribution of wealth through enhanced international cooperation, in 
particular in international economic, commercial and financial relations. Also included 
were the rights to peace; migration; food security; knowledge, especially for economic and 
social development; the production of medicine for treatment of pandemics, such as AIDS 
and influenza A H1N1; and a healthy and sustainable environment.   
</footnote>0-14914 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>agreements. The concept of a &#8220;common heritage of mankind&#8221; was established by the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as other instruments. Several 
respondents pointed out that the international community affirms its solidarity with victims 
of violations of international law, including human rights and humanitarian law, but that it 
is a broader and indispensable component of the efforts to realize the right to development 
and rights-based approaches to development, the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights and the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>10. Most respondents stressed that international solidarity should be based on the 
equality and sovereignty of all States. The Constitution of Colombia promotes international 
relations on the basis of fairness, equality, reciprocity and respect for national sovereignty 
and the self-determination of peoples. States have pledged to achieve the promotion of 
universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and 
should be led by their commitments to friendly relations. Some supported the principle of 
solidarity, but cautioned against its misuse to legitimize a new form of humanitarian 
intervention. It was also stated that the issues of relief provided to the Palestinian people 
living in the occupied territories and the collective punishment imposed upon them are not 
dealt with effectively or taken into account sufficiently by the international community.  
</p>

<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>the definition should include actions and persons, going beyond States. Reference to the 
interdependence of States and their interaction with other international actors would be 
more appropriate than speaking of dependence. A few respondents went as far as to 
advocate for legally-binding obligations in a convention on international solidarity. At the 
other end of the spectrum, one respondent argued that there is no need to recognize all 
moral imperatives as part of the legal order. Attempts to express moral principles in the 
language of human rights without giving them real content and legal meaning can only 
devalue both human rights and the moral principles themselves. According to this view, the 
interpretation of the solidarity principle as a source of international legal obligations with 
regard to matters that have not been explicitly addressed by norms of international law 
would not be acceptable. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International solidarity as a response to global challenges 
</b></p>
<p>14. Respondents stated that international solidarity must be recognized as a prerequisite 
for any collaboration in the international community. While noting the significant 
contributions made by Governments, there is scope to improve the coordination of 
international support, in line with the principles of Good Humanitarian Donorship and 
relevant General Assembly resolutions. The Millennium Declaration underscores that, 
when addressing global challenges, costs and burdens must be fairly distributed. Global 
challenges are numerous, and four areas are considered below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Humanitarian assistance in natural disasters 
</b></p>

<p>GE.10-14914 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>hazards and the severity of disasters; and secondly, in the aftermath, to rebuild better 
facilities rather than merely restore pre-existing ones. Suggestions for improvements 
include the publication of scientific forecasting of natural disasters, coordination in the 
implementation of proactive, preventive measures to avoid serious consequences, and the 
establishment of national and international reserves for prompt and adequate responses. The 
increase in the magnitude and frequency of disasters has affected the quality of the response 
of the international community to assist victims. The humanitarian assistance given in 
recent natural disasters has not been executed in an appropriate manner, since these actions 
ought to be immediate, viable, adjusted to the actual situation, speedy, preventive, carried 
out in close coordination with the affected States and at least attempt to reduce human 
casualties and protect means of survival. It is regrettable that, despite technological 
advances, accumulated information (technological and scientific knowledge) is not shared 
with States and regions that are more vulnerable to natural disasters.  
</p>
<p>18. Some respondents pointed to the need to change the activities that result in &#8220;natural&#8221; 
disasters, which are closely linked to industrial production in some parts of the world. 
Many natural disasters are a result of environmental degradation; international law and 
specifically international environmental law should therefore have binding agreements and 
enforcement mechanisms employing the precautionary principle to avoid natural disasters. 
This would require greater commitment by those responsible. It was pointed out that poor 
countries do not have the resources to install infrastructure and technical facilities to 
provide early warning systems, respond to overwhelming conditions following a disaster or 
rebuild thereafter. Therefore, greater investment and support to prevent and reduce the 
frequency and severity of natural disasters would be helpful.  
</p>
<p>19. Some felt that the real issue is global, rather than international solidarity. One 
respondent expressed belief in allegiance to humanity and social affiliation rather than to 
the nation State. It was suggested that there should be provision in every national 
constitution making a commitment to humanitarian disaster relief to countries in need, but 
that the will of the people must underlie such a notion. To have such a popular consensus, it 
was felt that we need to start with children, teaching them the value of treating others as 
oneself, as represented by millennia of spiritual wisdom. Friendship and tolerance among 
nations is also a fundamental value that needs to be taught. Trust and confidence should 
form the basis for global solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Poverty alleviation 
</b></p>
<p>20. Some respondents viewed solidarity as a principle born together with international 
human rights law through the pursuit of peace among nations. However, it lacks visibility 
in current human rights instruments because it has no binding force. International solidarity 
is the only way to alleviate poverty, including extreme poverty. Solidarity is not just an 
occasional action in favour of those who are sometimes in need, but rather a fundamental 
conception of human relations among persons, groups and nations. It is a basic moral 
principle found in virtually all major religions and cultures, namely, to treat others as you 
would have them treat you. Without this new spirit of communion in international relations, 
especially in international economic relations, it will be impossible to eradicate poverty and 
reduce the gap between rich and poor, both nationally and internationally. Solidarity 
requires peaceful coexistence, friendly relations and cooperation between States and others, 
as well as socially just economic and social institutional arrangements. International 
solidarity is a key approach to poverty eradication, as stated in the Kyiv Declaration of 
2008.  
</p>
<p>21. Given that close to 1 billion people live on less than $2 per day, overly represented 
in the so-called &#8220;global south&#8221;, this right can help to eradicate what is largely a North/South 
divide. This situation does not negate the fact that, within countries too, there is a gross </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>maldistribution of wealth, often due to oppressive regimes and rampant corruption. 
Solidarity at the national level would encourage States to create conditions for different 
sectors of the population, especially the poorest, through social policies that promote 
equality and allow the accumulation of social capital, among other actions.  
</p>
<p>22. Some respondents expressed the view that many developing countries are 
impoverished because of fiscal and other policies driven by unequal global political, 
economic, trade and security relations led by wealthier nations and international financial 
institutions. The intrinsic global interconnectivity and interrelationships characterized by 
globalization and trade liberalization have a significant impact on the state of the global 
economy and the stability and security of many States. International solidarity should be 
based on mutual respect and consultation of all nations, big and small. In this context, 
Guyana tabled a proposal for a new global human order, which was adopted by the General 
Assembly in 1998. This was aimed at mobilizing concerted global action over the long term 
to address development challenges, improve the well-being of people and reverse the 
growing disparities between rich and poor. Solidarity takes on added significance in the 
context of globalization, which excludes large sections of the global population, particularly 
developing countries, from the related benefits, generating a framework of asymmetric 
relations. The world has the means to eradicate poverty, but it is essential that international 
solidarity permeate the political will to do so. Creating an enabling environment, including 
by increasing access for developing countries to international economic opportunities and 
the non-imposition of conditionalities, are essential to the eradication of poverty.  
</p>
<p>23. Solidarity <i>ante factum</i> is preferable to solidarity <i>post factum</i>, as it aims at tackling 
the root causes of poverty on the basis of the wisdom that prevention is better than cure. 
Such solidarity implies that States respect fully their international obligations pledged at the 
United Nations, implement obligations under international law and are committed to 
disarmament, clean energy policies, health system strengthening and the Millennium 
Development Goals, among others. Solidarity <i>ante factum</i> is interlinked with other key 
issues under debate at the United Nations and other forums, such as total cancellation of the 
foreign debt of developing countries; global and national governance; world trade; 
reforming the United Nations and international financial institutions; civil society 
participation; intellectual property rights; agricultural policies; climate change; social 
determinants of health; and, importantly, world peace. One could also propose the concept 
of twinship between a developed and developing country, whereby a developed country 
accepts to accompany a developing country (and vice versa) in achieving its right to 
development through a mutual exchange of experiences, gains and human, financial and 
cultural resources. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to development 
</b></p>
<p>24. Several respondents viewed international solidarity and the right to development as 
complimentary and mutually reinforcing. International solidarity should be an 
indispensable component of efforts to realize the right to development, which could help to 
lessen the gap between developed and developing countries by buttressing rhetoric and 
declarations with tangible actions. It is the right of all countries to develop, subject to the 
duty to do so in ways that will not harm others or the environment. In today&#8217;s 
interdependent world, international conditions give rise to situations of emergency, 
especially in developing countries; for instance, the financial crisis, conflicts and 
environmental degradation. The spread of diseases, high-debt burdens and unfair trade 
practices hamper the efforts of developing countries to pursue sustainable development. It 
is argued that global solidarity or universal fraternity should be the basic principle inspiring 
relations between developed and developing countries. This view also reflects the need felt 
in the current international context to ensure that civil society actors are leading players in </p>


<p>GE.10-14914 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>development processes. It also provides qualitatively important elements for a defining 
feature of cooperation for development: the idea of partnership.  
</p>
<p>25. The concept of &#8220;twinship&#8221; between a developed and developing country would be a 
practical way to reduce the existing gap. The very idea of a partnership envisages equality 
between the subjects, and primarily between developed and developing countries, non-
governmental organizations in the North and in the South, and multinational and local 
companies. Partnership should be made substantial by fraternity at an individual level, and 
also between public institutions and private organizations. According to article 2 of the 
Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 41/128, the human person is the central subject of development and should be the 
active participant and beneficiary of the right to development. Transparency, good 
governance and democratic Governments at the national level are also essential elements of 
the right to development. In many developing countries, the fruits of development are 
monopolized by small ruling elites, to the detriment of the masses. 
</p>
<p>26. The right to development must be closely monitored, and one country&#8217;s right to 
development should never intrude on another&#8217;s. There should be some official system of 
checks and balances to ensure that States uphold the agreements they reach. The right to 
development requires, inter alia, accessibility of development; the cancellation of debt of 
developing countries; access to agricultural markets in developed countries; and the 
elimination of price discrepancies for agricultural and manufactured goods on the world 
markets. The view was expressed that this right also requires a condemnation of the 
practice of proclamation of territories of other countries as areas of national interest of other 
States, and renunciation of the use of double standards in assessing regional conflicts, 
issues concerning the territorial integrity of States, and the rights of nations and peoples to 
self-determination. The right to development mandates fostering just global social and 
economic arrangements and a sense of human solidarity among all peoples. International 
relations are still subject to the law of the strong and powerful in economic and military 
terms. Attempts to exercise pressure on other countries pose a challenge that requires 
international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>27. International solidarity is an imperative, and the right to international solidarity 
needs fleshing out in more detailed instruments to be implemented effectively. This should 
be done in different sectors, so as to be more focused and implementable. Moreover, these 
processes of substantiation should take place across different sectors to enhance the focus 
and implementation of this principle. The right to development should be taught in 
educational institutions. Furthermore, experience-sharing would help States when facing 
difficult situations and contribute to their development, first at the regional level, owing to 
common factors, and then internationally. International cooperation and solidarity, self-
determination and sovereignty will afford the majority of the population full enjoyment of 
human rights. Some respondents referred to the need to promote and strengthen channels of 
dialogue at the regional level, while reaffirming shared commitment to the multilateral 
system. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>28. According to the Millennium Declaration, global challenges must be addressed in a 
way that ensures that costs and burdens are distributed fairly. In the view of one State 
respondent, it should be understood that, as long as there is extreme poverty and children 
die of preventable, curable diseases, human nature requires that we all care, and regard this 
as a common challenge. 
</p>
<p>29. The Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus of the International 
Conference on Financing for Development of 2002 and the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness of 2005, among other instruments, provide the foundation for a broad-based </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>alliance in support of the Millennium Development Goals. To meet the Goals, all actors 
must carry out their respective roles: developing countries need to define their development 
strategies, donors must translate their commitments into action, and the United Nations 
should act in a coordinated and coherent manner. Only by collective action with shared 
responsibility to protect our planet, with awareness of our different capabilities, can global 
problems be solved. The impact of the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration on 
Financing for Development of 2008 remains, despite what has been achieved to date, far 
short of the response necessary to meet challenges faced, especially by Africa, which 
continues to be the most affected by pandemics and extreme poverty. To address the 
particular needs of Africa while stressing that the eradication of poverty constitutes the 
greatest challenge facing the world, the international community should define a real 
strategy to mobilize resources on the basis of a United Nations resolution that would make 
it binding upon Member States to contribute financially to the global effort against poverty 
and social exclusion. The path to integrating developing countries in the global economy is 
of key importance. 
</p>
<p>30. To strengthen international cooperation means firstly to place the dignity of every 
human being at the centre of action of the international community. It is important to take 
into consideration qualitative elements, not only quantitative ones. One respondent 
emphasized that there is no clear link to human rights in the Goals, apart from a reference 
to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the right to development. It is necessary 
to make a clear link between the Goals and human rights, particularly articles 25 and 26 of 
the Universal Declaration, on the rights to health and education, and articles 11, 12 and 13 
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, on the rights to 
food, adequate housing, health and education. 
</p>
<p>31. To implement the Millennium Development Goals, the priorities, sequence and form 
of joint efforts should be identified at the international and regional levels. International 
cooperation can be strengthened by making it a priority to set and implement international 
projects that specifically address the Goals. A huge leap in resource allocation is required. 
Mechanisms must be put in place within the United Nations to ensure that States fulfil their 
commitments of 0.<footnote name="7">. The right to development is one of the third generation rights which have been 
enshrined in international and regional instruments. The 1986 Declaration on the Right to 
Development recognized this right as an inalienable human right. How would the right to </footnote> per cent of gross national income. An annual review of the fulfilment 
of pledges by all countries would be useful. Official development assistance (ODA) needs 
to be coordinated and targeted according to the real needs of countries, and bearing in mind 
their heterogeneity. While aid in recent years has increased in nominal terms, this has been 
mainly due to debt relief and assistance in the case of emergencies. Conditionalities in aid 
pose serious challenges. Developed countries should continue to render assistance while 
respecting developing countries as equal, sovereign partners.  
</p>
<p>32. To enhance accountability, one option would be to encourage countries to register 
measurable and monitorable commitments towards the achievement of the Goals. A greater 
focus on and more resource allocation for programmes addressing access to markets, good 
governance and natural resources management are also desirable. Measures to overcome 
the factors that provoke global crises, international and inter-ethnic conflicts, xenophobia 
and discrimination are needed. It is crucial to address issues related to crime and corruption 
in the policies aimed at reducing poverty and promoting development and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>33. Developing countries need a greater voice in forums where crucial decisions are 
made about their future, and there must be reform and the creation of a more equitable 
economic and financial system, as well as the transfer of technology to States to promote 
the sustainable and equitable use of natural resources. International financial institutions 
should adopt a systematic approach to impoverished States and use transparent criteria for 
determining forms of development support. International cooperation should involve the 
legitimate right to consultation as equal partners. </p>


<p>GE.10-14914 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>34. Countries also need to exchange good practices, and empower people through the 
media and technology. Human rights education in schools, with a focus on fostering a 
strong sense of internationalism, especially concern for those in dire circumstances, would 
be helpful.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Obligations in international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>35. Respondents pointed out that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 
Monterrey Consensus, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for 
Action of 2008 are, among others, important steps by which States agreed upon obligations 
in international solidarity. Some respondents asserted that there are State obligations with 
regard to international and/or global solidarity; however, others stated that, since the 
concept is broad, it is difficult to hold any party to it, and suggested that individual and 
measurable country commitments be developed. According to the latter respondents, there 
should be some official system of checks and balances without which implementation 
cannot be monitored, and &#8220;all talk and no action&#8221; instead. 
</p>

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>39. The realization of solidarity rights, including the right to solidarity, is also linked to 
the behaviour of individuals, civil society, the private sector and other components of 
society. The private sector, especially major corporate enterprises operating in developing 
countries, should assume obligations for development to help to reduce the gap between the 
developed and developing world through increased corporate social responsibility in the 
field of business and human rights. In international tourism, efforts have been made to 
ensure that poor and marginalized communities do not suffer from the disproportionate 
costs associated with tourism development while missing out on the benefits. In this 
respect, the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism, in article 9, stipulates that:  
</p>
<p>As an irreplaceable factor of solidarity in the development and dynamic growth of 
international exchanges, multinational enterprises of the tourism industry should not 
exploit the dominant positions they sometimes occupy; ... in exchange for their 
freedom to invest and trade, which should be fully recognized, they should involve 
themselves in local development, avoiding, by the excessive repatriation of their 
profits or their induced imports, a reduction of their contribution to the economies in 
which they are established<i>. 
</i></p>
<p><b> III. Salient elements of a conceptual and normative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Review and observations 
</b></p>
<p>40. The independent expert reiterates that there is an unequivocal value of solidarity and 
a related value system that can inform the progressive development of international law and 
legal development, at the regional and national levels, supporting an integrated and 
cohesive principle of international solidarity, and an evolving right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity. Notions of solidarity, humility, justice and equity 
have been found in moral, ethical, philosophical, religious and spiritual traditions the world 
over since time immemorial, including in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and 
Buddhism. Ranging from the parable of the good Samaritan and commandment of &#8220;love 
thy neighbour&#8221; or &#8220;do not harm thy neighbour&#8221; in Christian literature to the concept of 
universal brotherhood in Islam and the central tenets of compassion and loving kindness in 
Buddhist scriptures, the seminal value of solidarity encapsulates the power of human 
goodness and goodwill, essential for the survival of society at all levels, including the 
international community, humanity and its ecological habitat.2  
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert reiterates his call for human, international and global 
solidarity, which require strengthened cooperation among all stakeholders: States, 
international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and all individuals. 
The need for solidarity is amplified in the context of increasing interdependence in a 
globalizing world, where liberalization of international trade and foreign direct investment 
create a single global economy, mandating that humanity is also conceived as a single, 
global community. Great thinkers and leaders have, throughout the course of history, 
implored for the need for unity, fraternity, solidarity and reconciliation, among them, 
Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela. The pursuit 
of social justice and equity has long been a subject of discourse, including in international 
relations, for instance the quest for a new international economic order in the 1970s. In the 
modern context of globalization, there is a considerable amount of philosophical writing 
asserting the need for global social justice and the fair distribution of social and economic 
advantages across the bounds of State sovereignty. It is argued that obligations arise

</b></p>
<p>between persons by virtue of the global social and economic processes that connect them 
across national jurisdictions. Structural social injustices can cause harm to people, requiring 
a conception of responsibility that recognizes this connection.3 Writers have also stressed 
the need, in this regard, for a greater coordinating role for international institutions in 
ensuring accountability and responsibilities, cohesion and coherence. Our actions &#8212; and 
inaction &#8212; touch people every day across the globe, which in turn calls us to act, to grant 
dignity to the poor and rethink our engagement with the world.4  
</p>
<p>42. In the sphere of international law and policy, the Charter of the United Nations 
expresses the need to promote social progress and better standards of living in larger 
freedom and, to that end, to employ international mechanisms for the promotion of the 
economic and social advancement of all peoples, and calls for international cooperation in 
solving problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian nature. The Declaration 
on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among 
States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations of 1970 provides further 
evidence of consensus on the need for cooperation and friendly relations. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights refers to the need for universal brotherhood in its very first 
article, and further integrates the values of solidarity, justice and equity and duties of all in 
articles 28 and 29. Again, solidarity is a refrain in the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
for Action of 1993. In its resolution 8/5, the Council proposes the promotion of a 
democratic and equitable international order, explicitly referring to the rights to 
development and international solidarity. The idea of the common heritage of humankind in 
the Law of the Sea Convention of 1982 gives binding legal effect to social justice values at 
the global level. The principle of solidarity also permeates regional human rights 
instruments, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Charter of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which 
underscore regional solidarity as a central means and goal of regional economic, social and 
political relations. 
</p>
<p>43. The obligations of international assistance and cooperation are complementary to the 
primary responsibility of States to meet their national human rights obligations. 
International cooperation rests on the premise that some members of the international 
community may not possess the resources necessary for the full realization of rights set 
forth in conventions. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its 
general comment No. 3, stated that international cooperation for development, and thus the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights, is an obligation of all States, in 
accordance with Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, well-established 
principles of international law and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights itself. In the context of the right to development, the open-ended Working 
Group on the Right to Development underlined that, in the international economic, 
commercial and financial spheres, core principles, such as equality, equity, non-
discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international cooperation, 
including partnership and commitments, are important for the realization of the right to 
development (E/CN.4/2002/28/Rev.1). Studies reflecting on the international dimension of 
the right to development have identified different levels of responsibility for development,

<p>for instance that of corporations at the microlevel, States at the macrolevel and the 
international community at the mesolevel.<footnote name="5">. International solidarity is closely connected with humanitarian assistance, including 
global responses to natural disasters. How do you perceive global responses to natural 
disasters within the framework of international law? 
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>44. Globalization has created rapid economic growth, but also fostered extreme 
inequality and underdevelopment. Some assert that world poverty represents a failure of the 
international community to see half the global population secure their basic socio-economic 
rights; that some States are constrained in their ability to fulfil their human rights 
obligations through actions and structural arrangements of other members of the 
international community and entrenched economic and political advantage; that it is 
necessary to rethink human rights and frame responsibilities essential to their protection; 
that there is a role for the international community in creating an environment conducive to 
human-centred development and globalization; and that the right to development is a key 
factor to meeting the challenges of poverty in the twenty-first century.<footnote name="6">. The Millennium Development Goals could be considered collective goals of the 
international community. How should international cooperation be strengthened in order to 
accomplish the Goals? 
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>45. At the eleventh session of the Working Group on the Right to Development, several 
Member States stressed the need for international cooperation, solidarity and international 
responsibility for creating an enabling global environment and adequate policy space for 
the realization of the right to development, especially in the areas of international aid, trade, 
debt, access to medicines, transfer of technology, environment and intellectual property 
rights (A/HRC/15/23). Similarly, it is beyond doubt that governance at the national level 
and good leadership are also key factors to achieving the right to development. The 
importance of both national and international dimensions, and of shared responsibilities by 
and mutual accountability of all were underlined by the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development in its reports submitted for its sixth session 
(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, Add.1 and 2). 
46. The international sale of arms can destroy millions of lives, especially in countries 
affected by civil strife and with weak governance structures. The local and the global can 
no longer be separated; human rights must be integrated into governance at all levels. The 
breaking down of national borders means that everyday actions, purchases or investments 
can make a phenomenal difference to persons in the invisible world of the market. The 
unprecedented movement of people and goods across borders has led to increased 
challenges of a transboundary nature, such as human trafficking and the dumping of toxic 
wastes, which inevitably affect vulnerable people and nations. &#8220;The task before us is how to 
reconcile differences and create consensus, without resiling from the principle that respect 
for human rights is the ultimate foundation upon which rests the legitimacy of the actions of 
our Governments, our international institutions, our corporations and business enterprises, 
our organs of civil society, and ourselves, presently and in future.&#8221;7 National interests and 
the universal ethics of solidarity are closely connected, and in the words of a former 
Secretary-General &#8220;the simple fact of the matter is, if we cannot make globalization work 
for all, in the end it will work for none&#8221;.8

<p>GE.10-14914 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Selected areas of focus 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Sustainable development  
</b></p>
<p>47. Sustainable development calls for holistic development through the integration of 
economic, social and environmental concerns, and is therefore naturally suited to the 
pursuit of just, equitable, human-centred development. The Rio Declaration on 
Environment and Development of 1982 places human beings at the centre of concerns for 
sustainable development. Since the calls for global partnerships in Rio, the increasing 
importance of the principle of international solidarity in connection with responses to 
sustainable development, environment and climate change, was seen in the World Summit 
on Sustainable Development and Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of 2002, which 
elaborated on the need for partnerships, including public-private partnerships, to address 
these issues collectively. Approaches to global partnership need to be underpinned by a 
recognition of the interdependent nature of the responsibilities of States in the context of 
climate change. Integral concepts of sustainable development, including the right to 
development, common but differentiated responsibilities, inter- and intra-generational 
equity and constituent principles, such as the precautionary principle, make sustainable 
development particularly relevant to solidarity.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Financing for Development 
</b></p>
<p>48. The key role played by the principle of international solidarity in the Financing for 
Development initiative, first highlighted in the Monterrey Consensus, was confirmed in the 
Doha Declaration of 2008, reiterating commitments to address such financing in the spirit 
of global partnership and solidarity. Within the broader Financing for Development 
framework, the search for innovative sources of development finance has a strong link to 
international solidarity. Such links were explicitly and implicitly recognized in the World 
Summit Outcome and the Declaration on innovative sources of financing, both of 2005, and 
the Paris Conference on Solidarity and Globalization of 2006. In his progress report on 
innovative sources of development finance (A/64/189), the Secretary-General described 
international solidarity as a basis for international cooperation in the context of financing 
for development, and highlighted existing and potential initiatives that could contribute to 
international and human solidarity, including solidarity levies and the Digital Solidarity 
Fund.  
</p>
<p>49. In 2008, in his opening remarks to the Doha Conference on Financing for 
Development (A/CONF.212/7), the Secretary-General made a plea for selflessness and 
solidarity and the building of bridges to include the entire international community rather 
than a select few. These bridges must stand on three pillars: cooperation, including in 
stimulus programmes following the crises, so that they address the needs of all, especially 
the poorest and most vulnerable; sustainability, including climate change; and inclusive 
governance, which requires a new multilateralism that recognizes the world of the twenty-
first century and the central role of emerging and developing economies. Coherence and 
coordination through the United Nations becomes a key factor in ensuring solidarity.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Emerging approaches in international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Shared responsibilities 
</b></p>

<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>promoting interdependence and its positive effects, can also have the opposite effects of 
disconnection and exclusion, especially for people surviving on the edge of existence. 
Accountability and shared responsibilities were recently stressed to be essential to 
development:  
</p>
<p>We must embrace shared responsibilities across national boundaries. For example, 
self-interest and short-term thinking have plagued progress on global trade reform. 
When Governments provide development assistance, but at the same time continue 
massive agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, they aren&#8217;t promoting 
sustainable development for all. They are undermining development prospects and 
damaging the livelihoods of some of our most vulnerable sisters and brothers.9  
</p>
<p>This underlines the importance of policy coherence across sectors and institutions, and in 
international, regional and national policies of States. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. South-South cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>51. Solidarity, friendship and cooperation, sovereignty and territorial integrity were the 
core principles of the Bandung Conference of 1955 between leaders of Asian and African 
countries, reinvigorated in 2005 in the Declaration on the New Asian-African Strategic 
Partnership and the Joint Ministerial Statement. Mutual aid among countries of the South 
can be at the bilateral, regional and global levels. Countries cooperate in the areas of reform 
of global governance institutions, the Millennium Development Goals, poverty, food 
security, energy security, climate change and sustainable development, which all hope to 
achieve through the advantages of globalization.  
</p>
<p>52. The Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2006 and the India-
Africa Forum Summit in 2008, and the greater involvement of Latin American countries in 
Africa are increasing the continent&#8217;s cooperation at the bilateral level, which could evolve 
into regional, and eventually global, issues of common concern. Trade and investment 
arrangements with newly emerging economies are seeing a large increase in economic 
activity in Africa, and hold much promise for the future, provided they are implemented in 
a context of fairness and equity, information-sharing, experience, awareness and equal 
partnerships for all.10 Technical cooperation among developing countries, or South-South 
cooperation, is guided by the goal of contributing to strengthening relations; for instance, 
Brazil follows a policy of &#8220;solidarity diplomacy&#8221; whereby it makes its own experience and 
knowledge available to other developing countries to promote economic and social progress 
without imposing conditions, and areas of cooperation are defined by recipient countries. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Major global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic, social and climate 
fields  
</b></p>
<p>53. Support for the principle of international solidarity, and the coordinated approach to 
addressing global issues that this principle calls for, was witnessed in a series of major 
global meetings spanning the diverse but interrelated thematic areas of development, trade, 
aid, the financial and economic crisis, and the environment. The Doha Review Conference 
and Declaration of 2008 reaffirmed the global partnership for sustainable development that 
had been launched in Monterrey. Solidarity also underpinned the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, in 2002; the outcome documents of the second 
and third High-Level Forums on Aid Effectiveness in 2005 and 2008, namely the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action; the Conference on the

special high-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council with Bretton Woods 
institutions, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Conference on Trade

Conference on Current Challenges to Human Rights and Freedoms, viewed international 
solidarity as a key approach to eradicating poverty. The Declaration of the Beijing Summit 
of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation of 2006 and the Delhi Declaration of the India-
Africa Forum Summit of 2008 are also significant new developments. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Best practices  
</b></p>
<p>54. Since the earliest times, international cooperation has been reflected in numerous 
good practices by many countries and other actors across all regions. For several decades, 
there have been far-reaching efforts and practices of international assistance and 
cooperation. The practices described below are only some illustrative examples from the 
answers sent by respondents. 
</p>
<p>55. In the constitutions of Guyana and Colombia, the principle of solidarity finds 
express and implicit recognition. In Tunisia the National Solidarity Fund is the final 
outcome of a long process towards the implementation of a solidarity system for 
development and the fight against poverty. Well-anchored in the institutional landscape of 
the country, this fund is an instrument aimed at fighting poverty. The extension of social 
security to vulnerable social groups and commitments to poverty eradication constitute a 
good practice in Suriname; the Alternativa Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra 
Am&#233;rica stands for the principles of solidarity, genuine cooperation and complementarity 
among Member States, sustainable development based on the well-being of peoples and 
their natural environment. Best practices among other stakeholders include the Global Code 
of Ethics for Tourism of the World Tourism Organization and open source technologies, 
such as Ushahidi and Frontline SMS to strengthen cooperation, awareness and response in 
crisis situations and human rights monitoring. Across national borders, there is an ever 
increasing number of alliances, such as Medecins<b> </b>sans Fronti&#232;res<b> </b>and Avocats sans 
Fronti&#232;res, which bear witness to an abundance of goodwill that exists across the world.  
</p>
<p>56. Some countries, as a matter of principle and respect for State sovereignty and in 
accordance with General Assembly resolution 46/182, only provide humanitarian assistance 
at the express request of the recipient country, in accordance with its priorities. The foreign 
policy of Brazil in the area of the human right to food includes international cooperation 
actions and the exchange of best practices aimed at achieving long-term solutions to food 
insecurity problems. Its policies in international cooperation are oriented towards 
overcoming obstacles to development, including tariffs and agricultural subsidies in 
developed countries, patents that prevent access to technology, and unsustainable debt. Its 
initiatives of South-South cooperation are framed in governmental policies aimed at 
overcoming these obstacles by establishing new mechanisms of partnership, such as the 
Forum India, Brazil and South Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks: international solidarity in an 
interdependent world 
</b></p>

<p><b>18</b> GE.10-14914 
</p>
<p>solidarity encompasses the relationship of solidarity among all stakeholders in the 
international community. 
</p>
<p>58. International solidarity is a precondition to human dignity, the basis of all human 
rights, and a human-centred approach to development, and has a bridge-building function 
across all divides and distinctions. It encompasses the values of social justice and equity; 
goodwill among peoples and nations, and integrity of the international community; 
sovereignty and sovereign equality of all States, and friendly relations among them. 
International cooperation is the core of international solidarity. However, international 
solidarity is not limited to international assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or 
humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept and principle that includes sustainability in 
international relations, especially international economic relations, the peaceful coexistence 
of all members of the international community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing 
of benefits and burdens, refraining from doing harm or posing obstacles to the greater well-
being of others, including in the international economic system and to our common 
ecological habitat, for which all are responsible. In a unified, interdependent, globalized 
marketplace, actions and inactions can benefit or harm people at the furthest ends of the 
earth; they therefore necessitate shared responsibilities and mutual accountability. 
Tolerance and diversity are intrinsic to international solidarity, which has no space for 
discrimination of any form. Special attention must be given to the human rights of 
vulnerable groups, including women, children, the disabled, the elderly, indigenous peoples 
and migrants. 
</p>
<p>59. There is an overwhelming manifestation of solidarity by States, individually and 
collectively, civil society, global social movements, countless people of goodwill reaching 
out to others, and corporate social initiatives by the private sector. The international 
responses after cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, the Asian tsunami and the earthquake in Haiti 
bear witness to the abundance of solidarity that exists. However, much more is needed, 
owing to the magnitude of global and local challenges, the alarming increase of natural and 
man-made disasters, and the continuing rises in poverty and inequality. Ideally, solidarity 
should be preventive rather than simply reactive to massive irreversible damage already 
caused, and must address both natural and man-made disasters. Towards this end, it must 
address the core need for justice and equity at the national and international levels; this is 
the only long-term, sustainable solution to common challenges faced by the international

<p>60. In the present report, the independent expert has identified the primary areas to be 
addressed, the main concepts and norms that can form the basis of a framework, and good 
practices to inform the future development of law and policy with regard to human rights 
and international solidarity. There is an abundance of hard and soft laws, policies and 
values that can form the basis of a conceptual and normative framework on human rights 
and international solidarity, principles and guidelines on human rights and international 
solidarity and, eventually, a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity. These laws, policies and values in the national, regional and 
international domains include the most basic instruments founded on international 
consensus.  
</p>
<p>61. International solidarity permeates the three pillars of the Charter of the United 
Nations: peace and security; development; and human rights. Development and human 
rights are the most secure basis for peace.11 At the nuclear security summit called by the 
President of the United States of America on 13 April 2010, the world was reminded that a

<p>substantially new manner of thinking and action was essential if humankind is to survive. 
Similarly, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the realization of the 
right to development call for a more enlightened approach, mindset and action based on a 
sense of community and international solidarity. The need for change is underlined by the 
Millennium Declaration, which includes solidarity12 and shared responsibility as 
fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century.  
</p>
<p>62. The independent expert would like to conclude with the wisdom of the words of the 
report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;In larger freedom&#8221; (A/59/2005): 
</p>
<p>In a world of interconnected threats and challenges, it is in each country&#8217;s self 
interest that all of them are addressed effectively. Hence, the cause of larger freedom 
can only be advanced by broad, deep and sustained global cooperation among 
States. Such cooperation is possible if every country&#8217;s policies take into account not 
only the needs of its own citizens but also the needs of others. This kind of 
cooperation not only advances everyone&#8217;s interests but also recognizes our common 
humanity.

<p>1. International solidarity, according to the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity, is defined as the union of interests or purposes among countries, 
and social cohesion between them, based upon the dependence of States and other 
international actors on each other, in order to preserve the order and very survival of 
international society, and in order to achieve collective goals, which require international 
cooperation and joint action. Given that the principle of international solidarity is essential 
to responding to current global challenges, what is your opinion with regard to recognizing 
international solidarity as a principle of international law, in particular, international human 
rights law? 
</p>
<p>2. General Assembly resolution 55/2 recognized solidarity as a fundamental value, 
essential to international relations. Taking into consideration the related concepts of 
international solidarity, the right to development, and human rights-based approaches to 
development, what is your opinion on international solidarity as one of the approaches to 
alleviate poverty?  
</p>
<p>3. In the context of third generation rights, and recognizing that solidarity rights are 
third generation rights, comprising, among others, the right to economic and social 
development, the right to participate in and benefit from the &#8220;common heritage of 
mankind&#8221;, the right to peace, the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, the right to 
humanitarian disaster relief and the right to communication: 
</p>
<p> (a) Do you see third generation rights, in particular solidarity rights, as an 
established or an emerging area of human rights law? 
</p>
<p> (b) In your perspective, is there any particular right that should be included under 
solidarity rights other than the rights mentioned herein?

<p>development reduce the existing gap between developed and developing countries by 
means of international cooperation and solidarity?  
</p>
<p>8. International solidarity itself is not a new notion, having been introduced by 
developing countries in the 1970s. The concept has been echoed in several international 
instruments (e.g. General Assembly resolution 55/2). In your view, are there State 
obligations in relation to international and/or global solidarity? 
</p>
<p> The independent expert has been requested to prepare a draft declaration on the right 
of peoples and individuals to international solidarity and would welcome your suggestions 
and comments.
