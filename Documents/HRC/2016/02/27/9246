<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 1/3, the Human Rights Council gave the Working Group on an optional 
protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights a mandate to 
elaborate an optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. The Chairperson submitted a first draft optional protocol (A/HRC/6/WG.4/2) as a basis 
for the negotiations of the Working Group at its fourth session, held from 16 to 27 July 2007. 
Based on the discussions of the Working Group, the Chairperson subsequently submitted a first 
revised draft (A/HRC/8/WG.4/2) to the Working Group at the first part of its fifth session and a 
second revised draft (A/HRC/8/WG.4/3) to the second part. The present report contains a 
summary of the discussions held during those two parts of the fifth session, from 4 to 8 February 
and from 31 March to 4 April 2008, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>2. The fifth session of the Working Group was opened by the Head of the Special Procedures 
Division of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 
</p>
<p>3. The Chairperson, Catarina de Albuquerque (Portugal), declared her confidence that the 
Working Group would strive for solutions likely to meet consensus and, at the same time, to 
ensure effective protection for victims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group adopted its agenda (A/HRC/8/WG.4/1) and programme of work. 
</p>
<p>5. In her address to the Working Group, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights stated that the adoption of the optional protocol would be a milestone in the 
history of the universal human rights system and would provide an important impetus for 
renewed attention to economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  OPENING STATEMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>6. Delegations welcomed the revised drafts prepared by the Chairpersons to facilitate the 
negotiation process.  
</p>
<p>7. Several delegations noted that the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights provided an excellent occasion for adopting the optional protocol, which would 
reaffirm the indivisibility, interrelatedness and interdependence of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Some delegations emphasized that an optional protocol should closely reflect the language 
of similar treaties establishing communications procedures. 
</p>
<p>9. Several delegations, including non-governmental organizations and the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights favoured a comprehensive approach, under which all Covenant rights would be 
covered by this protocol. Other delegations expressed preference for a selective (&#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221;) 
approach, by which States could exclude certain rights by way of opting in or out. 
</p>
<p>10. While South Africa asserted the justiciability of all economic, social and cultural rights, 
Canada and the United States of America argued that the progressive nature of those rights made </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>it difficult to adjudicate them without interfering with decisions by Governments concerning 
resource allocation. Nigeria stressed that the fact that the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights was subject to a State&#8217;s available resources made their adjudication difficult for 
developing countries. 
</p>
<p>11. Some delegations favoured clear criteria for the assessment of violations of these rights, 
such as reasonableness and unreasonableness and a wide margin of appreciation for States in 
their policy choices. Several delegations and non-governmental organizations rejected codifying 
these criteria. 
</p>
<p>12. In view of the severe resource constraints faced by developing countries, Bangladesh, 
China, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Republic of 
Korea, Amnesty International and CETIM supported including a provision on international 
assistance and cooperation. A number of delegations expressed the view that such a provision 
did not belong to an optional protocol. 
</p>
<p>13. The NGO Coalition stated that an optional protocol should include provisions for an 
inquiry procedure, interim measures and a prohibition of reservations. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  REVIEW OF THE FIRST REVISED DRAFT 
</b></p>
<p>14. During the first part of its fifth session, held from 4 to 8 February 2008, the Working 
Group reviewed the first revised draft optional protocol (A/HRC/8/WG.4/2), in which 
amendments to the original draft (A/HRC/6/WG.4/2) were indicated in bold font. 
</p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Russian Federation suggested shortening the preamble to one or two paragraphs. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to paragraph 1, Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, Egypt, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and Mexico supported the original text.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to paragraph 2, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, 
Finland, France, Haiti, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Spain, 
Switzerland and the NGO Coalition favoured the original text. 
</p>
<p>18. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), India, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland preferred using the exact quotation from the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. Some delegations noted that an alternative was to drop the explicit 
reference to the Declaration and to include similar language to that of the preamble of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to paragraph 4, India and the Netherlands favoured the original wording. 
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden preferred to either delete the paragraph or keep the 
original wording. 
</p>
<p>20. Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Lesotho, Morocco, 
the Russian Federation, Senegal and South Africa suggested adding text so as to quote the full 
text of paragraph 5 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>21. Belgium, France, Mexico, Poland and Portugal proposed that the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action not be quoted and that the agreed language from the preamble of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities be used. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to paragraph 5, India and the Netherlands favoured the original text. 
Canada and the United Kingdom noted that the reference to Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1985/17 could be part of the text and requested adding the phrase &#8220;or any successor 
thereto&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. India noted that the bracketed text &#8220;any of the rights&#8221; should be revised upon agreement on 
article 2. 
</p>
<p>24. Canada, India, Mexico, the Netherlands and South Africa proposed to replace the last part 
of the paragraph with &#8220;to carry out the functions provided in the present Protocol&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to paragraph 6, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Portugal and Sweden asked for its 
deletion. Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa and Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of) preferred its retention. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p>26. Concerning the title, the United Kingdom and the United States proposed adding &#8220;to 
receive and consider communications&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. With regard to paragraph 1, several delegates favoured retaining the brackets around 
the text &#8220;and to conduct inquiries&#8221; pending a decision on articles 10, 11 and 11 bis, while 
Canada, China, Denmark, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Senegal, 
the United Kingdom and the United States proposed the deletion of this text. It was noted that 
none of the human rights treaties providing for an inquiry procedure included such a reference. 
Egypt mentioned that keeping the bracketed text would clarify the competence of the 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>28. If an inquiry procedure were included, several delegates proposed the addition of &#8220;where 
applicable&#8221; or other similar wording to the bracketed text to reflect the optional character of this 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to paragraph 2, several delegations supported its retention. Egypt and the 
Netherlands noted that, if a reference to inquiries were kept in paragraph 1, paragraph 2 should 
be revised accordingly. 
</p>
<p>30. Bangladesh and Egypt suggested replacing the verb &#8220;receive&#8221; with &#8220;consider&#8221; in 
paragraphs 1 and 2. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p>31. Concerning the title, New Zealand proposed keeping the word &#8220;individual&#8221; while China 
supported its deletion. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to paragraph 1, several delegations suggested retaining &#8220;within&#8221; the 
jurisdiction, while others favoured the wording &#8220;subject to&#8221;. France supported the wording 
&#8220;relevant de la jurisdiction&#8221; in the French version. Amnesty International preferred excluding 
any reference to jurisdiction. 
</p><p>33. Austria, Bangladesh, Chile, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, India, Italy, 
Mexico, Pakistan, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Slovenia and South Africa preferred the 
deletion of the bracketed text &#8220;direct&#8221; and &#8220;significant&#8221;. Canada, China, Poland and Sweden 
favoured retaining this text. New Zealand supported the reference to &#8220;significant&#8221; and sought 
clarification of the meaning of &#8220;direct victims&#8221;. The Netherlands and the Republic of Korea 
noted that the need for a reference to &#8220;significant&#8221; depended on whether paragraph 2 would be 
retained, while the Netherlands and the United States said that this reference might be better 
placed in article 4. 
</p>
<p>34. China, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Nepal and Poland favoured retaining the 
bracketed text &#8220;express&#8221;, while Bangladesh, Finland, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
Portugal and Slovenia asked for its deletion. 
</p>
<p>35. Bangladesh, Belgium, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Liechtenstein, Mexico and 
Portugal preferred deleting the bracketed text &#8220;Parts II and III of/Parts III read in conjunction 
with provisions contained in Part II&#8221;. Canada, China, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, the 
Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States advised 
retaining the text &#8220;Part III read in conjunction with provisions contained in Part II&#8221;. 
</p><p>36. Some delegates supported the exclusion of Part I (art. 1) of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, while others were for its inclusion. In this regard, Egypt 
requested the Chairperson to seek the views of the Committee on how it had addressed issues 
related to article 1 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>37. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Finland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and FIAN supported the retention of &#8220;unless the author can justify acting 
on their behalf without such consent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to paragraph 2, several delegations and non-governmental organizations called 
for its deletion and reiterated their support for a comprehensive scope. Other delegations 
supported its retention. Canada presented an alternative proposal, supported by several States, 
changing the paragraph from an opt-out to an opt-in clause. Other delegations favoured an 
opt-out approach. 
</p>
<p>39. Turkey and the United Kingdom asked for the deletion of &#8220;of articles 2 (1) and 6 to 15&#8221;, 
the United States proposed replacing this text with &#8220;referred to in paragraph 1 above&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>40. China, Denmark, New Zealand, Poland and the Russian Federation suggested the deletion 
of the bracketed last sentence. Austria, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea and the 
United States supported its retention. The Netherlands preferred a time frame shorter than 
10 years. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7*

</p>
<p>41. The Working Group then turned to new proposals included in bracketed article 2, 
paragraph 1, subparagraphs 1 bis and 1 ter<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to subparagraph 1 bis, several delegates supported giving further consideration 
to the inclusion of a provision allowing the Committee to grant amicus standing to 
non-governmental organizations. Specific proposals were made to add references to national 
human rights institutions and/or trade unions and employers&#8217; organizations. 
</p>
<p>43. Some delegations expressed concern about subparagraph 1 bis, noting that 
non-governmental organizations could already participate as third parties under article 2, 
paragraph 1, and that such a procedure was not found under other similar instruments. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to subparagraph 1 ter, most delegates preferred its deletion, expressing, 
inter alia, concerns about allowing for communications without identified victims and preventing 
a flood of communications. Ecuador, the Netherlands and the NGO Coalition preferred its 
retention. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p>45. Several delegations supported the deletion of this article. The Netherlands and Poland 
supported its retention but expressed flexibility to the position of the majority of delegates. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p>46. Austria stated that the autonomy of the Committee to interpret admissibility criteria should 
not be overregulated. Amnesty International and COHRE cautioned against admissibility criteria 
that were overly restrictive. 
</p>
<p>47. On paragraph 1, several delegations and non-governmental organizations favoured 
retaining the original language &#8220;all available domestic remedies&#8221; used in other similar 
instruments. Denmark, Greece, New Zealand, Poland and the United Kingdom preferred keeping 
the bracketed text &#8220;judicial, administrative and other&#8221;. A proposal to insert &#8220;effective&#8221; after &#8220;all 
available&#8221;, supported by Chile, the United Kingdom, Mexico and the Netherlands, was opposed 
by Bangladesh, China, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Poland, the Russian Federation and 
the United States. 
</p>
<p>48. Several delegates and non-governmental organizations supported keeping the bracketed 
text &#8220;unreasonably prolonged&#8221; used in all similar communications. China, Bangladesh, Egypt 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran supported its deletion. 
</p>
<p>49. Several delegations and non-governmental organizations advised keeping the text in 
brackets &#8220;or unlikely to bring effective relief&#8221;, which is agreed language from the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. Canada, the United States and China preferred its deletion. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>50. Several delegations asked for the deletion of the bracketed last sentence. No delegate 
supported its retention, but some pointed out that, if retained, the sentence should end after the 
word &#8220;established&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. On paragraph 2, proposals were made to replace &#8220;where&#8221; with &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;when&#8221; in the 
chapeau. Egypt, Liechtenstein and the Netherlands suggested inserting &#8220;or&#8221; at the end of 
subparagraph (f) to underline the non-cumulative nature of the list of inadmissibility criteria. 
</p>
<p>52. With regard to subparagraph (a), Mexico and the NGO Coalition supported replacing 
&#8220;six months&#8221; with &#8220;a reasonable period&#8221;. Several delegations noted their preference for a fixed 
time limit of six months or longer. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to subparagraph (b), several delegations favoured the new wording proposed 
in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. The Islamic Republic of Iran suggested deleting &#8220;after that date&#8221;. 
A proposal was made to replace &#8220;those facts&#8221; with &#8220;the alleged violation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. With regard to subparagraph (c), several delegates supported retaining &#8220;matter&#8221;, in line 
with the language used in all the other communication mechanisms. Germany preferred the word 
&#8220;violation&#8221;, while Belgium, France, Indonesia and Japan preferred &#8220;alleged violation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. A number of delegations preferred deletion of &#8220;of the same nature&#8221; at the end of the 
subparagraph, while Mexico proposed retaining this wording, also used in the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Egypt suggested &#8220;of 
a similar legal character&#8221; as an alternative. 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to subparagraph (d), several delegates preferred deletion of the bracketed text 
&#8220;or inconsistent with applicable instruments in the field of human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>57. With regard to subparagraph (e), several delegates preferred the deletion of the bracketed 
text &#8220;or dependent mainly on second hand information&#8221;. China and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
supported its retention.  
</p>
<p>58. With regard to subparagraph (g), some delegations favoured deleting the bracketed text 
about confidentiality of the information to protect the victim. Other delegates noted that the text 
should be placed under article 6 or dealt with in the rules of procedure. France and several 
non-governmental organizations preferred keeping the text, replacing &#8220;victims&#8221; with &#8220;authors&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>59. Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom proposed a new subparagraph (d) bis 
referring to a threshold of &#8220;significant disadvantage&#8221;, unless the communication raised a serious 
issue of general importance. A number of delegates supported the inclusion of such a new 
criterion, noting that it would allow the Committee not to deal with complaints of minor 
importance. Other delegations opposed the proposal, noting that it would require the Committee 
to undertake an examination of the merits at the admissibility stage and would seem to imply that 
some violations could be considered insignificant, which was unacceptable. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p>60. Several delegations and non-governmental organizations supported the inclusion of interim 
measures in the optional protocol, while others preferred their inclusion in the rules of procedure. 
Algeria and the Russian Federation proposed the deletion of article 5. 
</p>
<p>61. With regard to paragraph 1, Canada, China, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Spain, the 
United Kingdom and the United States favoured the addition of &#8220;in exceptional circumstances&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>62. Australia, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), South Africa, the Syrian Arab Republic 
and Venezuela proposed deleting the bracketed text &#8220;taking into account the availability of 
resources&#8221;. China, India and Nepal preferred its retention. 
</p>
<p>63. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) supported the use of the word &#8220;harm&#8221; instead of 
&#8220;damage&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>64. Australia and Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) preferred deleting the bracketed text 
&#8220;and based on reliable information&#8221;; China preferred its retention. 
</p>
<p>65. Bangladesh, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), India, Ireland and Poland suggested 
that interim measures should only be granted after a communication had been declared 
admissible. 
</p>
<p>66. Norway and Sweden proposed adding &#8220;bearing in mind the voluntary nature of such 
requests&#8221; at the end of the paragraph. Some States supported this proposal. Others noted that its 
inclusion was not necessary, as the views and requests of treaty bodies such as the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights were non-binding and voluntary in nature. 
</p>
<p>67. With regard to paragraph 2, several delegates supported its retention. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p>68. With regard to paragraph 1, several delegations preferred deleting the bracketed text. It 
was noted that a State would not be able to respond appropriately to a communication if it did 
not know the identity of the author, and that concerns about the safety of individuals were 
covered by article 12. 
</p>
<p>69. Austria and Bangladesh noted that this issue could be dealt with in the rules of procedure. 
</p>
<p>70. Portugal, Mexico, ICJ, IWRAW Asia-Pacific and the NGO Coalition favoured the 
retention of the bracketed text. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to paragraph 2, the Netherlands suggested adding the word &#8220;including&#8221; before 
the text in bold font. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p>72. Several delegations were in favour of retaining article 7; others preferred its deletion or its 
inclusion in the rules of procedure. Australia, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Indonesia, South Africa 
and the United Kingdom indicated preference for the original text of draft article 7. China noted 
that friendly settlements should be confined to inter-States procedures. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to paragraph 1, Portugal and the Russian Federation supported the bracketed 
text &#8220;within a reasonable period of time&#8221;. Argentina and the United Kingdom preferred deletion 
of this text; Guatemala advised referring to a specific period of time. 
</p>
<p>74. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) expressed support for the bracketed text about friendly 
settlement, while Argentina, Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom preferred 
its deletion. Indonesia proposed replacing it with text referring to the exhaustion of all available 
domestic remedies before making use of a friendly settlement mechanism. 
</p>
<p>75. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) agreed to the bracketed text about reaching a 
conclusion; Argentina, Guatemala, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom preferred its 
deletion. 
</p>
<p>76. Several delegations were in favour of the bracketed text &#8220;[T]he terms of a friendly 
settlement shall be subject to review and approval by the Committee.&#8221; Poland supported giving 
the Committee the competence to review but not approve the terms. Australia, Austria, Germany, 
Ghana, the Russian Federation, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Kingdom and Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of) preferred its deletion. 
</p>
<p>77. On paragraph 2, Mexico, Portugal and the Russian Federation supported the insertion of 
the bracketed text &#8220;[T]he full implementation of&#8221;, while Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
wished to delete it. The Syrian Arab Republic preferred to delete only &#8220;full&#8221;. Poland preferred 
the original text providing for closure of the procedure at the moment of reaching a friendly 
settlement. 
</p>
<p>78. The Russian Federation and the United Kingdom favoured retaining the original language 
&#8220;shall be deemed to close&#8221;; France preferred replacing it with the word &#8220;closes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>79. With regard to paragraph 3, several delegations favoured its deletion. Germany supported 
its retention. The Netherlands suggested inserting the word &#8220;negotiations&#8221; after the words &#8220;end 
the friendly settlement&#8221;. Senegal considered that the Committee should have the power to 
intervene only if the result of the friendly settlement had not been achieved; New Zealand 
considered that the Committee should not be able to terminate the process unilaterally.  
</p>
<p>80. Bangladesh, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom requested the deletion of 
paragraph 4.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>

proposed in bold font, while Egypt, India, and Norway asked for its deletion. Australia, Chile, 
Denmark, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United States proposed deleting only the text

</p>
<p>83. New Zealand proposed adding &#8220;written&#8221; before the word &#8220;information&#8221;. Poland suggested 
replacing the text in bold with &#8220;[P]arties concerned shall be invited to submit statements or 
observations in regard to this information within the time limit set by the Committee.&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>84. With regard to paragraph 3, Argentina, Finland, Mexico, Sweden and the Netherlands 
preferred reverting to the original wording. Liechtenstein and the United States proposed 
replacing &#8220;may&#8221; with &#8220;shall&#8221;, while Chile proposed including &#8220;shall&#8221; in relation to 
United Nations mechanisms and &#8220;may&#8221; to regional mechanisms. Several delegations preferred 
the wording &#8220;may consult&#8221; with regard to both United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms. Liechtenstein preferred deleting the reference to regional mechanisms. Azerbaijan 
and Egypt suggested referring to &#8220;United Nations treaty bodies&#8221;. Some delegations preferred 
deleting the paragraph or leaving it for the rules of procedure. Slovenia and the United Kingdom 
preferred reverting to &#8220;decisions and recommendations&#8221; instead of &#8220;work carried out&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>85. On paragraph 4, Argentina, Bangladesh, Finland and the Russian Federation preferred the 
original text, while Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Portugal and Sri Lanka highlighted the 
importance of closely reflecting the language of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>86. Delegates proposed a number of amendments. Germany proposed replacing the word 
&#8220;shall&#8221; with &#8220;may&#8221; before the word &#8220;focus&#8221;. Canada, Denmark, Germany, Liechtenstein, 
New Zealand, Spain and the NGO Coalition suggested the deletion of words &#8220;respect, protect 
and fulfil&#8221;. Azerbaijan and Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) supported its retention. 
</p><p>87. Canada, Liechtenstein and Mexico proposed merging the first and second sentences, 
deleting the bracketed text in the first sentence. 
</p>

Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovenia and Sweden supported the inclusion 
of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221;, while Denmark, Japan, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States 
preferred the term &#8220;unreasonableness&#8221;. The United Kingdom proposed an annex for the criteria 
for the text of unreasonableness. Chile and Slovenia supported the inclusion of the term 
&#8220;effectiveness&#8221;. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Guatemala, Liechtenstein and Mexico 
supported wording closer to article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>89. Liechtenstein proposed the text &#8220;[&#8230;] the Committee shall assess the steps taken by the 
State Party, to the maximum of its available resources and with a view to achieving the full 
realization of the right or rights referred to in the communication by all appropriate means, in

Canada, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and 
the United Kingdom supported adding the word &#8220;broad&#8221; or &#8220;wide&#8221; before the word &#8220;margin&#8221;. 
Canada, supported by several States, proposed amending the end of the sentence to &#8220;the 
appropriate policy measures and allocation of its resources in accordance with domestic 
priorities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>92. The International Labour Organization, by reference to article 74, paragraph 5, of the 
International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, 
proposed inserting a new paragraph reading &#8220;When considering communications related to 
matters falling within the competence of the International Labour Organization, the Committee 
shall invite the International Labour Office to appoint a representative to participate, in a 
consultative capacity, in its meetings.&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 bis 
</b></p>
<p>93. Canada suggested the deletion of the second and third paragraphs and the last part of 
paragraph 1, converting the first part of that paragraph into a new paragraph 5 of article 8. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p>94. Argentina, Egypt, Ghana, South Africa, the Netherlands and Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of) supported the retention of article 9. France and Poland noted that article 9 was 
acceptable given its optional nature. Poland stressed the non-binding nature of the report 
submitted by the Committee under this procedure. 
</p>
<p>95. China, Japan, New Zealand, Senegal, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Russian Federation 
preferred the deletion of article 9. If retained, delegations underlined the need to ensure the 
consistency of the text with the rest of the protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Articles 10, 11 and 11 bis 
</b></p>
<p>96. Several delegations supported the retention of the inquiry procedure provided for in 
articles 10 and 11. Other delegations called for the deletion of these articles. 
</p>
<p>97. Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the 
United States requested retaining the reference to the words &#8220;grave or systematic&#8221; in article 10, 
paragraph 1. Ecuador preferred their deletion. 
</p>
<p>98. With regard to article 10, paragraph 5, Brazil and Sweden asked to retain the time frame of

  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>99. With regard to article 10, paragraph 6, Australia noted that States should be able to provide 
comments on the report before it was made public. 
</p>
<p>100. On article 11, Canada and New Zealand preferred its deletion, as follow-up issues could be 
dealt with in the rules of procedure. If retained, New Zealand suggested that the non-binding 
nature of the procedure be clarified by adding the words &#8220;if any&#8221; between the words &#8220;taken&#8221; and 
&#8220;in response&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>101. Several delegations expressed flexibility or support for an inquiry procedure, as long as it 
remained optional, as provided for in article 11 bis. Others were of the view that the procedure 
should not be optional, but expressed flexibility on this point. Some delegates suggested 
replacing the opt-out mechanism with an opt-in one, while others cautioned against this change. 
The Russian Federation favoured merging articles 10 and 11 bis to make clear that the procedure 
was optional. 
</p>
<p>102. The Russian Federation expressed concern at the power given to the Committee to launch 
an inquiry. India requested clarification as to whether an inquiry procedure could be triggered in 
the absence of a communication and, if so, on which grounds. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 12 
</b></p>
<p>103. Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United States and 
Amnesty International supported the retention of article 12. Australia, Belgium, Canada, the

article 11 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>104. Australia, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland noted that reference to &#8220;individuals&#8221; only 
would be sufficient. New Zealand inquired whether the word &#8220;authors&#8221; would not cover all 
situations. 
</p>
<p>105. Australia, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland underlined that the words &#8220;ill-treatment&#8221; and 
&#8220;intimidation&#8221; covered various threats. France emphasized that the words &#8220;form of ill-treatment, 
reprisal, victimization or intimidation&#8221; should cover any restrictions to access remedies. 
Amnesty International proposed amending the text to read &#8220;any threats, intimidation or denial of 
any human rights or fundamental freedom&#8221;. COHRE proposed replacing these words with &#8220;any 
form of pressure&#8221;. The United States noted that the words &#8220;subject to its jurisdiction&#8221; should be 
made consistent with article 2, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p>106. The Netherlands suggested that article 12 could become article 8 ter as it related to the 
individual communication procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>Articles 13 
</b></p>
<p>107. Algeria, Austria, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), the Russian Federation and the 
United States supported article 13. Italy, Liechtenstein, Sweden and Switzerland preferred the 
original language. Canada and Liechtenstein considered that article 22 of the Covenant provided 
a better mechanism for identifying international assistance needs and Canada sought the deletion 
of article 13. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>108. Senegal and the NGO Coalition noted that the title &#8220;International assistance and 
cooperation&#8221; should be referred to in the text of article 13. 
</p>
<p>109. With regard to paragraph 1, Argentina, Bangladesh, France, Guatemala, India, the 
Netherlands and Poland supported the wording &#8220;and with the consent of the State party 
concerned&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>110. Argentina, France and Poland favoured the inclusion of &#8220;and other States parties&#8221;; 
Guatemala, Japan, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea and Sweden sought its deletion. 
Indonesia noted that article 22 of the Covenant made no reference to &#8220;other States parties&#8221;. India 
inquired whether this reference implied that all information would be automatically transmitted 
to other States parties. 
</p>
<p>111. Argentina, France, the Netherlands, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and 
Switzerland preferred deleting the word &#8220;financial&#8221; before &#8220;assistance&#8221;, while China and Nepal 
supported its retention. 
</p>
<p>112. Egypt noted that the focus of international assistance in article 13 should be on technical 
advice to avoid duplication with article 14. 
</p>
<p>113. With regard to article 13, paragraph 2, Guatemala favoured retaining &#8220;each within its field 
of competence&#8221;. Australia, Egypt and the Netherlands suggested including a reference to &#8220;with 
the consent of the State Party&#8221;, while China proposed referring to &#8220;with prior knowledge of&#8221; and 
Indonesia to &#8220;with prior notification of&#8221; the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 14 
</b></p>
<p>114. Several delegations, including Canada, Denmark and the United States, opposed or 
expressed concerns about the establishment of a fund, noting the danger of linking violations to 
funding, the risks of duplicating existing United Nations funds and the practical difficulties in 
managing such a fund. The raison d&#8217;&#234;tre of the fund was also questioned, as, in many cases, no 
violation of the Covenant would be found if the non-fulfilment of a right was caused by a lack of 
resources. 
</p>
<p>115. Argentina, Bangladesh and Egypt argued that the optional protocol was the right place for 
establishing a fund and referred to the precedent in the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture. 
</p>
<p>116. Australia noted that, if the article was retained, there would be a need for strict criteria for 
the use of the fund. Switzerland noted that there was a need to clarify what proportion of funding 
would be made available to individual victims and to Governments respectively. 
</p>
<p>117. Sweden and Switzerland inquired how the fund would benefit victims. While stating a 
strong preference for not establishing a fund, Sweden proposed compromise language for a fund 
exclusively geared towards assisting individuals to submit communications. Several delegates 
favoured using the fund for supporting victims&#8217; access to the procedure or for providing effective 
remedies for victims. Algeria, Bangladesh and Egypt were against such a limited use of the fund. 
Poland noted, that if established, the fund should support financing technical assistance only. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>118. Belgium, with the support of Austria, Brazil, Egypt, Morocco and Norway, suggested 
adding language from article 32, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities to clarify that a lack of financial aid could not be justification for not complying with 
the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>119. With regard to paragraph 1, Argentina, Bangladesh, Ecuador, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Nepal and the NGO Coalition supported the revised text. China asked for the deletion of &#8220;on 
remedies&#8221; in the first line and the replacement of &#8220;effective remedies&#8221; with &#8220;effective measures 
to implement the recommendations of the Committee&#8221; in the last line. 
</p>
<p>120. With regard to paragraph 2, several delegations preferred its retention, if article 14 were to 
be kept in the protocol, to underline the voluntary nature of the fund. Bangladesh and Egypt 
noted that, while the fund would be voluntary, the protocol should not mention this explicitly. 
Egypt noted that the fund could also be established as a dedicated project of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 15 
</b></p>
<p>121. Professor Eibe Riedel advised delegates to revert to the original draft text, because 
the Committee reports to the Economic and Social Council, not the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 16 
</b></p>
<p>122. Australia preferred the original draft. Austria and Mexico preferred the word &#8220;undertake&#8221; 
while France preferred &#8220;encouraged&#8221;. Mexico and New Zealand suggested amending the 
bracketed text in line with article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
&#8220;and to do in a manner which recognizes the rights of persons with disabilities to information in 
accessible format&#8221;. The United Kingdom supported the provision of material in accessible 
formats but preferred not to refer to &#8220;rights of persons with disabilities&#8221;, as they were not 
recognized in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 17 
</b></p>
<p>123. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) noted that the article should either indicate 
elements to be included in the rules of procedure or be deleted. 
</p>
<p>124. Several delegates called for the deletion of the alternative text in bold font. 
</p>
<p>125. Canada proposed new text based on article 39, paragraph 2 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, specifying that the rules &#8220;shall provide, inter alia, that: 
(a) two-thirds of the membership shall constitute a quorum, and (b) decisions of the Committee 
shall be made by the majority of the members present&#8221;. Some delegations preferred changing the 
word &#8220;develop&#8221; in the original draft to &#8220;modify&#8221;, to allow the Committee to assume its new 
functions without having to review all its existing procedures. 
</p>
<p>126. Australia, Denmark, Nepal, New Zealand and the United States suggested postponing 
discussions on this article until it became clearer which issues would be left for the rules of 
procedure. Japan proposed adding &#8220;and the States parties may comment on or make proposal for 
the rules of procedures, which will be considered by the Committee&#8221; to the first sentence. </p>

<p><b>Article 18 
</b></p>
<p>127. New Zealand suggested amendments to simplify the language, merging the first and 
second paragraphs. Other delegates cautioned against changing the text of such a standard 
provision. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) supported allowing States who had signed 
the Covenant only to ratify the optional protocol. The United States recommended replacing the 
words &#8220;shall be&#8221; with &#8220;is&#8221; as in article 8 of the First Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 19

Guatemala and the Netherlands proposed using the language of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, article 14. Some delegates highlighted that other instruments of a 
similar nature also prohibited reservations. 
</p>
<p>131. Several delegations noted that the article was superfluous, as the matter was covered by the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and asked for its deletion. Bangladesh and Egypt (on 
behalf of the African Group) noted that reservations could be permitted only if consistent with 
the nature and scope of the protocol.

Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture and other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the

<p><b>V.  REVIEW OF THE SECOND REVISED DRAFT 
</b></p>
<p>137. At the second part of the session, from 31 March to 4 April 2008, the Working Group had 
before it a second revised draft of the optional protocol (A/HRC/8/WG.4/3) and a note with 
additional drafting proposals, prepared by the Chairperson dated 25 March 2008. In her opening 
statement, the Chairperson underlined the need for all to show flexibility in order to reach 
consensus and expressed her hope that the Working Group would be able to complete its 
mandate and conclude the session with a text for transmission to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>138. The Working Group agreed to replace paragraph 1 with the wording of preambular 
paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>139. Paragraphs 2 and 3 were accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p>140. Paragraph 4 was left pending owing to a lack of consensus on a proposal by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to reflect language from paragraph 5 of the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>141. The discussion on paragraph 6 was left pending. 
</p>
<p>142. Paragraph 5 was approved as drafted after some discussion, without reference to Economic 
and Social Council resolution 1985/17. Delegates discussed inserting, &#8220;established by ECOSOC 
resolution 1985/17&#8221; after &#8220;Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8221;. Some 
delegations agreed to the insertion, others discussed whether to insert this reference as a 
footnote, while a third group cautioned against such an insertion. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p>143. Article 1 was accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p>144. With regard to paragraph 1, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) and Portugal preferred 
the deletion of the language in brackets. Algeria stated that the scope of the protocol should 
include Part I of the Covenant. Canada, Greece, Poland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>United States favoured referring to &#8220;any rights set forth in Part III read in conjunction with 
Part II of the Covenant&#8221;. Morocco reiterated its position that the application of the protocol 
should be limited to rights that are only specific to the Covenant. The NGO Coalition cautioned 
against exclusion of Part I of the Covenant from the protocol. China and India stated that Part I 
of the Covenant should be excluded from the scope of the article. 
</p>
<p>145. With regard to paragraph 2, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt (on behalf 
of the African Group), Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Portugal, Slovenia, 
South Africa, Spain, Uruguay and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) supported a 
comprehensive approach and called for the deletion of this paragraph. Italy and Sweden 
supported a comprehensive approach, provided that the optional protocol allowed States a wide 
margin of appreciation to determine freely the best use of their resources. 
</p>
<p>146. Canada, China, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the 
United Kingdom and the United States supported the retention of the paragraph. The 
United States suggested that the reference to specific articles should be changed to read &#8220;any 
rights set forth in Part III read in conjunction with Part II of the Covenant&#8221;. Austria, Denmark, 
the Republic of Korea and Turkey supported an opt-out clause. Japan and Poland preferred an 
opt-in clause, as proposed by Canada, but remained open to consider an opt-out approach. Latvia 
and the Russian Federation favoured an &#224; la carte approach. China stated that an opt-out 
approach should not be applied to article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p>147. The Working Group approved its deletion. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p>148. With regard to paragraph 1, the Working Group agreed to delete &#8220;or unlikely to bring 
effective relief&#8221;. ICJ expressed concern about the deletion, arguing that no one should be 
required to exhaust futile remedies. 
</p>
<p>149. Paragraph 2, subparagraph (<i>a</i>) was approved by the Working Group as amended, replacing 
&#8220;six months&#8221; with &#8220;one year&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>150. Subparagraph (<i>b</i>) was accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p>151. Subparagraph (<i>c</i>) was approved as drafted after some discussion. Egypt (on behalf of the 
African Group) and Senegal requested a reference to &#8220;international procedures of similar 
character&#8221;. Bangladesh, Egypt, France, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Senegal proposed 
deleting &#8220;investigations&#8221; and referring to &#8220;similar procedures of settlement&#8221;. Guatemala 
suggested adding the word &#8220;complaints&#8221;. India and the Russian Federation proposed referring to 
&#8220;another procedure of international consideration of communications or settlement&#8221;. The 
Syrian Arab Republic preferred mentioning &#8220;settlement, complaint and investigation&#8221;. Australia, 
Austria, Brazil, Greece, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the 
Russian Federation and the United Kingdom cautioned against changing to language that might</p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>give rise to legal questions, particularly adding &#8220;similar&#8221;, which would be unclear. In adopting 
this provision, the Working Group agreed to mention in the report that they understood the 
wording in a broad and comprehensive way that would include other international (including 
regional) procedures. 
</p>
<p>152. Subparagraph (<i>d</i>) was accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p>153. With regard to subparagraph (<i>e</i>), the Chairperson suggested adding &#8220;frivolous&#8221;. Most 
delegations did not favour the inclusion of this word. China and India supported adding a 
requirement that communications could not rely mainly on second-hand information. 
</p>
<p>154. Subparagraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) were accepted as drafted. 
155. The United Kingdom, supported by Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, 
New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United States, submitted an amended version to 
subparagraph 2 (<i>d</i>) bis, as a new paragraph 3, which reads: &#8220;The Committee may decline to 
consider a communication where it does not appear to reveal that the author has been 
significantly disadvantaged&#8221;, noting that this text offered flexibility to the Committee to allocate 
time and resources effectively.  
</p>
<p>156. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Finland, 
France, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Switzerland and 
several non-governmental organizations did not favour proposed paragraph 3. Delegations 
underlined concerns raised in the first part of the session about the expression &#8220;significantly 
disadvantaged&#8221; (see paragraph 60 above). 
</p>
<p>157. China was concerned that, with the word &#8220;may&#8221; and with no criteria that the Committee 
has to apply in deciding not to consider a communication being provided for, any double 
standard would be to the detriment of the uniform application of the protocol. The 
United Kingdom said that, while it would have preferred &#8220;shall&#8221;, it considered that the 
Committee should be relied upon to adopt a consistent approach in the light of its workload and 
the prevailing circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p>158. With regard to paragraph 1, Brazil, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Finland, Germany, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico and Portugal preferred the text as drafted. Argentina, 
Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States supported 
including &#8220;as may be necessary in exceptional circumstances&#8221;, as suggested by the Chairperson. 
Finland, Switzerland, Amnesty International, ICJ and the NGO Coalition considered the 
amendment redundant. 
</p>
<p>159. Liechtenstein proposed replacing &#8220;for its urgent consideration a request that the State party 
take such interim measures&#8221; with &#8220;a request that the State party urgently consider taking such 
interim measures&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>160. Norway proposed adding at the end of the paragraph &#8220;bearing in mind the voluntary nature 
of compliance with such requests&#8221;. A number of delegations supported the proposal, while others </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>preferred not to add such wording. Some delegates noted that the proposal was not necessary 
because of the voluntary nature of such requests. Mexico, Portugal and Switzerland considered it 
incompatible with the purpose of preventing irreparable harm. Several delegates and 
non-governmental organizations mentioned that it would imply a retrogression in relation to 
Optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the jurisprudence of regional human rights systems. Norway argued that 
clarification of the voluntary nature was necessary, since other treaty bodies interpreted interim 
measure requests to be binding on States. Canada agreed that it would be helpful to state that 
requests for interim measures were non-binding, even if that was already clear from the words 
&#8220;request&#8221; and &#8220;urgent consideration&#8221;, and further proposed adding at the end of the paragraph 
&#8220;and shall invite the State party concerned to make submissions regarding the request if it so 
wishes&#8221;. Liechtenstein considered that States parties had an obligation to consider urgently 
taking action on interim measure requests. 
</p>
<p>161. Japan favoured reinserting &#8220;when the risk of such damage is sufficiently substantiated&#8221; at 
the end of paragraph 1. Canada preferred that interim measures be dealt within the rules of 
procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p>162. Article 6 was accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p>163. Article 7 was accepted as drafted. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p>164. Portugal and the Russian Federation suggested using uniform terminology to streamline 
&#8220;examine/examination&#8221; and &#8220;consider/consideration&#8221;. Some delegates cautioned against 
deviating from standard language. 
</p>
<p>165. Paragraph 1 was approved as modified, replacing &#8220;consider&#8221; with &#8220;examine&#8221;, &#8220;made 
available to it&#8221; by &#8220;submitted to it&#8221; and &#8220;information&#8221; by &#8220;documentation&#8221; twice. Discussions 
were held in relation to the proposal of Canada to insert &#8220;written&#8221; before information to ensure 
consistency with the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, article 5 (1), but delegations noted that &#8220;written&#8221; was not contained in other instruments. 
China, Pakistan and the Russian Federation expressed concern about replacing &#8220;provided that 
this information is transmitted to the Parties concerned&#8221; with &#8220;by the Parties concerned&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>166. Paragraph 2 was approved as drafted. 
</p>
<p>167. Paragraph 3 was approved as amended after some discussion, adding references to 
&#8220;United Nations specialized agencies, funds, programmes and mechanisms&#8221;, &#8220;other international 
organizations&#8221; and &#8220;any observations and comments by the State party concerned&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>168. With regard to paragraph 4, the Chairperson suggested the insertion of &#8220;and 
appropriateness&#8221; after &#8220;reasonableness&#8221;, and the deletion of the last sentence. Some delegations 
supported the insertion of &#8220;appropriateness&#8221;, while others did not. A few noted that the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>combined use of reasonableness and appropriateness could cause confusion. Canada and 
New Zealand cautioned against selective reference to article 2, paragraph 1 of the Covenant and 
proposed referring to Part II of the Covenant instead. Austria proposed replacing &#8220;as long as they 
are consistent&#8221; with &#8220;in compliance with&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>169. Germany, Mexico, Portugal and several non-governmental organizations proposed deleting 
paragraph 4, while Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) preferred retaining it. 
</p>
<p>170. Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Greece, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the 
United States supported a &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; test. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), Peru 
and the NGO Coalition preferred that the word &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; not be used. 
</p>
<p>171. Several delegations favoured maintaining a reference to the &#8220;[broad] margin of 
appreciation&#8221; as suggested in the first revised draft and also referred to in the Committee&#8217;s 
statement of May 2007 (E/C.12/2007/1), while several others, including non-governmental 
organizations, preferred deleting the reference to a &#8220;margin of appreciation&#8221;. Portugal feared that 
it would undermine the core objective of the protocol and increase the burden of proof on 
victims; Egypt (on behalf of the African Group) objected because it could undermine State&#8217;s 
sovereignty. Some delegates requested further clarification of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; and &#8220;margin of 
appreciation&#8221;. The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights cautioned against selectively adopting 
jurisprudential principles from the European system while ignoring those from other regional 
systems. 
</p>
<p>172. Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, Peru and Poland expressed support for 
the proposal of Liechtenstein from the first part of the session. 
</p>
<p>173. Canada proposed revising the paragraph so that it would include the wording &#8220;whether 
steps were reasonable, in conformity with Part II of the Covenant&#8221; and &#8220;appropriate policy 
measures and the optimum use of its resources in accordance with its domestic priorities, 
provided it does so in a manner consistent with its obligations under the Covenant&#8221;. Australia, 
Denmark and Ireland supported these amendments. 
</p>
<p>174. Canada and China found the wording &#8220;where relevant&#8221; unclear. The Chairperson noted 
that States had obligations to implement the Covenant immediately, such as in application of the 
right to non-discrimination. China noted that action taken to eliminate existing discrimination 
required financial and other resources. China also pointed out that article 2, paragraph 1 of the 
Covenant provides for &#8220;the rights recognized in the present Covenant&#8221; without any distinction 
between them. 
</p>
<p>175. Delegates discussed the proposal by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to add a 
paragraph 5. Several delegations preferred not to add a paragraph specifically related to ILO, 
since paragraph 3 already refers to information from all specialized agencies. ILO withdrew its 
proposal on its understanding that it would be accommodated in the practice of the Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 bis 
</b></p>
<p>176. After some discussion, the Working Group agreed to use language from article 7, 
paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women. Ethiopia suggested moving paragraph 1 to article 8, 
and dealing with paragraphs 2 and 3 in the rules of procedure. Canada noted that such matters 
could be dealt with in the rules of procedure, and suggested deleting paragraphs 2 and 3. The 
Netherlands and New Zealand requested adding &#8220;views on the admissibility&#8221; rather than only 
referring to &#8220;views on the merits&#8221;. China suggested using wording from paragraph 1, article 7 of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women to read &#8220;views on the communications and recommendations&#8221;. Mexico noted 
that paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article were also useful here. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p>177. The Russian Federation reiterated its reservations about this article and its possible 
application, asking that the entire article be put in brackets, and to defer a final decision on it. 
</p>
<p>178. The United Kingdom proposed similar admissibility criteria in paragraph (<i>c</i>) as those in 
article 4, paragraph 1, and favoured deletion of &#8220;invoked&#8221; and &#8220;in the matter&#8221; and &#8220;or unlikely to 
bring effective relief&#8221; at the end of the first sentence. Bangladesh and India preferred keeping the 
word &#8220;invoked&#8221; to ensure consistency with other instruments. 
</p>
<p><b>Articles 10, 11 and 11 bis 
</b></p>
<p>179. Several delegations expressed similar concerns as those discussed during the first part of 
the session. Egypt requested further clarification on the fact that the inter-State procedure was an 
opt-in clause while the inquiry procedure was an opt-out provision. The Russian Federation 
noted that the legal basis for having both approaches in this particular instrument was unclear, 
and suggested a similar approach to both procedures. Canada suggested that articles 2, 
paragraph 1, and 10 should have the same scope and refer to the &#8220;rights set forth in Part III read 
in conjunction with Part II. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 12 
</b></p>
<p>180. The Working Group accepted the text as drafted. 
</p>
<p><b>Articles 13 and 14 
</b></p>
<p>181. The Chairperson mentioned her proposal for an additional paragraph in article 13 and the 
deletion of article 14. 
</p>
<p>182. Several States agreed to merge articles 13 and 14. Some States expressed concern about 
the purpose and administration of a trust fund and requested the insertion of wording on its 
voluntary nature, as in article 26, paragraph 2 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture. Argentina, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland stated that they could 
accept most of paragraph 3. Germany, while being sceptical about the establishment of a fund as 
such, welcomed the reference to &#8220;a separate project within an existing trust fund&#8221;. 
</p><p>183. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), 
Japan and Sweden did not favour merging articles 13 and 14. Australia, Canada, Sweden and the 
United Kingdom stated that a fund should not be created by means of the optional protocol. 
Belgium, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States considered that the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>Committee was not the appropriate body to administer the fund, while Egypt (on behalf of the 
African Group) clarified that the fund would not be administered by the Committee alone. 
</p>
<p>184. With regard to paragraph 3, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Germany, India, 
Sweden and Switzerland indicated their support for providing assistance to victims. Bangladesh 
and Sweden suggested replacing &#8220;legal aid&#8221; with &#8220;aid&#8221; or &#8220;assistance&#8221;. Belgium and Switzerland 
proposed replacing &#8220;alleged victim&#8221; with &#8220;victim or victims of alleged violations&#8221;. Australia 
favoured retaining &#8220;alleged victim&#8221;. Canada and France stated that the fund should not be used 
to compensate victims of violations, a duty of the State party. Belgium, Canada and the 
United States did not favour making assistance to victim(s) dependent on &#8220;the consent of the 
State party concerned&#8221;, while India favoured this clause. 
</p>
<p>185. Canada, China, Egypt and the United States expressed concerns at a legal aid fund that had 
no precedent in other instruments. The United States considered that the Committee was not in a 
position to fund complaints that it would be reviewing, while Switzerland disagreed. 
</p>
<p>186. Australia, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States 
cautioned against the wording &#8220;technical assistance to Governments&#8221; being understood as yet 
another development fund. The United Kingdom and India argued that the fund could only be 
linked to the implementation of the optional protocol, in line with article 7 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict. Germany proposed replacing the last part of paragraph 3 with &#8220;and to provide expert 
and technical assistance to States parties to develop new and to further contribute to existing 
national human rights capacities in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, as the 
Committee may consider appropriate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>187. Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), supported by Bangladesh and the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, proposed replacing &#8220;separate project within an existing Trust Fund of the OHCHR&#8221; with 
&#8220;mechanism&#8221; and amending the objectives to read: &#8220;(a) to provide expert and technical 
assistance to Governments for the implementation of the rights recognized in the Covenant; (b) 
to grant aid to a victim of a violation, after having examined the communication and made a 
determination on the merits, in connection with the presentation of the case&#8221;. Belgium and 
Switzerland preferred the deletion of &#8220;as the Committee may consider appropriate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>188. Belgium, Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Senegal and Switzerland considered that legal aid should be available to potential victims once a 
communication had been declared admissible. 
</p>
<p>189. Liechtenstein cautioned against a two-class system between States parties to the protocol 
and States parties to the Covenant only in terms of receiving assistance from the fund. CETIM 
underlined the importance of international assistance and cooperation in the implementation of 
the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>190. The Russian Federation pointed out that a reference to technical assistance was already 
reflected in article 13, paragraph 2. Liechtenstein, in support of that argument, emphasized the 
need to clarify the relationship between paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, suggested deleting paragraph 3 
and adding the following sentence at the end of paragraph 1: &#8220;For the provision of such technical 
advice or assistance by the OHCHR, a separate project, within an existing Trust Fund, shall be </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>established in accordance with the relevant procedures of the General Assembly, to be 
administered in accordance with the financial regulations and rules of the United Nations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>191. The Netherlands and New Zealand proposed replacing &#8220;legal aid&#8221; and &#8220;presentation of 
the case&#8221; with &#8220;assistance&#8221; and &#8220;submissions of communication&#8221; respectively. The 
Russian Federation also preferred a general reference, avoiding the term &#8220;legal aid&#8221;. Egypt 
(on behalf of the African Group) did not favour the use of &#8220;legal aid&#8221; and &#8220;case&#8221;, and favoured 
the deletion of all reference to assistance to individuals. Some delegations preferred referring to 
&#8220;States parties&#8221; rather than to &#8220;Governments&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>192. With regard to the beneficiaries of the fund, the Russian Federation supported granting 
assistance to both victims and States. Poland supported technical assistance to Governments but 
was concerned about granting legal aid to individuals without clear eligibility criteria. Senegal 
emphasized the importance of ensuring compensation for the victims and for supporting States in 
building capacity to implement their obligations. 
</p>
<p>193. New Zealand considered linking the provision of assistance to victims to a determination 
of admissibility, and suggested inserting &#8220;assistance in preparation of the submission of the 
communication&#8221; instead of &#8220;presentation of the case&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>194. The Netherlands favoured omitting &#8220;alleged&#8221; and suggested reference to &#8220;author&#8221; or 
&#8220;individuals or groups of individuals claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the rights set 
forth in the Covenant&#8221;. Argentina and the Russian Federation supported the retention of 
&#8220;alleged&#8221;. The Russian Federation added that assistance would be provided only when a 
violation had been found by the Committee. 
</p>
<p>195. In relation to the administration of the fund, the Russian Federation suggested inserting &#8220;as 
the Committee may recommend appropriate&#8221; to clarify (a) that the provision of assistance is not 
an automatic procedure, and (b) that a final decision in this regard should be made by the 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>196. A suggestion was made to use language from article 7, paragraph 2 of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children 
in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>197. The Russian Federation considered that article 13, paragraph 4 was not necessary. 
</p>
<p>198. CETIM pointed out that concerns could be solved by applying the criteria adopted by the 
Committee to distinguish States&#8217; inability and lack of political will and by granting assistance to 
victims only in cases where complaints had been declared admissible. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 15

<p>199. The Working Group approved the article as drafted. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 16

<p><b>Article 17

<p>201. The Working Group approved the deletion of article 17, after some discussion. Canada 
supported retention of this article and provided alternative text, which would ensure an 
appropriate quorum in the Committee when considering communications.

<p>202. Article 18 was approved as drafted.

<p>203. Article 19 was approved as modified, deleting &#8220;own&#8221; in paragraph 2 and basing it on the

<p>204. The Working Group approved the deletion of this article.

<p><b>VI.  CLOSURE OF PROCEEDINGS AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT 
</b></p>
<p>211. At the end of the discussion, the Chairperson noted that there was no objection to the 
transmission of the text to the Human Rights Council for its consideration and that the statements 
made by delegations would be reflected in the report. The Working Group had thus completed its 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>212. The text of the draft optional protocol transmitted by the Working Group to the Council is 
contained in annex I. 
</p>
<p>213. In their closing statements, delegations were unanimous in commending the dedicated 
efforts of the Chairperson and the Working Group as a collective to seek consensus solutions. 
</p>
<p>214. Algeria stated that the exclusion of Part I of the Covenant from article 2 of the optional 
protocol risked undermining the Covenant, and reserved its right to address this issue in the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>215. Chile welcomed the consensus reached on article 2. The fact that this article did not make 
any distinction between economic, social and cultural rights as such was consistent with the 
Covenant, notably article 3 and article 5, paragraph 1, and with resolutions of the Council, in 
which it reiterated the need to treat all human rights in an equal manner and with the same 
emphasis. 
</p>
<p>216. Uruguay noted that it would have preferred a protocol with a broader focus. 
</p>
<p>217. The United States noted that it continued to have concerns about a number of provisions 
and remained sceptical of the need for an optional protocol. It reserved its position on the text 
overall. While equally important, economic, social and cultural rights were, in a legal sense, 
fundamentally different. They were to be progressively realized in accordance with available 
resources and were, on their face, difficult to adjudicate, as reflected in the absence of provisions 
on remedies and enforcement in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>218. India considered that the draft optional protocol was a good compromise text which had 
met the concerns of all parties and noted that it would take the draft for further examination with 
relevant Government bodies. 
</p>
<p>219. The Russian Federation stated that the draft reflected a compromise between different 
approaches to implementing economic, social and cultural rights. As an integral part of the 
system of international law, the protocol would allow States parties to make reservations 
compatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. The Committee would not have the 
competence to assess such compatibility, but should rather focus on effectively fulfilling its new 
role in cooperation with States parties. 
</p>
<p>220. Egypt (on behalf of the African group) expressed its overall satisfaction with the text, 
welcomed the inclusion of the modest but potentially beneficial provision on a trust fund and the 
provisions on interim and protection measures, inquiry procedure and friendly settlement. The 
African Group regretted that the text did not encompass all parts of the Covenant, but understood 
that this exclusion had no bearing or implication for the centrality accorded to the right to 
self-determination in the Covenant or under international human rights law in general. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>221. Egypt (in a national capacity) fully welcomed and supported the transmission of the text to 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>222. Morocco considered that the text met the concerns of delegations, provided the best 
possible compromise, and that the Council should adopt the protocol as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>223. Denmark reserved its final position on the draft and stated that the decision to forward the 
draft to the Council represented neither an agreement on the text as a whole nor support for all 
elements in it. Denmark remained sceptical of an individual complaint mechanism. The nature 
and progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights made them insufficiently 
justiciable and less suited for such a mechanism, which could potentially interfere, unwarranted, 
with national policy measures. 
</p>
<p>224. The Netherlands was satisfied that several of its concerns had been accommodated and that 
useful compromise solutions had been found in some instances. Given that its overriding 
interest - the possibility to opt out from the right of complaint with regard to certain 
provisions - had not been accommodated, it reserved its final position on the draft. 
</p>
<p>225. Japan noted that it was less than satisfied with the draft, as arguments on some articles to 
which it attached importance had not been settled and its proposals not reflected. 
</p>
<p>226. Canada remained concerned about establishing a communications procedure for economic, 
social and cultural rights, given their different nature as progressively realizable. Some Covenant 
rights, set out in broad and vague terms, could not be easily subjected to quasi-judicial 
assessment. It regretted the rejection of an &#224; la carte approach, which would have facilitated 
broader acceptance of the procedure. It was not fully satisfied with the language intended to 
ensure appropriate deference to sovereign State prerogatives for resource allocations and 
policymaking. It did not support the inclusion of a trust fund, was concerned that the inclusion of 
additional mechanisms would overburden the Committee and duplicate existing mechanisms, 
emphasized the non-binding character of interim measures, and noted that the Committee should 
only consider documentation from regional human rights systems concerning instruments 
ratified by a State party. 
</p>
<p>227. Spain would have liked a higher threshold for protection of Covenant rights, but 
recognized that the text reflected a consensus and was a significant step towards the effective 
protection of these rights. It addressed an historic inequality between artificially created 
categories of rights. 
</p>
<p>228. Poland was not fully satisfied with the text and reserved its position with a view to further 
deliberations in the Council. It noted that Poland would not be bound by case law developed 
under the protocol if it did not ratify this instrument; Part II of the Covenant should be applied in 
line with article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; article 8, paragraph 4 of 
the protocol would be interpreted in the light of the whole text of article 2, paragraph 1 of the 
Covenant; as to the material scope of application, Part II of the Covenant could only be invoked 
in conjunction with the rights in Part III; the application of interim measures would be left to the 
discretion of the State party and the non-application of an interim measure would not imply a 
violation of the protocol&#8217;s provisions; and article 9 excluded the possibility of recommending</p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>specific corrective measures or reparation. It regretted the absence of a provision on the 
participation of social partners and non-governmental organizations in the procedure, and 
reserved the right to make further comments at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>229. Greece noted that the text contained positive elements but did not fully meet all its 
concerns. It would have preferred more flexibility concerning its scope and explicit language 
on a broad margin of appreciation. It considered requests for interim measures to be of a 
non-binding nature. 
</p>
<p>230. Norway regretted that article 5 did not underline the non-legally binding character of 
requests for interim measures, and that article 8, paragraph 4 did not clarify the State&#8217;s broad 
margin of appreciation. It reserved its position on the draft optional protocol as a whole. 
</p>
<p>231. Austria reiterated that the protocol needed to allow for national specificities to be taken 
into account in the implementation of the Covenant. The final text contained important language 
to guide the work of the Committee and to allow it to take into account the variety of means and 
choices available to States in implementing their obligations under the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>232. Guatemala considered the final draft to be the best possible text. 
</p>
<p>233. Finland reiterated its full support for an optional protocol covering all rights, contained in 
the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>234. The Republic of Korea stated that the draft did not fully succeed in reflecting the distinct 
nature of economic, social and cultural rights, nor fully accommodate the various views and 
concerns about how the protocol could be operationalized. 
</p>
<p>235. Sweden remained unconvinced that an optional protocol was the most effective way of 
promoting economic, social and cultural rights. It regretted that some of its key positions, 
including criteria for admissibility, were not reflected in the draft and remained sceptical about 
the provision on the establishment of a trust fund. It was concerned by the haste in which the 
negotiations had been conducted and noted that transmission of the text to the Council did not 
mean general acceptance of the draft protocol. 
</p>
<p>236. Belgium stated that the optional protocol filled a gap in the international human rights 
system. It could accept article 4, stressing the need for a strict respect for the condition &#8220;if 
necessary&#8221;, and article 8, paragraph 4, noting that the concept of &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; did not in any 
way imply a new interpretation of the Covenant. Belgium regretted the choice of an opt-in 
approach in article 11, having preferred the opt-out option. In a spirit of compromise, it could 
accept the establishment of a trust fund, noting that it should be managed by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>237. Turkey supported an opt-out approach and expressed disappointment at the deletion of 
article 2, paragraph 2, noting the distinct nature of economic, social and cultural rights 
characterized by the principle of progressive implementation. 
</p>
<p>238. New Zealand noted how all delegations had worked in a cooperative spirit and had made 
compromises. It reserved its position on the text as a whole. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>239. Switzerland reiterated its view that most obligations under the Covenant were of a 
programmatic nature and were not justiciable within its legal order. It could only support an &#224; la 
carte approach, which would allow more States to ratify the protocol. Switzerland was satisfied 
that article 5 did not refer to the voluntary nature of interim measures. It regretted the opt-in 
approach in articles 10 and 11, having preferred the opt-out option. It expressed reservations 
about the reference to a trust fund in article 14, noting the risk of duplicating existing 
development funds. 
</p>
<p>240. Germany could agree to the draft only on a preliminary basis, pending further examination. 
It understood that the word &#8220;may&#8221; in article 4 implied that it was the prerogative of the 
Committee to decide whether it would make use of this provision, and that article 8, paragraph 4 
did not diminish the scope of examination or protection of victims. Germany accepted the wish 
of the majority to establish a trust fund in article 14, paragraph 3. It did not see a real need for 
such fund, regretted the absence of a victims-related component and would not accept the trust 
fund being used to reward those violating their obligations. It interpreted the term &#8220;States 
parties&#8221; as recipients under article 14, paragraph 3, in a broad sense, covering Governments, 
non-governmental organizations and other civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>241. Mexico welcomed the final draft, noting that the text reflected a compromise. It would 
have preferred not to include article 4 in the protocol and stated that article 8, paragraph 4 should 
be interpreted in line with the provisions of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>242. Croatia noted that not all delegates could be fully satisfied with the text as it reflected a 
compromise. It looked forward to the adoption of the protocol by the Council and the 
General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>243.  Brazil welcomed the draft and reiterated that the protocol should cover all rights of the 
Covenant. An &#224; la carte approach would have been a retrogression, not in keeping with other 
United Nations procedures and the principles of universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness 
of all human rights. It expected that it would be possible to adopt the protocol in 2008. 
</p>
<p>244. Senegal noted the objectives of the optional protocol were to provide relief to victims and 
to ensure freedom from poverty. The adoption of the protocol was only the first step. What was 
needed now was its widest possible ratification. 
</p>
<p>245. Pakistan expressed reservations to the exclusion of Part I of the Covenant, noting that it did 
not favour artificial distinctions between Covenant rights. If specificity had led to a deadlock, 
then generality might be a way out; article 2 should either be kept general or specify all parts of 
the Covenant. Pakistan reiterated that the draft did not enjoy the support of all States. It would 
remain constructively engaged in negotiation prior to the session of the Council to find a solution 
acceptable to all. 
</p>
<p>246. The United Kingdom reserved its position on the draft. It remained sceptical about 
the practical benefits of the protocol, considering that economic, social and cultural rights did not 
lend themselves to adjudication in the same way as civil and political rights. It favoured</p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>an &#224; la carte approach, and questioned whether the comprehensive approach was the best way to 
ensure an effective mechanism which would be ratified by the widest number of States. It 
understood that &#8220;all available domestic remedies&#8221;, under article 3, paragraph 1 included judicial, 
administrative and any other remedies. It noted that the reasonableness test in examining rights 
contained in Part III read in conjunction with Part II of the Covenant should be applied so as not 
to second-guess a State&#8217;s reasonable policy choices, including by applying similar considerations 
as those in the Committee&#8217;s statement of  May 2007. It did not support the establishment of a 
trust fund. 
</p>
<p>247. South Africa aligned itself with the statement of Egypt (on behalf of the African Group), 
welcoming the compromise text. 
</p>
<p>248. China welcomed the decision to transmit the text to the Council. Though it was not 
entirely satisfied with some articles, it believed that the consensus text was the best outcome the 
Working Group could expect at this stage of its work. It reserved its final decision on the text as 
a whole pending thorough study of the draft by relevant Government departments. 
</p>
<p>249. Bolivia reiterated its support for the optional protocol, but regretted that article 2 only 
covered Parts II and III of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>250. Indonesia noted that the draft was a compromise that did not reflect all interests and views; 
however, States should look at it positively. It emphasized the importance of a balanced 
approach between economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. It had 
transmitted the text to its capital for review and reserved its right to comment further on the draft 
at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>251. The Syrian Arab Republic requested that a comprehensive approach encompassing all 
rights, including articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Covenant, be incorporated into article 2 of the protocol, 
noting that the existing formula was selective and unhelpful to the realization of equal and 
universal treatment of all rights. 
</p>
<p>252. The Islamic Republic of Iran stated that the protocol provided an opportunity to reiterate 
the equal status of all human rights. It noted that constructive approaches, such as enhancement 
of international cooperation in conformity with article 1, paragraph 2 of the Covenant and the 
universality of human rights coupled with cultural diversity should be highlighted more 
appropriately. The scope of the protocol should cover all Covenant rights consistent with other 
human rights instruments. It reserved its right to comment further on the draft at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>253. France stated that the approved text constituted a balanced compromise which covered all 
the rights set forth in the Covenant and met the concerns of States. 
</p>
<p>254. The NGO Coalition noted, inter alia, that the intent of article 2 should be that admissible 
communications may be considered in the light of all parts of the Covenant, including Part 1;</p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>that article 4 should not impose a new burden of proof on the author of a communication and that 
&#8220;clear disadvantage&#8221; should be interpreted taking into account the particular circumstances of 
indigenous people, women, persons with disabilities and other groups; and that article 8, 
paragraph 4 should be read consistently with the fact that many obligations under the Covenant 
are not subject to progressive realization. Nord-Sud XXI regretted the exclusion of the right to 
self-determination, which would exclude communications concerning rights to land and 
resources. 
</p>
<p>255. On 4 April 2008, the Working Group adopted the report of its fifth session ad referendum. </p>

<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>DRAFT OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT 
ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The States Parties to the present Protocol</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the 
United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all 
members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
 <i>Noting</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings 
are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and 
freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants 
on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and 
want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that each State Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (hereinafter referred to as the Covenant) undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in order further to achieve the purposes of the Covenant and the 
implementation of its provisions, it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out the functions 
provided for in the present Protocol, 
</p>
<p> <i>Have agreed</i> as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the Covenant that becomes a Party to the present Protocol recognizes the 
competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications as provided for by the 
provisions of the present Protocol. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7* 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>2. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State Party to the 
Covenant which is not a Party to the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p> Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, 
under the jurisdiction of a State Party, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the rights 
set forth in Parts II and III of the Covenant by that State Party. Where a communication is 
submitted on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, this shall be with their consent 
unless the author can justify acting on their behalf without such consent.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall not consider a communication unless it has ascertained that all 
available domestic remedies have been exhausted. This shall not be the rule where the 
application of such remedies is unreasonably prolonged. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall declare a communication inadmissible when: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic remedies, except 
in cases where the author can demonstrate that it had not been possible to submit the 
communication within that time limit; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into 
force of the present Protocol for the State Party concerned unless those facts continued after that 
date; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is 
being examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is incompatible with the provisions of the Covenant; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is manifestly ill-founded, not sufficiently substantiated or exclusively based on 
reports disseminated by mass media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It is an abuse of the right to submit a communication; or when 
 (<i>g</i>) It is anonymous or not in writing. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications not revealing a clear disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p> The Committee may, if necessary, decline to consider a communication where it does not 
reveal that the author has suffered a clear disadvantage, unless the Committee considers that the 
communication raises a serious issue of general importance. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the merits 
has been reached, the Committee may transmit to the State Party concerned for its urgent 
consideration a request that the State Party take such interim measures as may be necessary in 
exceptional circumstances to avoid possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the 
alleged violations. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present article, this 
does not imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to the 
State Party concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it under the 
present Protocol confidentially to the attention of the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. Within six months, the receiving State Party shall submit to the Committee written 
explanations or statements clarifying the matter and the remedy, if any, that may have been 
provided by that State Party. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a view 
to reaching a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of the respect for the obligations set 
forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>2. An agreement on a friendly settlement closes consideration of the communication under 
the present Protocol. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/7*

<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Examination of communications

<p>2. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the 
present Protocol. 
</p>
<p>3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may consult, 
as appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations bodies, specialized 
agencies, funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other international organizations, including 
from regional human rights systems, and any observations or comments by the State Party 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>4. When examining communications under the present Protocol, the Committee shall 
consider the reasonableness of the steps taken by the State Party in accordance with Part II of the 
Covenant. In doing so, the Committee shall bear in mind that the State Party may adopt a range 
of possible policy measures for the implementation of the rights set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>

communication, together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties concerned. 
</p>

its recommendations, if any, and shall submit to the Committee, within six months, a written 
response, including information on any action taken in the light of the views and 
recommendations of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>3.  The Committee may invite the State Party to submit further information about any 
measures the State Party has taken in response to its views or recommendations, if any, 
including as deemed appropriate by the Committee, in the State party&#8217;s subsequent reports under 
articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 10 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inter-State communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the present Protocol may at any time declare under this article that it 
recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications to the 
effect that a State Party claims that another State Party is not fulfilling its obligations under</p>

<p>A/HRC/8/7* 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>the Covenant. Communications under this article may be received and considered only if 
submitted by a State Party that has made a declaration recognizing in regard to itself the

concerns a State Party which has not made such a declaration. Communications received under

Within three months after the receipt of the communication the receiving State shall afford the 
State that sent the communication an explanation, or any other statement in writing clarifying the 
matter which should include, to the extent possible and pertinent, reference to domestic 
procedures and remedies taken, pending or available in the matter; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) If the matter is not settled to the satisfaction of both States Parties concerned within 
six months after the receipt by the receiving State of the initial communication, either State shall 
have the right to refer the matter to the Committee, by notice given to the Committee and to the 
other State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The Committee shall deal with a matter referred to it only after it has ascertained that 
all available domestic remedies have been invoked and exhausted in the matter. This shall not be 
the rule where the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (<i>c</i>) of the present paragraph the Committee

reached, the Committee shall confine its report to a brief statement of the facts 
and of the solution reached; </p>

</p>
<p>2. A declaration under paragraph 1 of the present article shall be deposited by the 
States Parties with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit copies 
thereof to the other States Parties. A declaration may be withdrawn at any time by notification to 
the Secretary-General. Such a withdrawal shall not prejudice the consideration of any matter that 
is the subject of a communication already transmitted under the present article; no further

notification of withdrawal of the declaration has been received by the Secretary-General, unless 
the State Party concerned has made a new declaration.

</p>
<p>2. The Committee may also bring to the attention of such bodies, with the consent of the 
State Party concerned, any matter arising out of communications considered under the present
