<p><i>Summary

<p> This thematic report addresses the topic of gender-related killings of women. 
Rather than a new form of violence, gender-related killings are the extreme 
manifestation of existing forms of violence against women. Such killings are not isolated 
incidents that arise suddenly and unexpectedly, but represent the ultimate act of violence 
which is experienced in a continuum of violence. Women subjected to continuous 
violence and living under conditions of gender-based discrimination and threat are 
always on &#8213;death row, always in fear of execution&#8214;.  
 Globally, the prevalence of different manifestations of gender-related killings is 
reaching alarming proportions. Culturally and socially embedded, these manifestations 
continue to be accepted, tolerated or justified&#8212;with impunity as the norm. States&#8216; 
responsibility to act with due diligence in the promotion and protection of women&#8216;s 
rights is largely lacking as regards the killing of women.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 16/7, is 
the third thematic report submitted to the Council by the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, since her appointment in 
June 2009. Chapter II summarizes the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s activities since her previous 
report to the Council up until 20 March 2012. Chapters III to V address the topic of gender-
related killings of women.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur requested invitations to visit 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, India and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). Earlier 
requests for country visits were also reiterated to the Governments of Bangladesh, Nepal, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Jordan, from 11 to 24 November 2011 (see 
A/HRC/20/16/Add.1); Italy, from 15 to 26 January 2012 (A/HRC/20/16/Add.2); and 
Somalia, from 9 to 16 December 2011 (A/HRC/20/16/Add.3). In addition, she visited 
Solomon Islands, from 12 to 16 March 2012, and Papua New Guinea, from 18 to 26 March 
</p><p>2012. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank these Governments for having responded 
positively to her requests for a visit and urges the Governments that have not yet done so to 
provide a favourable response.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and press releases  
</b></p>
<p>4. The communications sent to Governments during the reporting period (see the joint 
communications report, A/HRC/20/30) concerned a wide array of issues that reflect a 
pattern of inequality and discrimination relating to violence against women, its causes and 
consequences. These included: arbitrary detention; torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment; summary and extrajudicial executions; sexual violence, including 
rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation; and other forms of violence grounded in 
discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur issued numerous press statements, either individually or 
jointly with other mandate holders.  
</p>
<p><b> C. General Assembly and Commission on the Status of Women  
</b></p>
<p>6. In October 2011, the Special Rapporteur presented her first written report to the 
General Assembly (A/66/215). It contained an overview of the mandate&#8216;s work and main 
findings, and the challenges that continue to be identified. 
</p>
<p>7. In the report, the Special Rapporteur described how the mandate has analysed 
violence against women in four main spheres: violence in the family; violence in the 
community; violence that is perpetrated or condoned by the State; and violence that occurs 
in the transnational sphere. She then analysed States&#8216; obligations, under international 
human rights law, to prevent and respond to all acts of violence against women.  </p>


<p>8. The Special Rapporteur argued that States&#8216; efforts to comply with their due 
diligence obligation must address the structural causes that lead to violence against women. 
In doing so, States should consider the multiple forms of violence suffered by women and 
the different types of discrimination they encounter, in order to adopt multifaceted 
strategies to effectively prevent and combat this violence. She concluded the report by 
presenting a proposal for a holistic approach to understanding and addressing 
discrimination and violence against women.   
</p>
<p>9. On 29 February 2012, the Special Rapporteur submitted a written statement to the 
Commission on the Status of Women, in which she highlighted the need to ensure the 
social, cultural, and economic participation and empowerment of rural women.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur participated in consultations, held in Brussels in June 2011, 
with European civil society organizations, including representatives of European 
observatories on violence against women.  
</p>
<p>11. On 12 October 2011, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert group meeting in 
New York to inform her thematic report on gender-related killings of women. The meeting 
brought together 25 experts from academia, civil society organizations and United Nations 
agencies and bodies with technical and practical expertise on and experience in working on 
violence against women.  
</p>
<p>12. On 18 July, 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in a general discussion on the 
protection of women&#8216;s human rights in conflict and post-conflict which was organized in 
New York by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The 
Special Rapporteur also held a bilateral meeting with the Committee with a view to 
strengthening partnerships between the two mandates. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur also participated as main speaker in numerous international 
conferences including, among others, the South Asian conference entitled &#8213;Reclaiming 
Space&#8212;from Victimhood to Agency: State and Civil Society Responses to Violence 
against Women&#8214;, held in Pakistan in September 2011; the Women Building Peace 
conference, held in Barcelona in October 2011; and the Strengthening Girls&#8216; Rights 
Worldwide conference, held in Berlin in October 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Gender-related killings of women 
</b></p>
<p>14. In this report, the Special Rapporteur addresses the topic of gender-related killings 
of women whether they occur in the family or the community or are perpetrated or 
condoned by the State. Globally, the prevalence of different manifestations of such killings 
is increasing, and a lack of accountability for such crimes is the norm. Terms such as 
femicide, feminicide, honour killings and crimes of passion, among others, have been used 
to define such killings. 
</p>
<p>15. Rather than a new form of violence, gender-related killings are the extreme 
manifestation of existing forms of violence against women. Such killings are not isolated 
incidents that arise suddenly and unexpectedly, but are rather the ultimate act of violence 
which is experienced in a continuum of violence. Women subjected to continuous violence 
and living under conditions of gender-based discrimination and threat are always on &#8213;death </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>row, always in fear of execution&#8214;.1 This results in the inability to live, and is a major part of 
the death process when the lethal act finally occurs.2 Rather than serving isolated or 
individual purposes, such violence follows institutional logic &#8213;to delineate and sustain 
hierarchical social relations of race, gender, sexuality and class and, thereby, to perpetuate 
the inequality of marginalized communities&#8214;.3 
</p>
<p>16. The killings can be active or direct, with defined perpetrators, but they can also be 
passive or indirect. The direct category includes: killings as a result of intimate-partner 
violence; sorcery/witchcraft-related killings; honour-related killings; armed conflict-related 
killings; dowry-related killings; gender identity- and sexual orientation-related killings; and 
ethnic- and indigenous identity-related killings. The indirect category includes: deaths due 
to poorly conducted or clandestine abortions; maternal mortality; deaths from harmful 
practices; deaths linked to human trafficking, drug dealing, organized crime and gang-
related activities; the death of girls or women from simple neglect, through starvation or ill-
treatment; and deliberate acts or omissions by the State. 
</p>
<p>17. The discrimination and violence that is reflected in gender-related killings of women 
can be understood as multiple concentric circles, each intersecting with the other. These 
circles include structural, institutional, interpersonal and individual factors. The structural 
factors include macrolevel social, economic and political systems; institutional factors 
include formal and informal social networks and institutions; interpersonal factors include 
personal relationships between partners, among family members and within the community; 
and individual factors include personality and individual capacities to respond to violence.4 
</p>
<p>18. Thus an understanding of gender-related killings requires taking into account the 
political, social and economic contexts within which it takes place, including the responses 
of men to women&#8216;s empowerment; the political, legal and societal reaction to such killings; 
</p>
<p>the principle of the continuum of violence; and patterns of structural discrimination and 
inequality that continue to form part of the reality of women&#8216;s lives. It is also important to 
disaggregate data by factors such as race, ethnicity, education, sexual orientation and 
economic status, among others, to establish systemic patterns that exacerbate existing 
vulnerabilities.5 
</p>
<p>19. Impunity for the killings of women has become a global concern. As noted by the 
Secretary General: &#8213;Impunity for violence against women compounds the effects of such 
</p>
<p>violence as a mechanism of control. When the State fails to hold the perpetrators 
accountable, impunity not only intensifies the subordination and powerlessness of the 
targets of violence, but also sends a message to society that male violence against women is 
both acceptable and inevitable. As a result, patterns of violent behaviour are normalized&#8214;.6

<p><b> A. Conceptual evolution of terms 
</b></p>
<p>20. The term femicide has been used since the beginning of the nineteenth century to 
describe the killings of women.7 It was proposed as an alternative to the gender-neutral 
term of homicide, a term which overlooks the realities of inequality, oppression and 
systematic violence against women. It reappeared in the 1970s as part of the struggle of the 
feminist movement to name their own experiences and create a form of resistance to this 
fatal form of violence.8 
</p>
<p>21. Femicide was first defined as &#8213;the murders of women by men motivated by hatred, 
contempt, pleasure or a sense of ownership of women&#8214;.9 Subsequently, it was defined as 
&#8213;the misogynist killing of women by men&#8214;.10 The definition was expanded to go beyond 
that of misogynist killings, to all forms of sexist killings, including those killings by men 
motivated by the socially constructed right to do so, their superiority over females, pleasure 
or sadistic desires towards women, or the assumption of ownership over women.11  
</p>
<p>22. The term femicide has been used in the context of killings of women in the private 
and public spheres. In some European contexts, such killings are described as &#8213;crimes of 
passion&#8214;. In South Asia the term femicide has been adopted to encompass cultural practices 
in the region such as female infanticide, preadolescent mortality of girls and dowry-related 
deaths.12 The phenomena of so-called &#8213;honour killings&#8214; in the Middle East are rarely 
specifically labelled as acts of femicide, but some scholars have highlighted the femicidal 
nature of such acts and the impunity that accompanies such killings.13  
</p>
<p>23. A critical comparison, when addressing the killings of women, can be seen in the 
labelling in the West of femicides as &#8213;crimes of passion&#8214; stemming from individual violent 
behaviour; and in the East, as &#8213;crimes of honour&#8214; arising from cultural/religious practices 
and beliefs. This dichotomy exposes the simplistic, discriminatory and often stereotypical 
manner of construction, thereby obscuring the intersectionality of political, economic, 
social, cultural, and gender factors faced by all women around the world.14 
</p>
<p>24. With the alarming escalation of extreme forms of violence against women and girls 
in the 1990s, including in Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala,15 there was a pressing need 
to create and adopt new concepts and strategies to address the phenomenon. The 
disproportionate impact of economic, political and social factors in which the killings of 
women and girls were occurring, as well as the patriarchal nature of the societies that

<p>subordinated them, had to be taken into account. This violence has included torture, sexual 
abuse, deprivation of liberty, post mortem dismembering and the abandoning of bodies in 
public spaces by perpetrators (individual or groups), known or unknown to the victim. It is 
in this specific context that the concept of femicide scenarios was developed to determine 
the existence of a femicide crime, despite the difficulties of identifying motive, intention 
and perpetrators.16  
</p>
<p>25. Parallel to this conceptual discourse, Mexican feminists decided to translate the term 
femicide directly from its Latin origins as &#8213;<i>feminicidio</i>&#8214;.17 The femicide versus feminicide 
debate that has taken place in the Latin American context has not been resolved as yet. In 
the interim, feminists and academics have simply moved past the issue and adopted either 
or both terms, depending on the country, the context, the campaign or the lobbying target.18  
</p>
<p>26. Despite the increasing attention paid to the killings of women, there is little 
consistency in the normative frameworks used by researchers and service providers.19 Some 
scholars propose that a framework which includes the theoretical, political, operative and 
judicial aspects is useful, as it enables the recognition of multiple intersections of class, 
ethnicity, race, age, disability, migration, occupation, sexual orientation and gender 
identity, among others, in the killings of women.20  
</p>
<p>27. Other scholars advocate for the use of the notion of continuum as a tool of analysis 
where reinforcing linkages between different types of violence are complex, context-
specific, and interrelated. This tool integrates a multitude of causal factors at structural, 
institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels.21  
</p>
<p>28. It is argued that the term feminicide could be usefully adopted when holding 
governments to account at the international level, as it highlights the impunity and the 
institutional violence aspect of such crimes, which are caused by States&#8216; acts or omissions. 
</p>
<p>Institutional violence against women and their families is present in all aspects of States&#8216; 
responses to the killings of women. This can include: tolerance, the blaming of victims, 
lack of access to justice and effective remedies, negligence, threats, corruption and abuse 
by officials.22 Under this scenario, femicide/feminicide is a State crime tolerated by public 
institutions and officials, due to the inability to prevent, protect and guarantee the lives of 
women, who have consequently experienced multiple forms of discrimination and violence 
throughout their lifetime.23

<p><b> B. Global trends and manifestations  
</b></p>
<p>29. Globally, the prevalence of different manifestations of gender-related killings is 
reaching alarming proportions. Culturally and socially embedded, these manifestations 
continue to be accepted, tolerated or justified&#8212;with impunity as the norm. States&#8216; 
responsibility to act with due diligence in the promotion and protection of women&#8216;s rights, 
is largely lacking as regards the killing of women.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Killings of women as a result of intimate-partner violence 
</b></p>
<p>30. Intimate-partner violence is a problem affecting millions of women all over the 
world, and the overwhelming burden of partner violence is borne by women.24 Research on 
homicide resulting from intimate-partner violence reflects, almost without exception, that 
females are at greater risk than males, and that the majority of female homicide victims are 
killed by male intimate partners.25 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime studies 
also confirm that in many countries, intimate partner/family-related homicide is the major 
cause of female homicides, and that female homicide rates are much more likely to be 
driven by this type of violence than by the organized crime-related homicide typology that 
so affects men.26 
</p>
<p>31. As with all forms of intimate-partner violence, intimate-partner femicide is likely to 
be significantly underreported. Studies have shown that in some countries between 40 and 
70 per cent of female murder victims are killed by an intimate partner.27 In many countries 
the home is the place where a woman is most likely to be murdered, whereas men are more 
likely to be murdered in the street.28  
</p>
<p>32. One study indicates that there are approximately 3,500 intimate partner violence-
related deaths every year in Europe.29 Women account for more than 77 per cent of all 
victims of intimate partner/family-related homicide,30 with women between the ages of 35

rates of killings of women.32 For instance, in Spain there has been a 15.16 per cent increase 
in intimate partner femicides.33 In Italy, the total number of homicides (male and female 
murders) is decreasing; however, female homicides increased from 15.3 per cent during 
1992-1994 to 23.8 per cent during 2007-2008.34 According to data, in England and Wales 
in 2009/10 95 female victims of homicide were killed by a current or former partner, 
compared to 21 male victims of domestic homicide.35 
</p>
<p>33. Studies in Honduras and Costa Rica show that more than 60 per cent of femicides 
are perpetrated by an intimate partner or male family member.36 In Peru, 70 per cent of acts 
of femicide are carried out by a former or current intimate partner.37 In Mexico, 60 per cent 
of the women who were murdered by their intimate or ex-intimate partners had previously 
reported domestic violence to public authorities.38 In some cases in Nicaragua, while the 
crimes were perpetrated by persons unknown to the victim, the murders were planned and 
paid for by the partner or ex-partner.39 
</p>
<p>34. A 2004 national study on femicide in South Africa estimated that a woman is killed 
by her intimate partner every six hours.40 Of the cases in which relationship status could be 
established, 50.3 per cent of the women were killed by an intimate partner. Furthermore, a 
racial analysis indicates that women of colour are disproportionately affected by such 
killings. The rate for coloured women was 18.3 per 100,000 women; for African women it 
was 8.8, and for white women, 2.8.41  
</p>
<p>35. Statistics from the United States Department of Justice estimate that 40 per cent of 
female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 1993, increasing to 45 per 
cent in 2007. An estimated 6 per cent of male homicide victims were killed by an intimate 
partner in 1993, decreasing to 5 per cent in 2007.42 Also, where the relationship between 
the victim and the murderer could be determined, over 90 per cent of the women knew the

<p>male killer, with 60 per cent of the victims being wives, common-law wives, ex-wives, or 
girlfriends of the offenders.43 In 2008 firearms were the most common weapon used by men 
to murder women, with nearly two thirds of the women having been murdered by male 
intimate partners. Women also suffer &#8213;hostile gun displays&#8214; as a form of intimate partner 
violence, by which abusive partners threaten to use guns against their victims.44 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Killings of women due to accusations of sorcery/witchcraft  
</b></p>
<p>36. The killing of women accused of sorcery/witchcraft has been reported as a 
significant phenomenon in countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands.45 The pattern of 
violations includes violent murders, physical mutilation, displacement, kidnapping and 
disappearances of girls and women.46 In many countries where women are accused of 
sorcery/witchcraft, they are also subjected to exorcism ceremonies involving public beating 
and abuse by shamans or village elders.47 
</p>
<p>37. Although in the majority of the cases younger women are at higher risk of 
sorcery/witchcraft violence, a study has found that in some parts of Africa, older women 
are more vulnerable to sorcery-related femicide due to their economic dependence on 
others, or the property rights that they hold&#8212;and which younger members of the family 
want to inherit.48 Also, if women are perceived as dangerous and a threat to men, their 
labelling as witches, and consequently their destruction, is then seen as justified.49  
</p>
<p>38. A study in Zimbabwe found that of the 42 cases of femicide involving women older 
than 50, most of the women had been accused of witchcraft by male relatives prior to the 
killing.50 A study conducted in Ghana found that many poor, often elderly, women were 
accused of witchcraft and subsequently murdered by male relatives, or subjected to a range 
of physical, sexual and economic abuses.51  
</p>
<p>39. Women accused of witchcraft in Ghana are often violently driven from their 
communities and forced to take refuge in &#8213;witch camps&#8214;. Many widows are subjected to 
property-related violence, including violent evictions and loss of inheritance; and subjected 
to sexual abuse and harassment by relatives.52 In India, based on accusations of being a 
<i>dayan</i> (witch) or practising <i>banamathi</i> (witchcraft), physical violence is sometimes 
employed against Dalit women as a mechanism to take possession of their family lands

<p>and/or to keep them under economic subjugation, sexual exploitation, gender domination 
and control.53 In Nepal, particularly in the southern Terai region, elderly women, widows, 
destitute women and women of low caste are often targeted and deprived of their property 
rights or victimized to settle a personal vendetta.54 
</p>
<p>40. In Papua New Guinea, cases of torture and murder of an estimated 500 women 
accused of practising sorcery/witchcraft have been reported.55 Sorcery allegations against 
women have been increasing, in particular in the Highlands region.56 Suspected witches 
have been thrown from cliffs, tortured, dragged behind cars, burned or buried alive. Victims 
of such attacks and killings are mainly widows or other vulnerable elderly women who do 
not have children or relatives to protect them, women born out of wedlock or women who 
do not have any standing in the family.57 According to police reports, women are six times 
more likely than men to be accused of sorcery.58  
</p>
<p>41. Those who torture or kill are almost exclusively men, and are often related socially 
or biologically to the victim.59 Some accusations of sorcery are economically motivated, for 
the purpose of taking over land or possessions of those accused, or because payments have 
been made by third parties to name alleged sorcerers. According to expert reports, 
&#8213;increasingly, there is a perception that accusations of sorcery are a convenient disguise for 
</p>
<p>premeditated killings based more on a person&#8216;s dislike for another, jealousy, envy, greed, 
</p>
<p>rivalry or revenge and targeting women from the tribes or communities&#8214;.60  
</p>
<p>42. A study showing sentencing patterns in witchcraft-related cases in Southern Africa 
reveals that men accused of killings of women were sentenced to shorter periods of time, 
and often the charges were reduced to minor crimes. Overall, sentences were lenient when 
the perpetrator was the husband or a male relative of the woman killed. In Zambia, for 
instance, the average sentence was one to two years for charges of premeditated homicide 
of women.61

<p>43. As noted by the Secretary-General, certain cultural norms and beliefs are the causal 
factors of harmful practices resulting in violence against women, such as crimes committed 
in the name of &#8213;honour&#8214;.62 Honour killings have been characterized as being among the 
most severe manifestations of harmful practices.63 Murder to cleanse family honour is

<p>committed with high levels of impunity in many parts of the world.64 Although honour 
crimes have mainly occurred in the vast zone spreading from the Sahara to the Himalayas, 
it also occurs in other regions and countries with migrant communities.65   
</p>
<p>44. Honour killings remain underreported and underdocumented globally. The United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has estimated that 5,000 women globally are murdered 
by family members each year in honour killings.66 With widespread urbanization, the 
proliferation of media and the changing roles of women, it has become difficult for such 
crimes to go unnoticed, and such killings are becoming more visible.67 
</p>
<p>45. Honour killings take many forms, including direct murder; stoning; women and 
young girls being forced to commit suicide after public denunciations of their behaviour; 
and women being disfigured by acid burns, leading to death.68 Honour crimes are also 
linked to other forms of family violence, and are usually committed by male family 
members as a means of controlling women&#8216;s sexual choices and limiting their freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement. Punishment usually has a collective dimension, with the family as a whole 
believing it to be injured by a woman&#8216;s actual or perceived behaviour, and is often public in 
character. The visibility of the issue and the punishment also serves a social objective, 
namely, influencing the conduct of other women.69  
</p>
<p>46. Stoning is a method of capital punishment primarily used for crimes of adultery and 
other related offences linked to honour, of which women are disproportionately found 
guilty. This has resulted in 23 joint communications by mandate holders sent between 2004 
and 2011, in respect of more than 30 women sentenced to death by stoning. Other 
communications to governments relate to honour crimes committed by family members or 
to the action/inaction of the State with regard to flogging or death by hanging of women for 
suspected premarital sex, for adultery, for failing to prove rape, and for acts deemed 
incompatible with chastity.70  
</p>
<p>47. It is argued that in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland crimes 
in the name of honour are rooted in cultural traditions, not religious beliefs, and that &#8213;the 
conflation of the concepts of culture and religion contributes to the misunderstanding of 
such crimes, particularly in the context of Islamophobia and the &#8215;war on terror&#8216;&#8214;.71 
Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted 
that &#8213;a number of renowned Islamic leaders and scholars have publicly condemned this 
practice and clarified that it has no religious basis&#8214;.72

<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women has raised concerns about the 
phenomenon of self-immolation, reported in Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
whereby women and girls attempt suicide by setting themselves on fire because they feel 
they are &#8213;dishonouring&#8214; the family.73  
</p>
<p>49. United Nations treaty bodies have expressed concerns that honour-related crimes 
often go unreported, are rarely investigated and usually go unpunished, and that when they 
are punished the sentences are far less than those for equally violent crimes without the 
&#8213;honour&#8214; dimension.74 Reduced sentences are justified on the basis of the necessity of 
murdering such women, to defend the misconceived notion of family honour.75 
</p>
<p>50. In his report on working towards the elimination of crimes against women 
committed in the name of honour, the Secretary-General presented a series of 
recommendations in relation to the criminalization of such acts, and noted that those 
deliberately participating in, facilitating, encouraging or threatening women and girls in the 
name of honour should be punished.76 He also noted that &#8213;in countries with immigrant 
communities, protection should be given to victims and potential victims in connection with 
asylum and immigration procedures&#8214;.77 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Killings in the context of armed conflict  
</b></p>
<p>51. During armed conflict, women experience all forms of physical, sexual and 
psychological violence, perpetrated by both State and non-State actors, including unlawful 
killings.78 Such violence is often used as a weapon of war, to punish or dehumanize women 
and girls, and to persecute the community to which they belong. 
</p>
<p>52. Women and girls suffer from operations randomly or strategically targeting and 
terrorizing the civilian population, but also from summary and extrajudicial executions, 
imprisonment, torture, rape and sexual mutilations for fighting in resistance movements, for 
engaging in the search for and defence of their loved ones or for coming from communities 
suspected of collaboration.79 Gender inequality becomes more pronounced in conflict and 
crisis situations, as competing masculine discourses place contradictory demands on 
women, and conflict is instrumentalized as a pretext to further entrench patriarchal 
control.80 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders has stated that 
women human rights defenders, who challenge oppressive governments and policies, are 
more at risk of suffering violence and other violations While reclaiming their rights or the 
rights of their communities, they are perceived as challenging accepted sociocultural norms, 
traditions, perceptions and stereotypes about femininity, sexual orientation, and the role and 
status of women in society. The mission report on Colombia by the Special Rapporteur on

<p>the situation of human rights defenders highlights the killings of several women human 
rights defenders and the gravity of the violence, persecution and sexual torture in these 
murders.81  
</p>
<p>54. In Afghanistan, women&#8216;s rights defenders continue to be regularly threatened and 
intimidated, and high-profile women, mainly political activists, have been assassinated, and 
their killers have not been brought to justice.82 The Taliban&#8216;s interpretation of sharia law is 
used to justify harsher punishments for women seen to be mixing with men outside their 
immediate families.83 A common means of intimidation and control of local communities, 
mainly women, is the use of night letters. These are threatening letters, usually hand-
delivered, or pasted onto a door or in a mosque, by insurgent groups. The content of these 
letters varies, but the main message is a threat of harm to women and girls (or their parents) 
if they go to school or to work, leave their homes, speak to non-family men, or call radio 
stations with music requests.84 
</p>
<p>55. In the 45-year-old civil war in Colombia, women community leaders and women 
fighting for their rights are the main targets of gender-related killings.85 These women are 
especially vulnerable if they promote land rights86 and the rights of the most marginalized 
groups, such as indigenous people, ethnic and religious minorities, trade unionists, and 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.87 The Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has confirmed that defenders of women&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>rights are significant targets of unlawful killings by both Colombian State forces and illegal 
armed groups.88 The gender-specific intimidation of women defenders includes the 
targeting of their children and families, as a way to manipulate their roles as mothers, 
thereby exerting additional pressure on them to stop their human rights work.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Dowry-related killings of women 
</b></p>
<p>56. In some South Asian countries, a widespread practice is that of dowry-related 
murders. This term covers the deaths of young brides who are murdered, or driven to 
suicide by continuous harassment and torture perpetrated by the groom&#8216;s family in an effort 
to extort dowry payment or an increased dowry of cash or goods. The most common 
manifestation of this practice is the burning of the bride. These incidents are often presented 
as, and accepted to be, accidents, such as death as a result of an &#8213;exploding stove&#8214;.89  
</p>
<p>57. Dowry-related violence is embedded in religious and cultural traditions of the South 
Asian region.90 The practice has permeated all communities. Pakistan enacted an anti-

against women,91 and the laws have failed to have an impact in curbing dowry or elevating 
the status of women within marriage.92   
</p>
<p>58. In several cases in Bangladesh, dowry-related harassment of women has been 
aggravated to acid attacks, leading to blindness, disfigurement and death of women.93 In 
2002, Bangladesh passed a law imposing the death penalty on offenders and also restricted 
the sale of acid, in response to the growing problem of acid attacks.94 In the first half of 
2009, 119 cases of dowry-related violence, including 78 deaths, were reported. In 2008, 
172 women were killed, and the figure for 2007 was 187.95  
</p>
<p>59. Statistics for the period 2007 to 2009 show that there have been between 8,093 and 
8,383 reported cases of dowry deaths in India.96 As noted by experts, the numbers of 
reported cases do not add up to conviction rates. The National Crime Records Bureau of 
India reports that for 2008 there were 1,948 convictions, as against 3,876 acquittals.97 Acid 
attacks are also becoming a growing phenomenon in India, with young women being 
targeted for spurning suitors and for rejecting proposals of marriage, as well as in 
connection with contestation over dowry.98 
</p>
<p>60. Human rights bodies have strongly condemned these practices.99 Experts argue that 
there is a need to address the underlying cultural concerns, such as the subordinate status of 
women within their birth/natal and marital homes; issues of property and ownership within 
these realms; the control of women&#8216;s sexuality; the stigma attached to divorce; and the lack 
</p>
<p>of support for a woman after she is married.100  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Killings of aboriginal and indigenous women  
</b></p>
<p>61. Aboriginal and indigenous women and girls experience extremely high levels of 
violence. The social, cultural, economic and political marginalization of aboriginal and 
indigenous women globally, along with a negative legacy of colonialism, historic racist 
government policies and the consequences of economic policies, has driven an alarming 
number of these women into extremely vulnerable situations. For example, the effect of 
certain economic policies imposed on the Central America region has exacerbated the 
vulnerability of indigenous women, and has forced them to migrate both internally and 
regionally. They have been pressed into low-skilled and low-paid jobs, mainly in <i>maquila 
</i>factories, domestic service, the sex trade and prostitution, under precarious and exploitative 
conditions.

<p> 94 In 2002, the Parliament of Bangladesh enacted two laws against acid violence: Under the Acid

result in a prison term of 3-10 years. Those who possess chemicals and equipment for the unlicensed 
production of acid can get the same prison term.

<p>62. The intersection of different layers of discrimination based on race, ethnic identity, 
sex, class, education and political views further disenfranchises indigenous and aboriginal 
women, reproducing a multi-level oppression that culminates in violence. In cases of 
killings of aboriginal and indigenous women, the main failings by the authorities are the 
failure of police to protect aboriginal women and girls from violence and to investigate 
promptly and thoroughly when they are missing or murdered, and the disadvantaged social 
and economic conditions in which aboriginal women and girls live, which make them 
vulnerable to such violence.101   
</p>
<p>63. In Guatemala, the current experience of massive and violent killings of indigenous 
women has a legacy stemming back to colonial times, further increasing during the 36-year 
armed conflict. Indigenous Maya women constituted 88 per cent of victims of sexual and 
systematic attacks, with such attacks being publicly and intentionally perpetrated, mainly 
by military and paramilitary personnel.102 After the 1996 Peace Accord, no efforts were 
made to seek justice for and provide reparations to the victims and their families. In fact, 
article 200 of the Penal Code (repealed in 2006) afforded immunity to perpetrators of 
sexual violence and kidnapping of women and girls over 12 years old, where the perpetrator 
subsequently married the victim. Thus a State-endorsed impunity was established, 
condoning all forms of violence, particularly against indigenous women.  
</p>
<p>64. In Australia, violence against aboriginal women is egregious due to the use of 
weapons and the licensing of firearms. Incidents of weapon-inflicted violence, involving 
hammers, knives, sticks, stones, guns and pickets, have resulted in a number of homicides 
of aboriginal women.103 Recent reports indicate that aboriginal women are at far greater risk 
of being the victims of homicide, rape and other assaults than non-aboriginal women.104 
However, aboriginal women have been reluctant to expose these acts of violence, due to the 
risk of further denigration of their communities from the dominant white society. As noted 
by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, &#8213;indigenous 
women and girls face the highest levels of violence, especially at home where indigenous 
women are 35 times as likely to be hospitalized as a result of family violence-related 
assaults as non-indigenous females&#8214;.105  
</p>
<p>65. Until 1985 Canada had many discriminatory laws against aboriginal women and 
children; this has had an intergenerational impact, and has contributed to a legacy of 
violence, abuse and impunity.106 Today, a young aboriginal woman is five times more 
likely than other Canadian women of the same age to die of violence.107 According to a 
2010 report, of 582 cases of violence against aboriginal women, 20 per cent involved 
missing women and girls, 67 per cent involved women or girls who died as a result of 
homicide or negligence, and 4 per cent fell under the category of suspicious death (usually

<p>declared natural or accidental by the police).108 Between 2000 and 2008, 153 cases of 
murders of women and girls were reported, and in 115 of these cases, the bodies are still 
missing.109 Aboriginal women and girls are more likely to be killed by a stranger than are 
non-aboriginal women. Approximately 50 per cent of such murders remain unsolved.110 
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed its 
concern that &#8213;hundreds of cases involving aboriginal women who have gone missing or 
been murdered in the past two decades have neither been fully investigated nor attracted 
priority attention, with the perpetrators remaining unpunished&#8214;.111  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Extreme forms of violent killings of women  
</b></p>
<p>66. The growing sociopolitical phenomena of gangs, organized crime, drug dealers, 
human and drug trafficking chains, massive migration and the proliferation of small arms 
have had a devastating impact on women&#8216;s lives, particularly in Mexico and Central 
America. The northern triangle of Central America has the highest rates of homicide in a 
non-conflict context.112 The rate of killings of men has been stable during the last decade, 
but there has been an increase in the rates of killings of women.113 In 2004 in Guatemala, 
murders of women increased 141 per cent, as opposed to 68 per cent for men; in El 
Salvador in 2006 murders of women increased 111 per cent, compared to 40 per cent for 
men; and in Honduras in 2007 murders of women increased 166 per cent, compared to 40 
per cent for men.  
</p>
<p>67. As regards Mexico, in 1993 reports began to appear in the international media of the 
discovery of the mutilated bodies of raped and murdered women on wastelands outside the 
city of Ciudad Ju&#225;rez.114 Data collection on femicides has indicated an escalation in the 
numbers of killings, with one author estimating that approximately 740 femicides occurred 
between 1993 and 2009 in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez.115 The patterns of killings include abduction and 
disappearances for a few days; torture and sexual assault by groups of men; murder and 
mutilation, particularly of the sexual organs and breasts; decapitation in some cases; and the 
naked bodies/body parts being left on public display or dumped in empty wastelands of the 
city. In the worst cases, parts of the bodies are scattered through different areas of the city 
with messages written on the bodies or on paper found on the bodies. It is argued that the

<p>murders are conducted with symbolic effect&#8212;destroying the victim&#8216;s humanity, integrity 
and identity.116  
</p>
<p>68. Victims come from a range of social and economic backgrounds, which vary from 
country to country, as do the circumstances in which they are killed. Many of the murdered 
women come from the most marginalized sectors of society: they are poor, from rural areas, 
of ethnic origin, sex workers or maquila workers. Young women between 16 and 24 years 
old are the most vulnerable group. Overall, 25 per cent of murders reveal evidence of 
sexual assault; 66 per cent of murders in Honduras and 44 per cent in El Salvador exhibit 
signs of brutality.117 Small firearms were used in 90 per cent of femicides in Guatemala118 
and in 79 per cent of femicides in Honduras in 2010.119 Femicide is considered the second-
highest cause of death of women of reproductive age in Honduras.120 
</p>
<p>69. Central America is a post-conflict<b> </b>region with fragile States and institutions, and it is 
also the poorest region in the Americas.121 The effect of certain economic policies 
encouraged and facilitated the introduction of maquilas. The low-paid jobs created by the 
maquila industry are mainly occupied by women, in particular poor and illiterate women 
from rural areas. Contracts are generally on a temporary basis, with long working hours and 
no benefits. Also, women walk through dark public spaces as they return home late in the 
day, with no protection against criminal activities in the public sphere.  
</p>
<p>70. Furthermore, organized crime groups and gangs (known as <i>maras</i>) have multiplied 
and have created an internal system of control of local territory and of communities. They 
have established an open market for a profitable arms trade, which allows them to position 
themselves as the main providers of private security for drug cartels, entrepreneurs and the 
elite.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Killings as a result of sexual orientation and gender identity  
</b></p>
<p>71. Gender-based killing due to sexual orientation and gender identity is a phenomenon 
that has been recently, albeit insufficiently, documented. Although limited statistics are 
available, civil society reports suggest that violence, motivated by hatred and prejudice 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity, is a daily reality for many. It is 
&#8213;characterized by levels of serious physical violence that in some cases exceed those 
</p>
<p>present in other types of hate crimes&#8214;.122 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, 
intersex and queer persons (LGBTIQ), and also activists working in this sector, are targeted 
because they do not conform to stereotypes of gender sexuality and/or identity, thus 
becoming victims of homophobic crimes.  
</p>
<p>72. Manifestations of violence, such as abuse of police power, sexual violence in prisons 
and murders fuelled by hate, as well as several kinds of discrimination, persist. As 
academics have noted,123 there is a paradox in the advancement in the protection of 
individuals&#8216; sexual rights on the one hand, and the increasing escalation of homophobic

<p>crimes on the other. In this sense, LGBTIQ persons, including women, are especially 
vulnerable to many kinds of violent crime, from killings in private homes to killings in 
public spaces known as &#8213;social cleansing&#8214;, extortion by blackmailers who threaten to reveal 
their identity to the public, and abuse from officials, especially the police, who sometimes 
arrest them.124  
</p>
<p>73. In the case of South Africa, the recent murders of Black lesbian women 
demonstrates the multiple and intersecting factors that have led to an escalation in 
homophobic attacks, despite progressive constitutional provisions preventing 
discrimination on the basis of, among others, race, gender and sexual orientation.125 
</p>
<p>74. The Human Rights Council has expressed its concern about the increasing violence 
and killings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and the impunity surrounding 
these crimes.126 More recently, the Council passed a groundbreaking resolution on human 
rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity.127 
</p>
<p>75. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has held several hearings in the 
last three years regarding the situation of violence and discrimination against sexual 
minorities in some countries of the Caribbean and Central and South America. In these 
countries, civil society organizations have expressed their concern regarding increasing 
incidents of homophobic crimes.128  
</p>
<p>76. Reports of homicides of &#8213;trans&#8214; people reflect that 93 murders were recorded in the 
first half of 2010.129 Another project has revealed that between January 2008 and 
September 2011 there were 681 reports of murdered &#8213;trans&#8214; people in 50 countries.130  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Other forms of gender-related killings of women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>77. As noted above, certain cultural norms and beliefs are the causal factors for harmful 
practices resulting in violence against women.131 For example, in India the practice of sati, 
that is, the burning alive of a widow on her husband&#8216;s pyre, has emerged since the 
country&#8216;s independence.132 To date there have been at least 40 reported cases.133

<p>78. Female infanticide has been practiced throughout history, on all continents, and by 
persons from all backgrounds.134 It remains a critical concern in a number of countries today. 
It is closely linked to the phenomenon of sex-selective abortion, which targets female 
foetuses. Female infanticide has been known to take such forms as the induced death of 
infants by suffocation, drowning, neglect and exposure to danger or other means.135 
</p>
<p>79. In recent decades, sex-ratio imbalances in favour of boy children have grown in a 
number of Asian countries, and there is broad agreement concerning the problem of gender-
biased sex selection.136 In a context of son preference, the recent availability of 
technologies that can be used for sex selection has compounded the problem. The rise in 
sex-ratio imbalances and the normalization of the use of sex selection is caused by deeply 
embedded discrimination against women within marriage systems, family formation and 
inheritance laws.137  
</p>
<p>80. In the case of India, international attention has been drawn to the vast divergence in 
the country&#8216;s natural gender ratio, with estimates that in 2003 100 million women were 
&#8213;missing&#8214; from its population.138 It is estimated that one million selective female foetal 
abortions occur annually in India.139 There is no official statistical data available on female 
infanticide, but in the state of Kerala, it is estimated that about 25,000 female newborns are 
killed every year.140 The preadolescent mortality rate of girls under 5 years old was 21 per 
cent higher than for boys of the same age in India. Violence, as well as nutritional and 
deliberate medical neglect by girls&#8216; parents, was cited as the main causes of death.141  
</p>
<p>81. Female infanticide in China goes back as far 2000 B.C. Girls were the main victims of 
infanticide, especially so in times of poverty and famine.142 A study suggested that the 
estimated number of missing girls in the twentieth century in China between 1900 and 2000 is 
35.59 million, representing 4.65 per cent of its population. An analysis of the most recent data 
from China shows that while the sex ratio at birth is more skewed in rural areas, the ratios in 
large cities increased in 2005 compared to 2000.143 These findings suggest that son preference 
is still a strong influence, and is increasingly being acted upon by those living in cities.

<p>The killing of women constitutes a violation of, among others, the rights to life, to equality, 
dignity and non-discrimination, and not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman, 
or degrading treatment or punishment. The obligation of States to ensure these rights arises 
pursuant to the duty of States to prevent and protect individuals from human rights 
violations within their jurisdictions, to punish perpetrators and to compensate individuals 
for such violations. The failure of States to guarantee the right of women to a life free from 
violence allows for a continuum of violence that can end in the deaths of women. 
</p>
<p>83. Gender-based violence has been recognized as one of the most extreme and 
pervasive forms of discrimination, severely impairing and nullifying the enforcement of 
women&#8216;s rights.144 The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women address 
all forms of violence, which include the killing of women, as acts of violence that are 
prohibited under international law.145  
</p>
<p>84. Treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders have also condemned specific 
forms of violence, including femicide, honour-related killings, systematic killings, 
disappearances and witchcraft-related killings of women.146 They have also raised concerns 
in relation to the significant obstacles for women in accessing justice, the climate of 
impunity surrounding such cases, and also the systematic failure of States to investigate or 
provide redress.147  
</p>
<p>85. A significant component of the international human rights framework is the duty 
placed on States to prevent, investigate, punish and provide compensation for all acts of 
violence. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women spells out the 
obligation of States to exercise due diligence when gender-based violence occurs, whether 
perpetrated by the State or by private persons.148 In numerous resolutions relating to the 
intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women, the Human 
Rights Council and the General Assembly have also urged States to act with due diligence

</p>
<p>resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993.   </p>


<p>to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women 
and girls and to provide protection to the victims.149   
</p>
<p>86. The rights of women and girls to be informed about and provided with access to the 
mechanisms of justice and effective remedies are also contained within international human 
rights law.150 As noted by the Special Rapporteur: &#8213;the obligation to provide adequate 
reparations involves ensuring the rights of women to access both criminal and civil 
remedies and the establishment of effective protection, support and rehabilitation services 
for survivors of violence&#8214;.151 The General Assembly has repeatedly urged Member States to 
take action towards this end by means of a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral 
and sustained approach, adequately supported and facilitated by strong institutional 
mechanisms and financing, through national action plans; and to ensure that all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms are respected and protected.152  
</p>
<p>87. Relevant resolutions also provide that States must condemn violence against women 
and not invoke custom, tradition or religion to avoid their obligations to eliminate such 
violence; develop penal, civil, labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to 
punish and redress the wrongs caused to victims; provide access to the mechanisms of 
justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and effective remedies; and 
ensure that the secondary victimization of women does not occur because of laws 
insensitive to gender considerations, enforcement practices or other interventions.153 
</p>
<p>88. In other resolutions, the General Assembly has also urged States to review or abolish 
all laws and regulations that discriminate against women or have a discriminatory impact 
on women and ensure that provisions of multiple legal systems comply with international 
human rights obligations, and to use best practices to end impunity and a culture of 
tolerance towards violence against women, including by evaluating and assessing the 
impact of legislation, rules and procedures regarding violence against women and 
reinforcing criminal law and procedure relating to all forms of violence against women, as 
well as by incorporating into law measures aimed at preventing violence against women.154  
</p>
<p>89. In 2000, the Human Rights Committee adopted general comment 28 on the equality 
of rights between men and women, in which it stated that honour crimes which remained 
unpunished constituted a serious violation of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Moreover, laws which imposed more severe penalties on women than on 
men for adultery or other offences also violated the requirement of equal treatment.155 In

against women. 
</p>
<p> 150 See Article 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Article 7 of 
Convention Belem do Para, supra note 1. Also relevant are the rights to judicial protection and 
effective remedies established in general human rights instruments. See the American Convention on 
Human Rights (arts. 8 and 15); the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (art. 
XVIII); the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 8), the International Covenant on Civil and

<p>2004, the General Assembly passed a resolution on the elimination of crimes against 
women and girls committed in the name of honour. It stressed the need to treat such crimes 
as criminal offences punishable by law. It emphasized that such crimes are incompatible 
with all religious and cultural values, and called upon all States to continue to intensify 
efforts to prevent and eliminate crimes against women and girls committed in the name of 
honour, by using legislative, administrative and programmatic measures.156  
</p>
<p>90. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has held State 
parties accountable for their failure to act with due diligence in addressing violence against 
women.157 For example, in the cases of <i>Goekce (deceased)</i> <i>v. Austria</i> and <i>Yildirim 
(deceased) v. Austria</i>,158 both concerning women victims of domestic violence, the 
Committee found that the State had discriminated against the women for failing to act with 
due diligence to protect their rights to life and to physical and mental integrity. The 
Committee has also addressed structural discrimination against women in relation to 
gender-based murders. In its inquiry under article 8 of the Optional Protocol into the 
abduction, rape and murder of women in and around Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, the Committee has 
recommended that Mexico sensitize all state and municipal authorities to the need for 
violence against women to be regarded as a violation of fundamental rights.159  
</p>
<p>91. Furthermore, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
has characterized the persecution of women accused of witchcraft as an extreme form of 
violence against women.160 It has expressed its concern about the persistence of the belief 
in witchcraft and the subjection of women in witch camps to violence.161  
</p>
<p>92. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has urged 
Canada to examine the reasons for the failure to investigate the cases of missing or 
murdered aboriginal women, to take the necessary steps to remedy the deficiencies in the 
system, to carry out thorough investigations of the cases of aboriginal women who have 
gone missing or been murdered in recent decades, to conduct an analysis of such cases in 
order to determine whether there is a racialized pattern to the disappearances, and to take 
measures to address the problem if that is the case.162 
</p>
<p>93. The Committee against Torture has stated that the definition of torture includes the 
principle of non-discrimination on any grounds, including gender, sexual orientation and 
transgender identity.163 Thus, States are obliged to protect certain minority or marginalized 
individuals or populations especially at risk of torture, and should ensure such protection by 
fully prosecuting and punishing all acts of violence and abuse and ensuring implementation 
of other positive measures of prevention and protection.164 The Human Rights Council, in

 157 The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against

<p>Women allows the Committee to review individual petitions against State parties that have ratified the 
CEDAW Convention. See Article 7, para. 3.

<p>its resolution 17/19, requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
present a study documenting discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against 
individuals based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Some national practices  
</b></p>
<p>94. States have sought to comply with their due diligence obligation to prevent violence 
against women through the adoption of specific legislation, the development of awareness-
raising campaigns, and the provision of training for professional groups, including the 
police, prosecutors and members of the judiciary.165 Many States have adopted national 
plans of action on violence against women in an effort to coordinate activities between and 
within government agencies and to take a multisectoral approach to prevent violence.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>95. In Afghanistan, the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women broadly 
criminalizes violence against women broadly. Despite this, cases of gender-based killings 
and other serious crimes against women are still being prosecuted under the Penal Code 
instead of under the new law.166 This is resulting in acquittals of perpetrators, the reduction 
of charges to less serious crimes, convictions with lighter sentences and women victims 
themselves being accused of &#8213;moral crimes&#8214;.167 Also, article 398 of the Penal Code 
mitigates penalties for murder if the victim is a close relative caught in the act of 
committing adultery, and the killing was not premeditated.168  
</p>
<p>96. Legislative advances have been made by Lebanon regarding honour crimes. In 
August 2011, Lebanon repealed article 562 of its Criminal Code. That article had mitigated 
the sentences of people who claimed they killed or injured their wife, daughter or other 
relative to protect the family honour.169 The Lebanese courts almost invariably refused to 
accept the alleged notion of honour to justify these crimes, and article 562 was rarely used 
by the judges.170 Nevertheless, women&#8216;s organizations in Lebanon argued that enacting a 
comprehensive law for the protection of women from family violence was an effective 
strategy to prevent killings of women in the first place.171 
</p>
<p>97. In 2010, the government of British Columbia established the Missing Women 
Commission of Inquiry, to conduct fact-finding missions and police investigations with 
regard to reports of missing and murdered women in the city of Vancouver (the Pickton 
case).172 This initiative does not address the phenomena in other parts of the country.173

<p>98. India passed the 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act, and dowry death was also criminalized 
in the Indian Penal Code,174 where a provision was introduced proscribing dowry-related 
violence and establishing domestic violence (cruelty in the marital home) as an offence with a 
maximum punishment of three years.175 This amendment was also necessary to respond to the 
difficulties of proving the murder of women committed within the home. The normal 
evidentiary rules were amended to shift the burden of proof to the accused in the hope that it 
would enable the prosecution to secure convictions. Similarly, evidentiary rules relating to the 
offence of abetment (instigation, conspiracy or intentional aiding) to suicide were amended to 
more justly deal with cases of suicides committed by women due to dowry harassment.176 
Despite such reforms, the incidence of dowry-related killings continues.177  
</p>
<p>99. Although some States have enacted legislation providing for the punishment of 
witches, penalties for the persecution or killing of witches have not been explicitly 
established. In some countries, laws consider witchcraft as an aggravating circumstance 
which warrants a lesser punishment for the aggressor.178 For example, in Papua New 
Guinea, attacks against persons accused of sorcery can be prosecuted as a crime under 
ordinary criminal legislation. Although the Sorcery Act of Papua New Guinea provides for 
the prosecution of those responsible for the deaths of accused witches, there is almost no 
enforcement of the law, as witnesses often fail to cooperate out of fear or complacency.179 
According to reports, of 67 sorcery-related incidents in Simbu recorded by the police 
between 2000 and 2005 (including 92 persons dead or injured), only six affidavits were 
produced regarding killers of suspected witches and only two people were eventually 
sentenced.180  
</p>
<p>100. In 2008 Guatemala passed the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence 
against Women. It includes a comprehensive framework and incorporates a wide definition 
that acknowledges that femicide is committed by a person who, in the context of unequal 
power relations between men and women, puts to death a woman because she is a woman.  
</p>
<p>101. At the federal level, Mexico passed the General Law on Women&#8216;s Access to a Life 
Free of Violence in 2007. Although this law does not recognize femicide as a crime, it has 
included &#8213;femicidal violence&#8214; (<i>violencia feminicida</i>) as a type of violence. To date, only the 
federal authorities of the capital and three county/state governments have issued executive 
regulations to implement this new legislation.  
</p>
<p>102. In 2010, El Salvador passed the Integral Law for a Life Free of Violence for 
Women, which defines and classifies two types of femicide: when the perpetrator of the 
death of a woman is motivated by hatred or contempt based on gender; and aggravated 
femicide, when the perpetrator is a civil servant, government official or member of the 
police or army, when two or more persons are involved, when the killing is committed in 
the presence of any of the victim&#8216;s members of the family, when the victim is a minor or 
</p>
<p>  
 174 See Section 304-B, Indian Penal Code. A minimum of seven years and a maximum of life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment was the prescribed punishment. 
 175 See S.498-A of the Indian Penal Code.  
 176 See Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.  
 177 The National Crime Record Bureau of India (NCRB) reports for 2008, there were 1,948 convictions 
</p>
<p>as against 3,876 acquittals.  In 2009, 8,383 dowry violence cases have been reported. See <i>Crime in

</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>While States have initiated various preventive programmes, there are 
numerous gaps in their efforts. Challenges include: a lack of overall societal 
</b></p>
<p><b>transformation; inadequate provision of access to justice; the absence and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>insufficiency of the rights-based discourse when addressing the killings of women; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the blindness to structural inequalities and the complex intersecting relations of power 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the public and private spheres, which remain the root causes of sex and gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. A holistic approach in preventing gender-related killings must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized in all the measures taken by States to investigate and sanction violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially in crafting, implementing and evaluating legislation, policies and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>plans of action. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Feminists have also identified what they believe are other challenges: the 
difficulty of translating social realities into claims based on rights; the narrow 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpretation of rights within an international legal order; and the prevalence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory cultural stereotypes in the administration of justice. The formulation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of rights-based claims by women remains an important strategic and political tool for 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s empowerment and for addressing human rights violations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The weaknesses in information systems and the poor quality of data are major 
barriers in investigating femicides, developing meaningful prevention strategies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>advocating for improved policies. The different frameworks, definitions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>classifications used in the conceptualization of femicide often complicate the collection 
</b></p>
<p><b>of data from different sources and could lead to documentation that may not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>comparable across communities or regions.
</b>181
</p>
<p><b> Studies on the subject have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted primarily using data from homicide databases. Information collected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>official or State sources is frequently not harmonized or coordinated. Often there are 
</b></p>
<p><b>incongruities between the data collated by the different facilities, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>inconsistencies in the categories used to document the circumstances surrounding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>crime, the victim-perpetrator relationship and the fact of pre-existing violence. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of an effective evidence base requires improving the quality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comparability of data.
</b>182
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The use of inexact categories for the classification of murders, such as the 
category </b>&#8220;<b>others</b>&#8221;,<b> results in misidentification, concealment and underreporting of 
</b></p>
<p><b>femicides</b>&#8212;<b>in particular those that do not occur in a family situation. Another 
</b></p>
<p><b>common practice is the use of stereotypical and potentially prejudicial categories, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including </b>&#8220;<b>crime of passion</b>&#8221;<b> or </b>&#8220;<b>mistress</b>&#8221;<b>.</b>183 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>In February 2009 the Statistical Commission, in response to a request from the 
General Assembly,
</b></p>
<p>184 <b>adopted a set of indicators that can document the prevalence of 
violence against women. The indicators proposed include: degree, frequency, 
</b></p>
<p><b>relationship with the perpetrator, victim</b>&#8217;<b>s age, and records of murder cases.

<p><b> 27 
</b></p>
<p><b>According to the information gathered to date, no country has all the information 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to calculate and create the proposed indicators.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Although media coverage of killings of women has generally perpetuated 
stereotypes and prejudicial biases, it has provided contextual information, including, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inter alia, the victim-perpetrator relationship and any history of violence. This has 
</b></p>
<p>helped women&#8217;s organi<b>zations to distinguish cases of femicide from those of homicides 
</b></p>
<p><b>of women.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The lack of adequate assessment of risk, the lack of enforcement by police and 
the judiciary of civil remedies and criminal sanctions, and the absence or inadequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision of services, such as shelters, also exacerbate the risk of women of being 
</b></p>
<p><b>abused and murdered, as often women have no choice but to continue living with their 
</b></p>
<p><b>abusers.
</b>185
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In the context of murders relating to witchcraft, a number of factors that 
hinder or prevent adequate police response were identified. These include shortages of 
</b></p>
<p><b>personnel, vehicles and fuel and a limited presence of the police, as well as the taboo 
</b></p>
<p><b>surrounding sorcery, which in and of itself prevents intervention. In many cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities do not cooperate and are reluctant to give information to the police due 
</b></p>
<p><b>to fear of mob rule and of being accused as co-sorcerers if they assist victims.
</b>186  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>International humanitarian law proscribes gender-based violence and 
extrajudicial executions of women during armed conflict. It also forbids attacks on 
</b></p>
<p><b>their personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment. Significant 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles to investigating and prosecuting killings of women have been identified. 
</b></p>
<p><b>These include the failure of police intervention, a lack of implementation of security 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures for women, repeated attacks on law-enfor</b>cement officials and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>rights advocates, and inaccessible detention locations in areas under the control of 
</b></p>
<p><b>insurgents and other illegally armed groups. Institutional weakness results in 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity in cases of gender-related killings of women, as a lack of respect for the rule 
</b></p>
<p><b>of law, corruption and poor administration of justice are the norm.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Despite progressive jurisprudence from the regional human rights systems, 
often there is no mechanism to coordinate the implementation of the judgements at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the national level, with some authorities stating that the absence of a special 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing law precludes fulfilment. It is argued that in order to facilitate 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with such rulings, the creation of an international standard for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation of femicide, which ensures compliance with the guarantee of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>repetition, is necessary. An Action Protocol, aimed at the judiciary, prosecutors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>political bodies, can outline guidelines for the prevention of and investigation into 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents of femicide.
</b>187
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> </b>As noted by this mandate, developing indicators for State responses &#8220;is 
<b>somewhat less complex than measuring violence, because there are clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities set out in international law: to prevent, protect, prosecute and provide 
</b></p>
<p>compensation&#8221;<b>.</b>188 <b>While adequate regulatory frameworks have generally been 
adopted to deal with violence against women, weaknesses include: a lack of adequate

<p>114. <b>In 2007, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
concluded that to end violence against women, it is imperative that it become a focus 
</b></p>
<p><b>of public agendas: firstly, as a human rights violation, secondly, because violence is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacle for development and, finally, because it is a key issue for democracy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance.
</b>189
</p>
<p><b> In this sense, the elimination of violence against women is based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>three pillars: legal protection, public policies and a culture of respect without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination.
</b>190 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>A holistic approach for the elimination of all forms of violence against all 
women would require that systemic discrimination, oppression and marginalization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women be addressed at the political, operative, judicial and administrative levels.

<p>116. <b>In cases involving gender-related killings, the international and regional human 
rights systems have included some of the following standards regarding the due 
</b></p>
<p><b>diligence obligations of States:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Conduct effective investigations of the crime, and prosecute and sanction 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts of violence perpetrated by State or private actors, especially when these acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrate a pattern of systemic violence towards women;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Guarantee de jure and de facto access to adequate and effective judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Include in the obligation of access to justice a requirement to treat 
</b></p>
<p><b>women victims and their relatives with respect and dignity throughout the legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>process;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure comprehensive reparations for women victims of violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their relatives, including measures that are designed to address institutional and social 
</b></p>
<p><b>factors;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Identify certain groups of women as being at particular risk for acts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence due to having been subjected to discrimination based on more than one 
</b></p>
<p><b>factor, including women belonging to ethnic, racial and minority groups. Such factors 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be considered by States in the adoption of measures to prevent all forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and eliminate prejudices, customary practices and other practices based on the idea of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and on stereotyped roles for men
