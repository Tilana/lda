</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 Canada is a society open to and accepting of cultural, religious and linguistic 
differences, where minorities can express their identities, speak their languages and practise 
their faiths freely. Canada has an impressive constitutional and legislative framework in the 
area of equality and non-discrimination at the federal and provincial and territorial levels 
and numerous policy initiatives to promote multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p> However, significant and persistent problems affect persons belonging to ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities, who are people of colour or of particular religious 
beliefs. Many feel that the Government has failed to respond adequately to their problems 
or to devise meaningful and enforceable solutions.  
</p>
<p> Rapid demographic changes have created new demands for deeper levels of 
disaggregation of data to keep pace with shifts in the economic and social status of specific 
minority communities. Certain minority communities, such as black Canadians, feel 
strongly that the catch-all terminology of &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; under which their data is 
captured leads inevitably to the neglect of their specific identities and situations and has 
served to obscure and dilute the differences and distinct experiences of respective minority 
groups. Unpacking the visible minority data is a first essential step towards the recognition

<p>of diverse experiences and challenges and enabling more targeted policy responses. 
</p>
<p> African-descendant Canadians and some Asian Canadian communities are 
concerned that their children are having negative experiences in public schools. Dropout 
rates are particularly high among boys from these communities. Parents and community 
leaders described approaches to education that do not take into account different cultures of 
learning, as well as curriculums and textbooks that ignore their histories and contributions 
to Canadian society. There is a gross underrepresentation of minorities in the teaching and 
school administrative staff. 
</p>
<p> Unemployment rates generally are significantly higher for certain minorities, 
income levels are lower, and minorities are disproportionately living in the poorest 
neighbourhoods and in social housing with relatively poor access to services. Useful 
legislation and policies exist in the field of employment equity, however, standards and 
requirements must be better enforced, first and foremost, in public service employment, to 
ensure that Canada&#8217;s workplaces truly reflect the diversity present in society. 
</p>
<p> Highly qualified and skilled workers have been encouraged to migrate to Canada, 
but many of them find on their arrival that their qualifications are not recognized at the 
provincial and territorial levels. Many professionals are unable to gain employment in their 
former professions and find themselves in low-skilled, low-waged or precarious 
employment often for years. This is a long-standing problem, however while some efforts 
continue to be made to find solutions they appear to still be at an initial stage. 
</p>
<p> Poverty is a problem disproportionately faced by people of colour. Poverty 
alleviation programmes in Canada must be targeted towards racialized communities. 
Responses should be holistic in nature and must recognize the complex causes of poverty 
that include racial discrimination and the resulting social and economic exclusion. 
</p>
<p> In the field of policing, serious concerns include the use of racial profiling as a 
systemic practice, biased and heavy-handed policing of some minority communities and 
allegations of excessive use of force leading to deaths, particularly of young black males. 
Some minorities feel that the justice system is failing them. Arabs and Muslims reported 
that post September 2001, communities feel targeted, profiled and subject to unequal 
treatment. 
</p>
<p> Finally, minorities are poorly represented in political structures and institutions at all 
levels of Government.

2004, just 7 per cent of members of the Canadian Parliament were visible minorities 
compared to a 15 per cent representation in the overall population. Despite rapid growth in 
the visible minority population, the seat share for visible minorities was virtually the same 
as that achieved in 1993. Across 11 cities, out of 552 elected officials at three levels of 
Government, the study revealed 48 visible minorities (9 per cent).

that a &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221; in political structures stops people of colour progressing to senior 
posts. Political parties rarely select minority candidates. Other barriers exist in such factors 
as employment and economic status, poor outreach to minorities by political parties 
including via ethnic media, and lack of inclusive consultations with minorities in 
policymaking.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on minority issues conducted an official visit to Canada 
between 13 and 23 October 2009. She visited the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia 
and Quebec and held consultations with senior federal, provincial and territorial 
government representatives with responsibilities in the field of minority rights, anti-
discrimination and equality. She held numerous meetings with non-governmental 
organizations, members of minority communities and academics and hosted forums for 
minority women. She thanks the Government of Canada and the provincial and territorial 
governments for their excellent cooperation, as well as the numerous non-governmental 
organizations, civil society groups and community representatives that provided valuable 
information and assistance. 
</p>
<p>2. Under the federal Employment Equity Act, &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; are defined as 
&#8220;persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in 
colour&#8221;. The following groups are included in the visible minority population: Chinese, 
South Asians, blacks, Arabs, West Asians, Filipinos, Southeast Asians, Latin Americans, 
Japanese, Koreans and other visible minority groups, such as Pacific Islanders.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. Canada has a total population of 31,241,030 according to 2006 census data. More 
than 5 million, or 16.2 per cent, are identified as visible minorities. The visible minority 
population increased by 27.2 per cent between 2001 and 2006, five times faster than growth 
for the population as a whole. Statistics Canada projections demonstrate that by 2017, one 
in five Canadians will be non-white or people of colour. In 2006, 95.9 per cent of visible 
minorities lived in a metropolitan area, the largest concentrations in Toronto (42.9 per cent 
of the total population), Vancouver (41.7 per cent) and Montreal (16.5 per cent). Three in 
10 visible minorities were Canadian-born. 
</p>
<p>4. Canadians identifying as South Asian (including those of East Indian, Pakistani, Sri 
Lankan and Bangladeshi origin), account for 1.3 million people, 24.9 per cent of the visible 
minority population, and 4 per cent of the total population. Chinese make up 24 per cent of 
the visible minority population (1.2 million people), and 3.9 per cent of the total population. 
Other large visible minority groups are: black1 (15.5 per cent of the visible minority 
population); Filipino (8.1 per cent); Latin American (6.0 per cent); Arab (5.2 per cent); 
Southeast Asian (4.7 per cent); West Asian (3.1 per cent); Korean (2.<footnote name="8">1. Barriers to political participation by minority women are particularly persistent. 
They include the heavy burden of care for families and cultural factors. In the 1997 and 
2000 federal elections, there was only one Muslim female candidate running on the ticket 
of any major party. This number increased to four in 2004. In 2005, there were only two 
Muslim women serving in a provincial and territorial or federal legislature. 
</footnote> per cent); and 
Japanese (1.6 per cent). 
</p>
<p><b>  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>5. The independent expert&#8217;s evaluation of minority issues in Canada is based on the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities (1992) and other relevant international standards, from which she has 
identified four broad areas of concern relating to minorities globally. These are: (a) the 
protection of a minority&#8217;s survival, through the combating of violence against them and the 
prevention of genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of minority 
groups and the right of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their 
collective identity and to reject forced assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-
discrimination and equality, including ending structural or systemic discrimination, as well 
as the promotion of affirmative action when required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11860 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>effective participation of members of minorities in public life, especially with regard to 
decisions that affect them. She applies a gender perspective in all areas of her work. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert has chosen to focus her attention on persons belonging to 
racial or ethnic and religious minorities, officially categorized in Canada as &#8220;visible 
minorities&#8221;. Statistics Canada uses this term in its reporting based upon demographic 
census data. When enacting the Employment Equity Act in 1986, Canada adopted the term 
&#8220;visible minorities&#8221; to define those with diverse ethnic and racial origins who had 
experienced disadvantages in employment, considering it the best terminology available. 
</p>
<p>7. The term &#8220;visible minority&#8221; is objected to by many of those it is used to describe. 
They point out that this catch-all term has served to obscure and dilute the differences and 
distinct experiences of diverse minority groups. They state that the term discounts the racial 
hierarchy that is embedded in how race is constructed and how racism is manifested for 
different racial minority groups. Many favour being referred to as &#8220;racialized&#8221; individuals 
or groups. 
</p>
<p>8. Statistical analysis should acknowledge and reveal the great diversity of identities 
and experiences of different national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. However, 
the independent expert notes a considerable lack of clarity with regard to the use of terms 
such as &#8220;visible-minority&#8221; (and conversely &#8220;non-visible-minority&#8221;), &#8220;Black&#8221;, &#8220;African 
Canadian&#8221;, &#8220;Asian Canadian&#8221; and &#8220;Arab&#8221;. General references to &#8220;African Canadians&#8221; or 
&#8220;Blacks&#8221; encompass people of extremely diverse ethnic, sociocultural, geographical and 
historical origins, including former slaves, loyalists, immigrants from the Caribbean (both 
anglophone and francophone), immigrants from Africa and African refugees. The same is 
true for diverse communities of Asian origin. 
</p>
<p>9. Specific minority communities experience unique situations and challenges that may 
be hidden by the use of general terms of reference under which their data is gathered. 
Aggregating these experiences under &#8220;catch-all&#8221; terminologies masks their uniqueness and 
defies attempts to gain understanding and develop effective policies. References made in 
the present report to statistical data disaggregated into categories called &#8220;visible-
minorities&#8221;, &#8220;African Canadian&#8221;, &#8220;Black&#8221; or &#8220;Asian&#8221;, are drawn from various sources as 
noted, and are not necessarily the preference of the independent expert. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework and enforcement mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>10. Canada is a federal State in which legislative and executive powers are divided 
between federal, provincial and territorial levels of Government. The Constitution of 
Canada is the supreme law of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada has stated that the 
protection of minorities is one of the basic structural principles of the constitutional 
framework of Canada.2 Human rights are a matter of shared federal, provincial and 
territorial jurisdiction. 
11. Canada has ratified human rights treaties including the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The courts of Canada have held that 
domestic law is presumed to be in conformity with international obligations and will strive 
for an interpretation of domestic law that is consistent. Human rights treaties are 
implemented through constitutional law, human rights legislation that has been enacted in 
each jurisdiction, and other legislative, policy and programmatic measures.

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11860 
</p>
<p>12. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as part of the Canada Act, 1982, applies to all 
government legislation and action, federal, provincial and territorial, which must be in 
conformity with it. It also applies to actions of municipalities. Section 15 (1) states that: 
&#8220;Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection 
and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without 
discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental 
or physical disability.&#8221; The Charter allows for affirmative action measures to ensure 
equality under Section 15 (2). Although the Charter does not apply to purely private action, 
human rights legislation does apply in the areas of employment, accommodation and 
services. 
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution empowers the courts with the ability to strike down or read down 
legislation that is inconsistent with the Charter. In addition, the Charter states that anyone 
whose Charter rights have been infringed can apply to a court for an appropriate and just 
remedy. This allows a court to award a range of remedies, including damages. 
</p>
<p>14. The purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977) is: &#8220;to give effect &#8230; to the 
principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to 
make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs 
accommodated &#8230; without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory 
practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual 
orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a 
pardon has been granted&#8221;. The Act applies only to the federal Government and to federally 
regulated bodies and activities throughout Canada. The Act established the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, mandated to investigate claims of discrimination, and the 
Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to judge discrimination cases. Each province and 
territory has its own anti-discrimination law, and concerns related to discrimination by such 
organizations as retail and hospitality businesses, hospitals or health-care providers, 
educational institutions and most manufacturers come under provincial or territorial 
jurisdiction. 
15. The Canadian Human Rights Commission administers the Canadian Human Rights 
Act and is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Employment Equity Act.3 Both 
laws ensure that the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination are followed in 
all areas of federal jurisdiction. Citizens, permanent residents or persons legally present in 
Canada can file complaints under the Canadian Human Rights Act with the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, however complaints may only be filed against federally 
regulated organizations, employers, unions and service providers, representing just 10 per 
cent of organizations.4 All other cases must be addressed to the provincial and territorial 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>16. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act, adopted in July 1988, requires federally 
regulated institutions, in all their activities, to be sensitive and responsive to the 
multicultural reality of Canada. They are responsible for ensuring equal opportunity for 
employment in federal institutions, enhancing the ability of individuals and communities to 
contribute to the continuing evolution of Canada, enhancing the understanding of and 
respect for the diversity of the members of Canadian society, collecting statistical data, and

 Discrimination cases can be brought against federally regulated employers and service providers: 
</p>
<p>federal departments, agencies and Crown corporations; chartered banks; airlines; television and radio 
stations; interprovincial communications and telephone companies; buses and railways that travel 
between provinces; First Nations; other federally regulated industries. </p>

<p>making use of language skills and cultural understandings.5 The federal Multiculturalism 
Program encourages federal institutions to meet their obligations under the Act and aims to 
remove barriers related to ethnicity, race, culture and religion. 
</p>
<p>17. Most provinces and territories have multiculturalism legislation or policies, 
including British Columbia which adopted its Multiculturalism Act in 1993, and Ontario 
which adopted a Ministry of Citizenship and Culture Act in 1982. Quebec designates its 
policy as &#8220;inter-culturalism&#8221; and has a Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. Specific legislation and protection bodies exist in the provinces of Canada. The 
Human Rights Code of Ontario is administered by the Ontario Human Rights Commission 
and the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. The province&#8217;s Human Rights Legal Support 
Centre also provides legal services to individuals. The British Columbia Human Rights 
Code created the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, an independent, quasi-judicial 
body responsible for accepting, screening, mediating and adjudicating human rights 
complaints. The Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms covers civil and political 
rights as well as economic and social rights. The Human Rights and Youth Rights 
Commission is responsible for promoting and upholding the Quebec Charter and a Human 
Rights Tribunal hears cases referred by the Commission.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. Minority spokespersons highlighted concerns regarding the erosion of avenues of 
redress for victims of discrimination. They note that in 2007 the investigatory powers of the 
Ontario Commission were diluted. Charges of political correctness, bias and criticism of 
evidential standards have reportedly served to create a negative environment in which 
Commissions conduct their work. Muslim representatives described a backlash against 
Commissions following cases that Muslim groups have asked them to consider. Some 
perceive this as a part of a wider climate of hostility against Muslims when they attempt to 
raise their concerns. 
</p>
<p>20. Minority spokespersons cite the abolition of the British Columbia Human Rights 
Commission in 2003 and attacks on other provincial or territorial bodies that provide 
accessible and affordable avenues of complaint. While cases are heard by the British 
Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, the Commission is no longer available to assist victims 
with the preparation of cases, conduct investigations, prepare reports, offer advisory 
services, monitor government policy or conduct public education. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government notes that review of the British Columbia Human Rights 
Commission revealed inefficiencies, delays in processing complaints and a high percentage 
of complaints dismissed. British Columbia replaced the Commission with direct access to 
the Human Rights Tribunal. According to the Government, the Tribunal is reportedly able 
to process a complaint, notify respondents, provide mediation services and schedule a 
hearing date within six months, whereas some complaints previously took up to three years 
to resolve. A Human Rights Clinic provides assistance, including legal representation to 
eligible complainants and respondents. The Clinic is mandated to deliver a public education 
programme on the British Columbia Human Rights Code and deal with requests for 
information. 
</p>
<p>22. Minorities criticized the abolition of the Court Challenges Program. This national 
initiative, previously funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage, provided financial 
assistance to linguistic and disadvantaged minority groups and individuals to initiate court 
challenges which sought to clarify matters related to constitutional rights and freedoms, 
equality and official language rights. The Program was discussed positively in Canada&#8217;s

equality and linguistic provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&#8221;. 
Despite this, in September 2006 the funding for the Program was terminated. Funding was 
partially restored under the Program to Support Linguistic Rights in 2008, however not for 
other, non-linguistic minority and discrimination issues. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to Statistics Canada research, the proportion of visible minorities who felt 
they had experienced discrimination was twice that of non-visible minorities. Overall, 81 
per cent of visible minorities who felt that they had experienced discrimination believed 
that it was because of their race or ethnic origin. The Ethnic Diversity Survey (EDS)6 
revealed that about 20 per cent of visible minorities reported experiences of discrimination 
sometimes or often, compared to 10 per cent of non-visible minorities. Nearly 32 per cent 
of blacks said that they had experienced discrimination sometimes or often. About 21 per 
cent of South Asians and 18 per cent of Chinese respondents reported experiencing 
discrimination. Discrimination was most often experienced at work or in a store or bank. 
</p>
<p>24. A 2003 survey7 reported that 74 per cent of Canadians polled believe that racism is 
prevalent in Canada. Muslim and Arab groups highlight research conducted in 2007 
revealing that 47 per cent of respondents confessed to some racist views and that their 
prejudice is &#8220;planted firmly at the door of Arab and Muslim minorities&#8221;.<footnote name="8">0. Muslims are the least likely of all faith communities to exercise the franchise and 
Muslim women have a lower propensity to vote than men. In Vancouver, Chinese 
community representatives discussed progress in their representation in localities with large 
Chinese communities. However, this is not matched by strong representation at provincial, 
territorial or national levels.  
</footnote> African Canadian 
representatives stated that anti-black racism must be understood in the context of a history 
rooted in the maintenance and perpetuation of stereotypes of African Canadians as inferior, 
overly aggressive and prone to criminality. 
</p>
<p>25. In March 2005, A Canada for All: Canada&#8217;s Action Plan Against Racism was 
adopted. The Action Plan acknowledged that racism and discrimination exist and that a 
comprehensive strategy and programme of action is required. Six key priority areas seek: 
(a) to assist victims and groups vulnerable to racism and discrimination; (b) to develop 
forward-looking approaches to promote diversity and combat racism; (c) to strengthen the 
role of civil society; (d) to strengthen regional and international cooperation; (e) to educate 
children and youth on diversity and anti-racism; and (f) to counter hate and bias. 
26. The Government notes that the Action Plan represents a concerted effort across 
organizations to advance inclusiveness through over 40 existing programmes and 
initiatives, 6 new initiatives and $Can 56 million allocated over 5 years. It claims positive 
results in key areas: workplace discrimination, youth integration, hate crime reporting, race-
based issues in the justice system, and institutional change within public institutions to 
remove systemic barriers. The Government states that its Multiculturalism Program 
continues to achieve success through important public education initiatives, research and 
policy development, and support and grants to civil society and public institutions. 
</p>
<p>27. A variety of provincial initiatives have been established. In 2008, Quebec adopted 
the policy &#8220;Diversity: An Added Value&#8221;, primarily focused on combating racism and racial 
discrimination. An action plan proposes measures targeting education, the exercise of

<p>28. The following sections consider discrimination in the key policy areas of poverty, 
education, employment, policing and national security. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>29. Minority representatives consider that discrimination, racism and educational and 
economic inequality are key causal factors in the disproportionate poverty experienced by 
people of colour. blacks in Ottawa are five times more likely to be poor than the non-visible 
minority population. About 60 per cent of all employed black Canadians earn less than 
$20,000 per year, compared to 55 per cent of all visible minorities and only 37 per cent of 
non-visible minorities.9 
</p>
<p>30. In Toronto, between 1980 and 2000 the number of non-racialized families living in 
poverty fell by 28 per cent. In comparison the number of racialized families in poverty rose 
by 361 per cent.10 The research stated that there had been a major shift in the resident 
profile of higher poverty neighbourhoods, with poor visible minority and immigrant 
families making up far larger percentages of the total &#8220;poor&#8221; family population in those 
neighbourhoods. Minority representatives in Ontario, including the Colour of Poverty 
Campaign believe that, nationwide, initiatives have failed to address the poverty of 
racialized communities. 
</p>
<p>31. The African Canadian Legal Clinic notes that approximately 44 per cent of African 
Canadian children live in poverty.11 The Roots of Youth Violence study by the Government 
of Ontario highlights that the levels, concentration and circumstances surrounding child 
poverty contribute to youth violence, lack of accessible services, health issues and 
educational achievement. Black children are more likely to grow up in low income 
neighbourhoods and housing and are further stigmatized by their living conditions. Food 
insecurity is reportedly a growing problem for some African Canadians. High levels of 
poverty are a significant factor contributing to a higher incidence of poor health among 
affected groups. 
</p>
<p>32. Ontario&#8217;s Poverty Reduction Strategy (2008) includes policies focusing on reducing 
child poverty, supporting education initiatives, addressing the needs of low income 
households, and addressing poverty affecting new immigrant communities. There is no 
targeted focus on black, Asian and other minority groups or explicit recognition of the role 
that discrimination plays in poverty. The Quebec Government Action Plan to Combat 
Poverty and Social Exclusion published in 2004 includes, among other things, measures to 
support the socio-occupational integration of visible minority groups, and recognizes 
challenges and discrimination facing groups including the black English-speaking

<p>community. In British Columbia specific initiatives focus on addressing high levels of child 
poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Education 
</b></p>
<p>33. Provincial or territorial governments establish and implement education policies 
with the devolution of certain measures of control to municipal and district school boards. 
Black Canadian sources in particular stated that systemic racism in education is manifested 
in the ideologies, structures, policies and practices within the education system, at all levels 
throughout Canada. They complained that the issue of racism is rarely addressed in schools 
and that a focus on &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; does not adequately address 
inequality. 
</p>
<p>34. Dropout rates among students from certain minority groups are considerably higher 
than the average. The Toronto District School Board&#8217;s 2006 Student Survey found that 
dropout rates of English-speaking black students with a Caribbean heritage were 40 per 
cent. Central and South American students experienced dropout rates of 37 per cent and the 
rate for students of East-African descent was 32 per cent. In some low-income localities 
with a high percentage of ethnic minorities, dropout rates were reported to be far higher. 
The poor educational outcomes of black boys are particularly worrying. 
</p>
<p>35. Minority communities reported school curriculums that neglect their heritage, 
cultures and religions, or contributions to Canadian society. Teachers, principals and school 
councils continue to be predominantly white even in localities with high proportions of 
people of colour. A study of Toronto&#8217;s teachers showed that roughly 23 per cent are visible 
minorities &#8211; yet 7 in 10 high-school students are minorities.12 Approaches to learning and 
the school environment do not respond to different learning cultures or the specific needs of 
children of colour. Wide disparities are reported among school boards and within school 
districts in how issues of race, exclusion and inequity are addressed. Minority 
representatives call for more inclusive learning environments and Afro-centred 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>36. Ontario&#8217;s Ministry of Education notes that its Equity and Inclusive Education 
Strategy provides a framework to identify and remove discriminatory biases and systemic 
barriers to student achievement. With the Ontario Human Rights Commission the Ministry 
is working to provide joint training sessions for the education sector as part of the 
province&#8217;s commitment to an equitable and inclusive education system.<b> </b>Ontario has set a 
target of an 85 per cent graduation rate by 2010&#8211;2011. Additional supports, including credit 
schemes for struggling students, seek to enable eligible students to overcome barriers to 
graduation. 
</p>
<p>37. Minority representatives believe that the Safe Schools Act and &#8220;zero-tolerance 
programs&#8221;, implemented in Ontario since 2001, impose a security and disciplinary regime 
that has targeted and negatively impacted on black students. They claim that the legislation, 
which allows police presence in some schools, promotes racial profiling of black, Hispanic 
and some Asian students. School principals have broad powers to suspend or expel students 
considered a threat to safety. Community representatives claimed that 80 per cent of 
students expelled under the legislation are from visible minority groups &#8211; most commonly 
black students. Expulsion greatly increases the likelihood of permanent dropout. Some

<p>commentators described Safe School policies as a &#8220;pipeline into the criminal justice 
system&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. The government of Ontario notes that a comprehensive review of the safe schools 
provisions of the Education Act was conducted and amendments passed (Bill 212 and 
associated regulations in 2007) to more effectively combine discipline with opportunities 
for students to continue their education. Disciplinary measures are to be applied, it states, 
within a framework that shifts the focus from solely punitive to both corrective and 
supportive interventions. The government of British Columbia notes that its &#8220;Make a Case 
against Racism&#8221; programme is an example of a positive programme which encourages 
students to take personal responsibility for preventing racism, while celebrating cultural 
diversity through music and art. 
</p>
<p>39. The independent expert visited Ryerson Community School, which services a 
diverse ethno-cultural and linguistic community and is part of the Model Schools for Inner 
Cities Initiative of Toronto District School Board. This school demonstrates an impressive 
commitment to anti-racist education and positive practices in education. These include: a 
school council including numerous community representatives; enhanced opportunities for 
parent involvement; the Parenting and Literacy Centre as an important link between home 
and school; and a network of community links and partnerships with community-based 
social and support organizations. </p>
<p><b> C. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>40. Employment discrimination on the basis of race is prohibited by the Canadian 
Human Rights Act and provincial and territorial human rights codes. The federal 
Employment Equity Act of 1995 (which amended the 1986 Act) applies to federally 
regulated employers and industries including banks, broadcasters, telecommunications 
companies, railroad companies, airlines and transportation companies &#8211; approximately 12 
per cent of Canada&#8217;s labour market, totalling about 1,527 employers and 1.94 million 
employees. The majority of private employers and their staff fall under provincial and 
territorial jurisdiction. The Act aims to provide equal opportunities in employment to 
designated protected groups: women; persons with disabilities; aboriginal peoples; and 
visible minorities. The Canadian Human Rights Commission monitors compliance and 
conducts employment equity audits of employers, including their implementation of special 
measures and the &#8220;accommodation of differences&#8221;. </p>
<p>41. No province has a law that is analogous with the federal Employment Equity Act. 
Most Canadian provinces have employment equity policies that apply to provincial and 
territorial government and private employers within a framework of non-discrimination 
legislation that prohibits discrimination including in employment. Minority representatives 
highlight that legislation and policy initiatives suffer from poor implementation and 
enforcement. </p>
<p>42. Some minorities asserted that they experience discrimination in access to 
employment based upon their colour, ethnic origin or their religion. Census data from 2006 
reveals that, nationally, blacks (not disaggregated by Statistics Canada) experienced 
unemployment rates of 10.7 per cent, West Asians (including Iranian and Afghan, among 
others) 10.7 per cent, and Arabs 13 per cent, compared to non-visible minority 
unemployment rates of 6.2 per cent.13 Barriers to labour markets are experienced not only

<p>by recent immigrants, but by workers of colour generally, including Canadian-born 
minorities more highly educated than average. Minorities stated their belief that foreign or 
Muslim sounding names or addresses in low-income neighbourhoods were also the basis 
for discriminatory rejection of employment applications. 43. Research by the Canadian Labour Congress in 2006 revealed large and consistent 
gaps in economic security for workers of colour compared to other comparably educated 
and skilled workers. The research concluded that discrimination is an important 
contributing factor to their poor labour market outcomes. About 33 per cent of racialized 
workers overall and 51 per cent of black workers (a sub-set of all racialized workers) 
experienced racial discrimination. Racialized workers are most likely to be in low-status, 
low-skill, or precarious jobs, accounting for 45 per cent of workers in sewing and textile 
industries, over 43 per cent of taxi drivers and 45 per cent of electronics assemblers. </p>
<p>44. Canadians of Arab origin are twice as likely to have a university or post-graduate 
degree, yet experience unemployment rates among the highest in Canada at 13 per cent. 
Equally, poverty among Arab and Muslim communities is disproportionately high, which 
many attribute to discrimination, exclusion and income inequality. These trends are 
replicated within certain Asian communities, including the Chinese community, where 
significantly higher than average educational attainment is not translated into average levels 
of skilled, high-income or executive employment and workplace mobility. Racialized 
persons reportedly make up only 3 per cent of executives.14 
</p>
<p>45. Unemployment (16.5 per cent) among Muslim women is more than double the rate 
(7.2 per cent) for all women, despite their significantly higher levels of graduate education 
and professional qualifications. They are concentrated in low-paying, low-skill occupations 
and earn on average $16,010, compared with $22,885 for all women.15 Muslim women 
described &#8220;triple jeopardy&#8221; &#8211; intersectional discrimination based upon their identities as 
Muslims, as women and as people of colour.16 For Arab, West Asian, South Asian and 
African women in Toronto, the unemployment rate is over twice that of white Canadian 
women. One in four workers in Ontario earns below the poverty line. This number is higher 
for women overall (31 per cent) and women of colour especially (38 per cent).  
46. People of colour are underrepresented in public service employment. Following the 
enactment of the Employment Equity Act, the federal Government established the 
Perinbam Task Force on the Participation of Visible Minorities in the Federal Public 
Service<b> </b>in 2000, to advise on measures to increase representation and propose an action 
plan. Its recommendations,17 endorsed by Parliament, set targets for hiring one visible 
minority in every five new hires by 2003 and the same ratio for executive promotions by 
2005. Failure to implement these recommendations is reflected in an actual decline in

<p>visible minorities in the federal public service from 9.8 per cent in 2005&#8211;2006 to 8.7 per 
cent in 2006&#8211;2007,18 below the workforce availability estimate of 10.4 per cent. 
</p>
<p>47. The Public Service Commission and the National Council of Visible Minorities in 
the Federal Public Service challenge as false the arguments that few visible minority 
candidates apply for posts and that managers cannot find suitably qualified minorities. 
While statistics are not available, consultations with provincial and territorial government 
representatives also revealed underrepresentation in government employment. Of some 
26,000 members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in 2006 only 316 (1.2 per cent) 
were visible minorities. The Government acknowledges that the public service still has 
work to do to address critical issues affecting the recruitment, advancement and retention of 
visible minorities. 
</p>
<p>48. The issue of non-recognition of foreign credentials was raised as a long-standing and 
persistent problem. Many described a disconnect between the federal policy of promoting 
immigration to Canada of highly skilled people in fields including medicine and 
engineering, and employment restrictions imposed at the provincial or territorial level by 
professional regulatory bodies. They highlighted a lack of clarity, information and full 
disclosure at the pre-immigration stage, followed by inadequate support after immigration. 
</p>
<p>49. Affected individuals described having to take unskilled, low-wage employment, 
often for years, and the need to retrain in professions in which they were previously 
practitioners in order to meet provincial requirements. Some find themselves in a cycle of 
poverty and one community member stated: &#8220;The Government promotes qualified 
immigration and then lets those skills rot. It&#8217;s like a dream gone bad.&#8221; It is estimated that 6 
in 10 immigrants cannot find work in their chosen profession. Minority representatives 
point out that, even when credentials are recognized, discrimination results in continuing 
barriers to employment often on the grounds of &#8220;lack of Canadian experience&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. A Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign 
Qualifications was established through cooperation between government representatives 
and professional regulatory bodies. The framework provides a Canada-wide vision for 
immigrant labour market integration based on timeliness, transparency, consistency and 
fairness. In December 2009 the federal Government announced a fast-track process of 
recognition of foreign credentials and that credentials of individuals in eight fields would be 
assessed within a year regarding their compliance with Canadian standards. The Working in 
Canada website and the Foreign Credentials Referral Office aim to improve pre-
immigration information. In 2006, the Ontario government enacted the Fair Access to 
Regulated Professions Act to help ensure fair registration practices. 
</p>
<p>51. The federal Government notes that under Canada&#8217;s Action Plan Against Racism, the 
Racism-Free Workplace Strategy develops the tools, guidelines and educational materials 
required to facilitate the integration of skilled individuals, including visible minorities, into 
equitable and inclusive workplaces.19 Partnerships are built with and between different 
government departments and agencies, community and labour organizations, and the 
private sector. Through partnerships, the Government aims to raise awareness of the 
Racism-Free Workplace Strategy, while removing barriers to opportunity.

<p>52. Through the Welcoming Communities Initiative of the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration funding is allocated to regions and provinces to support ongoing anti-
racism activities, awareness-raising, outreach, direct services and tools and resource 
development. Funded projects have included community-based conferences, focus groups, 
workshops and committees.20 In 2008, British Columbia launched the Welcoming and 
Inclusive Communities and Workplaces Program to support the capacity of communities 
and workplaces in British Columbia to be inclusive. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Policing 
</b></p>
<p>53. Policing issues were raised in community consultations held in Regent Park, Jane 
and Finch and Thorncliffe Park in Toronto, the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver, and 
Montreal North. Persons belonging to African Canadian, Muslim, Arab and Latino 
communities reported feeling subject to unjustified police surveillance and experiencing 
negative interactions with the police, which they consider to be consistent with a practice of 
racial profiling.  
</p>
<p>54. Community members claim that derogatory stereotypes, such as characterizations of 
African Canadian criminality, violence and drug offences, or Muslim extremism, colour 
wider societal perceptions of black or Muslim males. They devalue whole communities and 
negate their sense of citizenship and belonging. Racial profiling and heavy-handed policing 
of minority neighbourhoods is blamed for disproportionate arrest rates and 
overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice system. Members of minority 
communities claim that racial profiling, police impunity and disproportionate use of force 
have resulted in deaths and serious injuries. 
55. Montreal North residents claim that investigations of police misconduct have not 
been independent. Rather, they characterize the current system as amounting to the police 
investigating the police. When a police officer is involved in a shooting, the investigation of 
whether the use of force was justified and proportional is given to the police force in 
another jurisdiction. Cases may be referred for prosecution by the Crown Prosecutor. But 
according to the investigations of a local journalist, over the past six years, 97 cases were 
investigated where civilians were injured or killed in police shootings, chases and arrests. 
Of those, only one was prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>56. Community members claim that reports and evidence related to investigations are 
withheld from them. They call for a comprehensive review of the process of investigation 
to ensure independence, the establishment of an independent civilian investigation authority 
board, full transparency and disclosure, an investigation into racial and religious profiling, 
and suspension of the use of tasers. 
</p>
<p>57. Montreal police representatives provided information on their policies,21 and 
highlighted a zero-tolerance policy with regard to profiling and racism. No police have 
been found guilty of profiling. They pointed to specialist expert committees established 
with advisory roles, including on racial profiling and with respect to specific communities. 
They rejected claims of excessive force and impunity.  
58. The Quebec government notes that independent investigations are launched 
systematically where a person has died or sustained serious injuries as a result of police 
actions or while being held in custody. Actions of police officers are scrutinized by civilian

<p>and police mechanisms, including the Police Ethics Commissioner and the Police Ethics 
Committee, which were established upon the recommendation of the Human Rights and 
Youth Rights Commission. However, police representatives acknowledged that the process 
currently fails to have the confidence of the community. 
</p>
<p>59. Work is under way to improve the system of independent investigations, providing 
additional guarantees regarding impartiality. 
</p>
<p>60. The action plan of the government of Quebec, entitled &#8220;Diversity: An Added 
Value&#8221;, contains measures focused on preventing discrimination and racial profiling within 
Quebec police forces, including education and measures to hire staff from cultural 
communities. On 19 October, 2009, the government of Ontario established the Office of the 
Independent Police Review Director as an arms-length agency to accept, process and 
oversee the investigation of public complaints against Ontario&#8217;s police. British Columbia 
has a Diversity Committee that examines policing issues. 
</p>
<p>61. There is currently no requirement for ethnically disaggregated data relating to the 
criminal justice system, including on stop-and-search rates or arrests. Between 1994 and 
2004, African Canadian inmates held in federal prisons comprised approximately 6 per cent 
of inmates while African Canadians comprised only 2 per cent of the population.22 The 
African Canadian Legal Clinic expressed serious concerns regarding disproportionately 
high incarceration rates of African Canadian women, many on drug-related offences. They 
stressed that solutions must be considered in the wider context of social inequality and 
poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Profiling under national security legislation 
</b></p>
<p>62. The security certificates process is based on provisions within the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act (2001). Certificates can be issued to non-citizens as a preliminary 
step to detain and deport individuals on national security grounds. The independent expert 
met an individual who had been detained for considerable periods under security certificate 
provisions. He described his treatment as discriminatory and his detention as based only 
upon his profile as a man of Arab ethnicity. Numerous civil society groups claim the 
powers authorized under these laws are used indiscriminately, are targeted against Muslims 
and Arabs, resulting in discriminatory impact, and serve to re-enforce negative stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>63. The Government notes that the security certificate process is a legal immigration 
proceeding and not a criminal proceeding23 and that it is neither arbitrary nor 
indiscriminate. Its aim is to remove non-Canadians who pose a serious threat to national 
security or public safety. Certificates are issued in exceptional circumstances24 and with the 
approval of two Ministers. Security certificates are referred to a federal court judge who 
determines whether the application is reasonable. The federal Government is legally 
empowered to use classified information in closed proceedings, however, in 2007, the 
Supreme Court ruled that additional safeguards were required. In 2008, the Act to amend 
the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (certificate and special advocate) and to make 
a consequential amendment to another Act introduced &#8220;special advocates&#8221; to protect the 
interests of subjects during closed proceedings. The legislation requires regular reviews of

</p>
<p><b> IV. Identity, religion, language 
</b></p>
<p>64. Amongst initiatives to promote tolerance and knowledge of diversity within 
Canadian identity, the federal Government has initiated Black History Month, marked 
annually in February. It includes events that honour the legacy of black Canadians and raise 
awareness of their long history in Canada, their experiences and contributions to Canadian 
society, past and present. Official literature acknowledges the relative absence of people of 
African descent from Canadian history books. Asian Heritage Month in May recognizes 
similar omissions and seeks similar objectives in respect to Canada&#8217;s varied Asian 
communities, while recognizing past injustices. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>65. Freedom of religion is protected in Canada under section 2 (a) of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The purpose of section 2 (a) is to ensure that society does 
not interfere with profoundly personal beliefs that govern one&#8217;s perception of oneself, 
humankind, nature, and, in some cases, a higher or different order of being. The Supreme 
Court has interpreted freedom of conscience and religion very broadly and has 
acknowledged that it is not restricted to major and recognizable religions.  
66. Minorities were positive about the extent of freedom to express their religious 
identity and consider that Canada offers an enabling environment. However, Muslim 
community members expressed concerns over increasing Islamophobia within mainstream 
society. Some described anxiety over openly expressing their faith, supporting Islamic 
schools or promoting Muslim rights, lest they be perceived as extremists. A rise in anti-
Islamic sentiment is leading some to question their equality and their ability to speak out 
openly about Muslim issues.  
</p>
<p>67. A debate on &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; of racial, ethnic and religious differences 
and practices undertaken in Quebec since 2006 has, some claim, taken on racist dimensions 
and revealed prejudices. Muslims and others point to a &#8220;false crisis&#8221; created by the media 
regarding Islam in Canada despite census statistics revealing that Muslims form little over 
2.5 per cent of the population. Muslim women&#8217;s groups highlight that stereotypes about 
Muslim women differ markedly from reality and help to fuel anti-Muslim sentiment. 
</p>
<p>68. In 2003 the Ontario Human Rights Commission launched an examination into the 
human cost of profiling in social institutions for individuals, their families and their 
communities. Having identified more than 800 personal accounts, the Commission said the 
practice may lead to alienation, an eventual mistrust of Canada&#8217;s institutions, and a 
weakened sense of citizenship for targeted racial and ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>69. Polls carried out in 200925 revealed that only 28 per cent nationally had a &#8220;generally 
favourable opinion&#8221; of Islam compared to 72 per cent for Christianity. About 45 per cent of 
those polled said that they believe that Islam encourages violence. Muslims and Arab 
representatives stated that negative stereotypes abound in Canadian society including in the 
mass media and entertainment industry and have been reinforced since September 2001.

<p>Arabs and Muslims described discriminatory treatment, detention, interrogation and 
fingerprinting by immigration officials and consular services and pointed out incidents 
revealing marked contrasts in the experiences of Arabs and Muslims in comparison to white 
Canadians.  
</p>
<p>70. The government of<b> </b>British Columbia noted that within its multiculturalism and anti-
racism programme, entitled &#8220;EmbraceBC&#8221;, a specific programme element called &#8220;Interfaith 
Bridging&#8221; exists. In recognition of intersectional identities (such as race, gender, religion, 
etc.), Interfaith Bridging promotes the building of relationships between diverse, 
established faith communities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Language issues 
</b></p>
<p>71. The official language provisions in the Charter serve to preserve and promote the 
two official languages of Canada and the cultures represented by those languages, by 
ensuring that each language flourishes in provinces where it is not spoken by the majority. 
Section 23 aims at achieving this goal by granting minority language educational rights to 
minority language parents throughout Canada. In addition to the minority language rights 
contained in the Charter, the Official Languages Act is the cornerstone of Canada&#8217;s 
legislative and regulatory regime of language rights protections.  
</p>
<p>72. The 2006 Census revealed that 98 per cent of Canadian residents speak at least one 
official language, English or French. However about 20 per cent of Canadians (roughly 6.1 
million people) speak a different mother-tongue language. Immigration trends have resulted 
in significant growth in the number of people speaking non-European languages including 
Chinese, South Asian and African languages. However, minority representatives noted that 
government policy is geared towards promoting the universal knowledge of and equality of 
official languages, rather than the teaching of non-official languages. 
</p>
<p>73. The federal Multiculturalism Act aims to, among other things, &#8220;preserve and 
enhance the use of languages other than English and French&#8221;, and some support has been 
provided to ethno-cultural communities via multiculturalism programmes. Teaching of 
mother-tongue languages is generally based upon community classes and the initiatives of 
individual school boards. The Toronto District School Board operates the International 
Languages Elementary Program in some Toronto schools. Students learn mother-tongue 
languages including Arabic and Cantonese as extra-curriculum activities in which parents 
contribute as teaching assistants. The government of Quebec offers members of minority 
communities courses in some 20 languages other than French and English. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Protection against violence 
</b></p>
<p>74. A Statistics Canada 2004 General Social Survey found race or ethnic origin was the 
most commonly cited motive for hate crime incidents (66 per cent of all hate-motivated 
incidents). In just over 3 per cent of all crimes victims believed that the crime had been 
motivated by hate. However, for incidents in which the victim was a visible minority the 
proportion is over 7 per cent. Research on hate crimes in 2007 reveals that 33 per cent of 
the victims of all racially motivated hate crimes were black, decreased from 48 per cent in 
2006.26

<p>75. Muslims and Arabs described a more hostile post-September 2001 environment in 
which they feel increasingly targeted by racism, Islamophobia and hatred. Muslim groups 
described increasing incidents of vandalism of mosques and Muslim schools, hate crimes 
against individual Muslims, negative portrayals of Islam in the media and anti-Muslim 
sentiments among the general public. They expressed the need for stronger protection 
measures and action against racism. In Quebec, a preliminary report on hate crimes is 
expected in 2010. 
</p>
<p>76. The Department of Justice implements key objectives of Canada&#8217;s Action Plan 
Against Racism, focusing on race-based issues in the justice system, interventions for 
victims and perpetrators of hate crimes, and countering Internet-based hate crimes. These 
constitute the Department&#8217;s strategy to sustain equality before the law. In 2007&#8211;2008 the 
Department supported initiatives to combat the proliferation of hate propaganda on the 
Internet, including a national stakeholders meeting which brought together participants 
from community organizations. 
</p>
<p>77. Violence within poor localities with high ethnic minority populations is a problem 
that minority representatives consider cannot be disassociated from poor educational 
outcomes, economic inequality, poverty and the relative lack of opportunities open to 
young people of colour. Gang-related and drug crime must consequently be addressed by 
social policy responses as well as policing initiatives.

<p><b> VI. Political participation of minorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11860 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>83. Elections Canada has specific initiatives to promote minority participation including 
multilanguage advertising and information campaigns in over 25 languages; website-based 
voter information; targeted information communications (made available to 573 ethno-
cultural associations); and community relations officers to disseminate voter information to 
ethno-cultural communities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations of the independent expert 
</b>84. <b>Canada is rightly proud of its richly diverse society including citizens with 
many ethnic backgrounds, numerous languages, religions and cultural practices. 
Many identify themselves as African or black Canadians, Arab and Asian Canadians, 
people of colour and religious minorities. Persons belonging to minorities generally 
described Canada as a society where they can express their identities, speak their 
languages and practise their faiths freely and without hindrance. Canada has an 
impressive constitutional and legislative framework at the federal, provincial and 
territorial levels that requires adherence to the core principles of equality and non-
discrimination for all. Canada was a leader in fashioning a State policy of 
multiculturalism and has invested considerable resources into meeting the 
expectations of its Constitution and legislation.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Achieving a truly inclusive society requires constant vigilance. Significant and 
persistent problems face individuals and communities belonging to certain ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities. Many of those consulted believe that federal, 
provincial and territorial governments have not adequately implemented the 
impressive legislative and policy framework that exists. They have failed to respond 
adequately to their problems or to devise meaningful and enforceable solutions, 
leaving them and their communities feeling discriminated against and neglected. The 
following recommendations are proposed.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Take robust actions to achieve equality in employment  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>At all levels of Government and within the work of all relevant ministries it is 
essential that efforts to fully implement non-discrimination and equality guarantees be 
intensified. Appropriate penalties should be applied to those entities that fail to fully 
comply with standards for non-discrimination and equality as measured by a &#8220;results 
test&#8221;. Where current best efforts fail to achieve the equality objectives, robust 
affirmative action programmes should be implemented.</b>  
</p>
<p>87. <b>Federal, provincial and territorial Governments have useful legislation and 
policies in the field of employment equity. However there is a substantial 
implementation gap. Standards and requirements must be better enforced and 
penalties must be imposed to ensure that Canada&#8217;s workplaces, both public and 
private, truly reflect the diversity present in society and live up to the promise of 
equality.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Government must lead by example with robust efforts and measurable 
achievements in recruiting, retaining and promoting minorities to senior roles in the 
public service, ministries and departments. Government workplaces should be 
examples of enabling environments for the advancement of minorities. In this respect, 
the Perinbam Task Force on the Participation of Visible Minorities in the Federal 
Public Service established by the federal Government in 2000 provided a valuable 
action plan and recommendations that remain extremely relevant today. A decade 
later, its objectives remain unfulfilled. Those recommendations should be 
implemented fully at both federal and provincial or territorial levels.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-11860 
</p>
<p>89. <b>For some minority communities, including sectors of the African Canadian, 
Asian Canadian, Arab and immigrant community, consistently higher-than-average 
educational achievements do not translate into access to professional and skilled 
employment, labour mobility and wages commensurate with their educational 
outcomes. It must be recognized that discrimination plays a role in this equation. A 
disconnect between education and employment must be tackled by Government as an 
important issue of concern requiring policy implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Minorities are frustrated that highly qualified workers have been encouraged 
to migrate to Canada, but many find on their arrival that their qualifications are not 
recognized at the provincial or territorial level. Many professionals are unable to gain 
employment in their former professions despite critical shortages, including of doctors 
and nurses in some regions. Professionals who have practised prior to migrating have 
faced lengthy, expensive and unexpected hurdles to satisfy provincial requirements. 
Many must resort to low-skilled, low-waged employment for years forcing some to live 
in conditions of hardship and poverty. The clich&#233; of &#8220;doctors driving taxi cabs&#8221; 
resonates as reality for many minority professionals. While the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments are engaged in a collaborative process to address this long-
standing problem, efforts to find solutions should be intensified as a matter of 
urgency. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Disaggregate data currently labelled as &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Data disaggregated along ethnic and religious lines, as well as gender, is 
essential to reveal hidden inequalities and to provide a key resource for informed 
policy responses. Statistics Canada has done excellent work in the field of data 
collection and analysis. However demographic changes, including rapidly growing 
minority populations, are making new demands for deeper levels of disaggregation to 
keep pace with shifts in the economic and social status of specific minority 
communities. Digging deeper into demographic data can give recognition to even 
greater diversity in Canadian society. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>While the category called &#8220;visible minority&#8221; in the Employment Equity Act was 
at one time a positive step to acknowledge minority communities, it is now too broad 
to give a realistic picture of the achievements of or problems faced by distinct 
communities. Certain communities, particularly those with African heritage, feel 
strongly that this terminology, under which their data is captured, leads inevitably to 
the neglect of their specific identities and situations.</b>  
</p>
<p>93. <b>Consultations revealed the interchangeable and overlapping use of terms 
including &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; and &#8220;cultural communities&#8221;. A lack of 
clarity exists between and within different levels of Government, which may impact 
on the effectiveness of measures to address the issues of distinct population groups. 
Many positive policies appear targeted towards &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, while few seem to 
speak directly to the experiences of established minority communities experiencing 
long-standing problems and discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>&#8220;Unpacking&#8221; the visible minority data is a first essential step towards 
recognition that a wide variety of experiences exist among different minority groups. 
Statistics Canada should hold nationwide consultations with various communities to 
develop terminology and a nomenclature based on the exercise of those communities&#8217; 
right to self-identification. Consultations should determine the categories used in the 
future to disaggregate data for reporting and policymaking purposes. Consideration 
should be given to amending the Employment Equity Act to use corresponding 
terminology.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11860 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>All data should be further disaggregated by sex to reveal how the situation of 
women in each racial/ethnic category differs from the experiences of men in those 
categories. That would enable Status of Women Canada to play a more effective role 
in policymaking with respect to minority women.</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Target poverty elimination policies to the special needs of ethnic/racial and religious 
minorities 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Federal and provincial or territorial governments acknowledge that poverty is 
a problem disproportionately faced by people of colour, including African Canadian 
and specific Asian Canadian communities. Income levels generally are significantly 
lower for minorities, unemployment rates are higher and minorities are 
disproportionately living in the poorest neighbourhoods and in social housing with 
relatively poor access to services. A cycle of poverty is set in place from which it is 
difficult to escape. Policy responses and specific anti-poverty measures should be 
holistic and must recognize the complex causes of poverty that include discrimination 
targeted towards minorities because of the colour of their skin and the resulting social 
and economic exclusion. Consequently, poverty alleviation programmes must be 
targeted towards racialized communities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comprehensively address inequalities in educational outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Black Canadians and some Asian Canadian communities are concerned that 
their children are having negative experiences in public schools. Data reveals that 
dropout rates are particularly high among boys from these communities. The current 
discourse and rhetoric of multicultural education appears to be failing these children. 
Community members described approaches to education that do not take into account 
their different cultures of learning, curriculum and textbooks that ignore their 
histories and contributions to Canadian society and a gross underrepresentation of 
minorities in the teaching and school administrative staff.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>It is vital to fully recognize the challenges facing minority children and to 
address these throughout the learning experience. Safe Schools legislation should be 
reviewed to ensure that its implementation is conducive to a positive learning 
environment and is not discriminatory. The independent expert draws the 
Government&#8217;s attention to the recommendations regarding minorities and the right to 
education from the first session of the Forum on Minority Issues (see 
A/HRC/10/11/Add.1). 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Increase political participation of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Political participation and representation enables minorities to have a voice in 
decision-making bodies. However, at the federal, provincial/territorial and municipal 
levels minorities are poorly represented in political structures and institutions. 
Minorities must be proactive in their engagement and participation in political 
processes. At the same time, more must be done to empower them to do so and 
attention must be given by all political actors, including political parties, to improve 
the representation of minorities. The independent expert wishes to draw attention to 
the recommendations of the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues on 
minorities and effective political participation (A/HRC/13/25) and urges appropriate 
implementation of these recommendations.  </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>  Take effective steps to protect against profiling and establish community confidence in 
unbiased policing 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Minority communities raised serious issues regarding policing, including racial 
profiling as a systemic practice, biased, heavy-handed policing of some communities 
and allegations of excessive use of force leading to deaths, particularly of young black 
males. Perceptions persist that the police act with impunity in some localities and that 
investigations are not conducted by independent authorities or civilian review boards. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>It is essential that investigations into serious allegations of police misconduct 
have the confidence of communities concerned, are carried out by bodies that are 
perceived by communities to be independent and that mechanisms of civilian 
oversight are strengthened where they exist or established where they do not.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Initiatives by police authorities to strengthen community relations and enforce 
internal non-discrimination measures are welcome, but must be enhanced. Steps 
should be taken to dramatically increase minority employment in the national, 
provincial/territorial and municipal police forces. Requirements for reasonable 
suspicion should be established for all police stops. Statistics should be collected and 
publicly reported which anonymously identify the ethnicity of the subject each time an 
officer stops a person, noting the nature and justification for the action. Data should 
be retained to assess what percentage of those stops has resulted in grounds for arrest 
and convictions. Disaggregated data should be required throughout the criminal 
justice system and publicly reported annually, as a measure to enforce bans on racial 
profiling.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Oversight mechanisms should be strengthened with respect to scrutiny of the 
necessity and proportionality regarding the use of force by a police officer in every 
case. The methods of scrutiny should allow a comparison between the frequency and 
severity of force used in situations involving minority as opposed to majority 
community individuals. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ensure that counter-terrorism measures meet human rights standards and avoid 
profiling 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Members of Muslim and Arab communities commonly reported that 
Government policies post September 2001 have made them feel targeted, profiled and 
harassed. They described indiscriminate, unfair and unjust treatment by federal, 
provincial or territorial authorities, the media and others. They described anxiety 
about speaking out about their concerns and expect a backlash when they seek 
avenues of redress. They are concerned about racial profiling and the use of Security 
Certificates based on unsubstantiated information. They perceive they have a second 
class citizenship when they are abroad and require the assistance of the Canadian 
authorities and consular services. Steps must be taken to address these concerns, 
answer allegations, and to build positive relations and confidence among communities 
that feel targeted by national security legislation.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Strengthen mechanisms of redress and access to justice throughout the country 
</b>105. <b>The Constitution of Canada recognizes the authority of provincial or territorial 
governments in such fields as education, non-federally regulated employment, the 
delivery of health care and social services. These are critical responsibilities with 
respect to equality in the protection of social and economic rights.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The constitutional arrangement of shared responsibility for human rights 
between federal Government and provincial/territorial governments has resulted in 
an uneven and unclear enforcement system that varies between provinces. The federal </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11860 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government, in close cooperation with provincial or territorial authorities, must work 
towards stronger mechanisms of cooperation to guarantee consistent enforcement 
with respect to obligations under the provisions of international treaties, particularly 
in the area of non-discrimination and equality and the implementation of the rights of 
persons belonging to minority groups.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Where provincial/territorial governments fail, the federal Government must 
take a vigorous approach to influencing matters that are otherwise considered within 
the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial or territorial governments. The federal 
Government has placed conditions on provincial governments in the exercise of its 
spending powers. Using that authority to exercise control over provincial or local 
actions when necessary to guarantee the rights of minorities to equality should be 
considered in the national interest regardless of whether the matter falls within the 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</b>108. <b>Minorities feel that certain mechanisms of redress are inaccessible, 
underfunded and under threat, particularly the Human Rights Commissions. 
Additionally, the Court Challenges Program which provided critical support for 
enforcing constitutional guarantees has been defunded. This has led some 
communities to perceive an erosion of their avenues for redress and to lose faith in the 
effectiveness of these critical enforcement bodies. Human Rights Commissions and 
other independent advisory and monitoring bodies have an essential role to play in the 
promotion and protection of human rights and should be adequately resourced in 
order to carry out their work. The independent expert recommends review of the 
abolition of the Court Challenges Program, particularly the Equality Rights Program.
