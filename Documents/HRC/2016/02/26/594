</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council, 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council concerning terrorism, 
</p>
<p>including Assembly resolutions 46/51 of 9 December 1991, 60/288 of 8 September 2006, 
</p>
<p>64/297 of 8 September 2010, 66/10 of 18 November 2011 on the United Nations Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Centre established on the initiative of the United Nations and Saudi Arabia, and 
</p>
<p>68/178 of 18 December 2013, as well as Commission resolution 2004/44 of 19 April 2004 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights Council resolution 25/7 of 27 March 2014, and reaffirming its 
</p>
<p>commitment to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 60/28 of 8 September 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the objectives of countering terrorism and of the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights are not conflicting but complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>

<p><i>Taking note</i> of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism,1  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>its strongest condemnation </i>of the continuing heinous acts of terrorism 
</p>
<p>that have indiscriminately caused enormous loss of human life, destruction and damage to 
</p>
<p>societies, detrimentally affected human rights, such as the right to life and security of 
</p>
<p>person, undermined the rule of law and democratic freedoms, threatened socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>development and impeded the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>that are indispensable for human dignity and development of the human personality, thus 
</p>
<p>representing a grave threat to international peace and security, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and 
</p>
<p>manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms and democracy, thus threatening territorial integrity and the security of States and 
</p>
<p>destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, and that the international community 
</p>
<p>should take the necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> <i>unequivocally</i> all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its 
</p>
<p>forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, regardless of their 
</p>
<p>motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing its commitment to strengthen 
</p>
<p>international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at the fact that some grave crimes committed by terrorist 
</p>
<p>groups, including mercenaries and foreign fighters, have targeted persons and groups on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their ethnic and religious background, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States must ensure that any measures taken to counter terrorism 
</p>
<p>should be in line with national legislations and in conformity with international law, in 
</p>
<p>particular international human rights law and international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolution 16/18 of 24 March 2011 and the Rabat Plan of Action on the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hostility or violence as important tools to counter violent extremism, and 
</p>
<p>calling for their effective implementation by the international community as a means to 
</p>
<p>deprive radical groups and individuals of any justification for violent extremism on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of ethno-religious stigmatization and discrimination, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all terrorist acts, and expresses grave concern at their 
</p>
<p>detrimental effects on human rights, including the right to life, liberty and security of 
</p>
<p>person; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns </i>all terrorist acts on State institutions, public sites, individual 
</p>
<p>property, national monuments and historical and cultural relics; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that terrorist groups have targeted entire population 
</p>
<p>segments indiscriminately, and in some cases on the basis of their ethnic and religious 
</p>
<p>backgrounds; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms</i> the primary responsibility of the State to protect its citizens against 
</p>
<p>terrorism; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> all States to deny all forms of support for terrorist groups, including 
</p>
<p>financial support, and to deny safe haven to those who incite, plan, finance, support or 
</p>
<p>commit terrorist acts; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>6. <i>Reiterates</i> the obligation of States to prevent and suppress the financing of 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts, including ransom payment, and to criminalize the wilful provision or 
</p>
<p>collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their 
</p>
<p>territories, with the intention that the funds be used, or with the knowledge that they are to 
</p>
<p>be used, to carry out terrorist acts; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States to take appropriate measures to duly investigate the incitement, 
</p>
<p>preparation, instigation or commission of acts of terrorism and, where appropriate, to 
</p>
<p>prosecute, convict and punish those engaged in such acts in accordance with national 
</p>
<p>criminal laws and procedure; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to strengthen further their national laws and mechanisms 
</p>
<p>on countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Condemns</i> incitement to violence and terrorism by any means, in particular 
</p>
<p>through the media, and highlights in that regard the complex challenges associated with the 
</p>
<p>increasing use of social media and information and communications technology in inciting 
</p>
<p>violence and terrorism; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> <i>its unequivocal condemnation</i> of all acts, methods, practices and 
</p>
<p>financing of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, renews its commitment to strengthen 
</p>
<p>international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, and in that regard calls upon 
</p>
<p>States and relevant regional and subregional organizations, as appropriate, to continue to 
</p>
<p>implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> all national and regional institutions and relevant civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, as appropriate, to advance tolerance and non-violence and more broadly to 
</p>
<p>promote initiatives to build resilience against the recruitment of terrorists; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its solidarity</i> with the victims of terrorism and their families, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the importance of considering the needs of the victims of terrorism and 
</p>
<p>preserving their human rights in such a way that requires the enhancement of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation and the exchange of expertise in that respect; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Encourages</i> States to provide satisfaction, reparation and rehabilitation for 
</p>
<p>victims in accordance with the relevant national laws from within available resources; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Urges</i> States and the international community to take measures, including 
</p>
<p>through education, awareness-raising, the media and human rights educational activities 
</p>
<p>and training, to effectively address the root causes of terrorism and the factors that make 
</p>
<p>individuals and groups more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism and increase their 
</p>
<p>propensity to be recruited by terrorists; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Invites</i> all treaty bodies, special procedures mandate holders, relevant 
</p>
<p>international and regional human rights mechanisms, and the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, within their respective mandates, to pay due attention to 
</p>
<p>the negative impact of terrorism on the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-ninth session, a panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>effects of terrorism on the enjoyment by all persons of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms, and requests the High Commissioner to liaise with States and all stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including the relevant United Nations bodies, agencies, and programmes, treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders, national human rights institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, with a view to ensuring their participation in the panel discussion; </p>


<p>17. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the panel discussion 
</p>
<p>in the form of a summary, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session.
