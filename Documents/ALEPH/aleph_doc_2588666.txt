·Operating and maintenance expense was $500 million, down from $665 million in the prior
period;
·Net income attributable to controlling interest was $77 million, $0.21 per diluted share,
compared with $249 million, $0.68 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016;
·Adjusted net income was $64 million, $0.17 per diluted share, excluding $13 million of net
favorable items.  This compares with $254 million, $0.69 per diluted share, in the prior quarter,
excluding $5 million of net unfavorable items;
·The Annual Effective Tax Rate(1) was 16.3 percent, compared with 22.8 percent in the
first quarter of 2016;
·Cash flows from operating activities were $207 million, compared with $631 million in the
previous quarter;

·Contract backlog was $13.7 billion as of the July 2016 Fleet Status Report.
ZUG, SWITZERLAND—August 3, 2016—Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) today reported net
income attributable to controlling interest of $77 million, $0.21 per diluted share, for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.  Second quarter 2016 results included net favorable items of
$13 million, $0.04 per diluted share, as follows:
·$38 million, $0.10 per diluted share, in net gains on early debt retirements; and
·$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, associated with gains on rig disposals and discontinued
operations.
These net favorable items were partially offset by:
·$18 million, $0.04 per diluted share, related to the loss on impairment of assets;
·$7 million, $0.02 per diluted share, in restructuring costs including employee severance; and
·$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, in discrete tax expense.
After consideration of these net favorable items, second quarter 2016 adjusted net income was
$64 million, or $0.17 per diluted share.
For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the company reported a net income attributable to
controlling interest of $342 million, or $0.93 per diluted share.  The second quarter of 2015
included net unfavorable items of $66 million, $0.18 per diluted share, associated with losses on
the impairment of the midwater floater asset group and other assets classified as held for sale,
partially offset by Macondo-related settlements and insurance recoveries.  After consideration of
these net unfavorable items, adjusted net income was $408 million, or $1.11 per diluted share.
Contract drilling revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016, decreased $193 million
sequentially to $918 million due primarily to lower rig utilization(3) and dayrates.  The decrease
was partially offset by contributions from the newbuild, ultra‑deepwater drillships
Deepwater Proteus and Deepwater Thalassa and the reactivated harsh‑environment floater
Henry  Goodrich, and higher revenue efficiency.
Other revenues decreased $205 million sequentially to $25 million due primarily to significant
first quarter 2016 early contract termination fees.
Operating and maintenance expense was $500 million, down from $665 million in the previous
quarter.  The decrease was due largely to reduced activity and lower stacking costs.  The quarter
was also favorably impacted by a decline in reactivation costs associated with the Henry
Goodrich, and lower shore-based expenses.
General and administrative expense was $42 million, down from $43 million in the first quarter of
2016.
Depreciation expense was $225 million, compared with $217 million in the previous quarter.
 The increase was primarily associated with the commencement of operations of the newbuild
drillships.
The Effective Tax Rate(4) was 16.2 percent, down from 22.4 percent in the first quarter of 2016.
 The Annual Effective Tax Rate was 16.3 percent, down from 22.8 percent in the previous
quarter.  The decrease was due largely to changes in adjusted pre-tax income and the mix of
operating results from certain jurisdictions.  As a result, income tax expense included a benefit of
$22 million, $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the decrease in the Annual Effective Tax Rate to
21.5 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from 22.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was $95 million, compared with $89 million in the
prior quarter.  Capitalized interest decreased $9 million sequentially to $40 million due primarily
to the commencement of operations of the newbuild drillships.  Interest income was $4 million,
compared with $6 million in the prior quarter.
Cash flows from operating activities were $207 million, compared with $631 million in the prior
quarter.  The decline was largely related to early contract termination fees that primarily impacted
the first quarter of 2016.
Capital expenditures totaled $458 million, up from $368 million in the prior quarter.  The increase
was primarily associated with the company’s newbuild program.  Capital expenditures in the
second quarter of 2016 included shipyard payments primarily on the contracted newbuild, ultra-
deepwater drillships Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Conqueror.
“I am very pleased with the company’s second quarter operating and financial results,” said
President and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen.  “Thanks to the continued focus and
commitment of the entire Transocean team, we delivered excellent safety and uptime
performance for our customers, resulting in 96.5 percent quarterly revenue efficiency.  We also
continued to improve our cost structure through the streamlining of both our organization and our
processes.”
“In addition to the strong operating results, we further strengthened our balance sheet, and
enhanced our liquidity position, by closing a $1.25 billion note offering and simultaneous tender
to repurchase debt,” said Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark Mey.  “We
also announced the merger agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Transocean Partners
which will improve our liquidity position going forward.”
Additionally, Thigpen said, “though we continue to face market headwinds, the combination of
our industry-leading backlog, exceptional operating performance, and solid financial position
ensures that we will maintain our position as the industry’s leading deepwater driller.”

aware of other events and include changes in (a) deferred taxes, (b) valuation of allowances
on deferred taxes and (c) other tax liabilities.
(2)The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes $(22) million of additional tax
expense (benefit) reflecting the catch-up effect of an increase (decrease) in the annual
effective tax rate from the previous quarter estimate.
(3)Effective Tax Rate is income tax expense for continuing operations, divided by income from
continuing operations before income taxes.
(4)Annual Effective Tax Rate is income tax expense for continuing operations, excluding various
discrete items (such as changes in estimates and tax on items excluded from income before
income taxes) divided by income from continuing operations before income tax expense
excluding gains and losses on sales and similar items pursuant to the accounting standards
for income taxes and estimating the annual effective tax rate.
