THE LAC DORÉ VANADIUM PROJECT, CHIBOUGAMAU, QUÉBEC

ITEM 1: SUMMARY 
 
The  Lac  Doré  project  is  a  vanadium  exploration  project  covering  a  group  of  mineral 
properties  held  100%  by  VanadiumCorp  Resource  Inc.  (“VanadiumCorp”)  in  the 
Chibougamau  area,  Province  of  Quebec  (figure  1).  VanadiumCorp  has  undergone  a 
series  of  corporate  name  changes,  with  no  material  changes  in  ownership  of  the  Lac 
Dore project, throughout its history from Novawest Resources Inc. to Apella Resources 
Inc. to PacificOre Mining Corp. and finally to VanadiumCorp Resource Inc. This report 
will  reference  VanadiumCorp  with  respect  to  all  previous  work  done  by  these  related 
companies.  In  2007,  VanadiumCorp  acquired  the  property  through  conventional  field 
staking, after the claims were accidentally allowed to lapse by the former owner of the 
deposit, Lac Doré Mining Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of McKenzie Bay International 
Ltd. The following report was prepared in support of the release of the first resources 
estimate on the project by VanadiumCorp Resource Inc., under s.43(1)(j) of IN-43-101. It 
was prepared in compliance with the CIM Guidelines for resources estimate disclosure 
as  well  as  form  F-1  of  National  Instrument  43-101  ("NI  43-101")  of  the  Canadian 
Securities Administrators. The authorsare both considered as Qualified Persons in their 
respective field of expertise, and independent of VanadiumCorp according to NI-43-101 
definitions. 
 
The current report draws upon a former report written by the first author (Girard, 2014) 
on behalf of VanadiumCorp, effective June 10, 2014, and revised December 08, 2014, 
duly filed on Sedar. The first author, who supervised most of the work carried-out under 
McKenzie  Bay,  has  reviewed  all  geological  data  related  to  the  deposit  conducted  by 
former  management  of  VanadiumCorp,  plus  all  contracts  and  agreements  made  by 
VanadiumCorp relating to this property. The second author (D’Amours) is responsible for 
the resources estimate described in item 14. 
 
A non-current bankable feasibility study was completed on the deposit in 2002 by SNC-
Lavalin  on  behalf  of  the  former  owner,  which  study  included  a  non-current  mineral 
resource estimate. Furthermore, a non-current prefeasibility study was completed on the 
deposit in 2000 by Cambior, which study included another non-current mineral resource 
estimate.  The  current  report  draws  upon  certain  aspects  of  these  former  non-current 
studies. 
 
The first author has long been involved with the Lac Doré project, having worked on it 
intermittently since 1997 and possessing an intimate knowledge on most of the technical 
aspects related to geology, metallurgy, environment and industrial applications. He was 
involved  as  independent  Qualified  Person  on  this  project  since  its  beginning  with 
McKenzie Bay, supervising the field work and being client advisor in the course of the

preparation of the feasibility study. He was a technical consultant for BlackRock Metals 
for a short period, and is now involved as technical consultant for VanadiumCorp. The 
second author has extensive expertise in mineral resource estimation and geostatistical 
modelling. 
 
The  Lac  Doré  vanadium  project  is  located  30  km  southeast  of  the  town  of 
Chibougamau, central Québec. The project includes two properties which cover an area 
of  45.9  km2  and  consists  of  81  posted  claims  of  16  hectares  each,  plus  60  map 
designated cells of approximately 55 hectares each, for a total of 4594.54 hectares.
Since its acquisition in 2007 by VanadiumCorp, a limited amount of exploration work has 
been conducted on the project, including:
Three ground magnetometric surveys, encompassing almost completely
the current properties.
Stripping  and  surface  sampling  on  Lac  Doré  North  property  in  2008,
which were recently remapped.
A 10 holes exploration drilling program on Lac Doré North in 2009. 
  A  brief  channel  sampling  program  on  Lac  Doré  in  2012  aiming  to 
duplicate  former  McKenzie  Bay  samples,  the  results  of  which  are  not 
available.
A four holes confirmation drilling program in 2013 on Lac Doré, aiming to
duplicate historical drill holes.
A  field  verification  and  surveying  of  historical  drill  hole  location  in  fall
2015.
The  Lac  Doré  vanadium  deposit  has  a  protracted  exploration  history,  spanning  more 
than 60 years. It was evaluated by drilling or trenching on nine occasions through time, 
by the various past owners. These results are of variable quality, but many of them are 
sufficiently  accurate  to  be  incorporated  into  a  resource  estimation.  A  total  of  54  holes 
and trenches are available on the property, for 15,006 metres, including some segments 
traversing onto adjacent properties:
  1958: Jalore Mining, 5 holes for 773.38 metres 
  1970: MRN, 1 hole for 183.49 metres 
  1973: MRN, 9 holes for 914.99 metres 
  1979: SOQUEM, 19 holes for 3425.85 metres 
  1997: McKenzie Bay Resources, 27 trenches for 7225.21 metres 
  2001: McKenzie Bay Resources, 3 holes for 438 metres 
  2002: McKenzie Bay Resources, 3 holes for 450 metres 
  2009: VanadiumCorp Resource, 10 holes for 995.65 metres 
  2013: VanadiumCorp Resource, 4 holes for 600 metres

THE LAC DORÉ VANADIUM PROJECT, CHIBOUGAMAU, QUÉBEC
lihhkh
The  current  VanadiumCorp  Lac  Doré  property  encompasses  the  former  Eastern  and 
part  of  the  former  Western  deposits,  previously  focused  on  by  SOQUEM  and 
subsequently  McKenzie  Bay,  while  the  Lac  Doré  North  encompasses  part  of  the 
Northeast Extension. Through time, historical resource estimates were calculated on the 
Eastern  and  Western  deposit,  successively  by  the  Québec  department  of  Natural 
Resources,  SOQUEM,  LMBDS-Sidam  on  behalf  of  SOQUEM,  IOS  on  behalf  of 
McKenzie Bay Resources and finally Cambior. All these previous resource estimates 
are  considered  as  not  current  and  therefore  historical  in  nature  and  will  not  be 
discussed in detail. A mining reserve was calculated by SNC-Lavalin in 2002 on behalf 
of McKenzie Bay Resources, which is also considered as historical and non-current by 
the authors.  
 
The  current  resource  estimation  is  based  on  historical  drilling  and  trenching,  with  the 
exception of four confirmation holes drilled in 2013 by VanadiumCorp. All relevant data 
were captured under the authors' supervision, and thoroughly tested using redundance 
and  various  statistics  and  closure  tests.  Headgrade  (core)  and  magnetite  concentrate 
(Davis  tube)  assays  conducted  since  McKenzie  Bay  program  in  1997  included  the 
insertion  of  the  same  certified  reference  material,  providing  a  fair  confidence  on  their 
precision  and  accuracy.  Assays  conducted  prior  to  McKenzie  Bay,  thus  including 
MRN1970,  MRN1974  and  SOQUEM  1980  were  not  as  well  controlled,  and  an 
uncertainty  remains  in  regard  of  their  accuracy.  These  historic  results  shall  be 
considered as potentially discrepant, either overestimated or underestimated, up to 5% 
relative. This issue is raised both in regards to headgrade analysis as well as magnetite 
concentrate grade. No correction was applied to the data. 
 
Grades  from  the  present  resources  estimation  were  calculated  based  on  magnetite 
abundance as obtained from Davis Tube testing, and the vanadium assaying of these 
magnetite  concentrates.  Davis  tube  testing  was  conducted  through  time  using  slightly 
different grinding parameters. For example, the MRN-1974 samples were ground at 80% 
at 325 mesh, while the Cambior 1999 test were conducted at 80% 100 mesh. Fineness 
of the grinding influence magnetite liberation: coarser is the material, more abundant are 
ilmenite  and  silicates,  larger  is  the  concentrate  and  lower  is  its  vanadium  grade. 
However, the overall vanadium recovery is almost similar, and all these test can be used 
confidently. 
 
Systematic density measurements were available only from Cambior-2000 re-assaying 
of  McKenzie  Bay  1997  trench  samples.  About  20%  of  the  measurements  were 
discrepant  and  discarded.  The  measured  densities  were  equated  to  the  iron  plus

Drill hole location were systematically verified in the field by the author's crew, and collar 
measured with the use of a DGPS wherever available. Evidence of the drilling pads was 
found  in  most  locations,  which  enabled  a  precision  on  locations  within  5  metres. 
Downhole  measurements  were  taken  from  historic  logs, most  of  them  made  with  acid 
test. 
 
Resources were calculated by C. D'Amours (OGQ no 226), based on the data provided 
by R.Girard (OGQ no 521). The resources were calculated using the Davis tube testing 
results to evaluate the abundance of magnetite, and the magnetic concentrate vanadium 
grades.  This  is  in  contrast  will  all  previous  historic  estimations,  which  used  the 
headgrade  assays,  to  which  an  overall  recovery  factor  was  applied.  The  parameters 
used were:
From section 6+50 East to section 24+50 East, for a total deposit length of 1.8
kilometres.
Maximum depth of 200 metres from surface. 
  Pit slope: 50o. 
  Cut-off magnetite abundance of 15%. 
  Easting: 257 cells, 10 m each. 
  Northing: 117 cells, 10 m each. 
  Elevation: 230 metres, 32 cells 11.9 metres each. 
  Ordinary Kriging. 
  Search radius: 200 metres, 10-25 composited samples. 
  Grade of unsampled interval: 0%. 
  Specific gravity calculated from Fe2O3+TiO2+V2O5, 5% trimming. 
  Omnidirectional variograms. 
  Minimum profit required: 25%. 
  Mining cost: $1.80 / metric tonne. 
  Beneficiation cost: $2.50 / metric tonne. 
  Roasting cost: $40 / metric tonne of magnetite. 
  Market value: $5.50USD per pound of V2O5. 
  Hydrometallurgical recovery: 95%.
Results of the resource estimates are, exclusively classified as inferred:
Inferred resource tonnage: 99,104,000 metric tonne. 
  Waste tonnage: 165,690,000 metric tonne. 
  Magnetite content: 26,067,000 metric tonne or 26.3%. 
  Vanadium grade in magnetite: 1.08% V2O5. 
  Total vanadium in magnetite concentrate: 282,370 metric tonne V2O5.

including
A significant amount of metallurgical testing was historically conducted on the Lac Doré 
mineralization.  These  included  both  bench  scale  and  pilot  plant  testing  of  magnetite 
beneficiation, 
the  grindability  and  energy  consumption,  magnetite 
concentration by magnetic separation, as well as pelletization. Vanadium production was 
tested  through  two  different  processes,  intensive  fusion  and  alkali  roasting.  Intensive 
fusion requires the smelting of the ore in an arc furnace to produce steel or pig iron and 
a  vanadium-titanium  slag.  The  second  route  involves  the  production  of  vanadium 
chemicals as primary product. It involves roasting of the magnetite in presence of soda 
ash  in  order  to  produce  a  leachable  sodium  vanadate,  which  can  be  refined  by 
conventional  hydrometallurgy.  Successful  tests  were  made  for  the  production  of  pure 
vanadium chemicals by the latter process for the production of electrolyte.
VanadiumCorp's intent is to complete a preliminary economic assessment, focusing on 
the Eastern deposit.

Ressources naturelles du Québec (MERNQ), internal and consultant reports, corporate 
documents, 
from 
McKenzie Bay Resources, and from public reports and data produced by IOS under the 
author’s supervision on behalf of McKenzie Bay Resources. All geological data available 
to  VanadiumCorp  were  provided  to  the  author,  in  various  formats.  All  of  the  available 
data was reviewed by the first author. All information released in the present report is 
publicly available.  
 
Archives  of  SOQUEM  were  retrieved  by  the  author  in  1997,  while  he  was  acting  on 
behalf  of  McKenzie  Bay  Resources.  All  geological  information  from  McKenzie  Bay 
Resources was collected by the author's team, and is considered as reliable. Information 
obtained  from  VanadiumCorp  and  its  precursor  was  checked  in  detail  from  original 
documents and core, if available. 
 
All  agreements  and  contracts  related  to  the  project  were  provided  by  VanadiumCorp. 
Agreements  relating  to  former  ownership  of  the  deposits  were  provided  to  the  author, 
reviewed  in  detail,  are  considered  obsolete.  The  good  standing  of  claims  was  verified 
with  the  "Service  des  titres  miniers"  from  "Ministère  de  l'Énergie  et  des  Ressources 
naturelles du Québec" on March 13, 2015.

ITEM 3: RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The  authors  have  relied  on  technical  data  from  government  publications,  assessment 
files  and  previous  work  conducted  by  prior  operators  for  some  sections  of  this  report. 
Critical  components  include  historical  property  assessment  reports,  internal  company 
reports  and  Quebec  and  Canadian  federal  government  publications  and  websites. 
Mineral Resource Estimates included in this report are based on historical data publically 
available as assessment files, plus a limited amount of data supplied by VanadiumCorp 
and  by  IOS  Services  Geoscientifiques  Inc.  Part  of  the  information  regarding  the 
vanadium  market  provided  in  section  24  was  provided  by  Mr  Terry  Perles  of  TTP- 
square Inc. through various communications. The authors have reviewed the private and 
public data and believe them to be accurate and reliable in their collection, disclosure 
and analysis of results and therefore can be relied upon and used for project evaluation. 
In cases of uncertainty, the authors have qualified that information with accompanying 
clarification and explanation. 
 
The  authors,  not  experts  in  legal  matters,  are  required  by  NI  43-101  to  include  a 
description of the property title, terms of legal agreements and related information found 
in Section 4 of the report. The authors have relied on property agreement information 
provided by VanadiumCorp. Claim status information was obtained from Gestim, the on-
line registry of the Quebec’s Department of Natural Resources. A review of the claim title 
information  was  conducted  by  the  authors  on  March  13,  2015.  An  independent 
verification of land title and tenure was not performed and as such, this report does not 
represent a legal title opinion. This report has been prepared on the understanding that 
the  property  is,  or  will  be,  lawfully  accessible  for  evaluation,  development,  mining  and 
processing. 
 
Part  of  the  information  regarding  vanadium  market  provided  in  item  24  has  been 
provided  by Mr Terry Perles of TTP-square Inc through various communications.

ITEM 4: PROPERTY LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 
 
CLAIM LIST 
 
The claim list was obtained from the Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles 
du Québec on-line registry, on March 13, 2015. This list is provided in appendix 1, along 
with credits and obligations. All the titles are duly registered under the name of Apella 
Resources  Inc,  which  changed  its  name  to  VanadiumCorp  Resources  (intervenant 
#81845). Transfer forms from Apella Resources to VanadiumCorp have been submitted 
to the Ministry and are pending processing. A claims map is provided in figure 2. 
 
The two properties, Lac Doré and Lac Doré North, consists of 60 map designated cells, 
approximately 55.5 hectares each. Map designated cells "CDC" are mining titles which 
are  designated  on  map  through  the  Gestim  web-based  system,  according  to  a  pre-
established grid which is 30 seconds of arc by 30 seconds of arc. 
 
The properties also include 81 conventional claims, most of them of 16 hectares each, 
which  needed  to  be  posted  in  the  field.  Posted  claims  are  remnants  from  the  former 
mining  regime,  allowed  only  in  "parc  de  jalonnement"  neighbouring  active  claims 
predating the actual mining regime. 
 
All the posted claims and staking parks within the Chibougamau area, are in the process 
of being converted into map-designated cell by the government, and because of such, 
the former staking parks in the area are currently subtracted from staking (Renvois au 
Ministre,  dossier  32-9502  to  32-9510).  Actual  cells  boundaries  were  agreed  upon  by 
VanadiumCorp and neighbouring BlackRock Metals, meaning that after conversion, the 
property will bear the exact same outline, although the internal division will be according 
to the pre-established cell grid. 
 
A group of 24 posted claims, for 384 hectares, were staked on behalf of VanadiumCorp 
in fall 2014, filling the gap between VanadiumCorp map designated cell to the north and 
BlackRock claims to the south. These claims were staked once the area was subtracted 
to staking, and are thus not currently recorded by the government. However, discussion 
with  the  government  official  indicated  to  the  author  that  the  area  shall  be  granted  to 
VanadiumCorp through the conversion process. 
 
AREA AND EXTENT 
 
The property covers two discontinuous groups of claims, Lac Doré and Lac Doré North, 
separated by a one kilometre gap to the east and 400 metres to the north of Lac Doré.

CLAIM STATUS 
 
Claims are valid until their renewal anniversaries, the next group being on September 
27th, 2015.The claim-to-cell conversion process currently underway will homogenize the 
expiry date, which date is currently not known. Table 2 provides the anniversary dates, 
required  credits  and  renewal  fees.  A  total  of  $258,553  in  assessment  credits  are 
currently available. The required assessment credits are either $500 or $750 per claim 
and  $1,200  or  $1,800  per  cell,  depending  on  the  number  of  renewals  they  have  had, 
while  renewal  fees  are  $28.25  for  claims  and  $55.25  for  cells.  About  $50,000  inv 
exploration expenditure is currently pending submission for assessment.
Exploration titles in Québec are required to be renewed every two years, sixty days prior 
to their anniversary or up to their anniversary with a penalty. A renewal fee is needed at 
each renewal. Renewal also requires assessment credits accumulated from exploration 
expenditures. The management rules of assessment credits are complex. In the current 
project,  assessment  credits  are  not  evenly  distributed  among  the  titles  and  credit 
deficiency is expected for the next renewal of the claims recently acquired to the north, 
while  the  claims  covering  the  deposits  are  secured  for  the  next  four  renewals.  It  is 
estimated  that  $75,000  worth  of  work  will  be  required  by  January  20,  2016  for  their 
renewal. Notice that credit cannot be transferred from Lac Doré and Lac Doré North, 
since properties are not contiguous.

STAKING HISTORY 
 
The first Lac  Doré  North claims were acquired in October 2007, in order to cover the 
North-Eastern  Extension  of  the  deposit.  The  rest  of  the  claims  were  acquired  in  the 
following year, depending on when they were relinquished by McKenzie Bay. The area 
to  the  North  was  acquired  last  year  for  the  purpose  of  accommodate  eventual 
infrastructures, under the recommendation of the author. 
 
VanadiumCorp  has  been  active  in  the  Chibougamau  area  since  approximately  2005,  
during  which  time  they  have  acquired  and  subsequently  relinquished  a  large  land

position. VanadiumCorp now owns 143 other active exploration titles, posted claims for 
most of them, scattered into 7 properties in the Chibougamau area. 
 
CLAIM IRREVOCABILITY 
 
Lac Doré and Lac Doré North properties are dominantly made of conventional posted 
claims, which are notorious for being prone to be put into conflict. However, one year 
after a posted claim is recorded at the Ministry, or immediately after it is transferred, a 
posted claim cannot be challenged by a third party, unless a major staking flaw (such as 
the  absence  of  posts)  is  demonstrated.  In  the  course  of  the  current  conversion  from 
posted claims to map designated cells, both VanadiumCorp Resources and BlackRock 
Metals agreed to maintain the actual claim outline, which would make it irrevocable. 
 
Inversely, once officially registered, map designated cells are near to irrevocable by law 
so long as the owner fulfils its renewal obligations. 
 
SURVEYING 
 
Claims of Lac Doré property were staked in the field and their limits surveyed in 2009, 
although this surveying is not available to the author. Claims of Lac  Doré  North were 
not  surveyed,  but  posts  were  located  with  the  use  of  handheld  GPS  device,  allowing 
precision of a few metres. To the author's best knowledge; surrounding claims belonging 
to BlackRock were not surveyed, except for those to the west of Lac Doré. 
 
However,  in  the  course  of  the  claim  conversion  to  map  designated  cells  process 
currently underway, the limits indicated in the government maps and registry, based on 
2009 surveying, will be officialised, superseding the claim post in the field. 
 
EMBEDDED CLAIMS 
 
An isolated claim (Cl5274422, indicated as to expireon March 30, 2015, but entrapped in 
the  Arrêté  Ministériel)  belonging  to  BlackRock  Metals  is  enclaved  within  Lac  Doré 
property, close to its south-western end. 
 
An isolated claim (CL5274560, expiring on 2016/02/25, excluded from statistics on the 
project)  belonging  to  VanadiumCorp  lies  between  the  claims  belonging  to  BlackRock 
Metals and those belonging to Cogitore Resources and recently optioned by BlackRock, 
south  of  the  Armitage  extension  of  the  deposit,  midway  to  the  former  Lemoine  Mine 
(Cogitore).  This  claim  is  located  very  close  to  BlackRock's  Armitage  deposit.  It  is  not 
included in the afore mentioned list.

CLAIM GAPS 
 
One  vacant  gap  of  irregular  shape,  between  the  claims  of  Lac  Doré  property  and 
BlackRock  property,  is  discernible  on  Ministère  de  l'Énergie  et  des  Ressources 
naturelles maps. In the course of conversion from claims to cell, the gap will be granted 
to either VanadiumCorp or BlackRock, but cannot be granted to a third party. 
 
RELATION TO ADJACENT BLACKROCK METALS PROPERTIES 
 
The Lac Doré property is totally surrounded by BlackRock Metals claims. To the north 
and northwest, only one row (400 metres) of BlackRock posted claims separates them 
from Lac Doré North. To the southwest, the Lac Doré property limit is very close (100-
120 metres, corresponding to the irregular claim 5277107) to the outline of the mining 
lease currently applied for by BlackRock, covering the South-western deposit. 
 
Three  encroachments  along  the  Lac  Doré  property  west  border  exist  from  claims 
belonging to BlackRock. These encroachments are near the Western deposit, and one 
of them is a clear hindrance to its development. Claim 5279561 is a regular 16 Ha claim 
which protrude into the property, covering a 400 metres stretch of the Western deposit. 
Claim  5279517  (expire  date  of  September  18,  2015),  is  a  0.40  hectare  sliver  wedged 
between claims 5274554 and 5274555, which is not a serious hindrance. Third is claim 
5256468,  about  4.00  hectares,  located  north  of  the  deposit,  and  which  is  not  a 
hindrance. 
 
BlackRock Metals owns a large continuous property, encompassing a long stretch of the 
magnetite bearing layers. The property extends for about 14 kilometres to the southwest 
of  VanadiumCorp,  including  the  South-western  deposit,  Armitage  deposit,  and  a  thin 
layer  extending  close  to  the  Corner  Bay  mine.  To  the  west,  this  property  is  almost 
adjacent  to  VanadiumCorp's  Cornerback  property,  which  is  not  related  to  vanadium 
exploration. BlackRock Metals property also includes a 2 kilometres long stretch of the 
North-eastern Deposit, separating the Lac Doré and Lac Doré North deposits. 
 
HISTORY OF THE PAST AND PRESENT PROPERTIES 
 
Claims  over  the  Lac  Doré  vanadium  deposit  and  its  extensions  have  a  long  and 
protracted history spanning half a century, with numerous interwoven liens, involving 13 
different companies, entities or individuals. 
 
The  Lac  Doré  deposit  was  first  staked  in  1966  on  behalf  of  the  Québec  Government. 
These 21 "K" claims, 16 hectares, encompassed the actual East and West deposit. In 
1977, ownership of the claims was transferred to SOQUEM, a mineral exploration Crown

corporation. In 1997, the property was granted for option to McKenzie Bay Resources, 
and completely sold to this group in 1998. In 1999, the project was granted for option to 
Cambior Inc., who relinquished the option in 2000. In 2002, claim ownership was passed 
to Lac Doré Mining Inc, a fully owned subsidiary of McKenzie Bay International. These 
claims  were  accidently  allowed  to  lapse  in 2008,  and  the claims  became  available  for 
staking. 
 
A  detailed  account  of  the  30  transactions  or  events  affecting  the  Lac  Dore  Project 
through  history  is  available  Girard,  2014.  All  contracts,  acts  and  events  affecting  the 
claims were reviewed in detail by the author. Since the historical claims were allowed to 
lapse by the previous owner, any historical liens are now obsolete and non-transferable 
to the current claims, which were acquired by genuine staking. No remaining liens have 
been uncovered by the author. However, in 2008 Lac Doré Mining sold their remaining 
properties as well as all their intellectual properties to BlackRock Metals Corporation. It 
is not clear if VanadiumCorp Resources has any rights to the historical core drilled on it's 
properties and now stored by BlackRock Metals. 
 
STATUS OF EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES 
 
Up to the present time, with the exception of the acquisition cost and claim management 
cost,  total  exploration  expenditures  incurred  on  the  properties  by  VanadiumCorp  is 
estimated by the first author to be less than $1,000,000.  
 
REMAINING ENCUMBRANCES 
 
To the first author's best knowledge, all encumbrances accrued from Lac Doré Mining 
and  previous  owners  are  currently  obsolete,  due  to  the  expiry  of  the  claims  and 
legitimate  restaking  by  VanadiumCorp.  No 
liens  or  royalties  are  reported  by 
VanadiumCorp  administration,  and  no  hypothec  was  recorded  at  Régistre  des 
hypothèques du Québec. 
 
To the first author's best knowledge, all unpaid bills in the Chibougamau community, left 
by  the  former  management  of  VanadiumCorp  under  the  previous  name,  PacificOre 
Mining Corp., were recently paid by VanadiumCorp. 
 
RIGHT OF ACCESS 
 
The  property  straddles  territories  of  the  Chibougamau  municipality,  the  James  Bay 
municipality (MBJ) and the Domaine-du-Roy regional municipality (MRC). This partition 
implies that these various jurisdictions will need to be addressed regarding the issuance 
of permits, according to their respective regulations.

The deposit stands within the limits of the Chibougamau municipality and the James Bay 
municipality. Any infrastructure construction, such as camps, sewage, and roads, needs 
to  be  permitted  by  the  respective  municipal  authorities  in  Chibougamau-Chapais, 
Matagami or St-Félicien. This area is included in the James Bay and Northern Québec 
Agreement  ("Convention  de  la  Baie  James  et  du  Nord  Québecois")  as  well  as  the 
subsequent  "Paix  des  Braves"  treaty  between  the  Québec  Government  and  the  Cree 
nation.  It  is  indicated  as  "Terres  de  Catégories  III",  and  shall  be  therefore  free  of  any 
encumbrances  relating  to  exploration  activities.  The  deposit  lies  within  traditional  trap 
line no O59, belonging to Mr Matthew Wapache Sr. from Ouje-Bougoumou, except for its 
north-eastern limit which is within trap line no O57, belonging to Mr James B. Wapache 
from Ouje-Bougoumou. According to the "Paix des Braves" agreement, any intervention 
affecting  traditional  trapping,  such  as  logging,  needs  approval  from  the  trap  line 
tallymans.
About 20% of the claims of the Lac Doré North property are located to the south of the 
watercrest dividing the James Bay and St-Laurent watershed. The area southeast of the 
watercrest is located in non-organized territories ("Territoires non-organisés") managed 
by  the  Domaine-du-Roy  regional  municipality  ("MRC  Domaine-du-Roy")  in  St-Félicien. 
This  area  is  not  included  in  the  James  Bay  and  Northern  Québec  agreements,  and 
therefore falls under the general regulation of the Ministère de l'Énergie des Ressources 
naturelles du Québec relating to forestry and mining, and under the general regulations 
of the Ministère de l'environnement et du Développement durable du Québec pertaining 
to  environmental  issues.  The  area  lies  within  the  Nitassinan,  the  traditional  Innu 
("Montagnais")  territory.  A  treaty,  named  the  "Approche  commune"  is  currently  under 
negotiation between the Innus, the Québec and the Canadian governments. 
 
There is nothing preventing a claim owner accessing his properties. The only permitting 
required relates to regulations regarding logging activity and access to wet lands. Notice 
that  different  permits,  and  slightly  different  permitting  procedures,  are  required  for 
intervention  in  James  Bay  or  Domaine-du-Roy  jurisdictions.  Roads  leading  to  the 
properties are public domain with no restriction to access. 
 
It is required to inform and consult with the First Nation community as well as with the 
local  tallyman  (ie.  Mr  Wapache)  concerning  any  planned  exploration  work,  in  order  to 
minimize interference with hunting and fishing activities.  
 
As mineral right owner, VanadiumCorp does not hold any surface rights. However, since 
the property is located on public lands, the claims grant a right of first refusal to obtain 
such surface rights within the property.

The property is straddling hunting and fishing zones 17 and 28. Exclusivity is not granted 
to  outfitters  or  to  the  First  Nations.  No  outfitters’  camp  is  known  to  the  author  in  the 
vicinity, and no hunting or fishing cabins were noted in the vicinity. 
 
VanadiumCorp does not retain any rights to hydraulic, forestry, cynegetic or halieuthic 
resources.  There  are  no  rivers  with  hydraulic  potential  in  excess  of  225  kW  within  or 
near the property, to which restrictions could apply.  
 
LEASES 
 
There is currently no surface lease or private land within the perimeter of the properties. 
No  "bail  non-exclusif  sur  les  ressources  de  surface",  or  lease  for  earth  and  gravel,  is 
currently valid within the property, although gravel pits are present. No mining lease or 
any other lease in regards to mineral resources was ever active within the property. No 
evidence of any undeclared mineral exploitation was noted by the author. 
 
PERMITTING 
 
With respect to the exploration work, permitting is required for:
  Setting-up  a  temporary  or  permanent  camp.  The  permits  are  available  at
Chibougamau or James Bay municipality without difficulty.
  Logging is required in order to access drill site and clear drill pads, which needs 
to be requested from the forestry department of the Ministère de l'Énergie et des 
Ressources naturelles du Québec. For such, the Ministre must obtain approval 
from the Tallyman, according to the "Paix des Braves" and if one considers that 
less than 90% of the trap line was harvested, no difficulty is expected.
  Trenching  in  excess  of  50  square  metres  requires  a  special  permit  from  the
Environment ministry (MDDEFP), and a rehabilitation plan may be requested.
  Extraction of more than 50 tonnes of ore from a claim requires a special permit 
from the Natural Resources Department. Although no difficulty is expected, there 
may be a request for a restoration plan.
  Permission to drill on lakes has to be requested from Environment Canada. No
difficulty is expected.
  Establishing  a  temporary  camp  requires  a  construction  permit  from  the  James 
Bay  Municipality  and  must  be  compliant  with  the  MDDEFP  regulations,  CSST 
regulations and MAPAQ regulations.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
 
To  the  author’s  best  knowledge,  there  are  two  known  environmental  liabilities  left  by 
McKenzie Bay Resources. These liabilities are not legally transferable to VanadiumCorp, 
although a proactive attitude is expected. The first one is the reclamation plan in regard 
of  stripping  done  in  1997.  A  set  of  36  trenches,  for  a  total  length  of  8538  metres,  of 
which 32 are located on the actual Lac Doré property, were dug on the deposit. Since 
this stripping exceeded the 10,000 cubic metres limit, McKenzie Bay was requested to 
file a reclamation plan in order to obtain its permit. According to this plan, McKenzie Bay 
has to backfill any digging in excess of 1 metre depth, and to replace top soil upon it. 
Second, McKenzie Bay had the liability in regard of a surface lease for its Laugon Lake 
camp. Thus, they were expected to clean the site, remove septic tanks and reclaim any 
soil contaminated by hydrocarbons. The camp site was cleaned by BlackRock Metals, 
with  the  exception  of  the  septic  tank  removal  and  contaminated  soil  remediation.  The 
cost  of  the  trenches  rehabilitation  was  estimated  in  1997  at  $18,510,  or  $35,000  in 
today's dollars. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS 
 
There is no sensitive breeding or spawning habitat known to the author or reported in the 
former McKenzie Bay environmental assessment study. There is no area where mining 
activity is restricted in the vicinity of the project, the nearest ones being the urbanized 
part of the town of Chibougamau and the "Catégorie I" land from Ouje-Bougoumou and 
Mistassini. 
 
The  Ashuapmushuan  wildlife  reserve  ("Réserve  Faunique  de  l'Ashuapmushuan")  is 
located  about  20  kilometres  to  the  south  of  the  property,  while  the  Assinica,  Albanel, 
Mistassini  and  Waconichi  Lakes  wildlife  reserve  ("Réserve  faunique  d'Assinica  et  des 
lacs Albanel, Mistassini et Waconichi") is located about 40 kilometres to the north. There 
is no severe restriction with respect of exploration activity within these reserves. A series 
of wildlife habitats ("Refuges biologiques") are withdrawn from mineral exploration about 
11 kilometres to the northwest, which shall not be considered as a hindrance. 
 
Any mining or industrial activities conducted near a tributary to Chibougamau Lake, such 
as  near  the  Armitage  Lake,  may  face  opposition  from  native  communities  or 
environmentalist. 
 
HISTORIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY 
 
In  2002,  McKenzie  Bay  International  commissioned  Groupe-Conseil  ENTRACO  Inc. 
("ENTRACO")  to  perform  an  environmental  assessment.  This  assessment  included

numerous  aspects,  among  which  a  social  and  economic  assessment,  ecotoxicity,  and 
baseline survey, with respect to surface water quality, biological sensitivity, and more for 
the  area  covering  the  main  deposit  as  well  as  the  surrounding  area  affected  by 
infrastructure.  No  natural  contamination  by  vanadium  was  detected.  This  element  is 
considered to be practically insoluble in water, does not significantly bioaccumulate and 
is of low ecotoxicity. Some aspects of this study, especially those related to the access 
corridor, were included in BlackRock Metals environmental study, and covered by their 
authorization  certificate  granted  by  the  Ministère  du  Développement  durable,  de 
l'Environnement et des Parcs.  
 
There  is  no  exceptional  environmental  restriction  attached  to  the  territory  of  the  Lac 
Doré project. Only the usual Ministère du Développement durable, de l’Environnement 
et  des  Parcs  du  Québec  rules  and  items  included  in  the  James  Bay  and  Northern 
Québec Agreement apply.  
 
The author did not note any exceptional ecosystems within the property, such as a full-
grown ancestral forest. 
 
ADEQUACY OF SIZE 
 
The  property  of  the  Lac  Doré  Project  is  of  adequate  size  for  an  eventual  mining 
operation.  Additional  ground  was  acquired  to  the  north  in  this  respect,  but  which  is 
separated from the deposit by a single claim wide strip belonging to BlackRock Metals.

ITEM 5: ACCESSIBILITY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The  Lac  Doré  deposit  is  located  on  a  north-easterly  trending  hill  culminating  at  a 
530 metres  elevation,  limiting  the  Lac  Doré  lowlands  to  the  north  which  have  an 
elevation of 410 metres. A relief, reaching 120 metres, is therefore present at the site. 
The mineralized zone extends parallel to the stratigraphy, as expressed by the crest of 
the elongated hill (picture 3). 
 
The property is located along the line of height of land between the St-Lawrence River to 
the  South  and  James  Bay  to  the  North.  Drainage  to  the  north  of  the  watercrest  flows 
toward Chibougamau Lake, via Villefagnan and Armitage rivers. Drainage to the south of 
watershed  flows  toward  Lac  St-Jean,  by  way  of  the  Boisvert  River.  No  large  lake  is 
present on the property, the largest being Laugon Lake to the Southwest. The property 
is well drained, with limited bogs and swamps on its southern limit.
Picture  3:  View  from  the  East  deposit  looking  north.  In  the  distance  we  can  see  hills 
behind  the  town  of  Chibougamau,  with  the  Chibougamau  Lake  just  in  front.  The 
Campbell mine shaft used to be visible from this location.

Picture 4: View of logging road taken in 1997 along the crest where the East and West 
deposits  are  located.  Outcrops  of  anorthosite  are  visible  on  both  side.  The  area  was 
logged about 30 years ago. 
 
VEGETATION 
 
The property is covered by immature second growth commercial taiga forest, dominated 
by  black  spruce  (Picea  mariana)  and  poplar  (Poplar  Trembuloides).  Vast  strands  of 
alders (Alnus incana), white willows (salix sp.) and birches (Betula paperyfera) cover an 
area with poor drainage, such as southeast of the deposit. Heath (Ericaceae) are diverse 
and  locally  abundant.  Most  of  the  property  was  logged  and  reforested  in  the  last  3 
decades. 
 
FAUNA 
 
Large  mammals  are  limited  to  moose  and  occasional  wolf  and  black  bear.  Reindeer 
(caribou forestier, a threatened species) or white-tail deers (chevreuil) are not reported. 
Hares, ptarmigans, grouses, foxes and beavers are commons. Fishes are dominated by 
trout, bass and pikes.  
 
CLIMATE 
 
A cold continental climate prevails in the Chibougamau area. It is characterized by warm 
summers  (15 oC  July  average)  and  cold  winters  (-20 oC  January  average).  Average

annual precipitations are in the order 919 mm of water, with prevailing winds from the 
West. Snow is present typically from late October to early May. 
 
ACCESS 
 
The property is accessible from the paved highway no 167 between Chibougamau and 
St-Félicien  (Lac  St-Jean).  At  kilometre  197,  access  is  provided  by  the  forestry  road 
no 210 (known as "Chemin de la mine Lemoine" or "Chemin Gagnon Frères"). A network 
of  poorly  maintained  forestry  roads  access  the  property  at  different  locations  from  the 
Lemoine  road.  Some  upgrading  or  maintenance  will  be  needed  on  these  roads  for 
proper regular access. A distance of about 85 kilometres by road separates the centre of 
the property from the town of Chibougamau. The property can also be reached from the 
north by way of another gravel road (locally known as Cigam road). 
 
The former Lac Audet railroad siding of Canadian National Railways’ Chibougamau-St-
Félicien line is located about 40 kilometres from the property, near the junction between 
highway  no  167  and  Lemoine  road.  A  seaport  is  available  at  La  Baie  (Port-Alfred), 
400 kilometres southeast along the railroad. A commercial airport is located between the 
towns of Chibougamau and Chapais, about 60 kilometres from the property. 
 
Most of the property is within the range of cellular phone towers. 
 
SERVICES 
 
The cities of Chibougamau and Chapais, a former copper and gold mining centre, have 
a combined population of 11,000 residents, plus the Cree community of Mistassini and 
Ouje-Bougoumou with a population of about 3000 residents each. Besides mining, the 
local  economy  is  based  on  forestry  and  the  service  industry.  Social,  educational, 
commercial,  medical  and  industrial  services,  as  well  as  a  helicopter  base,  airport  and 
seaplane base are available at the town site, as well as forestry and mining offices of the 
Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles du Québec. 
 
Chibougamau  being  a  former  mining  community,  abundant  and  skilled  manpower  as 
well  as  equipment  is  available,  and  is  well  served  by  heavy  equipment  service  and 
maintenance providers. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
No infrastructure except for the poorly maintained logging roads are present within the 
property.  No  infrastructure  was  left  on  Lemoine  mine  site  after  its  reclamation.  No 
infrastructure was left at the Gagnon Frères sawmill and Audet Lake siding.

ITEM 6: EXPLORATION HISTORY 
 
The  Lac  Doré  vanadium  deposit  has  sustained  a  protracted  exploration  history, 
spanning almost 60 years. The amount of data available to the author is immense. Over 
200  studies  and  reports,  filling  a  complete  bookshelf  cabinet,  both  confidential  and 
available  to  public,  dealing  with  geology,  assaying,  metallurgy,  market  and  technico-
economic issues are available to the author. Therefore, the review of historical work will 
freely  encompass  both  the  main  deposit  and  its  extension  as  covered  by  the  current 
project and all references will not be necessarily described in detail. 
 
According  to  tradition,  each  of  the  succeeding  owners  or  operators  started  their  work 
with geological mapping and ground magnetometry. The largest effort in this regard was 
conducted by McKenzie Bay Resources in 1997 on the main deposit, and subsequent 
years  for  its  extensions.  The  details  available  from  this  effort  supersede  the  work  by 
previous  owners,  except  in  regard  of  drilling.  These  previous  campaigns  will  not  be 
described in detail here. 
 
ASSESSMENT AND GOVERNMENT WORK 
 
The  property  being  located  in  the  vicinity  of  a  historic  mining  district,  abundant 
government  and  academic  literature  is  available.  More  than  400  government  and 
university reports and maps are available for NTS 32-G-16 and 32-H-13 map-sheet, plus 
more  than  2000  assessment  files  submitted  by  exploration  companies.  A  thorough 
review of all literature is not considered relevant to the current report. The most relevant 
governmental work is considered to be those of Allard (RP 567, 1967; RP 566, 1969; 
RP 589, 1970 and DPV 759, 1981) who mapped and described the magnetite series of 
the  Lac  Doré  anorthositic  complex,  and  from  which  Dr.  Allard  predicted  the  vanadium 
occurrence.  A  regional  compilation  of  the  complex  was  prepared  by  Daigneault  and 
Allard (1990, MM 89-03).

EARLY EXPLORATION WORK 
 
In 1948, Dominion Gulf discovered the magnetite deposit after an aeromagnetic survey 
(GM  1028,  3640,  3873).  It  is  reported  (GM  8571)  that  they  conducted  field  work  from 
1954 to 1956, including geological mapping, trenching, sampling and some geophysics.  
 
From 1957 to 1959, Trepan Mining Corporation Ltd. explored the aeromagnetic anomaly 
for its iron ore potential. Trepan conducted geological mapping, a ground magnetometer 
survey and three diamond drill holes. Drill hole locations are not available, although they 
are suspected to be near the former forestry road leading to Armitage Lake. Vanadium 
was  not  assayed  (GM  06047,  GM  06482,  and  GM  10012).  These  drill  holes,  being 
located outside the current property, will not be discussed. 
 
Subsequent exploration work by Jalore Mining (a subsidiary of Jones and Laughlin Steel 
from  Pittsburgh)  and  Continental  Ore  Corporation  included  a  "dip-needle"  (ground 
magnetic)  survey,  six  diamond  drill  holes  and  some  metallurgical  testing  on  a 
1000 tonnes  bulk  sample  (GM  27165,  GM  07301,  GM  8571,  GM  08572,  GM  03640, 
GM 11061,  GM  04411,  GM  04653).  The  property  was  dropped  because  of  the  high 
titanium content rendering it's magnetite unsuitable for iron smelting. The core was not

assayed for vanadium by Jalore, but was subsequently by the Ministère des Richesses 
Naturelles  in  1970.  This  work  is  considered  as  of  little  use.  The  author  searched 
extensively  in  1997  to  locate  this  core  without  success.  However,  it  was  apparently 
found  by  Cambior  (Crépeaux,  1999).  But  since  the  Cambior  technical  team  has  been 
dismantled, the author has not been capable to locate this core. The core from the six 
holes is considered as lost. 
 
WORK  CONDUCTED  BY  THE  "MINISTÈRE  DES  RICHESSES  NATURELLES  DU 
QUÉBEC" 
 
The vanadium content of the titanium rich magnetite layers was indicated by Dr. Gilles 
O.  Allard  (1967,  1967b),  at  that  time  working  for  the  Quebec  Department  of  Natural 
Resources, currently the Ministère de l'Énergie et des Resource naturelles. The deposit 
was  then  staked  on  behalf  of  the  Crown.  From  1966  to  1975,  the  following  work  was 
completed:
  Geological mapping (Gobeil, 1976; Assad, 1968). 
  Line cutting and surveying (Gobeil, 1976). 
  Ground magnetometric survey. 
  Bulk sampling. 
  13  exploratory  diamond  drill  holes  (Avramtchev,  1975;  Assad,  1968),  of  which
two are on the Southwest deposit (BlackRock project).
  Numerous metallurgical tests, both for alkali roasting and steel-slag smelting.

Geological  mapping  and  ground  magnetic  surveys  conducted  by  the  MRNQ  are 
considered  as  being  superseded  by  the  more  detailed  McKenzie  Bay  Resources 
surveys, as part of the drilling and metallurgical work discussed in the following sections.

Obsolete resources were calculated first by Assad (1968) and then by Kish (1971) and 
Avramtchev (1975). These estimates are not current and considered of minimal use, and 
as such will not be described in detail. 
 
The dollar value of geological and metallurgical work carried out by the government has 
not  been  accurately  assessed,  but  can  be  estimated  at  more  than  $5  million  in  2014 
adjusted dollar value. 
 
WORK CONDUCTED BY SOQUEM 
 
The  Lac  Doré  vanadium  project  was  transferred  to  SOQUEM,  a  Québec  crown 
corporation, in 1977. This corporation did some geological work until 1979 until a non-
current  resource  was  recalculated,  SOQUEM  then  carried  out  additional  metallurgical 
testing  until  1980.  In  1981,  SOQUEM  abandoned  the  development  program  due  to  a 
weakening vanadium market.

SOQUEM's  expenditures  on  the  project  have  not  been  revealed,  but  its  replacement 
value is evaluated to be at least $2 million dollars. 
 
A non-current resource estimate was calculated by SOQUEM in 1980 (Dion, 1980) and 
again  in  1981  along  with  a  pit  design  (LMBDS-Sidam,  1981).  These  estimations  are 
obsolete and as such will not be discussed in further detail. 
 
From 1983 to 1989, the project was reviewed and evaluated by various groups on behalf 
of SOQUEM:

WORK CONDUCTED BY McKENZIE BAY RESOURCES LTD. 
 
IOS,  on  behalf  of  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  Ltd.,  conducted  a  large  stripping  and 
sampling program in 1997 over the Southwest, West and East deposits (Tremblay et al, 
1998). This campaign included the following:
  Line  cutting,  a  ground  magnetometer  survey  and  detailed  geological
mapping over 70 line-km.
  Stripping and detailed mapping of 36 trenches for a cumulative length of
8650 metres (pictures 6 and 7)
  Sampling  and  assaying  of  1734  samples  (3  metres  long)  for  a  total  of
4486.7 metres of diamond-saw cut channels.
  Structural mapping and analysis (Lamontagne, 1997 and Tremblay et al.,
1998)
  Analytical QAQC (Girard, 1997; Bédard and Girard, 1998) 
  Ore  microscopy  and  microprobe  analysis
(Lamontagne,  1997;
Lamontagne et Lavoie, 1997; Bédard, 1998 and Tremblay et al., 1998).
  Various market, processing and economic reviews (Girard, 1997). 
  No metallurgical testing was carried out on behalf of McKenzie Bay within
this program.
The 1997 work program, done on behalf of McKenzie Bay Resources, cost $1.5 million. 
 
A non-current resource calculation was attempted by the first author, using assays from 
the  trenching  (Girard,  1997)  and  projecting  downward.  This  estimation  is  obsolete  as 
such will not be discussed in further detail (Girard, 2014).

excavated in 1999.
  From  1997  to  1999,  IOS  Services  Geoscientifiques  Inc.  made  a  series  of 
ground  magnetometer  surveys  covering  the  whole  strike  of  the  deposit 
(figure 3). These surveys, made with analogical flux-gate magnetometer, are 
not  properly  levelled  and  must  be  used  with  care.  They  were  helpful  in 
selecting trenching and drilling sites. However, they are not reliable enough 
to make comparisons between the various parts of the deposit or to allow a 
reliable structural interpretation. The poor quality of these surveys led to the 
commissioning of the high resolution airborne survey by BlackRock Metals.
From 1998 to 2000, the following metallurgical tests were carried out for McKenzie Bay 
Resources by the author:
  Review of the historical metallurgical tests (Girard, 1998). 
  Crushing, work index and liberation of magnetite (Lamontagne, 2000). 
  Design  of  an  optimum  magnetite  recovery  process  with  Davis  tube  for  a
routine separation protocol (Girard, 2000).
  Distribution of vanadium among oxide and silicates minerals (Girard, 2000).
In 2001, a drilling campaign was carried out by IOS on behalf of McKenzie Bay (Huss, 
2003). This campaign included 14 holes for a total 2187 metres of drilling, distributed as 
follow:
  Northeast extension:

Of these holes, one is collared within the current Lac Doré North property, and two on 
Lac Doré property, for a total of 438 metres. 
 
The  overall  value  of  the  work  conducted  by  McKenzie  Bay  Resources,  as  well  as  the 
work conducted on the Armitage,  Southwest and Northeast deposits is evaluated at 2

WORK CONDUCTED BY CAMBIOR INC. 
 
Within  their  option  agreement  with  McKenzie  Bay  Resources,  Cambior  (currently 
Iamgold Corporation) completed a pre-feasibility study (Crépeau, 2000), which included:
  Preliminary resource calculations and pit design. 
  Market study for vanadium pentoxide and ferrovanadium (Taylor, 1998
in Cambior 1999).
  Financial analysis (Services Techniques, 1999).
Subsequently,  the  following  work  was  carried  out,  until  financial  difficulties  forced 
Cambior to withdraw from the project:
  Detailed  geological  re-mapping  of  all  trenches  and  re-logging  of  the 
core, including a due diligence and liability assessment (Magnan, 1999 
in Cambior 1999).
  Davis tube testing (contracted to IOS, Villeneuve, 1999) and magnetite 
concentrate assaying, as well as magnetite content measurement using 
a "Satmagan".
  Preliminary  environmental  assessment,  contracted  to  Entraco  Groupe-
Conseil (Unsigned, 1999).
  Very thorough analytical testing to corroborate accuracy of assays and 
grade  assessment  (Crépeau,  2000).  This  verification  confirmed  the 
extent of the quality and robustness of available analyses.
Cambior calculated a resource estimate on the East and West deposits. This resource 
predates  the  implementation  of  NI  43-101  regulations,  and  cannot  be  considered  as 
current  (Crépeau,  2000).  Parts  of  the  calculation  were  made  available  to  the  author. 
Cambior invested about $340,000 in the project.

These  non-current  mineral  resource  and  minable  reserve  estimates  offered  by 
SNC-Lavalin were intended to be compliant with CIM Guidelines, and are provided 
here  only  because  they  are  the  last  ones  reported  in  the  literature  by  previous 
owners.  They  are  not  considered  as  adequate  by  the  author  to  be  reported  as 
current resources and shall not be relied upon. 
 
The  resource  calculation  included  the  same  dataset  used  in  previous  estimations  by 
Cambior,  plus  three  confirmation  holes  (table  3).  The  project  aimed  only  at  vanadium 
production,  and  thus  estimation  targeted  dominantly  the  P2  units.  The  estimation  is 
based  on  headgrade  analysis,  so  did  not  use  the  magnetite  concentrates  from  Davis 
tube  testing  for  the  resource  calculation.  Magnetite  abundance  was  calculated  based 
upon various assumptions, such as simplified normative calculation, in regard of which 
the current author is in disagreement. Variogram analysis indicated that grades can be 
extrapolated  up  to  125 metres  laterally  and  30  metres  across  strike.  The  resource 
calculations were used for the Whittle-4D mining plan.  
 
Resources, all categories and deposit included, were calculated by stratigraphic units at:

site at Laugon Lake (located on current VanadiumCorp's property). The historic 
core included the drill core from the East and West deposits as well as McKenzie 
Bay holes on north-eastern and Armitage extension.
  High  resolution  airborne  magnetometer  and  topographic  survey  over  the  entire 
length  of  the  deposit  (Largeault  et  al.,  2008,  GM  64819).  The  survey  did 
encompass the East and West deposits, currently belonging to VanadiumCorp, 
although data from this portion was never provided to BlackRock. However, this 
part of the survey was then made available by the contractor to the author, who 
was  supervising  the  work,  and  will  be  presented  in  subsequent  sections.  This 
survey replicates with better accuracy the former ground magnetometer survey.

VALIDITY  OF  THE  VARIOUS  SURVEYS  AND 
CONTRACTORS 
 
The Ministère des Richesses Naturelles carried out all the work over the deposit using 
its  own  staff.  There  is  no  reason  to  doubt  the  integrity  and  independence  of  these 
authors, although some of them might not have been sufficiently trained for the type of 
work they conducted. 
 
SOQUEM  carried  out  their  various  surveys  using  its  own  staff,  which  work  was 
conducted according to the industry standard of the time. SOQUEM to quality control of 
the analysis is worth noting. 
 
The  work  carried  out  on  behalf  of  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  was  completed  by  the 
author's crews. The geologists in charge of the various programs were experienced and 
the work conducted according to quality procedures of the time. An exception is the set 
of ground magnetometric surveys which was not conducted by properly trained staff, and 
thus is of undertermined quality. IOS was a thoroughly independent firm from McKenzie 
Bay. 
 
Part  of  the  work  conducted  for  McKenzie  Bay  was  conducted  by  Glen  McCormick 
Exploration Ltd., who was paid in shares of the company. This contractor is therefore not 
considered as independent. 
 
The  work  conducted  by  Cambior  was  of  proper  quality,  with  the  exception  of  the 
geological  re-mapping  of  the  trenches  and  density  measurements.  The  author  has  no 
reason to suspect any bias of execution. 
 
The quality of work conducted by SNC-Lavalin cannot be addressed. The author does 
not have the expertise to evaluate engineering aspects. SNC-Lavalin is expected to be 
independent from SOQUEM and McKenzie Bay Resources. 
 
DETAILS ON HISTORICAL DRILLING 
 
The historical drilling is the most valuable set of information currently available, far more 
valuable  from  its  mere  abundance  than  drilling  and  sampling  done  by  VanadiumCorp. 
This  information  is  the  basis  for  the  calculation  of  the  current  resource  estimate. 
Therefore, a thorough review of this data is presented in Item 10 for the drilling, Item 11 
for the sampling procedure, and Item 12 for the assaying procedure and quality controls. 
This historical data will be presented along with VanadiumCorp's drilling.

ITEM 7: GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Lac Doré project is hosted in the Lac Doré Anorthositic Complex, aged at 2.728 Ga. 
This Archean complex is at the core of the Eastern end of the Northern domain of the 
Abitibi  Greenstone  Belt,  Abitibi  sub-Province,  and  Superior  Province  in  the  Canadian 
Shield.  The  regional  stratigraphy  is  dominantly  East-West  trending,  South  or  North 
verging  depending  on  the  side  of  the  anticline,  with  a  metamorphic  facies  grading 
southward from greenschist to amphibolite, ages of the rocks lying between 2.759 and 
2.728 Ga (Chown et al., 1992; Gouthier et al., 1992). 
 
The  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  the  Chibougamau  area  is  shaped  like  an  East-
West trending anticlinorium, both flanks of which have mirror stratigraphy (figure 3). The 
core of the anticlinorium is occupied by the Chibougamau pluton, the emplacement of 
which has resulted in tilting the enclosing volcanics into an upright position symmetrically 
on both sides. The stratigraphy is comprised of the volcanic Roy Group, and overlying 
volcano-sedimentary Opemisca Group. The Roy Group consists of two volcanic cycles, 
with the basaltic Obatogamau Formation and felsic volcano-clastic Waconichi Formation 
(2.728 Ga) in the lower part, and the basaltic Gilman Formation and felsic volcanoclastic 
Blondeau Formation in the upper cycle, capped by the volcano-sedimentary Bordeleau 
Formation.  The  Opemica  Group  is  known  to  occur  only  on  the  south  limb  of  the 
anticlinorium, 
the  epiclastite  dominated  Chebistuan,  Stella  and  Haüy 
Formations. 
 
The  lower  cycle  Waconichi  Formation  is  truncated  by  the  near  conformable  Lac  Doré 
Anorthositic Complex, itself truncated by the Chibougamau tonalitic pluton (2.718 Ga). 
Some other minor late intrusions are reported. 
 
The  rocks  are  affected  by  multiple  deformation  events,  including  regional  dome-and-
basin type folding and associated shearing. A dense network of late faults dissects the 
area,  dominantly  northeast  trending.  These  faults  are  either  associated  with  or 
reactivated by the Grenvillian event, the main  expression of which being the Grenville 
Front to the Southeast. 
 
Most of the mines from the Chibougamau camp are shear hosted within the Lac Doré 
anorthosite, typically associated with fault intersections. Over 44 million tonnes of gold-
copper ore have been extracted to date. The only significant exception is the small base 
metals bearing volcanogenic massive sulphides, such as the Lemoine Mine, hosted in 
the Waconichi Formation.

LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Lac Doré Complex is a lopolith, a sub-tabular intrusive body of mafic to anorthositic 
composition,  strongly  differentiated  near  its  top.  The  lopolith  is  emplaced  within  the 
Waconichi  Formation,  a  felsic  volcanic  and  sedimentary  pile,  and  folded  along  by  the 
regional  anticlinorium.  The  deposit  is  hosted  in  a  homoclinal  sequence  of  magnetite 
bearing  layers  within  the  South  flank  of  the  Lac  Doré  Anorthositic  Complex.  Top  of 
stratigraphy is to the south. 
 
According to Allard (1967), the Lac Doré Complex is divided in four major units. From 
top to bottom they are:
  The border zone (top, South-East); 
  The granophyre; 
  The layered zone; 
  The Anorthositic zone (base, North-West).
The layered zone hosts the vanadium deposit, while the anorthosite and the granophyre 
host  most  of  copper-gold  mineralization  of  the  mining  camp  (outside  of  the  Lac  Doré 
property).
The  anorthosite  zone  (approximately  3660  m  in  observed  thickness)  is  composed  of 
anorthosite,  gabbro  and  magnetite-bearing  gabbro,  plus  some  minor  pyroxenite.  The 
magnetite as well as the vanadium content increase in the upper 150 metres of the unit, 
toward the layered zone. 
 
The layered zone, which hosts the vanadium deposit, consists up of 450 to 900 metres 
of rhythmically layered beds rich in pyroxene, magnetite plus ilmenite, intercalated with 
layers  of  anorthositic  gabbro.  The  vanadium  deposit  is  located  in  the  lowermost  part, 
namely the P1, P2 and P3 units. Vanadium strongly partitions into magnetite, and thus 
into the first magnetite layers. Its content in magnetite decrease upward (Allard, 1967). 
 
The vanadium-bearing magnetite deposit is described by Allard (1967) as:
"(…) an alternation of layers of solid titaniferous magnetite, magnetite rich 
gabbro,  magnetite  rich  pyroxenite,  gabbro  and  anorthositic  gabbro.  The 
solid magnetite layers range from  a fraction of an inch to four feet. The 
magnetite band is everywhere at the same stratigraphic horizon, but each 
magnetite  layer  is  discontinuous  and  exhibits  marked  changes  in 
thickness and character along strike (…)"

Minor vanadium-bearing layered series are reported on the north flank of the complex, 
near Magnetite Bay. 
 
GEOLOGY OF THE DEPOSIT 
 
The deposit was mapped both by MRNQ and SOQUEM geologists. It was at that time 
covered  by  forest  and  overburden  with  only  about  1%  outcrop.  Since  McKenzie  Bay 
Resources  stripping  program  and  the  recent  logging  activity,  outcrops  are  more 
abundant and allow for a better understanding of the geology as presented at figures 
4A and B. 
 
Dr.  Allard's  stratigraphy  (P1-A1-P2-A2-P3)  was  partly  revised  by  the  author  based  on 
this  mapping  (Tremblay,  1998).  Local  stratigraphy  is  presently  defined  as  follow,  from 
bottom (North) to top (South):
  Footwall anorthosite, free of magnetite. 
  P0: Anorthosite with small scattered beds of magnetite (picture 12). 
  P1: Anorthosite with abundant and thick beds of magnetite (picture 11). 
  P2: Magnetite and layered gabbros, main ore body (pictures 8 and 9). 
  P3: Magnetite-ilmenite bearing pyroxenite (picture 10). 
  Hanging wall, mainly gabbro and pyroxenite.
Lenses of anorthosite, metres to tens of metres in thickness, are intercalated within the 
above units, which were considered as stratigraphic units by Allard (1967).

truncated  by  the  Mistassini  Fault  (Grenville  Front).  However,  thicknesses  are  variable 
and complexities locally abundant. 
 
The  East  and  West  deposits  were  reported  as  a  bulge  on  P2,  distinctly  visible on  the 
aeromagnetic  survey.  The  presence  of  this  prominent  magnetic  anomaly  attracted 
exploration activity. Explorationists neglected the extensions of the deposit except for the 
limited work by McKenzie Bay Resources in the 1998-2000 periods. 
 
All the various mineralized bodies, from Armitage to Northeast, correspond to a package 
of  horizons  steeply  dipping  toward  the  southeast.  These  horizons  extend,  almost 
continuously,  for  17  kilometres  in  length,  as  expressed  by  the  ground  magnetometer 
survey  and  BlackRock's  aeromagnetic  survey.  The  various  mineralized  bodies,  or 
extensions,  were  named  on  historical  basis,  being  separated  only  by  late  faults, 
topographic features or claim boundaries. However,  the  overall  mineralized  body  is 
uninterrupted.  For  example,  the  East  and  West  deposits  are  separated  by  a  valley 
related  to  a  small  cross-fault  with  minimal  displacement.  The  West  and  Southwest 
deposits are offset by the Coil Lake cross-fault corresponding to a second valley, and 
are separated by a narrow stretch of lower grade material. The East and West bodies 
bulge  to  a  thickness  of  100  to  150  metres,  reaching  locally  up  to  200  metres.  The 
Southeast  body  is  narrower  at  100  metres  in  thickness,  locally  injected  of  abundant 
anorthosite sills devoid of magnetite. The Armitage extension is continuous over more 
than 12 kilometres with 50-100 metres in width. Toward the Northeast, the geology and 
stratigraphy  is  more  difficult  to  decipher,  being  offset  by  late  faulting  related  to  the 
Grenville Front.  
 
The  vanadium  grade  decreases  sharply  towards  the  stratigraphic  top  of  the  layered 
series as one proceeds south-eastward. This is related to the early partition of vanadium 
in 
the  magma  during  magmatic 
differentiation. Also, in the gabbroic and pyroxenititic top layers, the remaining vanadium 
is scavenged by ferromagnesian minerals, and not amenable for metallurgical recovery. 
Therefore,  layers  above  P3  are  not  considered  as  part  of  the  deposit.  Nelsonite 
horizons,  made  of  ilmenite  and  apatite,  are  reported  in  the  upper  series  and  the  over 
incumbent granophyre, which shall be just considered as curiosities. 
 
Inversely, as one proceeds toward the base of the layers, north-westward, the grade of 
vanadium in the magnetite increases to a level which may be sufficient to justify mining 
of  isolated  magnetite  bands  within  the  anorthosite,  such  as  P0.  Only  very  preliminary 
results are available on this aspect.

GEOCHEMISTRY 
 
The vanadium hosted in magnetite and ilmenite is relatively refractory. It is not expected 
to  be  liberated  from  the  host  minerals  and  to  yield  any  geochemical  anomaly  in  the 
secondary  environment.  Furthermore,  vanadium  is  a  ubiquitous  element,  present  in 
trace amount in any type or rock, thus having little contrast with the deposit. Exploration 
geochemistry is therefore not considered as relevant. 
 
A regional lake bottom sediment geochemical survey, conducted by the MRNQ in 2007 
and 2011, covers the area, which is of little use for the project. 
 
GEOPHYSICS 
 
As  the  vanadium  is  contained  in  the  magnetite,  the  mineralization  is  readily  visible  on 
aeromagnetic  survey.  The  17  kilometres  long  anomaly  associated  with  the  deposit  is 
outstanding on the regional map. Ground magnetic surveys were carried out by the Gulf 
Mineral, Trepan Mining and Jalore in the 1950's, using a dip-needle compass, as well as 
by  Ministères  des  Richesses  Naturelles  (Kish,  1971),  SOQUEM  (Nolet,  1980),  and 
McKenzie  Bay  Resources  (Tremblay  et  al.,  1998;  Boudreault,  2000;  Girard,  2001; 
Villeneuve, 1999). These surveys were carried out with an analog flux-gate instrument, 
which  measures  only  the  vertical  component  of  the  total  field.  Flux-gate  was  the 
standard instrument in the time of MRN and SOQUEM, and was chosen by IOS for the 
McKenzie Bay survey for being less sensitive to lateral gradient and saturation than then 
available  neutron  precession  units.  The  various  surveys  conducted  for  McKenzie  Bay 
are  noisy,  with  numerous  levelling  discrepancies.  For  these  reasons,  the  author 
recommended  to  BlackRock  Metals  in  2007  to  commission  a  low-altitude  high  density 
airborne  magnetic  survey  covering 
last  airborne  survey 
encompassed, for logistical reasons, a large part of VanadiumCorp's Lac Doré and Lac 
Doré  North  properties  (figures  5,  6A  and  6B).  It  can  be  noted  right  away  from  this 
survey  that  the  Eastern  deposit  has  a  significantly  larger  magnetic  signature  than  the 
others.

No geophysical method allows detection or measurement of the vanadium itself. 
 
Electromagnetic and gravimetric (Nolet, 1980) surveys were carried-out by the Ministère

author's opinion there is no need for testing other geophysical methods. 
 
GLACIAL GEOLOGY 
 
Glacial  geology  of  Chibougamau  area  is  dominantly  covered  by  the  Chibougamau  Till 
(Martineau et Bouchard, 1984). This extensive till blanket is Winconsinian in age, and is 
reported  to  flow  toward  the  Southwest  in  the  area  (see  drumlin  and  elongated  crest 
visible on figure 5). The crest where the deposit is located is covered by a thin veneer of 
till,  while  periglacial  sandy  material  dominates  the  plains  to  the  North  toward  Lake 
Chibougamau. Fluvioglacial material is rare in the vicinity of the deposit.

MINERALIZATION 
 
Vanadiferous  mineralization  at  Lac  Doré  is  composed  of  titaniferous  magnetite  and 
ilmenite,  hosted  in  anorthosite,  anorthositic  gabbros  and  gabbros,  within  the  layered 
series  of  the  Lac  Doré  Complex.  Magnetite  and  ilmenite,  associated  in  various 
proportions depending on stratigraphy, are found either as massive beds, decimetres to 
metres  in  thickness,  or  as  dissemination  within  anorthosite  and  gabbros.  Overall,  the 
deposit  contains  about  30%  magnetite,  the  main  vanadium  hosting  mineral,  plus  10% 
ilmenite.  Oxides  are  best  described  as  orthocumulate  phase  in  the  massive  beds,  or 
intercumulate  while  disseminated  in  host  rock.  Typical  abundances  and  vanadium 
grades  for  the  various  units  as  estimated  from  McKenzie  Bay  channel  samples 
(Tremblay et al., 1998) are provided in table 5.

The  magnetite  bearing  layers  form  a  definite  horizon  which  can  be  traced  from  the 
Grenville Front to the northeast, to the Lac Caché to the southwest, for a total stretch of 
17 kilometres. Cross faults, with short displacement, are separating the Eastern from the 
Western deposits, as well as the Western and South-Western deposits. Magnetite beds 
are reported all along this horizon, with diverse abundance and thickness. The overall 
thickness of the sequence typically ranges between 60 to 100 metres, but increases to 
more than 200 metres in the Eastern deposit. The aeromagnetic signature is very linear, 
suggesting  a  near  perfect  homoclinal  sequence  dipping  steeply  to  the  southeast. 
Although the overall mineralized envelope is fairly regular, internal stratigraphy is very 
complex, injected by dismembering anorthosite sills. Local tight folds and truncation of 
the stratigraphy are noted, interpreted as representing magmatic slumps. 
 
ORE PETROGRAPHY 
 
Vanadium is hosted at 70-80% in magnetite (FeO-Fe2O3) and 10-15% in ilmenite (FeO-
TiO2). These two minerals are associated in a complex manner. Titanium is partitioned 
into  hemoilmenite,  ulvöspinel  or  titaniferous  magnetite,  which  are  co-precipitated  from 
the  magma,  with  granular  relationship.  Proportion  of  hemoilmenite  and  ulvöspinel  is

controlled  by  oxygen  fugacity  of  the  magma:  more  oxygen  being  available,  more 
hemoilmenite being formed. The primary magmatic oxides typically have grain sizes of a 
fraction  of  a  millimetre  to  a  few  millimetres.  Titaniferous  magnetite  is  a  ferrous-ferric 
spinel (FeO-Fe2O3) which makes a discontinuous solid solution with ulvöspinel (2FeO-
TiO2)  through  a  diadochic  substitution  at  high  temperature.  At  high  temperature,  this 
substitution can accommodate up to 20% TiO2. No solid solution exists between ilmenite 
and titaniferous spinels. However, a complete solid solution exists between ilmenite and 
hematite  at  high  temperature.  At  lower  temperature,  ulvöspinel  is  not  stable  and 
exsolves  as  ilmenite  intergrowth  in  titaniferous  magnetite.  Titano-magnetite  itself  can 
accommodate  up  to  a  maximum  of  4%  TiO2,  the  excess  being  exsolved  as  minute 
ilmenite intergrowths. Similarly, ilmenite (FeTiO3) makes a complete solid solution with 
hematite (Fe2O3) at high temperature, and hemoilmenite exsolves as ilmenite-hematite 
intergrowth at lower temperature. These various iron and titanium oxides react with iron-
bearing silicates (pyroxene, etc.) during the course of metamorphism, making secondary 
magnetite, with or without titanium, with or without vanadium, plus panoply of vanadium-
bearing ferromagnesian silicates. These secondary oxides are mainly developed in P3, 
considering  the  original  abundance  of  ferromagnesian  minerals.  Hematite  is  of  very 
limited  importance  in  Lac  Doré  ore,  typically  restricted  to  secondary  minerals  of 
metamorphic or alteration origin. Vanadium only weaklysubstitutes in hematite. 
 
Headgrade  in  vanadium  is  at  its  maximum  in  P2,  in  the  middle  of  the  layered  series. 
However, vanadium grades in magnetite decrease systematically upward, while titanium 
headgrade  increases  upward.  Consequently,  the  best  vanadium  grades  in  magnetite 
concentrates are found in P0 and P1, while the bulk of the vanadium resources being 
hosted  in  P2.  This  is  reflected  in  every  former  obsolete  resource  assessment  which 
targeted P2 only. 
 
The  Lac  Doré  mineralization  typically  consists  of  80%  magnetite  and  20%  granular 
ilmenite (figure 7). The magnetite itself consists of 80% titaniferous magnetite with about 
20% very minute intergrowths of ilmenite exsolution (figure  8). The presence of these 
ilmenite exsolutions makes this mineralization unsuitable for iron production from blast 
furnace  without  by-product.  Titano-magnetite  typically  grades  about  1.8%  V2O5,  while 
the  ilmenite  typically  grades  0.3%  V2O5.  The  abundance  of  these  ilmenite  exsolutions 
causes dilution of the vanadium grade in the magnetite. Vanadium grades in magnetite 
and  ilmenite  are  rather  constant  in  PO,  P1  and  P2,  and  drop  drastically  in  P3.  The 
difference in vanadium grade of the concentrates produced from P0, P1 and P2 reflects 
the abundance of ilmenite exsolutions within the magnetite. For a typical sample from 
P2, it is calculated that 86% of the vanadium is hosted in magnetite, 8% of vanadium is 
in  ilmenite  (exsolutions  plus  granular  grains)  and  5%  is  hosted  in  ferromagnesian 
minerals (table 6). It is technically possible, although not economical, to process ilmenite 
along  with  magnetite  to  recover  its  vanadium.  However,  processing  ferromagnesian

silicates is not technically feasible. Not processing ilmenite and ferromagnesian silicate 
explains the reported low vanadium recovery, tested at about 70-80%. 
 
In  oxide  mineral,  vanadium  is  present  as  sesquioxide  V2O3  species,  despite  its  grade

ITEM 8: DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
In his discovery report, Allard (1967) made comparisons between the magnetite series of 
the Lac Doré Complex and the ones of the Bushveld Complex in South Africa. Similar 
series  are  also  reported  in  the  Skaergaard  Complex  in  Greenland,  the  Stillwater 
Complex  in  Nunavut,  and  the  Cullin  Complex  in  the  British  Tertiary  Province.  Another 
Archean equivalent is the Bell River Complex in the Matagami area, Quebec, Canada, 
which hosts the Iron-T Vanadium Project owned by VanadiumCorp. Such differentiated 
mafic  intrusions  are  rather  common,  and  many  of  them  contain  vanadium  bearing 
magnetite  series.  More  than  80%  of  the  vanadium  produced  worldwide  is  from  such 
occurrences, which also accounts for near to 100% of the primary production. 
 
METALLOGENY 
 
Vanadium  is  a  ubiquitous  element,  reported  at  levels  reaching  hundreds  of  ppm  in 
almost  any  kind  of  rock.  Vanadium  is  a  polyvalent  transition  metal,  with  valences 
between  V++  to  V+5,  which  is  the  controlling  factor  in  its  distribution.  Vanadium  is 
constituently  in  minerals  from  supergene  environments,  representing  very  oxidizing 
conditions and where vanadium is present as tetravalent vanadyl (V+4O)+2 or pentavalent 
vanadate  radical  (V+5O4)-3  such  as  pentagonite,  mounanaite,  bannermanite  and  more 
than 200 exotic mineral species.  
 
In  reducing  systems,  V+2  has  a  chemical  behaviour  similar  to  iron  in  regards  to  most 
common ferromagnesian minerals, such as chlorite or pyroxene, where it substitutes into 
M+2  sites.  Vanadium  therefore  does  not  tend  to  concentrate  in  a  specific  mineral  in 
silicate  dominated  magmatic,  hydrothermal  or  metamorphic  systems.  Inversely,  under 
higher  oxygen  fugacity,  vanadium  in  its  V+++  state  tends  to  partition  against  Fe+++  in 
minerals such as magnetite (coulsonite or vuorelainenite are the vanadium end-member 
+3O4) and hemo-ilmenite (karelianite V2O3 end-member 
of the spinel family (Fe-Mn)+2V2
as  a  diadochic  substitution  with  FeTiO3).  Some  other  complex  vanadium-titanium 
minerals are known, such as Kyzylkumite and Schreyerite, which are noted for reference 
only. 
 
Massive  iron  oxide  precipitation  can  occur  in  differentiating  mafic  magmatic  systems, 
such as layered complexes. Triggering of this precipitation is apparently caused by silica 
saturation  related  to  contamination  of  the  magma  by  melted  roof-rocks  and  the 
development of granophyre. Precipitation of these iron and titanium oxides may take on 
the form of rhythmically layered series such at Lac Doré or in the Bushveld, as massive 
oxide  pockets  such  as  the  "pipes"  in  the  Bushveld  Complex  or  the  St-Urbain 
Anorthosites,  or  as  broad  horizons  such  as  nelsonites  (ilmenite-apatite-magnetite

magmatic  rocks  typically  associated  with  anorthosite)  and  cumberlandite  (magnetite-
ilmenite-olivine  magmatic  rocks  typically  associated  with  troctolite)  deposits  in  the  Lac 
St-Jean  Anorthosites.  In  all  cases,  vanadium  is  preferentially  partitioned  into  the  first 
oxides to precipitate. Only magnetite layers series and magnetite pipes are economically 
mined as vanadium sources. Vanadium within ilmenite ore is considered a contaminant 
in respect of titanium production. Vanadium bearing magnetite cannot be distinguished 
from  common  magnetite  on  the  basis  of  its  appearance  or  physical  property, 
necessitating assaying. 
 
Layered  mafic  complexes  being  large  geological  features,  tens  to  hundreds  of  square 
kilometres in area, host extremely large magnetite deposits. Such occurrences are easily 
identified  in  mineral  exploration  due  to  their  prominent  aeromagnetic  signature. 
However,  in  most  occurrences,  layers  are  thin  or  the  magnetite  is  disseminated, 
rendering  mining  of  these  non-economical.  The  titanium  content  of  such  magnetite 
makes them not suitable for iron production through conventional blast furnace process.

ITEM 9: EXPLORATION 
 
A large amount of exploration work was conducted on the East and West deposits by 
prior owners. The most detailed surveys were conducted by IOS on behalf of McKenzie 
Bay Resources, and are considered as superseding previous work done by SOQUEM or 
the Ministère des Richesses Naturelles not including previous drilling. 
 
VanadiumCorp  conducted  two  trenching  programs,  two  limited  drilling  programs  and 
three  ground  magnetometric  surveys  between  2007  and  2013,  plus  some  road 
improvement  and  a  GPS  survey  (Aurus,  2013).  The  author's  firm  conducted  a  field 
program on behalf of VanadiumCorp in fall 2014, which included a DGPS survey of drill 
collars,  some  verification  and  sampling  of  the  1997  trenches,  re-mapping  of  2008 
trenches and re-logging of 2013 holes. 
 
A certain amount of exploration data produced during VanadiumCorp’s tenure as owner 
of the Lac Dore project has not been made available to the authors. This is due in large 
part to the nature of the transition between previous VanadiumCorp management and 
new management. Some data that was not filed as assessment work has been either 
withheld from current management or destroyed and was not available to the authors of 
this report. 
 
GROUND MAGNETOMETRIC SURVEYS 
 
Three ground magnetometric surveys were conducted on behalf of former management 
of  VanadiumCorp,  covering  the  Lac  Doré  (Tshimbalanga,  2009,  2012  and  Lac  Doré 
North  (Tshimbalanga  and  Hubert,  2009)  properties  (table  7).  All  three  surveys  were 
conducted  in  a  similar  manner  by  Geosig  Inc.,  from  Québec  City.  The  surveys  were 
conducted  with 
(neutron  precession) 
magnetometers, a mobile and a stationary unit. Lines were spaced every 100 metres, 
oriented  N315o,  plus  a  baseline  and  tie  lines.  Station  locations  were  measured  with 
handheld  GPS  devices.  A  base  station  was  established  and  calibrated  at  57,000  γ, 
providing an accuracy of 1 γ. Isopleth maps and profiles were provided. No vertical or 
horizontal  gradient  was  measured  or  calculated,  and  no  modelization  was  generated. 
Results from these surveys were concatanated and re-gridded as a single map (figures 
9A and 9B). 
 
For  the  purpose  of  the  ground  magnetometric  survey,  the  former  McKenzie  Bay's 
picketed line network was refreshed and surveyed (Aurus, 2013).

2008 AND 2009 STRIPPING PROGRAM   
 
Stripping  programs  were  conducted  on  the  South-Western  extremity  of  the  Lac  Doré 
North property in 2008 and 2009. The area targeted seems to coincide with the most 
intense ground magnetometric anomaly reported (Tshimbalanga and Hubert, 2009).  
 
No report, sample location, maps, field notes or assay databases regarding this stripping 
was made available to the author. For this reason, the stripping was re-mapped in the 
fall 2014 by one of the author's staff. Most sampling tags were still present, and assays 
available from certificates were relocated (Block, 2015).

2012: CHANNEL SAMPLING 
 
A channel sampling program was conducted in the summer of 2012 on the McKenzie 
Bay  trenches  in  Lac  Doré  property.  No  data  or  reports  were  made  available  to  the 
author, nor any report filed for assessment.  
 
2014 PROGRAM 
 
In  the  fall  of  2014,  a  brief  field  program  was  conducted  in  preparation  of  the  current 
resource estimate. It included:
  Locating the historic drill holes collars and surveying them with a DGPS. 
  Mapping the 2008-2009 trenches. 
  Verifying  the  current  status  of  1997  trenches  and  sampling  any  neglected
intervals.
  Re-sampling and re-logging of 2013 drill holes.
VALIDITY OF AVAILABLE SURVEYS 
 
The ground magnetometric surveys were conducted according to the industry standards 
but are superseded by the BlackRock Metals high resolution helicopter-borne survey. 
 
As  no  report,  sample  location,  maps,  field  notes  or  assay  database  regarding  the 
stripping was filed with the government or made available to the author, the validity of 
the trenching programs will not be commented on. 
 
INDEPENDENCE OF CONTRACTORS 
 
Geosig Inc. is a well established contractor, the independence and integrity of whom is 
not questioned. 
 
The trenching program was conducted by Glen McCormick Exploration, which was likely 
not independent from VanadiumCorp.

ITEM 10: DRILLING AND CHANNEL SAMPLING 
 
Limited  drilling  has  been  completed  by  VanadiumCorp  to  date.  Ten  (10)  short 
exploration  holes  were  drilled  on  the  Lac  Doré  North  in  2009,  and  four  confirmation 
holes  were  drilled  in  2013.  This  is  in  contrast  with  the  amount  of  historical  drilling 
completed by previous owners, which is the basis for the current resource calculation. 
Due to the importance of these historic drill holes and their use in the resource 
estimate, they will be described in detail in the following sections. 
 
Trench  and  drill  hole  locations  from  the  Lac  Doré  project  are  summarized  in  figures 
10A  and  10B.  The  sampling  and  assaying  procedures  are  provided  in  the  following 
sections. Trench details and a collection of drill hole sections were compiled in Girard, 
2014, but not considered relevant to the current report 
 
1997 McKENZIE BAY RESOURCES TRENCHING 
 
The  1997  stripping  campaign  carried  out  by  the  author  on  behalf  of  McKenzie  Bay 
Resources  provided  quite  systematic  channel  samples  on  more  or  less  continuous 
section across the East and West deposits, spaced every 100 metres (Tremblay, 1998). 
A  gap  in  the  trenching  pattern  exists  between  0+50E  at  the  West  end  of  the  West 
deposit, and 2+00W due to topographic constraints. These trenches are quite systematic 
and continuous, being interrupted only on topographic accident or to avoid ripping out 
the road. Location of the trenches was established with the use of a magnetometer, to 
locate the limits of the mineralization. Land surveying was made in 1997 and recently 
reviewed (Aurus, 2013). Overburden was typically less than a metre thick. The quality of 
these trenches is sufficient to consider them as equivalent to horizontal drill holes for the 
purpose  of  the  current  resource  estimate.  Trenches  within  the  actual  VanadiumCorp's 
Lac Doré project are listed in table 8. An example is depicted on picture 14. 
 
It  should  be  noted  that  segments  of  trenches  2+50E,  3+50E,  4+50E,  5+50E,  2+00W, 
3+00W and 4+00W are partly located on BlackRock Metals property.

1958 DRILLING BY JALORE MINING LTD. 
 
Six holes were drilled by Jalore Mining in 1958, of which 5 are within the main Lac Doré 
property.  In  the  Jalore  report,  hole's  azimuth  were  indicated  as  S28oE  in  the  old  four-
quadrant  system,  which  shall  translate  as  N152o  in  the  more  conventional  single 
quadrant  system.  However,  every  subsequent  report  indicates  them  as  towards 
northwest. Since drill collars are not available anymore, field verification is not possible. 
These holes are thus considered or oriented N308o to 339o so about 20o clockwise of the 
actual  grid.  Drill  collar  locations  were  unidentified.  The  core  was  AX  in  diameter,  and 
was  split  for  sampling.  Jalore  assayed  the  core  for  iron  and  titanium  in  their  private 
laboratory, and only results indicated in the log are available. The core was recovered by 
MRN  in  1970,  quarter-split  and  submitted  for  vanadium  assaying  and  Davis  tube 
magnetite concentrate at CRM (Kish, 1971). The core was not preserved. These holes 
are of little use and are not relevant to the current resource estimation.

1959 DRILLING BY TREPAN MINING 
 
A series of five holes (T-1 to T-5) were drilled by Trepan Mining South-East of Armitage 
lake, on the Armitage deposit in 1959 (GM 10012). Being located outside the outline of 
the properties, no attempt was made to evaluate them, and they were not included in the 
current resource estimation. 
 
1970-1974 DRILLING BY QUÉBEC GOVERNMENT 
 
Ten of the 13 holes drilled by the Ministère des Richesses Naturelles are located within 
Lac Doré property, of which 9 are on the East deposit. Two of the remaining holes are 
on  the  South-West  deposit  while  two  others  are  on  the  West  deposit  but  outside 
VanadiumCorp's property (BlackRock property). 
 
Four holes were drilled in 1970 (DDH-07 to DDH-10), and logged by contract geologist 
of the MRN (Kish, 1971). Another nine holes (DDH-11 to DDH-19) were drilled in 1974 
by L. Abvramtchev, of which only logs are available (table 9) devoid of a detailed report. 
The holes are oriented approximately parallel to current grid-lines, between N320o and 
N330°. MRN grid was oriented with an east-west baseline and due North lines, which 
explains why holes are indicated to an angle to the lines in the logs. No evidence of this 
grid remains in the field. Casings were not left behind and old drill pads are not readily 
visible.  However,  evidence  of  the  pads  or  access  trails  were  recently  located  (Block, 
2015).  Logging  and  footage  markings  on  these  holes  were  apparently  not  done  in  a 
conventional manner, without inserting marker blocks at the end of each tube. Accurate 
metering and re-logging of these holes is not possible. Furthermore, significant handling 
and transport of the core boxes caused the split core to shift in the boxes. And finally, 
the core resided for 20 years in the core-racks of Niobec Mine, near the tailing pond and 
is thus heavily contaminated with niobium carbonatite dust. Core is BQ in diameter, and 
was  sampled  by  half-splitting.  Drill  logs  were  obtained  from  assessment  files,  as 
conventional paper logs, which were captured into a Microsoft Office Excel dataset by 
IOS in 1997, and converted to Geotic's database for the purpose of the current report. 
The core is currently stored at a BlackRock facility, but of little use due to its poor state 
of conservation. 
 
The  quality  and  level  of  details  of  the  logging  by  the  MRN  is  adequate  except  for 
potential  issues  with  depth  measurement.  No  RQD,  density,  photographs  or  other 
measurements  are  available.  Precision  of  the  azimuth  is  uncertain,  considering  the 
magnetic deviation occurring on the deposit, and the absence of GPS devices which did 
not exist at that time. Orientation was probably made by aligning the rig with the lines, 
the quality of which cannot be verified. The plunge of the hole was measured with acid 
tests.  Sampling  procedures  are  not  described  nor  is  the  chain  of  custody.  Only  Davis

tube magnetite analyses are available for the 1970 holes conducted at CRM (Centre de 
recherche  minérale,  a  former  governmental  metallurgy  research  facility,  currently 
COREM).  Averages  of  headgrade  analysis  are  reported,  but  individual  analyses  were 
not  disclosed.  Holes  drilled  in  1974  have  both  headgrade  and  magnetite  concentrate 
assays. 
 
The  MRN  holes  are  considered  of  sufficient  reliability  for  the  current  calculation  of 
inferred resources. However, it is in the author opinion that they shall be excluded from 
any subsequent indicated resource calculation.

1979 DRILLING BY SOQUEM 
 
In  1979,  SOQUEM  conducted  the  first  resource  definition  drilling  program  over  the 
Eastern  deposit,  for  19  holes  and  3325  metres  (Dion,  1980).  Holes  were  spaced 
between  50  to  100  metres  along  sections,  with  sections  every  100-200  metres.  Holes 
were oriented parallel to the sections or N324o, plunging toward the northeast. Collars 
were  located  by  grid  coordinates,  but  the  grid  was  surveyed  by  a  land  surveyor, 
providing accurate relative location. However, the grid position was anchored on a local

datum (E40+00.23, S0+25.07) no longer available. Some collars as well as most drilling 
pads were recently located and measured with a DGPS (Block, 2015). Drill core is BQ in 
diameter, with near perfect recovery. Orientation of the holes was apparently based on 
grid  lines,  while  the  plunge  was  measured  with  acid  test.  Sampling  proceeded  by 
splitting, typically 3 metres in length. The core was stored at Niobec mines until it was 
recovered  by  McKenzie  Bay  in  1997.  It  is  currently  stored  as  BlackRock  facilities  in 
Chibougamau. Access to the core was declined by BlackRock Metals. However, due to 
the  numerous  manipulations  and  transportation  of  the  core,  its  integrity  is  uncertain. 
Assaying  of  headgrade  was  conducted  by  Chimitec  of  Québec  City,  while  magnetite 
concentration by the use of a Davis tube was conducted by CRM on composite samples. 
 
Results from SOQUEM drilling are considered as sufficiently reliable to be included in 
the  current  inferred  resource  estimation.  However,  it  is  uncertain  if  those  results  are 
reliable  enough  to  be  included  in  a  subsequent  resource  category  upgrade,  mainly 
because of uncertainties related to assaying. 
 
2001 EXPLORATION DRILLING BY McKENZIE BAY RESOURCES 
 
In 2001, McKenzie Bay Resources conducted an exploration drilling campaign outside of 
the main deposit (Huss, 2003), for a total of 2187 metres. Of the 14 holes, one (DDH-01) 
is located on Lac Doré North, while two (DDH-5 and DDH-6) are within Lac Doré. The 
remaining 11 holes are collared on BlackRock's property. This drilling was conducted by

Holes were located to intersect the ground magnetometric anomaly, oriented parallel to 
the grid, and located according to grid pickets. They were NQ in diameter, and deviation 
of  plunge  was  measured  with  acid  testing,  thus  lacking  downhole  azimuth.  Accurate 
collar location were recently measured by DGPS for most holes. The core is currently 
stored in BlackRock facilities, the access to which was declined to the author. 
 
Only  Davis  tube  magnetite  concentrates  were  analyzed,  without  headgrade  analysis. 
Rejects were not preserved, so headgrade analysis is not possible anymore. Samples 
were typically 3 metres in length, for a total of 497 samples. However, due to budgetary 
constraints, samples were not assayed until 2003, under the Cambior Option. They were 
then  concatenated  into  197  samples,  typically  9  metres  in  length.  Of  these,  166  were 
selected for Davis tube testing and assaying of the magnetite concentrate. 
 
McKenzie Bay 2001 holes were not included in the currently resource estimate, being 
located outside the main deposit. However, their quality is considered sufficient for an 
eventual inclusion.

2002 CONFIRMATION DRILLING BY SNC-LAVALIN 
 
Under  the  supervision  of  SNC-Lavalin,  and  as  part  of  their  due  diligence  on  the 
resources  of  the  deposits,  IOS  conducted  a  three  hole  drill  program,  aiming  to  certify 
former  SOQUEM  and  MRN  results  on  the  Eastern  deposit  (Boudreault,  2002).  These 
holes  were  not  duplicates  of  former  holes,  but  seem  to  rather  test  surface  results 
obtained from trenching. The program was directed by Mr Alexandre Boudreault, junior 
engineer, under the supervision of the first author in the fall of 2002. Holes were NQ in 
diameter, and located according to line pickets. Dips were measured with clinometer at 
collar, and by acid test at depth, and thus lacking downhole azimuth measurement. 
 
The core was logged according to industry standards, on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 
However,  this  data  was  stored  on  floppy  disk  which  is  now  corrupted  and  on  tape-
backups  which  cannot  be  read  by  modern  computers,  which  means  they  were  not 
available in numerical format and need to be recaptured. RQD were measured, the only 
ones over the whole project. Sampling was done with a core splitter, for a total of 107 
samples, plus QAQC materials. The core is currently stored in a BlackRock facility, the 
access of which was declined to the author. 
 
Additionally  to  the  three  drill  holes,  trench  11+50E  was  re-sampled  for  a  length  of  15 
metres. Sampling proceeded with a diamond rock saw, cutting a 2" wide strip beside the 
former samples, for a total of 15 samples. 
 
Samples  were  crushed  and  prepared  at  COREM  for  headgrade  analysis.  Davis  tube 
testing  was  not  conducted.  Material  from  these  samples  are  no  longer  available,  and 
cannot  be  tested  for  magnetic  concentration.  It  is  in  the  author’s  opinion  that  the  log 
description and sampling procedure were adequate. SNC-Lavalin holes were included in 
the current resources estimate. 
 
2009 VANADIUMCORPDRILLING 
 
In  2009,  VanadiumCorp  (recorded  as  Apella  Resources  in  assessment  filing  registry) 
conducted a drilling program on their Lac  Doré  North property, for a total of 10 holes 
and 1129.94 metres. The program was conducted by Mr Roger Moar, P.Geo, under the 
supervision of Mr Christian Derosier, P.Geo. No report was produced on this program, 
only drill logs were submitted for assessment files, and only the Geotic drilling database 
was made available to the author. Drilling sites were visited by the author in the course 
of his mandatory visit (picture  15), and seem properly located and oriented. Accurate 
coordinates of collars were recently measured by DGPS. Casings were left on a few of 
the  holes  and  capped  with  aluminium  plugs.  A  wooden  peg  was  inserted  in  the  hole 
where no casing was left.

Core was HQ in diameter, and was stored in a previously rented facility in Chibougamau 
which is now closed. It was recovered by the first author's crew and moved to the IOS 
facility, located in Saguenay. The core was examined by Gennady Ivanov, P. Geo, and 
the  log  reviewed.  The  logs  were  of  adequate  quality  and  sufficiently  detailed.  A 
downhole survey was conducted by Flex-it device. However, since Flex-it measurement 
are  based  on  magnetic  anisotropy,  downhole  azimuth  measurement  are  not  reliable. 
RQD,  density  or  magnetic  susceptibility  were  not  measured,  nor  were  photographs 
taken. 
 
Samples  were  taken  with  the  use  of  a  diamond  saw,  for  a  total  of  254  samples,  for 
length up to 3 metres. It was noted that wall rock to the magnetite bearing layers were 
not  sampled.  Samples  were  crushed  and  pulverized  at 
in 
Chibougamau, and shipped for assay at ALS Mineral in Val-d'Or. 
 
Most of the holes are located on the west side of the property, testing the large magnetic 
anomaly  and  the  magnetite  layers  visible  on  their  trenches.  Four  holes  were  testing 
other  targets  further  east.  Surprisingly,  these  do  not  coincide  with  magnetic  anomaly, 
and their purpose is uncertain. 
 
The  holes  were  located  outside  the  main  deposits,  and  thus  were  not  included  in  the 
current resource estimate.

2013 VANADIUMCORP DRILLING  
 
In  2013,  VanadiumCorp,  (recorded  as  PacificOre  Mining  in  the  assessment  filing 
registry) conducted a short drilling program of four holes on their Lac Doré property, for 
a total of 600 metres (picture 16). These holes aimed to duplicate former SOQUEM and 
Jalore holes, as shown in table 10. It should be noted that these duplicate holes were 
shorter than the original holes, with slightly different orientation and plunge, and that they 
were  collared  up  to  20  metres  away  from  the  reported  position  of  the  original  holes. 
Confusion in the labelled hole numbers were noted by the author between LD-13-03 (not 
existing in the field) and LD-13-04B (as indicated on the peg). The provided database 
also indicates that LD-13-04 is a twin of DDH-71-02 which do not exist, and considered 
as S-58-02.

Holes drilled in 2013 were HQ in diameter. They were reportedly located with the use of 
handheld GPS, with downhole survey made from acid testing. Collars were all located by 
the author last fall, and their DGPS location recently measured (Block, 2015). They were 
originally  described  by  Mr  Christian  Derosier,  P.Geo,  using  a  Geotic  database.  They 
were  recently  re-logged  due  to  some  deficiencies  (Ivanov,  2015),  and  detailed 
photographs taken. RQD, recoveries and magnetic susceptibility were measured along 
with  fracture  description.  Density  measurements  are  not  available.  Half  core  was 
sampled  with  the  use  of  a  diamond  saw,  and  samples  shipped  to  the  CEAQ-TJCM 
facilities  in  Chibougamau,  for  a  total  of  122  samples  and  317.05  metres  of  core.  The 
core was stored in a Chibougamau facility until it was recovered and transferred to IOS 
facilities in Saguenay. Coarse rejects were recovered from TJCM, re-assayed at Corem 
and magnetite concentrated by Davis tube.

MINERALIZED INTERSECTIONS 
 
Mineralized intersections were published officially only for the 2009 (November 30, 2009 
press release) and 2013 programs (April 2, 2013 press release). Neither SOQUEM nor 
McKenzie  Bay  published  their  intersections  or  calculated  them  in  their  reports. 
Intersections were calculated for the purpose of the previous version of the report, using 
uniform parameters and "Explorpac" (Gemcom) software provided on figures 10A and 
10B.  McKenzie  Bay  channel  samples  were  included  in  the  calculation  as  "horizontal 
holes", assuming unsampled interval as barren. Segments of holes or trenches outside 
the  property  (onto  BlackRock  property),  naming  trenches  3+50E,  4+50E,  5+50E  and 
6+50E, as well as for drill holes S1 and S7, were not excluded. Constraints used for this 
calculation were different from the parameters used for the current resources estimate. 
This means that intersections may differ in grade and length between the two versions of 
the  report.  A  3-D  projection  of  the  drill  holes  made  by  the  first  author  is  presented  in 
figure 11.

DISCUSSION ABOUT DRILLING RESULTS 
 
The VanadiumCorp properties include 54 drill holes, all from previous drill programs. The 
majority of these drill holes are located on Lac  Doré property, specifically the Eastern 
deposit.  Of  the  35  holes  available  on  the  Eastern  deposit,  4  are  considered  as  not 
sufficiently documented and reliable to be used for a resource calculation. The remaining 
holes are considered sufficient quality to be incorporated into a resource estimation as 
inferred resources. Drilling on the  Western deposit is sparse with only 4 holes, two of 
which are outside of the property, and two of which are split between VanadiumCorp and 
BlackRock's  properties.  Therefore,  resources  were  not  evaluated  on  the  Western 
deposit. Similarly, 11 holes are within the North-Eastern deposit, 7 of which within a tight 
cluster.  These  provide  only  a  partial  interpretation  of  this  deposit,  and  an  adequate 
resource cannot be estimated from the North-eastern deposit. 
 
The  bulk  of  the  drilling  is  located  within  P2  unit,  which  is  the  dominant  resource  of 
magnetite. Only a few intersections have passed through the entire stratigraphy of the 
magnetite  layers,  excluding  the  P0  which  was  not  intersected  by  any  drill  holes. 
However,  it  shall  be  noted  that  discrimination  of  stratigraphy  units  has  not  been 
attempted for any drill holes except for the ones drilled in 2001 and 2002 by McKenzie 
Bay. Distribution of stratigraphic unit was extrapolated from the surface trenching, where 
it was carefully mapped (Tremblay, 1998).

The irregular drilling pattern contrasts with the regular and thorough channel sampling 
conducted  by  McKenzie  Bay.  Trenching  results  are  of  sufficient  quality  to  be 
incorporated  into  resource  estimation  as  sub-horizontal  drill  holes.  Such  systematic 
trenching is not available on the North-Eastern deposit and trenches on Western deposit 
are too spaced apart to be of any use for resource calculation. 
 
Drilling of the North-Eastern deposit suggests the deposit is affected by faulting related 
to the Grenville Front, which creates stacking and truncation of the stratigraphy, in stark 
contrast  to  Eastern  and  Western  deposits.  Detailed  interpretation  of  the  north-eastern 
deposit  has  never  been  attempted.  It  seems  that  further  to  the  East,  the  P2  unit 
disappears, leaving a thick non-economical P3 unit. 
 
DRILL CORE STORAGE 
 
The drill core from Trepan Mining and Jalore Mining is considered lost. 
 
The drill core from the Ministère des Richesses Naturelles was recovered by SOQUEM 
and  stored  at  Niobec  Mines  storage  facility.  In  1997,  this  core,  along  with  SOQUEM 
core,  was  recovered  from  Niobec  by  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  and  stored  at  Laugon 
Lake.  In  1999,  core-racks  were  built  at  Laugon  Lake,  and  the  core  properly  stored. 
However, due to its improper storage, it is unlikely that the integrity of this core has been 
maintained. 
 
The core from the 2001 drill holes completed for McKenzie Bay and SNC-Lavalin has 
also  been  stored  at  Laugon  Lake.  From  2001  to  recently,  this  storage  facility  was  left 
unattended, and some core was vandalized. Integrity of this core is likely partial. 
 
In the summer 2008, the core stored at Laugon Lake was transferred in new core boxes 
with covers and strapped on palettes pending transfer to a secured BlackRock Metals 
facility.  Access  to  the  core  was  denied  by  BlackRock  and  its  fate  is  not  known  to  the 
author. 
 
VanadiumCorp's drill core is currently stored in racks in the IOS secured facility, located 
in Saguenay, QC.

ITEM  11:  SAMPLING,  SAMPLE  PREPARATION,  ANALYSIS 
AND SECURITY 
 
McKENZIE BAY CHANNEL SAMPLING  
 
All the channel sampling for McKenzie Bay Resources was completed by IOS using a 
uniform protocol. Channels were cut with the use of diamond saws, about 4 centimetres 
wide and deep, parallel to the sections (trench axis). Samples are typically 3 metres in 
length,  weighting  10-20  kg  per  sample.  Aluminium  tags  were  nailed  on  the  rock  for 
identification.  Locations  were  chained  from  the  line's  pickets,  and  GPS  location  never 
recorded.  Sample  length  disregarded  the  geology,  and  was  kept  as  constant  as 
possible.  Samples  were  chiselled  out  of  the  channels,  bagged  and  shipped  to 
Laboratoire  S.L.  (1997)  or  IOS  facilities  (1998)  for  crushing  and  grinding.  No  witness 
samples were kept, since trenches are readily accessible. Rejects from crushing were 
kept temporarily for eventual metallurgical processing but were finally discarded in 2002. 
A rigorous chain of custody was implemented by the author, due to stronger regulatory 
measures imposed in the aftermath of the Bre-X. 
 
The effect of weathering was tested upon a few samples, by collecting twin duplicates 
below the initial sample. No discrepancies were noted. No weathering is noticeable at 
the  surface  of  the  trenches  (Tremblay  et  al.,  1998),  and  the  quality  of  sampling  was 
considered adequate. 
 
JALORE AND TREPAN MINING CORE SAMPLING 
 
No information is available on sampling procedure, else that the MRN re-sampled the 
core in 1971. 
 
MRN CORE SAMPLING 
 
Core drilled by the MRN, BQ in size, was split with a standard core splitter and shipped 
to CRM for assaying. Details are not available, and rejects were discarded. The author 
noted  that  depth  markers  were  not  inserted  in  the  boxes,  neither  was  samples  limits, 
implying  that  it  would  be  impossible  to  properly  quarter-split  this  core  to  replicate  the 
assays. 
 
SOQUEM CORE SAMPLING 
 
Core drilled by SOQUEM, BQ in size, was split with a standard core splitter and shipped 
to Chimitec in Québec City for assaying. Detailed sampling procedure is available (Dion,
991, 2015, NI-43-101-V1

1980),  and  rejects  were  discarded.  According  to  our  1997  observation,  sampling  was 
according to industry standards. Contrarily to MRN core, the depth marks were properly 
located. Various sections of the core were re-sampled by quarter-splitting by the author 
in  1997,  and  submitted  to  ALS  Chemex  for  confirmation  assays.  However,  due  to  the 
multiple manipulations on the core through time, pieces shifted in the boxes and exact 
position cannot be certified. 
 
McKENZIE BAY RESOURCES CORE SAMPLING 
 
The NQ core from the 2001 and 2002 McKenzie Bay Resources drill program was split 
in  half  on  site  using  a  regular  hydraulic  core  splitter  by  IOS  crews,  following  industry 
standards.  The  samples  were  bagged  and  shipped  to  IOS  facilities  for  crushing  and 
pulverizing. This core is now likely stored at BlackRock facility and if such, it would be 
available  for  re-sampling.  A  proper  chain  of  custody  was  implemented  for  the  two 
McKenzie Bay programs. 
 
VANADIUMCORP CORE SAMPLING 
 
The NQ core from the 2009 and 2013 drill programs was halved with a diamond saw in a 
facility rented in Chibougamau, by Glen McCormick Exploration staff, following industry 
standards. The samples were bagged and shipped to TJCM facilities for crushing and 
pulverizing. This core, the coarse crushing rejects as well as the pulps are now stored in 
IOS  facility.  Coarse  rejects  from  2013  program  were  used  for  re-assaying  and  Davis 
tube  testing.  No  chain  of  custody  was  implemented  by  former  management  of 
VanadiumCorp, while a strict chain is implemented in IOS facility. 
 
SAMPLE SECURITY AND TAMPERING ISSUES 
 
Historical  drilling  program  were  sampled  either  by  government  or  a  crown  corporation 
representative, and falsification of the samples is not considered a concern. 
 
Since the 1997, McKenzie Bay Resources trenching program was carried out just after 
the aftermath of the Bre-X saga, much care was devoted to sample security. Samples 
were trucked by IOS employees to IOS or Laboratoires S.L. preparation facilities, and 
preparation  done  under  IOS  supervision  (Bédard,  1998).  Tampering  issues  were 
discussed but considered practically irrelevant (Girard, 1997), considering the size of the 
sample,  the  abundance  of  vanadium  and  its  embedding  in  the  magnetite  structure. 
McKenzie  Bay  representatives  never  acceded  the  samples  in  the  course  of  the 
programs.

MRN HEADGRADE ASSAYS 
 
Core  recovered  from  Ministère  des  Richesses  Naturelles  drill  campaign  was  sent  to 
Centre  de  Recherches  Minérales  ("CRM")  for  assay.  CRM  was  then  a  governmental 
laboratory dedicated to mineral processing, with extensive expertise in iron ore dressing. 
Samples  were  ground  at  75  μm  (200  mesh),  prior  to  being  submitted  for  Davis  tube 
testing. Headgrade was apparently assayed but not reported for iron, titanium, vanadium 
and  chromium,  and  data  considered  as  lost.  Davis  tube  magnetite  concentrates  were 
assayed and reported for iron, titanium and vanadium. Analytical procedures were not 
disclosed,  although  the  use  of  XRF  on  lithium  glass  bead  is  likely.  Quality  controls 
protocols and proficiency were not disclosed, if at all implemented. 
 
It  shall  be  noted  the  grinding  prior  to  Davis  tube  testing  was  finer  (75  microns)  than 
subsequent  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  samples  (200  microns)  preventing  direct 
comparison. This resulted in slightly higher vanadium and lower titanium grades in the 
concentrates, which will be discussed in detail in item 12.

SOQUEM HEADGRADE ASSAYS 
 
Core  from  SOQUEM  drilling  was  first  assayed  for  vanadium,  iron  and  titanium  by 
Chimitec  (Dion,  1980).  Chimitec  is  a  former  Bondar-Clegg  subsidiary,  subsequently 
bought by Inscape Testing in 1980's, then by ChemexLab in the 1990's, and finally by 
ALS in 2000's. The then director of Chimitec, Mr Richard Deschambeault, still owns this 
data  and  much  about  the  analytical  procedure  was  obtained  from  him.  A  total  of  691 
samples  were  submitted,  and  analysed  by  atomic  absorption  for  vanadium  (digestion 
method not available), colourimetry for titanium and K2Cr2O7 titration for iron. A quality 
control  protocol  was  implemented,  including  re-assaying  of  169  samples  by  the  CRM, 
plus  60  aliquots  of  five  different  internal  reference  materials.  SOQUEM  also  carried  a 
redundancy proficiency test ("round-robin") prior to selecting Chimitec, involving five (5) 
different commercially operated or institutional laboratories. Consider that implementing 
such QAQC protocol in the 1970's was not common practice. Chimitec was selected on 
the  basis  that  they  provided  results  close  to  the  average  of  the  test,  plus  economic 
consideration.  However,  it  must  be  noted  that  no  certified  reference  material  was 
inserted  in  the  test,  meaning  that  only  precision  (precision  being  the  capability  to 
replicate the data properly, and thus represent the standard deviation on the replicated 
analysis of the material) was tested, but not accuracy (accuracy being the capability to 
obtain the true value, or that the average of the replicated analysis match the certified 
value).  The  samples  assayed  both  at  Chimitec  and  CRM  within  this  proficiency  test 
indicated a discrepancy of about 8%, suggesting that at least one of the datasets was 
biased (figure 12). 
 
In  the  course  of  the  Davis  tube  testing  by  CRM,  this  laboratory  re-assayed  the  head 
sample. A comparison of the grades obtained on a 20 sample test run (Durocher, 1980 
(99-1098-93)), which were duplicated; indicate a discrepancy of 4-5% between the two 
laboratories (figure 13). Similarly, the headgrade of sample submitted for routine Davis 
tube  separation  were  measured  by  CRM,  and  can  be  compared  to  the  Chimitec 
composited  grades,  which  comparison  indicates  a  2.5%  discrepancy  (figure  14). 
Variations  between  the  correlation  factors  between  the  three  batches  of  samples 
suggest that one of the method being slightly unstable.

± 0.02% V2O5 as suggested from the difference between the CRM duplicates, regression 
is  anchored  at  0-0.  However,  since  Chimitec  results  were  calculated  by  compositing 
numerous assays, calculated error is expected to be multiplied by the number of sample 
in the composite, or 3 times more elevated than for CRM, which is based on a single 
assay. Notice that if samples which have a difference between both methods exceeding 
0.05% are excluded (assuming a wrong reading rather than just a calibration issue), the 
regression is slightly changed but both methods remain within 2.5% of each other. This 
suggest the symmetrical distribution of the errors.

Figure  15:  Headgrade  titanium  and  vanadium  assays  duplicate  between  CRM  and 
Chimitec (Desrochers, 1980). It can be noticed that the scattering is important, but the 
correlation  coefficient  is  significantly  higher  than  for  vanadium.  This  scattering  is 
suspected as caused by manipulation errors (these analysis predate computerization of 
the analytical process) and maybe errors on compositing process.  
 
A  set  of  10  quarter-splits  of  SOQUEM  core  was  re-assayed  by  McKenzie  Bay,  using 
ICP-OES  after  multi-acid  digestion  at  Chemex  Lab.  These  samples  were  significantly 
contaminated by niobium-bearing carbonatite from Niobec Mine, and it is likely that limits 
of  samples  are  likely  slightly  different  from  SOQUEM  samples  since  no  sample  limit 
marks were left on the core. Re-analysis was aimed to enable the comparison of 1979 
with 1997 analysis, and to merge them into a single coherent dataset. Bédard (1997), 
Bédard  and  Girard  (1997)  and  Girard  (1997)  suspected  the  SOQUEM  results  being 
underestimated  by  13%  (relative).  This  discrepancy  is  not  confirmed  in  the  CRM-
Chimitec analytical twins. Discrepancy arose concerning the adequacy of these assays 
in the course of historical project evaluation. Such underestimation may have impacted 
the conclusions of historic evaluations. 
 
Laboratory accreditation did not exist at the time of these programs. 
 
McKENZIE BAY HEADGRADE ASSAYS 
 
Samples  from  the  1997  and  subsequent  trenching  programs  were  assayed  with  the 
same  protocol  under  IOS  guidance.  Headgrade  analysis  was  carried  out  on  behalf  of 
McKenzie Bay Resources, while Davis tube testing and magnetite concentrates analysis 
were done on the behalf of Cambior Inc. 
 
Samples were crushed at 1.6 mm (10 mesh), aliquoted to 500 grams, and pulverized at 
63 μm (250 mesh) in IOS or S.L. Laboratories, prior to be shipped to Chemex Labs in

pulps  were  then  shipped  to  Vancouver  for  assaying  at  Chemex-Labs,  using  ICP-AES 
after  a  multi-acid  digestion,  except  for  vanadium  analysed  by  atomic  adsorption. 
Vanadium,  chromium  and  major  oxides  were  measured.  Rejects  and  pulps  were 
discarded. 
 
Samples from the 2002 confirmation drilling was prepared and assayed according to the 
same  protocol.  Samples  from  the  2001  exploration  drilling  were  not  submitted  for 
headgrade assays. Rejects and pulps are not available anymore. 
 
QUALITY CONTROL OF McKENZIE BAY HEADGRADE ASSAYS 
 
Accurate assaying of vanadium in magnetite is a complex process. First, for digestion-
based wet or spectral chemistry, such as atomic absorption or ICP methods, vanadium 
is  rather  refractory  and  is  put  in  solution  only  with  difficulty,  requiring  very  acidic  and 
oxidizing  condition.  This  creates  a  risk  of  vanadium  sesquioxide  flocculation  in  the 
digestion  liquor.  Sodium  peroxide  fusion  is  required  to  obtain  robust  results  which  is 
seldomly used. Vanadium is also notoriously difficult to measure by X-Ray fluorescence, 
due to peak interferences. Spectral line Kα for vanadium coincides with Kβ of titanium 
and Kβ of vanadium interfere with Kα of chromium. Since these three metals are present 
in the titano-magnetite, and because the less energetic Lα vanadium lines interfere with 
Kα of oxygen, vanadium cannot be measured directly and deconvolution of the signal is 
prone to miscalibration. 
 
Rigorous testing of assayer's proficiency was carried out in 1997 prior to the selection of 
Chemex laboratories. A set of test samples taken from the SOQUEM core, plus a series 
of certified reference material (SARM-12, SARM-38, and SARM-12 doped with SARM-
38 which is metallurgical grade V2O5) were submitted to Intertek, Chemex Laboratories, 
Metriclab, CRM, X-Ral, Australian National University and Mintek (a large metallurgical 
laboratory in South Africa, acquainted with vanadium metallurgy), who used a variety of 
analytical  methods.  Chemex  accurately  and  precisely  reported  the  expected  values 
(Bédard, 1997). This test represented the first attempt to measure the accuracy of the 
assays, and the author is confident in its robustness. 
 
Quality  control  included  repeated  assaying  of  certified  material  (SARM-12,  plain  and 
doped  with  SARM-38),  internal  reference  material  manufactured  from  Lac  Doré  bulk 
samples, and blanks. The internal reference material was assayed 37 times, and yielded 
a standard deviation of ± 0.02% V2O5 and a variation coefficient of 2.98%, if 2 outliers 
are excluded. Aliquotes of SARM-12 were reported properly. Four aliquotes of certified 
reference material, SARM-12 doped with SARM38, were assayed, which yielded quite 
discrepant  values,  suggesting  an  issue  with  the  doping  procedure  or  digestion  of  the

refractory SARM-38. No sample duplicates or re-analysis in a separate laboratory was 
made. 
 
ALS-Chemex  was  not,  at  the  time  of  the  project,  an  ISO-9001  accredited  facility. 
Accreditation was obtained in 2008. 
 
A subset of 1997 McKenzie Bay samples were submitted to Activation Laboratories and 
Corem  for  cross-check  analysis  by  Cambior  (Crépeau  2002).  Actlabs  analyses  were 
made by activation analysis, which, to the author knowledge, is not commonly used for. 
Although reputed as a total content analysis, the reliability of the method, detection limits 
and  linearity  of  the  methods  are  not  known  to  the  author.  Vanadium  is  usually  not 
included in INAA packages, meaning that a customized irradiation-decay counting was 
required.  X-Ray  absorption  issues  are  suspected  for  samples  rich  in  magnetite,  which 
may cause a non-linear relation between abundance and counts, usually not taken into 
account  in  the  course  of  calibration  by  this  method.  Two  batches  of  samples  were 
submitted,  in  1999  representing  initial  samples,  and  2000  representing  composited 
samples for Davis tube testing. It can be noted that regression between INAA and ICP-
OES analysis are close to unity for both sample subsets, the composited sample being 
less  accurate  (figure  16).  However,  correlation  of  1999  samples  indicates  that  INAA 
samples  are  overestimated  by  5.7%,  while  2000  composites  are  underestimated  by 
2.3%.  This  suggests  issues  with  the  constancy  of  calibration  with  either  one  or  both 
methods. 
 
Similarly,  the  same  set  of  composited  samples  selected  by  Cambior  (Crépeau,  2000) 
was also submitted for analysis by atomic absorption at Corem. Comparison with ALS-
Chemex  results  indicate  a  regression  coefficient  (R2=93.5)  similar  to  the  INAA-ALS 
duplicates with the same discrepant doublets, suggesting that the bulk of the scattering 
being  induced  by  ALS  analysis.  Atomic  absorption  are  overestimated  by  3.7%  (figure 
17).

VANADIUMCORP HEADGRADE ASSAYS 
 
2013  samples  were  prepared  for  assaying  at  the  Centre  d'Étude  Appliquée  au 
Quaternaire  (CEAQ),  a  Chibougamau  based  preparation  laboratory  run  by  the  Table 
Jamesienne de concertation minière (TJCM), a local mining development organization. 
Samples  were  dried,  crushed  to  70%  passing  2  mm  with  a  jaw  crusher,  split  to  250 
grams with a riffle splitter, and pulverized with a disk mill. Quality of milling is monitored 
by sieving every ten samples approximately. 
 
Samples  were  then  shipped  by  the  CAEQ  to  ALS  Minerals  in  Val-d'Or,  who  rerouted 
them to another facility for assaying. Major oxides and vanadium were analysed using

for  selected  samples.  Results  were  transmitted  electronically  to  VanadiumCorp  which 
integrated them into their database. 
 
2009 samples were submitted to CEAQ, likely to be prepared according to the protocol 
described  for  2013  samples.  They  were  then  shipped  to  ALS  Minerals  in  Val-d'Or  for 
assaying. Since no report is available, details are not disclosed, and only the analytical 
package  is  indicated  on  the  certificates  plus  some  details  on  the  press  release  dated 
November  30,  2009.  Certificates  of analysis  are  available  only  as  a  companion  to the 
assessment report stored at the MRN repository, originals or electronic copies were not 
provided to the author. These certificates indicate that major oxide and vanadium were 
analysed by XRF on a borate glass bead (ME-XRF-06 and V-XRF-10 packages), plus 
trace elements by ICP-MS after aqua-regia digestion for selected samples. However, in 
the  logs,  a  second  set  of  vanadium  assays  are  indicated,  for  which  no  certificate  are 
available.  These  second  assays  are  discrepant  from  the  previous  one,  when  both  are 
provided.  Not  all  samples  were  apparently  assayed  with  both  methods,  and  results 
presented on sections without discriminating the dataset. 
 
QUALITY CONTROL ON VANADIUMCORP ASSAYS 
 
VanadiumCorp Resources implemented a quality control procedure for assaying of their 
core  samples.  However,  no  description  of  this  procedure  and  its  proficiency  was 
provided to the author. 
 
The 2013 drill logs indicate that eight (8) reference materials were inserted among the 
samples, distributed irregularly, representing 6.5% of the population  (table  12). These 
include  three  (3)  blank  materials,  referred  as  "Graymont  limestone",  which  shall  be 
devoid of vanadium. Five other analyses refer to "SITA, SITB or SITD" internal reference 
materials which were prepared by CDN Resources Laboratories from Langley, B.C., and 
certified by Smee and Associates, who provided the author with the certification reports.

Table  12:  QCQA  results  on  2013  drilling  reference  materials.  Sample  54951,  with  a 
different sequence number, is listed in the database but not on certificate. 
 
Although the population is not large enough to be considered as representative, it can be 
noted  that  every  analysis  exceeds  the  certified  grade  by  about  0.1-0.2%  V  (10% 
relative). Coefficient of variation of these certifications is large, between 5-10%, which is 
of  a  concern  as  it  shows  a  low  precision  of  the  method  which  will  propagate  to  the 
resource estimates. A thorough review of the certification process would be required, but 
not conducted since these samples were re-assayed.  
 
The CEAQ used an alloyed steel ring mill for pulverization, the steel of which containing 
up to 1.0% V (certificate of analysis of the steel made available to the author). It was 
noted by the author, in a previous project, that milling of magnetite-rich samples cause a 
severe wear to the mill, which contributes up to 1% of the sample weight, or 1% of iron in 
the analysis. The current vanadium content of the steel could then contribute to 0.01% 
vanadium  to  the  sample,  higher  than  the  standard-deviation  indicated  for  the  assays. 
This  would  not  be  seen  in  the  reference  material,  since  they  were  not  prepared  by 
CEAQ.  It  is  uncertain  if  the  pulverization  of  the  "blank"  limestone  would  have  caused 
such  wearing,  calcite  being  much  softer  than  steel,  while  magnetite  is  of  comparable 
hardness. 
 
The 2009 drill paper logs includes 249 assays, while the numerical database includes 
292  assays,  the  cause  of  the  discrepancy  in  uncertain.  The  logs  indicate  that  six  (6) 
reference  materials  were  inserted  among  the  samples,  for  a  total  population  of  2.4%. 
Assay results and the nature of these reference materials were not made available to the 
author, and Mr Moar, who logged the core, does not recall. 
 
ALS  Minerals  was,  at  the  time  of  the  programs,  an  ISO-9001  accredited  facility.  It  is 
uncertain if ALS had its ISO-17025 accreditation for vanadium assays. CEAQ does not

All samples from 2013 drilling program were re-assayed in 2014. Pulps produced for the 
Davis  tube  testing  were  sent  to  Corem  for  assays.  Corem  successfully  reproduced 
certified values of the reference material, but vanadium grades were systematically 10% 
lower than ALS results (figure  18). Since reference material analysed by Corem were 
properly  reproduced  and  reference  material  analysed  by  ALS  were  also  10% 
overestimated,  it  is  concluded  that  ALL  assays  from  ALS  in  this  period  were  such 
overestimated. Iron, titanium and silica analyses were in good accordance without bias.

DAVIS TUBE TESTING OF JALORE, MRN AND SOQUEM SAMPLES 
 
Samples from Jalore drill holes (spot samples), MRN and SOQUEM holes were tested 
for  their  magnetite  content  by  Davis  tube  at  the  CRM.  Little  details  are  available  on 
settings;  other  than  the  testing  was  performed  on  material  grinded  with  a  dry  ball  mill 
passing 60% at 200 mesh, using a 15 grams aliquot, 2 amperes and 10 minutes wash. A 
standardized protocol is expected. No grindability or liberation tests are available, which 
does not mean they were not conducted. Magnetite concentrate was assayed for iron, 
titanium and vanadium. No measurement of the remaining silica and lime is available, 
which require to be back-calculated form the non-closure to 100% (figure 19). Most of 
these  Davis  tube  tests  were  conducted  as  individual  metallurgical  test,  providing 
headgrade,  concentrate  and  reject  analyses  (one  sample  out  of  5  for  MRN,  Richard, 
1975  (99-109-122)),  allowing  calculation  of  mass  balances,  which  calculation  were 
provided. A total of 653 tests were conducted, apparently using similar procedures, but 
without  being  possible  to  certify.  Analyses  were  done  by  XRF  on  borate  bead.  Recall 
that assays from SOQUEM samples were made by Chimitec by atomic absorption while 
assays from Davis tube headgrade and concentrates were made by CRM by XRF, and 
these laboratories have documented discrepancies. 
 
No Davis tube testing is reported by Jalore. However, such testing with iron assays are 
reported in a subsequent MRN report (Kish, 1971), but it is uncertain who conducted it. 
The  report  mentions  that  the  MRN  resampled  the  core,  taking  only  "spot"  samples  at

different depths, and processed by Davis tube testing to have the concentrates assayed 
for vanadium, titanium and chromium by CRM. Therefore, this testing was not conducted 
on  intervals  of  the  core,  and  shall  not  be  considered  as  such.  Also,  from  the  author’s 
experience,  vanadium  grades  of  the  magnetite  do  not  vary  significantly  over  a  short 
distance,  despite  that  the  magnetite  abundance  varies  wildly.  No  details  on  analytical 
procedure are available, however, a similar procedure as for MRN core is suspected in 
regards  to  Davis  tube  testing.  Analytical  method  is  not  disclosed,  but  likely  by  XRF 
calibrated with a linear regression. These results were discarded in regard to the current 
resource estimation. 
 
For MRN 1975 testing, assays of the magnetite concentrate, the non-magnetic fraction 
and  the  headgrade  are  indicated,  but  it  is  unclear  if  the  non-magnetic  fraction  assays 
were calculated or effectively analyzed.

A  series  of  17  SOQUEM  samples  were  resubmitted  for  testing  by  Cambior  (internal 
report, 2000). The samples were assayed by Corem, but they exact provenance and the 
protocol  of  the  Davis  tube  tests  are  unknown.  The  test  were  not  conducted  by  IOS, 
meaning  that  they  are  not  fully  comparable  to  the  results  produced  for  Cambior  from 
McKenzie Bay samples in 1999. This test indicated that both magnetite abundance and 
vanadium  grades  in  magnetite  concentrates  are  about  5%  higher  by  Corem  in  1999 
(figure  20). A low correlation (R2 of 78%) is noted in regard of magnetite abundance, 
suggestive of a difference in procedure, likely liberation and grinding. Discrepancies in 
regard of vanadium abundance in the concentrate can be explained by the difference in 
liberation of the ilmenite exsolution, as shown from the lack of correlation between the 
titanium grade of the two sets of data.

DAVIS TUBE TESTING OF McKENZIE BAY CHANNEL SAMPLES FOR CAMBIOR 
 
A first series of Davis tube magnetite concentrates were made in 1997 on samples from 
the trenching program by MetricLabs from Montreal, and assayed at Chemex Laboratory 
by  ICP-AES  after  sodium  peroxide  fusion.  These  concentrates  and  analyses  were 
plagued with quality problems, the program was halted, and the results disregarded.

In early 1999, IOS was mandated by McKenzie Bay to initiate magnetite concentration 
on channel samples with the use of the Davis tube. An extensive series of tests were 
carried  out  to  assess  the  grinding,  concentration  and  assaying  best  protocol  (Girard, 
2000). 
 
Production of magnetite concentrate was reinitiated by IOS on behalf of Cambior later in 
1999. Adjacent samples aliquots were concatenated by group of typically three, in order 
to represent intersection of about 6 to 9 metres. Concatenation proceeded based on the 
number of samples only, which were not weighted according to sample length, according 
to Cambior's instruction. Of the 1347 samples, 481 magnetite concentrates were made, 
of  which  401  are  from  the  East  and  West  deposits.  Sample's  aliquots  were  milled  at 
100 μm  (150  mesh),  and  magnetite  separated  with  the  Davis  tube  according  to  a 
complex protocol and reprocessed until quality specifications were met (<4% silicates in 
the  concentrate,  <10%  magnetite  in  the  rejects,  <5%  losses,  >5  grams  magnetite) 
(Villeneuve, 2000). Concentrates and rejects were shipped to Cambior. Analyses were 
made at Corem ("Consortium de Recherche Minérale", ex-CRM) using XRF on borated 
fused  beads  for  the  magnetite  concentrates  and  the  non-magnetic  rejects,  as  well  as 
atomic absorption for vanadium only in headgrade. The magnetite concentrate was also 
analysed by neutron activation by Activation Laboratories for a subset of samples.  
 
IOS did not had any laboratory certification at the time. Corem was, at the time of the 
program,  an  ISO-9001  accredited  facility.  However,  it  did  not  have  the  ISO-17025 
accreditation for vanadium assays. 
 
A  thorough  quality  control  protocol  was  implemented  by  Cambior  in  regards  to  their 
magnetite  concentrate  analysis,  including  inter-laboratory  cross-checks,  certified  and 
internal  reference  material  insertion,  replicates  and  mass  balance  calculation.  Quality 
control concerning the Davis tube concentration was implemented by IOS and included 
grain  size  control,  mass  balances  and  binocular  examination  of  the  concentrate. 
Cambior,  in  an  internal  note,  indicated  that  these  tests  met  specifications,  except  that 
grinding  was  slightly  too  coarse.  Magnetite  concentrates  were  assayed  for  all  major 
oxides, yielding an average of 1.947% SiO2 and 0.324% CaO. This average silica grade 
is comparable with most vanadiferous magnetite mines worldwide, but twice what was 
required and obtained from pilot plan magnetic separation. Fineness of the grinding is 
suspected as cause. 
 
The abundance of silicate mineral can be estimated by the non-closure to 100% of the 
iron, titanium plus vanadium analysis (figure 21). The average content is 4.2% silicate, 
in accordance with the silica abundance (1.94% SiO2). However, it should be noted that 
numerous samples contained more than 10% silicates, suggestive of deficient liberation.

analysis, and suggestive of liberation issues.  
 
Samples submitted to magnetic separation were composited from the coarse rejects of 
the core samples. In 1999, IOS was instructed by Cambior to use a 300 grams aliquot 
per  sample  and  to  combine  them,  typically  in  groups  of  three,  as  the  composited 
samples,  regardless  of  the  length  of  the  core  used  for  the  samples.  Although  most 
samples (1081 out of 1270, or 85%) were of uniform length, 15% of the samples were 
either  shorter  or  longer,  and  this  variation  has  not  been  taken  into  account.  This 
procedure  did  not  introduced  bias,  but  did  cause  scattering  (R2=97.4%  between  the

(figures 22 and 23).

of about 3% discrepant composite samples. 
 
The  abundance  of  magnetite  was  also  measured  with  the  use  of  a  magnetic 
susceptibilimetre, or "Satmagan", by Corem. Correlation between Satmagan and Davis 
tube  measurement  is  noisy  and  present  a  severe  bias,  Satmagan  results  being 
underestimated by up to 30% in magnetite rich samples (figure 24). This discrepancy is 
explained  by  the  fact  that  magnetite  concentrates  are  in  fact  a  mixture  of  titano-
magnetite and minute ilmenite exsolutions, plus a certain amount of silicates. Therefore, 
only about 85% of the concentrate is magnetite (6,000 x 10-3 SI), and is the dominant 
response  detected  by  the  Satmagan.  Ilmenite  has  a  magnetic  susceptibility  about  on 
third that of magnetite (1500 x 10-3 Si), and 10-3 times lower for ferromagnetic silicates. 
Furthermore,  magnetic  susceptibility  of  magnetite  decrease  with  the  abundance  of 
ulvöspinel molecule, thus with the titanium content. Therefore, these do not contribute 
significantly  to  the  overall  apparent  magnetic  susceptibility,  reducing  the  expected 
signature.  Since  the  abundance  of  exsolution  and  inclusion  cannot  be  accurately 
measured,  Satmagan  measurement  cannot  be  properly  corrected  and  are  considered 
inaccurate.

Figure  24:  Comparison  between  the  magnetite  abundance  in  1997  McKenzie  Bay 
samples as measured by Davis tube testing and Satmagan magnetic susceptibilimetre

cause of which being partly related to the abundance of ilmenite exsolutions. Notice the 
abundant erratics. A second order polynomial regression and a 1:1 reference lines are

Since  the  non-magnetic  fractions  were  submitted  to  analysis,  a  mineralurgical  mass 
balance can be calculated. Theoretically, the amount of vanadium in the head sample 
shall balance with the amount of vanadium in the magnetite concentrate plus the non-
magnetic rejects. Discrepancies can be caused by the proximity of detection limits in the 
non-magnetic  fraction,  the  elutriation  of  fines  (deschlamming)  in  the  Davis  tube 
concentration process as well as propagation of measurement errors. Discrepancies are 
close to propagated analytical errors for both the composited samples assayed at ALS-
Chemex  and  Corem  (figure  25)  as  well  as  the  samples  assayed  at  Actlabs  by  INAA

to  typographic  errors  in  original  reports  on  rejects  analysis.  Very  similar  correlation  is 
noted  for  iron  and  titanium,  with  the  same  outliers,  suggesting  the  error  is  from  the

Figure 26: A comparison between the vanadium as assayed in head sample versus the 
vanadium calculated from the mass balance of the magnetite concentrate and rejects. 
Note that the  mass balance of the Davis tube is overestimated by 9%. Error bars are 
based on a 0.02% V2O5 precision on assays, and thus of 0.02% on head samples and 
approximated at 0.04% on metallurgical balance. Error on Davis tube was estimated at 
2% relative, but is near nullified by being a system closed at 100%. 
 
A thorough quality control process was implemented by Cambior for the analysis of the 
magnetite concentrate, as well as for head samples and non-magnetic rejects (Crépeau, 
2000).  About  2%  of  certified  reference  material  was  inserted  and  monitored,  including 
SARM-12 (0.093% V2O5 or 520 ppm V) and JSS-831-1 (0.535% V2O5 or 0.30% V), all 
results being within tolerance limits. Cambior also had three internal reference material 
manufactured  at  Corem  from  Lac  Doré  material  and  certified  only  for  their  vanadium 
content  (MRI-99-08  at  1.178%  V2O5,  MRI-99-09  at  0.493%  V2O5  and  MRI-99-10  at 
0.647%  V2O5).  Their  internal  reference  material  was  inserted  for  about  10%  of  the

DAVIS TUBE TESTING OF McKENZIE BAY DRILL CORE SAMPLES 
 
Samples collected from McKenzie Bay Resources drill holes in 2002 were not submitted 
for Davis tube testing. 
 
Samples collected from McKenzie Bay Resources drill holes in 2001 were submitted for 
Davis tube testing in 2003, but were not submitted for headgrade analysis. Of the 497 
samples, typically 3 metres in length, 197 concatenated samples were made and  166 
magnetite concentrates prepared. Grinding, magnetic separation and assaying protocols 
were near to identical to the one used by Cambior, and results considered comparable. 
Grinding  was  set  at  85%  <150  μm.  Analyses  were  made  at  Corem,  using  XRF  on 
borated beads, for the magnetite concentrate and the non-magnetic rejects. Vanadium 
of  the  head  samples  were  assayed  by  atomic  absorption  at  Corem.  Metallurgical 
balance cannot be calculated due to the lack of head sample assays. According to mass 
balance,  the  headgrade  of  the  samples  are  underestimated  by  5%  compared  to  the 
mass balance. 
 
Quality  control  on  Davis  tubes  testing  included  grain  size  control,  mass  balance  and 
binocular  microscopic  examination  of  the  concentrate.  Quality  control  on  assaying 
included  mass  balance  as  well  as  certified  and  internal  reference  material  insertion, 
available in the author's archives. 
 
Davis  tube  tests  by  IOS  for  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  on  samples  outside  the  main 
deposit,  such  as  on  drill  core  from  Southwest  deposit,  Armitage  and  the  abutted 
Northeast extension, currently held by BlackRock Metals, were carried out with the same 
protocols as for Cambior on the main deposits, and are considered as comparable. 
 
Of  these  program,  only  26  concentrates  were  produced  from  drill  holes  located  within 
VanadiumCorp  properties,  which  were  not  included  in  the  current  resource  estimate 
being located outside the main deposit. Detailed description is not considered relevant.

Samples from the 2013 drill program were recently tested by Davis tube (Ivanov, 2015). 
The magnetic concentration of 109 of the 210 available samples was conducted by IOS, 
while analysis of the magnetite concentrates was conducted by Corem by mean of XRF 
on  borate  beads.  Samples  were  not  composited,  but  only  samples  with  sufficient  iron 
grades were processed. 
 
A liberation test was conducted (figure  27), by pulverizing the material with laboratory 
rod mills for variable time ranging from 5 to 60 minutes. Liberation was reached after 45 
minutes,  for  97.4%  minus  75  microns,  after  which  a  plateau  is  reached  in  regard  of 
magnetite purity (63.59% Fe) (Ivanov,2015).

Magnetite was concentrated from samples between 5 and 50 grams using 3200 gauss 
magnetic field, which is some what more intense than usually used. An average of 1.7% 
SiO2 was achieved, which exceeds the purity of previous programs, but still fails to match 
the targeted level of contaminant. 
 
The quality control on these magnetic separation tests was multiple:
  Quality  of  analysis  was  monitored  by  insertion  of  15%  of  certified  and  internal
reference materials, plus blanks.
  Purity of the concentrates were monitored prior to be sent to Corem by the use of 
an hand-held XRF. Concentrate not matching purity requirement (2% SiO2) were 
reprocessed.

  Purity  of  the  concentrates  as  well  as  rejects  was  further  monitored  by  a
microscopy examination, which still outlined liberation and sweeping issues.
  12  non-magnetic  rejects  were  reprocessed  by  the  Davis  tube,  which  indicates
negligible amount (<0.1%) of swept magnetite.
  Grain  size  curves  were  measured  for  every  sample  with  the  use  of  a  laser
dispersion analyser (Fritsch Analysette 22).
On figure 21, it can be noted that the amount of contaminant estimated from the non-
closure  to  100%  is  more  elevated  than  previous  program.  This  is  not  thoroughly  in 
accordance  with  the  analytical  results,  which  suggest  an  average  abundance  of  4% 
silicates (SiO2 + Al2O3 + MgO + CaO + Na2O), the discrepancy not being accounted for.
The  author  is  confident  on  the  quality  of  the  2014  analysis,  and  recommends  this 
protocol being used for subsequent drilling programs. 
 
DENSITY MEASUREMENTS 
 
Accurate  density  measurement  is  essential  for  the  calculation  of  resources  in  iron 
mineralization. Density may varies from 2.7 g/cc in a barren silicate rock to 5.5 in pure 
magnetite.  Contained  resource  is  a  square  function  of  the  iron  grade,  this  grade 
influencing  both  the  amount  of  metal  per  tonne  as  well  as  the  amount  of  tonnes  per 
cubic metres. Experience of the author with a different magnetite deposits indicated that 
using  average  density  over  the  deposit  instead  of  real  measured  density  on  every 
sample significantly underestimated the total resource. 
 
No  reliable  density  measurements  were  made  by  Jalore  and  MRN.  A  total  of  51 
measurements  are  reported  by  Kish  (1971)  on  typical  lithofacies.  A  second  set  of  90 
density  measurements  were  made  by  Abvreamtchev  on  selected  samples  from  1974 
drill program, mentioned by Dion (1980). A third series of 50 samples were measured by 
Nolet  (1980)  and  reported  by  Dion  (1980).  These  data  are  of  limited  use,  considering 
they represent selected samples not corresponding to core intervals and their important 
variability of the magnetite content. 
 
An attempt was made by Nolet (1980) on behalf of SOQUEM to calculate the density by 
estimating the amount of magnetite from the measured magnetic susceptibility: 
 
 
 
Where K is the magnetic susceptibility in 10-3 CGS. The author does not consider such 
estimation as dependable.

Dion (1980) mentioned systematic density measurement on core, without providing data. 
However, the author has located a list of density measurements handwritten on a set of 
copies  of  analysis  certificates  from  SOQUEM.  According  to  Dion,  the  density  was 
calculated from the volume and weight of the core. Volume was estimated by measuring 
the length of the core sample time its half diameter, while weight was obtained with a 
dynamometer  (spring  scale).  A  total  of  692  such  measurements  are  available,  for  an 
average density of 3.77 g/cc. Dion indicated a theoretical accuracy of about 6% of the 
measurement,  while  review  of  the  calculation  method  suggests  to  the  author  that 
propagated errors alone are in the order of 7%. Recall that the core was halfsplit, and 
that its volume did not exactly fit the volume of a half cylinder. Since density is controlled 
by the magnetite and ilmenite abundance, the density is expected to relate to iron and 
titanium abundance. A plot of measured density versus Fe2O3 + TiO2 suggests a second 
order polynomial relation with correlation coefficient R2 of 80% (figure  28). Notice the 
lower intercept for barren rocks (0% iron and titanium) at 2.76 g/cc.

Cambior measured the density on 1689 samples from 1997 McKenzie Bay Resources 
channel samples (Crépeau, 2000). Since no hard samples were available except for a 
few  determination  on  SOQUEM's  drill  core,  they  measured  the  density  by  water 
displacement on coarse crushing rejects. For such, a sample aliquot was weighted, and 
the sample immerged in water in a graduated cylinder to calculate volume. Calculation 
datasheets are available to the author and density recalculated. The propagated error on 
measurement is calculated at 2.5%. The comparison between the measured density and 
the iron plus titanium content indicates a second order polynomial relation, with a zero 
intercept at 2.82 g/cc and a regression coefficient R2 of 73% (figure 29). It is noted that 
261 measurements, or 15% of the population, are discrepant by more than 7% of the 
regression.  These  discrepant  data  are  considered  as  errors  caused  by  manipulation, 
entrapped  air  in  the  granular  material,  deschlamming  or  typing  (in  Cambior  report).  If 
such discrepant measurements are removed, the regression coefficient R2 is improved 
at 93% (figure 30). Density is then calculated by the following equation, which is used 
for the current resource estimation: 
 
SG = 0.0000677(Fe2O3 + TiO2+V2O5)2 + 0.009832(Fe2O3 + TiO2+V2O5)+ 2.78977841

ITEM 12: DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Considering the project spans over 60 years of work, by numerous groups, with different 
goals  and  methods,  and  considering  the  very  large  and  heterogeneous  database 
involved,  thorough  data  verification  was  completed  to  the  best  of  the  first  author's 
capability. Girard takes liability for this verification process. 
 
HISTORIC REPORTS 
 
Most of the over 200 historical reports relating to the deposit were read by the author 
through  time,  and  significant  information,  maps,  drill-holes  and  assays  were  captured 
into database and mining software. Most of these reports were handed to the author in 
1997 by SOQUEM, and are available only as hard copies. No database was transferred 
to the author by SOQUEM. 
 
Most  of  the  historic  reports  are  old  photocopies,  some  of  them  of  poor  quality, 
incomplete  or  with  handwritten  annotations.  Part  of  the  data  is  available  only  as 
handwritten  datasheets.  Numerical  data  were  typed  by  the  author's  assistant,  or 
decrypted with OCR software (ReadIris Pro V. 12.5). Drill logs were typed and formatted 
into modern drill hole software (Geotic's Log format), although simplification or omission 
of details were made. 
 
McKENZIE BAY RESOURCES DATA 
 
The author supervised the data collection by his various field crew during the McKenzie 
Bay period, which was then carried out according to the best industry practices of the 
time. Data results as well as most metadata were reported in details (Tremblay, 1997; 
Huss,  2001;  Boudreault,  2002).  However,  the  original  numerical  data,  all  based  on 
Lotus-123  spreadsheet,  have  been  stored  on 3.25"  inches  floppy  disks  now  corrupted 
and  on  DOS-based  back-up  tapes,  which  cannot  be  read  anymore  with  modern 
equipment  without  extensive  efforts.  Therefore,  original  computer  files  are  not  easily 
accessible anymore, and it was considered more effective to retype the significant data 
by  the  author's  assistant  or  to  capture  them  by  OCR.  The  author  is  confident  in  the 
quality and robustness of the original data, with the exception of the ground magnetic 
survey. Trenching data and plans were captured in a manner to enable their use with 
Geotic'  or  Gemcom  drill  hole  management  software,  which  required  them  to  be 
translated or reformatted. The meaningful data from these trenches were reformatted as 
"horizontal drill holes", with lithofacies coded and sampling intervals. Origin of the trench 
has been set at its southeastmost extremity.

CAMBIOR DATA 
 
Cambior completed a limited but highly relevant amount of data, including the Davis tube 
testing and assaying, plus density measurements. Davis tube metadata were available 
in  numeric  format  from  the  archives  of  the  author,  while  other  Cambior  data  were 
available  only  as  printed  files,  as  well  as  original  analysis  certificates.  Relevant  data 
were  either  retyped  or  captured  by  OCR,  including  metadata  for  the  density 
measurements. 
 
GROUND MAGNETIC SURVEYS 
 
The author is of the opinion that the quality of the ground magnetic survey data carried 
out for VanadiumCorp by Geosig Inc. is of adequate quality, notably with regard to the 
density of reading stations. No significant levelling issues are noted. 
 
The  set  of  ground  magnetic  surveys  conducted  for  McKenzie  Bay  contains  severe 
levelling issues, which cannot be properly corrected. They shall be used for illustration 
purposes only, and no modelling shall be attempted from these data. 
 
The  author  does  not  have  the  expertise  to  fully  interpret  or  reprocess  the  Novatem 
airborne magnetic survey. 
 
VANADIUMCORP RESOURCE DATA 
 
A  negligible  amount  of  data  from  the  two  trenching  programs  conducted  under  the 
previous  management  of  VanadiumCorp  was  made  available  to  the  author.  The  only 
information  recovered  was  part  of  the  sample  booklets  and  what  is  stated  in  press 
releases.  To  reconstruct  the  data,  the  trenches  were  remapped  in  late  2014,  and  the 
certificates  recalled  from  ALS  Minerals  (Block,  2015).  Drill  logs  from  2009  were 
compared  meticulously  with  the  core,  and  considered  of  acceptable  quality.  The 
trenching and drilling located outside of the current resource estimate are not considered 
as essential, and not reviewed in detail. Collar locations were visited by the author, and 
coordinates taken with the use of a DGPS (Block, 2015). 
 
Drill core from 2013 (Derosier, 2013) was re-logged (Ivanov, 2015) directly into Geotic' 
database.  The  sample's  meterage  were  thoroughly  checked,  corrected  if  needed,  and 
the  sampling  intervals  completed.  Collars  were  located  in  the  field  by  the  author,  and 
coordinates  taken  with  the  use  of  a  DGPS  (Block,  2015).  Assaying  results  were 
numerically transferred into database once QAQC approved.

DATABASE VALIDATION 
 
Building  a  database  from  heterogeneous  data  in  various  states  of  robustness  raises 
issues  with  its  reliability.  Errors  accumulate  through  the  process,  starting  from  errors 
within  the  initial  typewrite  reports  and  errors  in  capturing  these  data. Validation  was  a 
complex task, and all actions taken cannot be described in details.
  Every  critical  data,  such  as  assays  and  footages,  was  checked  by  the  use  of 
redundancy.  All  data  were  typed  or  acquired  through  OCR.  These  were  then 
checked  against  the  former  database  wherever  available.  Likelihood  that  the 
same typing error being captured in both dataset is minuscule. Any entry which 
was discrepant between both datasets were then individually checked in original 
data or analytical certificate, and corrected to the limit of the available data. Both 
datasets are now identical and less than 0.25% of the entries are estimated to 
remain wrongful and impossible to correct. However, if a data was discrepant in 
the original reports, it would not be detected by this process.
  Data which were of importance but not available as database, such as the results 
of Davis tube testing, were typed twice, using a different database structure or a 
different sources (example: report and certificates). Again, every discrepant entry 
was checked and corrected from the original data. Certificates were considered 
as the original data in regard of assays.
  Typing  of  the  data  included,  whenever  available,  the  metadata,  such  as 
calculation  and  statistics.  The  data  was  then  checked  against  the  metadata 
(example: if an average was indicated, the average of the data was calculated 
and compared to the one indicated in the report).
  In regards to assays, various elements were added and the total compared to the
indicated sum or theoretical closure.
  Mass balance for the Davis tube was available in MRN and SOQUEM reports,
which data was captured and recalculated.
  Length  of  composite  samples  was  checked  against  the  sum  of  the  individual 
sample  length.  Resulting  average  or  weighted  grades  were  checked  against 
assays of the composite samples wherever available.
  Consistency  of  field  contents  has  been  systematically  checked  with  the  use  of
"filters" in Excel.
REMINISCENT ERRORS 
 
Difficulties  have  arisen  in  verifying  core  assays  from  SOQUEM.  Some  drill  logs 
photocopies were truncated, and typographic errors were relatively abundant. Some of 
the data were not indicated on the drill log, and only handwritten on one of the copies of 
the  certificates,  and  some  assays  from  the  same  sample  were  scattered  on  many

certificates.  Furthermore,  errors  are  suspected  on  certificates,  which  were  typewritten. 
For example, a series of samples were indicated with the wrong number sequence on 
certificates, causing apparent duplication. These errors were corrected to the best of the 
author capacity, and every certificate was checked. 
 
Reports  from  CRM  and  Corem,  such  as  Davis  tube  reports,  were  practically  free  of 
typographic errors. 
 
Despite  the  efforts  by Cambior  to  control  the quality  of  the  data  and assays,  the  data 
generated  by  them  contained  abundant  errors.  Example  is  the  density  measurement, 
previously discussed, which included about 15% discrepant data. Numerous issues were 
noted in reporting assays from Davis tube testing. Samples were inverted, and in some 
instance,  concentrates  and  non-magnetic  rejects  were  inverted.  These  errors  were 
corrected in the extent they were detected by the author. 
 
The  most  severe  issue  with  Cambior  data  remains  the  inconsistencies  in  compositing 
the samples for Davis tube testing. The compositing list was provided to IOS who was 
instructed  to  proceed  according  to  list.  Comparing  the  list  with  the  sample  position  in 
trenches outlined issues:
  In  a  few  cases,  samples  numbers  were  misindicated  on  the  original  list,  and
irrelevant samples were inserted in composited sequence.
  In  numerous  cases,  unsampled  intervals  were  left  in  composited  intervals.  In 
other cases, a sample was isolated by tens of metres away from the sequence of 
contiguous  samples  in  the  same  composite.  In  such  case,  for  the  purpose  of 
making the database compatible to the resource estimation software, these non-
contiguous composited samples were disjointed into two separated samples with 
identical grades, and the unsampled intervals were left as a barren interval.
Validation  of  drill  holes  location  and  orientation  was  done  by  plotting  them  and 
comparing with maps of original reports. Discrepancies were detected and corrected. 
 
OVERALL CONSISTENCY OF ASSAY RESULTS 
 
The  quality  of  assays  had  always  been  a  concern  with  the  current  project,  mainly 
regarding  their  accuracy.  Vanadium  hosted  in  iron-titanium  oxides  is  difficult  to  assay, 
and prone to analytical discrepancies. A quality control was implemented by McKenzie 
Bay Resources in 1997, and all datasets acquired since then are considered as being 
accurate  and  compatible  with  each  other.  The  protocol  included  insertion  of  certified 
reference  material  on  a  regular  basis,  using  the  same  set  of  material.  The  author  is 
confident in the compatibility of these batches of assays.

In  1997,  a  proficiency  test  was  conducted  (Bédard  et  Girard,  1998)  involving  five 
commercial  laboratories  (Intertech,  Chemex,  Metriclab,  CRM  and  X-Ral),  plus  two 
research  facilities  (Mintek  and  Australian  National  University).  The  test  included  ten 
samples from previous SOQUEM drill core, a triplicate of an internal reference material, 
plus an aliquot of SARM-12 certified reference material. 
 
Further testing were made by Cambior, including re-analysis of two batches of samples 
plus analysis of the composited samples. Cambior used the same reference material as 
McKenzie Bay (SARM-12 and JSS-831-1). 
 
Re-assaying  of  2013  drill  core  was  controlled  using  the  same  reference  material  as 
McKenzie Bay, as well as the internal reference materials used by Cambior. 
 
Validation of the accuracy of historic SOQUEM and MRN assays is a more difficult task, 
since no certified reference material was inserted, and only limited QAQC protocols were 
applied.  Quality  control  on  assays  carried  on  behalf  of  Ministère  des  Richesses 
Naturelles were not disclosed, if any. The Ministère sent a series of 11 samples to four 
different governmental laboratories in 1968, but had to have the assays done at CRM. 
Discrepancies  were  significant  between  these  laboratories,  but  the  lack  of  certified 
material impedes proper conclusion.  
 
SOQUEM performed a similar test, sending 16 samples to five laboratories (Dion, 1980). 
Again, no certified reference material was included, which later proved to be a severe 
concern.  Chimitec,  which  was  chosen  for  headgrade  analysis,  reported  values 
underestimated  by  7%  compared  to  CRM,  used  for  Davis  tube  testing  (Vallée,  1989). 
Re-analysis  of  some  of  these  samples  by  McKenzie  Bay  in  1997  confirmed  the 
underestimation  issue,  suggestedby  13%.  However,  McKenzie  Bay  tests  were  not 
sufficiently  exhaustive  to  provide  a  conclusive  comparison.  SOQUEM's  resource 
calculation used the Chimitec assays, but inter-laboratory discrepancies were reported 
(LMBDS-Sidam,  1981).  Since  the  majority  of  drill  core  assays  on  the  project  are  from 
SOQUEM,  this  discrepancy  was  perpetuated  in  the  subsequent  resource  calculations 
and the uncertainties remained. 
 
Cambior  did  a  thorough  quality  control  on  assay  results;  including  some  re-assays  of 
McKenzie Bay Resources channel samples and SOQUEM core samples. They reported 
that  Chemex  results  done  by  ICP-OES  after  multi-acid  digestion  for  McKenzie  Bay 
samples  were  3%  lower  than  Corem  (previously  CRM)  by  XRF  on  borate  glass. 
Discrepancies were also noted for the SOQUEM core.

It is in Girard’s opinion that the uncertainties on drill core head assays remain, and are 
expected to be in the range of plus or minus 5% of the reported grade. Correcting this 
issue would require systematic re-assaying of quarter-splitted core, the access to which 
was denied. 
 
DAVIS TUBE TESTING GENERALITIES 
 
Davis tube testing is the industry standard protocol to routinely measure the abundance 
of magnetite in iron ore. It is a wet high strength magnetic separation, operating up to 
3000 gauss under a water current to wash the non-magnetic fraction. It is considered by 
metallurgists  that  Davis  tube  testing  is  a  fair  simulation  of  industrial  wet  magnetic 
separator.  The  quality  of  the  magnetite  concentrate  is  dependent  on  liberation  of  the 
magnetite grains, and thus to grain size and grinding process, as well as the settings of 
the various other parameters such as magnetic field strength and water current. Such 
settings  are  not  disclosed  in  every  report.  Some  laboratories  use  "standard"  settings, 
while others will optimize them through a grinding test. Magnetite abundance obtained 
by Davis tube testing and its analyses can be used directly into resource estimation and 
block modelling, as done in the current resource estimate. 
 
The  discrepancies  which  arose  between  MRN,  SOQUEM  and  McKenzie  Bay  head 
assays are even more significant with regards to magnetite concentrates made by Davis 
tube testing. Each set of data were made according to different specifications, especially 
with respect to grinding. Samples submitted by Jalore Mining and MRN to the CRM were 
ground at 90% -325 mesh (<50 μm), SOQUEM samples were ground at 85% -200 mesh 
(<75 μm),  McKenzie  Bay  and  Cambior  samples  at  85%  -  100  mesh  (<150  μm)  and 
VanadiumCorp  samples  at  95%  -200  mesh  (<75  μm).  Since  these  different  grinding 
specifications  affect  the  silicates  and  ilmenite  liberation,  vanadium  grades  and

abundance of magnetite are not directly comparable, although it does not mean that they 
are inaccurate. To circumvent such issue, Cambior did normalize all test results to 90% 
magnetite, a correction which has not been applied in the current resource estimate. 
 
The vanadium grade obtained in the magnetite concentrate is a function of the efficiency 
to remove minute ilmenite intergrowths. The finer the comminution, the more efficient is 
the removal, but the lower is the overall vanadium recovery. Optimization of the grinding 
and  beneficiation  process  in  regards  to  the kiln requirement  will  be  complex.  To  grind 
finer  means  cleaner  kiln  feed  and  lower  reactants  consumption,  but  also  increased 
grinding costs and fly ash issues. Grinding cost is a square function of the fineness and 
represents the bulk of the beneficiation circuit operating costs. Conversely, less grinding 
means  less  beneficiation  cost  and  better  recovery  due  to  the  processing  of  vanadium 
bearing ilmenite, but a higher roasting cost due to the lower feed grade and higher soda 
ash consumption. 
 
Silicate  minerals  contaminating  the  magnetite  concentrate  is  dominated  by  calcic 
plagioclase. During roasting, the silica of the plagioclase consumes the soda ash to form 
metasilicate, which ends in the pregnant liquor and forms silica gel. It is the main cause 
of  soda  losses  in  the  process.  Sodium  metasilicate  cannot  be  regenerated  into  soda 
carbonate.  Second  is  the  calcium  from  the  plagioclase  which  reacts  with  vanadium 
pentoxide in the kiln, to form partly insoluble calcium vanadate. This is likely the main 
cause  of  vanadium  non-recovery  in  the  course  of  the  roasting  hydrometallurgical 
process. Therefore, cleanliness of the magnetite concentrate is of great importance to 
the efficiency of the process, which is dictated by grinding. 
 
The effect of grinding on liberation can be visualized from Davis tube tests. Such testing 
is a magnetic separation done routinely on individual samples, currently regarded as a 
standard procedure in the iron industry. Davis tube concentrates done for Cambior were 
grinded  at  120  μm,  and  yielded  1.2%  V2O5  and  high  ilmenite  content,  while  the 
metallurgical  tests  completed  when  grinding  at  60  μm  yielded  1.4%  V2O5  and  lower 
titanium content. The decision for grinding at 120 μm for testing was made after a series 
of tests which indicated that the bulk of oxides were liberated at such fineness. Grinding 
at 60 μm for the metallurgical test allowed production of a cleaner (<1% SiO2) and richer 
concentrate, but quadrupled the grinding cost and reduced recovery. 
 
For the same reasons, cautions are to be applied to compare Davis tube tests done at 
different  laboratories  with  different  protocols.  The  tests  done  by  IOS  for  Cambior  on 
McKenzie Bay's channel samples does not readily compare with the tests done on the 
drill  core  by  the  Centre  de  Recherche  Minérale  for  SOQUEM  and  Ministère  des 
Richesses Naturelles. The vanadium grade achieved on the magnetite concentrate 
is sensitive to grinding process.

A mere statistical comparison (table 14) of the magnetite abundance or vanadium grade 
from the various series of Davis tube testing would not be significant, considering that 
the various series do not represent population from the same segments of the deposit. 
Thus,  tests  conducted  for  MRN,  which  represent  almost  uniquely  samples  from 
strongest magnetic anomalies, are enriched in magnetite, while samples from SOQUEM, 
which  are  the  core  of  P2  unit,  are  statistically  enriched  in  Vanadium.  Cambior  (1999) 
samples are lower in magnetite since they tap into P1 and P0 units.

Table 14: Statistics on magnetite concentrate assays. 
 
The  relation  between  the  vanadium  grades  in  the  magnetite  concentrate  versus  the 
abundance of magnetite is complex (figure 31). It is controlled by the provenance within 
the deposit, the abundance of magnetite of metamorphic origin, as well as the effect of 
dilution caused by non-liberation of ilmenite and silica during the Davis tube testing. The 
effect of the concentration process is visualized on figure 32, where the various batches 
of samples were isolated. The discrepancies are readily visible, especially between the 
MRN-1970 and MRN-1974 batches, which represent samples from the same area of the 
deposits, processed by the same laboratory (CRM) apparently with the same methods. 
Similarly,  a  discrepancy  is  noted  between  SOQUEM-1980  samples  which  are  from 
drilling  mainly  in  P2  unit,  and  Cambior-1999,  which  is  from  McKenzie  Bay  surface 
samples.  Since  McKenzie  Bay  samples  encompass  the  entire  deposit,  a  larger 
scattering  in  vanadium  grade  as  well  as  more  abundant  samples  with  low  magnetite 
abundance  is  present  compared  to  former  SOQUEM  and  MRN  samples.  SOQUEM 
samples  are  distinctive  by  being  more  vanadium  rich,  a  difference  considered  as  the 
effect of finer grinding and better liberation as well as potential analytical discrepancies. 
 
The  discrepancies  noted  in  vanadium  grade  of  the  magnetite  concentrates  are  not 
present in the head sample vanadium grade (figure 33). On the vanadium grade versus 
magnetite abundance diagram, the trends defined by the various batches are coincident, 
with scattering towards lower grade due to the inclusion of P3 samples.

Figure  31:  Diagram  of  the  vanadium  content  of  the  magnetite  concentrate  versus the 
magnetite abundance as recovered by Davis tube. Although fuzzy, two distributions are 
visible, mainly in the magnetite poor samples, with about 90% of the samples with about 
1.4% V2O5, and a second much smaller population intercepted mainly in Cambior 1999 
testing  at  about  0.5-0.7%  V2O5.  It  is  expected  that  this  second  population  represent 
samples  from  P3  unit.  It  can  also  be  noted  that  SOQUEM  drill  core  samples  (red 
squares) includes a population which is significantly enriched in vanadium (>1.6% V2O5), 
which population was not detected in Cambior trench samples.

Figure  33:  Diagram  of  the  head  sample  vanadium  grade  versus  the  magnetite 
abundance.  Unlike  for  the  vanadium  grade  of  the  magnetite  concentrate,  the  various 
batches of samples fell on a quite narrow trend, with scattering towards low vanadium 
grade related to samples taken higher in the stratigraphic sequence. 
 
Since  the  grinding  influences  the  magnetite  liberation  and  dilution  by  ilmenite  plus 
silicate, such relation shall be reflected in the iron content of the magnetite concentrate. 
Pure  magnetite,  Fe3O4,  contains  72.4%  Fe  or  103.5%  Fe2O3.  Since  the  average 
magnetite concentrate grades 87.4% Fe2O3, the difference (± 15%) is considered from 
dilution  by  titanium  in  ulvöspinel  in  solid  solution  within  the  magnetite,  ilmenite  as 
exsolution  and  entrapped  liberated  grains,  plus  dilution  from  entrapped/non-liberated 
silicates. The quality of the liberation and amount of dilution of the concentrate is readily 
visible  on  figure  34  left.  All  samples  fall  on  a  quite  narrow  trend,  with  the  various 
batches not easily differentiated. Discrepant samples are from Cambior 1999 and MRN-
1974 batches, and clearly related to the coarseness of the grinding and poor liberation. 
A  quite  linear  relation  is  present  between  the  total  iron  in  head  sample  regard  of  the 
magnetite  abundance  (figure  34  right).  The  various  batches  of  samples  are  quite

silicate and not amenable for magnetic separation. Iron recovery tends towards 100% for 
samples with more abundant magnetite.

Figure 34: Diagram of iron grade in magnetite concentrate (left) and head sample (right) 
against  the  magnetite  abundance  as  recovered  Davis  tube  testing.  No  significant 
differences  are  noted  between  the  various  sample  batches.  Scattering  in  magnetite 
concentrates  relates  to  the  purity  of  the  concentrate,  while  scattering  in  head  sample 
grade  is  caused  by  the  presence  of  iron  in  non-recovered  silicates  and  ilmenite.  Note 
that headgrade analysis is not available for MRN-1970 and MKBY-2001 (in Boudreault 
2002) samples. 
 
The  effectiveness  of  liberating  the  ilmenite  exsolution  is  easily  estimated  from  the 
titanium  content  of  the  magnetite  concentrate  (figure  35).  The  titanium  grade  of  the 
various  batches  of  concentrates  differs,  indicative  of  the  different  liberation  of  ilmenite 
exsolution  with  grinding.  Titanium  is  more  abundant  in  Cambior-1999  concentrates, 
these being rather coarsely grind at 70 mesh, while the titanium is minimal in CRM-1970 
(Kish, 1971) which is grinded at 325 mesh. Such relation is not noted in titanium head 
grade,  the  general  trends  of  each  batch  being  coincident.  Titanium  enrichment  is 
however  noted  for  part  of  the  samples,  regardless  of  the  batch,  which  samples  being 
from higher in the stratigraphy.

Figure  35: Diagram of titanium grade in magnetite concentrate (left) and head sample 
(right) against the magnetite abundance as recovered by Davis tube testing. The amount 
of  titanium  in  the  magnetite  concentrate  is  directly  related  to  the  liberation  of  ilmenite 
inclusion, and thus to the grinding process. The amount of titanium in the head sample 
relates to the abundance of oxides as well as to the stratigraphic position of the sample. 
 
The effect of fineness of the grinding is expected to be seen through the abundance of 
silicate contaminant left in the sample. Silica and other contaminants are available only 
for  Cambior-1999  concentrates  and  subsequent  ones,  which  data  has  not  been 
compiled. For older analysis, which includes bulk of the drilling, only iron, titanium and 
vanadium were assayed, and the contaminant abundance can be approximated by the 
lack  of  closure  to  100%.  On  figure  36,  it  can  be  noted  that  contaminant  levels  are 
similar,  although  not  identical,  between  the  batches.  Cambior-1999  concentrates 
includes some heavily contaminated concentrates, related to their coarseness. Overall, it 
can be noted that samples with low magnetite abundance are more contaminated, an 
effect quite pronounced on MRN-1974 samples. The cause is not explained.

abundance.  Contaminant  is  approximated  by  the  non-closure  to  100%  of  the  iron,

the  sake  of 
comparativeness.  Notice  that  samples  with  low  magnetite  abundance  are  more 
contaminated, suggesting either a grinding or a cleaning issue. 
 
Finally,  vanadium  recovery  can  be  calculated  for  each  test,  which  equals  vanadium 
grades in magnetite times magnetite abundance, divided by vanadium headgrade. This 
recovery  represents  the  amount  of  vanadium  extracted  from  the  rock  through 
beneficiation  of  magnetite,  the  rest  of  vanadium  being  hosted  in  silicate  or  liberated 
ilmenite. The recovery is dependent on magnetite abundance (figure 37), nearing 90% 
for magnetite-rich sample, and dropping progressively to 60% for samples with less than 
15%  magnetite,  and  then  collapse  to  zero  on  magnetite-poor  samples.  Samples  from 
MRN-1974,  Cambior-1999  and  those  processes  for  VanadiumCorp  in  2014  have 
concordant  recovery/grade  curves.  However,  samples  from  SOQUEM  1980  shows 
abnormally  high  recoveries,  some  even  exceeding  100%.  This  suggests  that  the 
vanadium  grade  of  the  magnetite  concentrate  is  overestimated  by  about  10%.  This 
discrepancy is not readily detectable from the mere concentrate analysis, which more or

less succeeded the quality control test. This enrichment is also discernible on figure 39, 
where  SOQUEM  samples  do  not  coincide  with  the  other  concentrate  grade  versus 
magnetite  abundance  curve.  A  slight  overestimation  of  about  5%  was  detected  by 
Cambior (Crépeau, 2000) on these samples. The metallurgical mass balance of these 
samples  is  correct,  as  long  as  the  calculation  is  based  on  CRM  headgrade  analysis, 
which are 5% higher than initial ALS analysis. Using the CRM headgrade instead of the 
Chimitec headgrade may correct the appearance of correctness, but the uncertainty will 
remain. 
 
The  discrepancy  between  the  concentrate  grades  obtained  on  SOQUEM  drilling 
samples and the various other samples sets is of concern, since SOQUEM drilling 
dominates the current resource estimate. It was agreed by both authors that no 
correction  on  the  data  would  be  applied  to  correct  this  issue  and  that  the 
estimation shall be based only on original assays without introducing further bias.

ITEM 13: MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 
TESTS 
 
Titano-magnetite is notorious for not being suitable for iron production, unless coupled 
with  vanadium  and  titanium  co-production  and  smelted  by  direct  reduction  and  arc 
furnace.  Conventional  blast-furnace  smelting  of  titano-magnetite  was  attempted  in  the 
early 1900's for various deposits located in Québec (St-Charles de Bourget, St-Urbain, 
Natashquan, etc.) without commercial success. 
 
Since its discovery by Gulf Mineral in 1956, more attention was placed on the metallurgy 
of  the  Lac  Doré  magnetite  mineralization  than  on  the  characterization  of  the  deposit 
itself.  Successively,  Jones  and  Laughin  Steel,  the  Québec  Departement  of  Natural 
Resources (Ministère des Richesses Naturelles), SOQUEM, McKenzie Bay Resources 
and BlackRock Metals did extensive work on the metal recovery and various aspects of 
the  metallurgy.  Extraction  of  ferroalloys  is  usually  more  complex  than  for  base  or 
precious metals and requires metallurgical testing early in the exploration process. The 
overall  profitability  of  a  project,  independently  of  its  grade  and  resources,  is  usually 
dictated by the choice of metallurgical process and the capital requirements attached to 
the selected process. 
 
Presenting the Lac Doré project systematically raises questions about efficiency of the 
metallurgical  process  and  availability  of  essential  know-how.  Extensive  metallurgical 
testing on Lac Doré mineralization was carried out by past owners of the project, and 
indicates  clearly  the  suitability  of  the  mineralization  to  beneficiation,  and  the 
recoverability  of  vanadium  by  conventional  alkali-roasting  as  well  as  smelting 
processes. Both tested routes are commercially operated worldwide upon similar ore for 
more than 50 years and are proven technologies. Laboratory and pilot plant tests on Lac 
Doré  mineralization  were  carried  out  by  various  independent  facilities,  which  indicated 
clearly  that  the  mineralization  behaves  similarly  to  other  vanadiferous-titaniferous-
magnetite  deposits  in  production  in  South-Africa,  China  and  Russia.  Concentrate  and 
recovery  grades  were  similar  to  other  ores  when  tested  with  both  methods.  Overall 
metallurgical efficiency is thus forecasted with acceptable certainty. 
 
Titaniferous  magnetite  is  the  cleanest  vanadium  ore  and  requires  the  simplest 
metallurgical process. Vanadium extraction out of shales, phosphorite, uranium ore, flue 
ashes, bauxites, non-titaniferous iron ore, stone coal or clays is known as complex and 
expensive (Gupta and Krishnamurthy, 1992), and shall not be compared to titaniferous 
iron ore processing.

All metallurgical tests conducted through time on the deposit were done on bulk samples 
were  taken  from  P2  in  the  East  deposit.  It  was  amply  demonstrated  that  the 
mineralization from the West deposit is very similar to that of the East deposit, as well is 
the  mineralization  from  BlackRock's  Southwest  and  Armitage  deposits.  Mineralization 
from  Northeast  deposit  may  behave  differently  in  the  course  of  beneficiation,  due  to 
metamorphic overprint causing sintering, grain coarsening and the presence of abundant 
iron silicates such as chlorite. No metallurgical test has ever been conducted on material 
from the other stratigraphic units. 
 
The  deposit  is  zoned  in  regard  of  stratigraphy,  both  in  grade  and  mineralogy. 
Beneficiation  and  metallurgical  efficiency  is  thus  expected  to  be  dependent  on  the 
specific stratigraphic unit. Conversely, the decision as to which unit is to be mined, and 
thus tested, is dependent on the process selected in the metallurgical tests, and which 
metals  are  to  be  recovered.  Production  of  vanadium  alone  by  alkali  roasting  requires 
high vanadium grade in the magnetite and may tolerate low magnetite abundance of P1 
and  P2,  while  co-production  of  vanadium,  iron  and  titanium  by  intense  fusion  is  less 
sensitive to vanadium headgrade but requires high magnetite content such as P3.

BULK SAMPLES  
 
The  Ministère  des  Richesses  Naturelles  du  Québec  collected  successively  three  bulk 
samples of 30, 200 and 600 tonnes in late 1960' and early 1970'. These samples were 
taken  from  the  P2  magnetite  rich  beds  of  the  Eastern  deposit.  It  is  uncertain  if  these 
three bulk samples were taken at the same location. These samples are considered as 
likely  biased  toward  a  higher  headgrade  than  the  average  deposit.  They  were  taken 
within the area of the initial pit design for SOQUEM, the site still being visible in the field 
(picture 17).

A  series  of  eight  (8)  small  1  tonne  bulk  samples  were  collected  by  McKenzie  Bay  in 
1997, 
including  grinding,  energy 
consumption  and  magnetite  concentration  were  carried-out  on  one  of  these  samples 
(T1)  (Lamontagne,  1998).  SNC-Lavalin  also  used  these  for  preliminary  beneficiation 
tests. These are the only bulks samples taken from P0, P1 and P3, and it is uncertain if 
they were processed individually or were composited. 
 
A 50 tonnes sample was collected for SNC-Lavalin in 2001, which was used for the pilot 
plant  testing  carried  out  within  the  scope  of  the  feasibility  study.  This  sample  was 
collected  from  the  P2  horizon  in  Eastern  Deposit,  close  to  the  former  MRNQ  site 
(picture 18). 
 
BENEFICIATION AND MAGNETITE CONCENTRATE QUALITY 
 
Beneficiation  of  the  Lac  Doré  magnetite  is  apparently  a  relatively  easy  process.  The 
specifications  to  be  met  are  what  is  needed  to  produce  a  pure  magnetite-ilmenite 
concentrate containing less than 1% silica and 0.1% lime. These two elements are the 
most deleterious in regards to vanadium recovery and alkali consumption. Magnetite can 
be easily separated with the use of cascading magnetic separators in conjunction with 
various step grinding. Various designs were tested both at the laboratory and pilot plant 
scales.  Reported  results  in  the  literature  are  sometimes  confusing,  since  they  do  not

always provide details of the tests. In every single test, specifications were apparently 
exceeded positively. 
 
The  efficiency  of  subsequent  metallurgical  processing  is  sensitive  to  the  grinding  and 
beneficiation  process  employed.  With  the  roasting  process,  the  finer  the  magnetite 
concentrate,  the  more  fly  ash  is  generated  in  the  rotary  kiln.  Leaching  gets  more 
effective and filtration less efficient. Inversely, smelting is likely to require pelletization, 
rendering  the  process  less  sensitive  to  fineness.  The  Lac  Doré  mineralization  is  not 
expected  to  be  suitable  for  conventional  direct  reduction  smelting  such  as  RTIT  (QIT) 
process without pelletization. 
 
BENEFICIATION TEST CONDUCTED BY JALORE MINING LTD 
 
Jalore Mining Ltd. reported a limited beneficiation test relating to the potential production 
of iron ore. They were unable to produce a magnetite concentrate with titanium content 
low enough to be suitable for blast-furnace iron smelting. 
 
BENEFICIATION TEST CONDUCTED BY CAMPBELL-CHIBOUGAMAU MINES LTD 
 
A 35 tonnes bulk sample, taken from the Campbell-Chibougamau deposit, was sent to 
CRM  for  magnetite  concentration  in  1966.  The  report  is  not  available.  This  deposit  is 
located at the same stratigraphic level of the Lac Doré Complex, about 40 kilometres to 
the west. 
 
FIRST CRM BENEFICIATION TEST, 1967 
 
The first beneficiation test done on the Lac Doré mineralization was carried by the CRM 
on drill cores recovered from Jones and Laughlin drilling. At the time, four small samples 
representing  50  kilogrammes  were  selected  by  Dr.  Gilles  O.  Allard  and  tested. 
Concentration  was  done  by  Davis  tube  and  Sala  magnetic  separator,  on  samples 
grinded at 325 mesh. A bench-scale alkali roasting tests were subsequently performed 
on these concentrates. 
 
BENEFICIATION TEST BY IRSID, 1970 
 
A  pilot  plant  beneficiation  test  was  performed  by  IRSID  ("Institut  de  recherche 
sidérurgique")  in  Nancy,  France  in  1970,  on  behalf  of  the  Ministèredes  Richesses 
Naturelles (Gerbe et al., 1970; Astier et al., 1970). It processed 5 samples of 4 tonnes 
each  from  the  MRNQ  bulk  samples  (table  15).  Autogenuous  grinding  energy 
requirements were established at 8.15 to 12.7 kWh/t. A dry route test included primary 
grinding  and  low  strength  magnetic  separation  (usually  referred  as  "scalping"  by

gravity separator from rejects of primary magnetic separation (Astier and Boudier, 1969). 
The results for the five samples are listed below. The low vanadium grade is probably a 
result of sampling parts of the P3 unit, vanadium distribution not being understood at that 
time. The material was not assayed for contaminants.

2nd BENEFICIATION TEST BY THE CRM 
 
A  second  beneficiation  test  was  carried  in  1971  (Cloutier,  1971)  by  the  CRM  using 
aliquots of the same samples than IRSID tests. Conventional wet methods were used for 
comminution and separation, including multiple steps crushing and grinding down to 270 
mesh.  Magnetic  separation  was  done  using  a  Sala  separator  and  then  a  Davis  tube. 
This work aimed mainly to establish the effect of grinding mesh on concentration. 
 
BENEFICIATION TEST BY FOOTE MINERALS 
 
Tests were carried on the Lac Doré mineralization by Foote Minerals for an American 
Steel  producer.  Only  a  shipping  statement  is  available  at  this  point,  no  results  were 
found. 
 
3rd BENEFICIATION TEST BY CRM 
 
A  pilot  plant  concentration  test  (Delisle  et  Dessureaux,  1977)  was  done  by  the  CRM 
(table  16).  The  samples  were  extracted  from  trenches  T-1  (45  tonnes)  and  T-3  (200 
tonnes).  Such  large  tonnage  was  needed  for  subsequent  smelting  test.  The  rock  was 
first  crushed  to  -28  mesh  and  submitted  to  a  first  magnetic  concentration  ("scalping"). 
Rejects were treated with Humphrey spirals for ilmenite recovery (3%). The concentrate 
was  then  grinded  to  90%  -325  mesh  and  submitted  to  a  second  magnetic  separator. 
Grinding indexes were calculated at 12.7-13.0 kWh/t for the rock and 23.9-26.0 kWh/t for 
the magnetite concentrate. 
 
Drums of this concentrate were submitted to various laboratories for pelletizing, roasting 
and smelting tests.

BENEFICIATION TEST DONE BY LAKEFIELD RESEARCH FOR SNC-LAVALIN 
 
A pilot plan beneficiation test was commissioned to Lakefield Research in 2001 by SNC-
Lavalinon 
(https://docs.google.com 
/file/d/0BxmBLfd5ee8sSDdtc2NWaDljUU0/preview).  This 
bench-scale 
processing of the eight 1 tonne bulk samples collected in 1997 by McKenzie Bay, plus 
the  pilot  plan  processing  of  the  50  tonnes  bulk  sample  collected  in  2001.  The  test 
includes  primary  grinding,  magnetite  scalping  at  low  magnetic  intensity,  secondary 
closed circuit regrinding and triple drum low intensity magnetic separation  (figure  39). 
Results were apparently within specifications, yielding a magnetite concentrate at <1.2% 
SiO2  and  <1.2%  V2O5,  from  a  feed  of  0.47%  V2O5  and  32%  magnetite.  Subsequent 
beneficiation test for ilmenite were reported by McKenzie Bay, the results of which are 
not available.

PELLETIZATION 
 
Numerous  pelletization  tests  were  carried  on  the  Lac  Doré  magnetite  concentrate. 
These were done by Rautaruuki (Finland), Ontario Research Foundation (Fossen, 1977) 
and  CRM  (Naldo,  1978)  from  the  CRM  magnetite  concentrate.  Pellet  quality  was 
considered as excellent. 
 
HIGHVELD-TYPE SMELTING TESTS 
 
The Lac Doré magnetite mineralization, because of its titanium content, is not suitable 
for  iron  smelting  in  standard  shaft  or  blast  furnaces.  "Should  this  process  be  used  to 
smelt  magnetite  ore,  the  carbon  reduces  the  titanium  dioxide  TiO2  content  to  titanium 
sequioxide  Ti2O3,  which  then  combines  with  the  air  blast  to  form  titanium  nitrides  and 
carbides. This results in the precipitation into a solid agglomeration which shuts down 
the 
passages" 
(www.evrazhighveld.co.za/processoverview.asp). Early attempts to smelt similar titanium 
bearing  magnetite  from  St-Charles-de-Bourget  and  St-Urbain  deposits  failed,  the 
magnetite was reported as too refractory. 
 
However,  the  magnetite  can  be  smelted  by  direct  reduction  in  electrical  furnaces.  Lac 
Doré  concentrates  were  tested  through  two  variancesof  the  process,  namely  Highveld 
and  QIT.  These  processes  involved  direct  reduction  and  intensive  fusion  in  an  arc

furnace for the production of either steel or pig iron, and a vanadium-titanium slag. Direct 
reduction accounts for the production of about 74 million tonnes of iron annually for the 
world 
(www.midrex.com/uploads/documents/MDX%20STATS%202012%207-3-
13Final.pdf), mainly in "minimills", or 4.6% of the total steel production. Minimills are a 
small  steel  production  concept,  developed  by  Co-Steel  Lasco,  currently  Gerdau 
Corporation, who built small intensive fusion steel mills in proximity to their market, such 
as  car  assembly  plants.  One  such  mill  is  present  in  Oshawa,  ON,  Canada.  Smelters 
using this process for the co-production of steel and vanadium are currently in operation 
only  in  China  and  New-Zealand.  The  Highveld  steel  plant  in  South  Africa  has  been 
recently  shut  down,  maintaining  only  the  conventional  alkali  roasting  process  in 
production. The fate of Evraz's Nizhny Tagil plant, in Russia, is not known to the author, 
the  vanadium  facility  of  this  plant  having  been  shut  down  on  recurrent  basis.  Finland 
based Rautaruukki Oyj plant closed its vanadium recovery plant in the 1980's. Finally, a 
small  vanadium  by-production  is  reported  by  New-Zealand  Steel,  from  the  Taharoa 
sand. 
 
Smelting  is  currently  not  contemplated  by  VanadiumCorp  as  a  means  of  vanadium 
production, considering that all previous studies indicated excessive capital requirement 
and poor economic perspectives. Smelting of the ore and recovery of titanium slag as 
well  as  vanadium  pentoxide  has  been  demonstrated  as  technically  feasible  at  a  pilot 
plant scale, including a full smelting scale test in QIT direct reduction furnace. Numerous 
scenarios  were  contemplated,  including  the  production  and  sale  of  hot  metal  to  other 
steel  mills  and  rolling  plants,  such  as  Sidbec  (now  Arcelor-Mittal)  in  Contrecoeur.  An 
account of the historic smelting tests and results is provided in Girard, 2014.  
 
ALKALI ROASTING 
 
Alkali roasting is the process used to extract the vanadium pentoxide out of most mineral 
material (figure 40). It can be used on vanadium bearing slag (Highveld), clays (Union 
Carbide),  uranium  mine  by-products  (Colorado  plateau),  oil  and  tar  residues  (defunct 
Carbovan  in  Alberta,  Canadian  patent  #4798709  and  #4966761)  as  well  as  primary 
vanadiferous  magnetite  concentrate.  Although 
is  constant, 
differences  in  recipes  and  furnace  or  vessel  configurations  are  noticed.  It  is  the  only 
process used for commercial production of primary vanadium, as well as being used for 
processing  vanadium  as  by-product  from  other  commodities  which  also  includes 
vanadium recycling. The overall process is divided into roasting itself, leaching, cleaning, 
precipitation and cracking (Bradbury, 2002).

is the conventional alkali roasting and AMV route. 
 
Roasting is a delicate operation. The principle is to produce a sodium vanadate out of 
the  feed-stock,  which  is  leached  in  water.  Sodium  vanadate  is  produced  through 
complex  reactions  between  molten  sodium  oxide  and  vanadium  sesquoxide  while 
expelled  out  of  the  magnetite  (or  other  feed-stock).  Sodium  oxide  is  produced  by  the 
breakdown  of  any  volatile  based  sodium  oxysalt,  soda  ash  (Na2CO3)  being  the  most 
convenient, or sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) if a sulfuric acid scrubber is added at the exit of 
the  kiln.  Sodium  oxalate  (Na2C2O4)  was  used  in  the  ill-fated  Windimurra  project, 
Australia. Sodium chloride cannot be used due to corrosion issues. 
 
Sodium  vanadate  is  solubilized  in  leach  tanks  to  produce  the  pregnant  liquor.  The 
addition of ammonia salt to the leach liquor precipitates ammonium poly-vanadate (APV 
route)  or  ammonium  metavanadate  (AMV  route),  which  is  be  broken  into  vanadium 
pentoxide and ammonia by heating. Although apparently complex, this process is used 
by most vanadium producers upon a wide variety of material, and is also used for the 
production  of  other  polyvalent  transition  metals  such  as  molybdenum,  tungsten,  and 
chromium.

The  roasting  reaction  is  sensitive  to  various  factors,  the  most  important  being  the 
roasting temperature, the residence time, the soda ash excess, the content of silica and 
lime of the concentrate. Various tests indicated that heating and chilling times, as well as 
titanium content do not significantly affect the reaction. Recovery usually increases with 
rising temperature, time and soda content, although a threshold needs to be in balance 
since  each  parameter  interacts  with  each  other.  Temperature  is  dictated  by  the  firing 
process  and  BTU  input,  plus  the  fact  that  magnetite  oxidation  into  hematite  is  an 
exothermic  reaction.  Soda  ash  consumption  is  the  principal  operating  cost  and 
minimizing its losses in the process lead to substantial savings. Finally roasting time is 
the  important  factor  influencing  the  engineering,  as  it  dictates  the  size  of  the  kiln. 
Doubling  the  roasting  time  doubles  the  kiln  size  or  reduce  throughput  by  half,  and 
physical limitations do exist. Construction of the kiln is largest capital cost of a plant. 
 
In laboratory tests (Malinsky, 1981), the best recoveries on non-aggregated magnetite 
were obtained using a temperature of 1300 oC, with the use of about 2% weight of soda 
ash and a residence time of 1 hour. This recipe yielded a 94% recovery of V2O5. Using 
these parameters is optimal in terms of soda ash consumption (40% of operating cost in 
South  Africa)  and  in  term  of  roasting  time  (optimization  of  the  throughput  of  the  kiln). 
Kilns  in  South  Africa  are  usually  fired  at  1150-1200  oC,  with  5%  soda  ash  and  a  few 
hours of roasting time. The author is unsure if rotary kilns can economically withstand 
protracted firing at 1300 oC. No pilot plant testing was done on this process by CRM. 
 
Tests  were  carried  on  pellet,  cake,  beads,  as  well  as  on  powdered  material 
(McDonough, 1980). Best recoveries were from pelletized ore. Powdered material tends 
to agglutinate, especially at very high temperature, requiring very skilled kiln operators to 
avoid "donuts" formation. 
 
Tests involving various heating and chilling times were conducted, indicating that these 
parameters  do  not  significantly  influence  recoveries  (Gabra,  1979;  Grégoire,  1979). 
However,  they  do  alter  the  mechanical  property  of  the  calcine,  especially  its  grinding 
index. 
 
A roasting cage test was carried inside the Rautaruukki vertical shaft furnace (Tolonen 
and Lindholm, 1978). Cages filled with pelletized Lac Doré magnetite were incorporated 
in  the  load  of  the  furnace  and  recovered  afterward.  Recoveries  up  to  92%  were 
obtained.  Shaft  furnaces  are  notorious  for  a  non-uniform  temperature  distribution, 
leading to a variable recovery, which was noted as expected. Such phenomenon is not 
encountered in a rotary kiln, meaning that better recovery should be obtained (Malinsky, 
1980).

Silica  content  of  the  feed-stock  influences  the  recovery  process  (Desrochers,  1980). 
Silica  reacts  with  soda  forming  leachable  sodium  metasilicate,  thus  consuming  the 
reactant.  Furthermore,  metasilicate  forms  a  silica  gel  in  the  reactor,  resulting  in  the 
clogging of the filtration units. More than half the soda used in South African operations 
is  lost  through  sodium  metasilicate.  A  larger  amount  of  reactants  is  thus  needed  to 
counteract this, which means that the cleanest ore should be used as kiln-feed. South 
Africans tolerate 2% SiO2 in feed-stock. The Lac Doré beneficiation test produced <1% 
SiO2 in the magnetite, which can still be improved. However, coal firing produces about 
5%  SiO2  ashes.  Thus  burning  the  required  5  tonnes  of  coal  versus  100  tonnes  of 
magnetite leads to the addition of 0.25% silica contamination in the calcine. A delicate 
economical balance must be achieved between finer grinding (improved liberation and 
lower silica) and alkali consumption. Furthermore, the molten sodium peroxide is prone 
to create stickiness to the magnetite, forming "donuts" rims which may cause hot-spots 
the  kiln.  The  favourably  low  silica  level  at  Lac  Doré  is  expected  to  reduce  cost  at 
production stage compared to current producers. 
 
Alkali-roasting has also been tested on Lac Caché deposit by Campbell-Chibougamau 
Mines, with similar results (Delisle, 1972). 
 
Various furnace designs were considered, including standard rotary kiln (Union Carbide), 
air-recirculated  rotary  kiln  (SNC)  and  shaft  furnace  (Rautaruuki).  Other  furnace 
configurations  were  mentioned  but  not  discussed  or  tested,  such  as  fluidized  bed, 
Herrendorf  furnace,  Herrendorf-fluidized  bed,  nitrogen  plasma  furnace,  etc.  Agnew 
Cough,  an  ill-fated  plant  in  Australia,  used  a  triple  deck  fluidised  bed  which  exploded 
after  a  short  operating  life,  is  often  taken  as  case  history  in  regard  of  risk  inherent  to 
introducing new technologies in extractive pyrometallurgy. 
 
LEACHING AND PRECIPITATION 
 
Sodium  vanadate  Na2V2O6  is  water  soluble.  In  the  conventional  process,  it  is  leached 
from calcine in agitated slurry tanks, drained and filtered. The pH of the pregnant liquor 
is  adjusted  with  sulfuric  acid,  and  then  mixed  with  ammonium  sulfate  or  chloride. 
Through  agitation,  vanadium  polymerize  with  ammonia  to  produce  either  ammonium 
metavanadate  (AMV:NH4VO3),  hexavanadate  (AHV:  (NH4)2V6O16)  or  polyvanadate 
(APV: (NH4)2O-3(V2O5)) depending on acidity and concentration, which precipitates. The 
vanadate is filtered, dried and roasted again. During this roasting, ammonium vanadate 
cracks down into fused V2O5 flakes and ammonia or NOX (Kougioumoutzagis, 1981). 
 
Bench  scale  leaching  tests  were  made,  both  on  roasted  magnetite  and  slag  from 
smelting  tests  (Malinsky,  1979).  More  specific  tests  were  made  on  resin-exchange 
column for vanadium recovery (Drapeau, 1978), on effluents conditioning, on chromium

elimination  (Kougioumoutzakis,  1980),  on  ammonium  vanadate  precipitation,  on  the 
effect of lime, titania and silica as contaminant, and on sodium metasilicate precipitation. 
Solvent extraction process, such as those developed by the CRM for the Mingan deposit 
(Ritcey et Lucas, 1979) were apparently not tested on Lac Doré material. 
 
VANADIUM ELECTROLYTE 
 
Vanadium redox flow batteries use vanadyl sulfate VSO4 as basis for their electrolyte. 
This compound can be obtained by reaction of sulfuric acid with vanadium pentoxide, or 
through acidulation of the pregnant liquor. The production of such electrolyte requires a 
very  low  contaminant  level  in  the  soluble  vanadium  compound,  notably  for  silica 
(<10 μg/l) and sodium (<100 μg/l), for an overall 99.999% purity. Such contaminant level 
cannot  be  achieved  by  conventional  hydrometallurgy,  and  require  addition  of  ion 
exchange resin or solvent extraction (Bradbury, 2002). Chemicals with such purity are 
currently produced by Stratcor (USA), Vanchem (RSA) and Dalian Bolong (PRC). 
 
FERROVANADIUM 
 
About 90% of the world production of vanadium pentoxide is dedicated to ferrovanadium 
conversion. As demonstrated by Niobec Inc., the adjunction of a ferroniobium facility to 
their  pyrochlore  (niobium  oxide)  production 
their  overall 
profitability  and  robustness.  Surprisingly,  ferrovanadium  conversion  of  the  Lac  Doré 
pentoxide  has  never  been  tested.  A  problem  historically  faced  by  the  project  was  a 
worldwide  excess  of  ferrovanadium  converting  capacity,  compared  to  a  lack  of  V2O5 
flakes production capacity. No incentives were perceived for conversion. 
 
OTHER NON-CONVENTIONAL PROCESS 
 
Vanadium has a tendency to be scavenged by organic matter, typically by reduction of 
vanadate  solution  in  contact  with  carbon-based  reducing  material.  For  such  reason, 
organic  rich  materials  are  typically  enriched  in  vanadium,  such  as  tar-sand  fly-ashes, 
orimulsion  fly-ashes,  and  anthracite  (stone-coal).  Based  on  salt  roasting,  these 
processes are typically complex, especially in regard of hydrometallurgical refining, and 
of lower economic robustness. A number of companies announced, in the last few years, 
new  hydrometallurgical  processes  to  extract  titanium  and  vanadium  as  well  as  other 
metals  from  titano-magnetite  concentrates,  without  preliminary  salt  roasting.  Various 
processes were announced; some currently in pilot plant, but none have been evaluated 
by the author.

ITEM 14: MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 
 
Christian  D’Amours,  P.Geo.  (OGQ  no  226)  from  Geopointcom  was  contracted  by 
VanadiumCorp  to  complete  a  Resource  Estimate  for  the  Lac  Dore  project.  The 
resources were estimated by Christian D’Amours, P.Geo. who is a qualified person and 
independent  of  both  the  issuer  and  the  title  holder,  based  on  the  tests  outlined  in 
National Instrument 43-101. The current estimation is restricted to the Eastern deposit 
and the easternmost part of Western deposit as defined in historical reports, and does 
not encompass the main portion of Western or North-Eastern deposits. 
 
The resource estimation work was performed from November 2014 to February 2015. 
The last drill hole included and considered is LD-13-04. This hole was drilled in March 
2013.  Since  that  time,  no  new  information  was  added  to  the  database.The  Mineral 
Resource  Estimates 
this  report  are  based  on  data  supplied  by 
VanadiumCorp and IOS Services Géoscientifiques Inc. and validated by the author. The 
effective date for the resource estimate is April 10, 2015. 
 
The main objective of this work was to publish the results of a mineral resource estimate 
and  evaluate  the  amount  of  work  required  to  upgrade  confidence  and  resource 
categories. 
 
The  resource  estimations  are  based  on  a  scenario  considering  an  open  pit  mining 
method  (50˚  slope)  up  to  a  maximum  depth  of  200  m.  Mineralized  block  selection  is 
made  in  two  steps.  First,  the  abundance  of  magnetite  (Davis  tube  magnetite 
concentrate) must be over 15%. Then, the amount of V2O5 measured in the magnetite 
concentrate  must  be  over  the  cut-off  limit.  The  cut-off  limit  is  the  breakeven  point 
between cost and revenue for the specific cell. In this case, the cost for extracting V2O5 
from magnetite bearing rocks varies in relation to the abundance of magnetite within the 
rock.  Thus,  the  V2O5  cut-off  cannot  be  a  constant  and  is  taken  as  a  function  of  the 
magnetite abundance in the rock.  
 
Mineral  resources  are  not  mineral  reserves,  not  having  demonstrated  their  economic 
viability.  
 
Christian D’Amours was responsible for the 3D model and geostatistical analysis as well 
for resource estimation and classification.

10 m X 10 m X 11.9 m estimated by ordinary kriging (OK). Then an iterative procedure 
allowed for selecting cells and optimizing the pit design. 
 
DRILL HOLE AND TRENCH SAMPLE DATABASE 
 
The actual Geotic / MS Access diamond drill holes and trench database was setup and 
created by the author using all the data submitted. It contains 83 surface diamond drill 
holes and trenches, for 14,559 m of core (trenches are considered as core equivalent). A 
total of 2880 headgrade samples were assayed for V2O5, Fe2O3 and TiO2, while specific 
gravity (SG) was calculated according to the procedure described in Item 12. Almost all 
sampleswere  also  flagged  with  a  lithological  code.  Most  of  the  intervals  previously 
assayed  for  headgrade  were  tested  for  their  magnetite  content  using  a  Davis  tube 
magnetic separator, and the magnetite concentrate assayed for V2O5, Fe2O3 and TiO2. 
Original  sample  limits  were  not  systematically  respected.  Headgrade  samples  were 
combined  in  longer  intervals  in  most  cases  prior  to  the  Davis  tube  process,  to  create 
composite  samples.  Thus,  the  database  contains  3751  samples  tested  for  magnetite 
content with the use of a Davis tube and assayed for TiO2, Fe2O3 and V2O5 (hereafter 
referred  as  magnetite  concentrates).This  method  allows  measuring  the  V2O5  content 
within  the  magnetite  concentrate  with  minimal  contribution  from  other  mineral  phases. 
This  magnetite  concentration  method  is  very  similar  to  the  method  proposed  for  an 
eventual milling process. Thus the current estimate is based solely on results from the 
Davis  tube  testing,  and  any  headgrade  estimate  are  based  on  cells  selection  from 
magnetite concentrates. 
 
INTERPRETATION OF MINERALIZED ZONES  
 
Interpretation and modeling of all lithological contact was performed in two phases using 
mostly  rock  code  and  the  measure  of  Fe2O3  reported  in  headgrade  samples  when 
available.  The  main  difficulty  here  was  to  interpret  and  model  a  series  of  barren 
anorthosite sills and dykes within the P2 Unit. 
 
First,  the  author  used  all  trenching  information  combined  with  all  available  surface 
mapping information to create a consistent three dimensional lithological model fitted to 
the topographical information. At this point it is important to note that trenching was not 
systematically  sampled.  Un-sampled  sections  may  either  represent  dykes  or  poorly 
mineralized  rocks,  typically  a  topographic  high,  or  may  represent  sections  where 
stripping was not possible, typically a depression or underneath the road. Both types of 
unsampled  segments  were  managed  differently,  either  attributed  with  a  grade  of  0% 
within mineralized rock, or a grade of 0% within barren anorthosite.

The  next  step  consisted  of  adding  all  pertinent  drill  holes  information  to  the  previous 
surface model. In regard of drill holes, unsampled section, especially within the P2 Unit, 
were considered as an internal barren anorthosite sill or dyke.  
 
In  the  cases,of  narrow  intersections  or  inconsistencies  with  surrounding  information,  it 
was  impossible  to  correlate  all  lithological  variations.  Hence,  samples  which  clearly 
represent  dykes  were  left  within  different  lithological  units.  Inversely  some  mineralized 
units may be included inside barren unit. Such instances are not abundant and do not 
affect the quality of the estimation. 
 
The  final  wireframe  solid  was  created  by  digitizing  interpretations  onto  35  sections 
(spaced 50 m apart in the SW area and 25 m apart in the NE), and then using tie-lines to 
complete the wireframes (figure 41). 
 
At this point, modelled lithologies were coded back to drill holes and trenching, allowing 
to match rock code for sample selection during the interpolation process.

COMPOSITING AND STATISTIC 
 
The estimation method chosen requires that all samples represent the same volume of 
rock  (same  length).  Compositing  was  processed  using  the  SG  calculated  from  each 
head  grade  sample  but  magnetite  abundance  and  V2O5  grades  were  taken  from  the 
Davis  tube  samples.  All  samples  were  composited  as  close  as  possible  to  3  metres 
within  each  lithological  interval  as  previously  defined  from  the  3D  model.  Within  each 
lithological  interval,  remaining  shorter  mineralized  intervals  were  redistributed  over  the 
whole composite. Thus the average length of all composites is 2.99 metres, the smallest 
composite  is  1.77  metres  and  the  longest  4.48  metres  (table  17).  While  creating  a 
composite,  SG  and  magnetite  abundance  were  weighted  solely  on  core  length  while 
V2O5 was weighted both on core length and magnetite abundance. 
 
Table  18 shows how the averages shift when extreme data are trimmed off. Trimming 
5% means removing 2.5% from the highest value as well as 2.5% from the lowest value.

The distribution of SG (figure 42) is indicative of the relevance of the lithological coding 
achieved from the lithological 3D model (very low IQR for barren dykes and P0). Barren 
anorthosite  and  P0  anorthositic  units  are  well  constrained  with  only  few  results  over 
3.2 g/cm3. However the presence of some high values is probably due to some erratic 
mineralized  intervals  within  barren  units.  P1  and  P3  units  are  quite  similar,  their  SG 
being confined between 3.1 and 3.4 g/cm3. The bimodal distribution of P2 specific gravity 
shows the presence of some barren anorthosite samples within the unit.

VARIOGRAPHY   
 
Variography  was  modeled  using  Isatis software.  Because of  the sampling  density and 
stationary effect, only composites from the P2 unit were used. The author was unable to 
identify  any  consistent  and  relevant  geometrical  anisotropy.  Therefore,  the  variogram 
model (figure 46) was built on an experimental omnidirectional variogram (figure 45).

BLOCK MODEL GEOMETRY  
 
A  block  model  was  established  encompassing  the  entire  drilled  area.  Origins  of  the 
model are as follows (center of the front, bottom, left cell):  
 
Easting: 
571180 m E (257 cells x 10 m each)  
Northing:  5518770 m N (117 cells x 10 m each)  
Elevation:  230 m (32 cells x 11.9 m each)  
 
The block model was rotated 39 degrees anticlockwise around the Z axes. The relative 
volume occupied by each rock unit within each cell was estimated using an array of 5 x 5 
needles oriented parallel to the rotated Y axes of the block model.   
 
ROCK DENSITY  
 
For each cell, rock density was estimated from specific gravity by ordinary kriging (OK) 
using the model presented in figure 46. Neighboring was set to a minimum of 10 and a 
maximum of 25 composites within a search radius of 200 metres without any constraint 
regarding  neither  the  hole  names  nor  the  octant  distribution.  The  only  constraint  was 
matching rock code from cell to composite. When the search ellipsoid was unable to find 
the required minimum number of composites, default values were applied. The default 
value of 3.1 g/cm3 was used for barren anorthosite and P0. The default density was set 
to 3.2 g/cm3 for P1, and P3 units. When required, the default density for the rock code 
P3 was 3.2g/cm3 (table 18).

GRADE BLOCK MODEL  
 
Abundance  of  magnetite  (%)  and  vanadium  grade  (V2O5  %)  of  the  concentrate  where 
estimated in the same manner as for specific gravity but with correspondent spherical 
model  (figure  46).  The  author  used  the  same  neighboring  strategies  and  the  same 
search ellipsoid size. The only difference was in the case where the minimum number of 
composites could not be found, then the value was set to 0% magnetite and grade.  
 
RESOURCE CATEGORIES  
 
The  resource  classification  definitions  used  for  this  report  are  those  published  by  the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in their document ''CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves'' dated of November 27, 2010. The CIM 
definition is reproduced here.  
 
Inferred Mineral Resource   
 
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The 
estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.   
 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. 
Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical 
and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of 
public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming 
the basis of feasibility or other economic studies.   
 
Indicated Mineral Resource   
 
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a 
level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability 
of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,

trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.   
 
Mineralization may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the qualified 
Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow 
confident interpretation of the geological framework and to reasonably assume the 
continuity of mineralization. The Qualified Person must recognize the importance of the 
Indicated Mineral Resource category to the advancement of the feasibility of the project. 
An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient quality to support a Preliminary 
Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major development decisions.   
 
Measured Mineral Resource   
 
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established 
that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application 
of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of 
the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that  are spaced 
closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.   
 
Mineralization or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a 
Measured Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity 
and distribution of data are such that the tonnage and grade of the mineralization can be 
estimated to within close limits and that variation from the estimate would not 
significantly affect potential economic viability. This category requires a high level of 
confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of the mineral deposit. 
 
In  the  present  case,  variability  and  distribution  (continuity)  of  the  three  dominant 
parameters  (specific  gravity,  magnetite  abundance  and  V2O5  of 
the  magnetite 
concentrate)  seem  to  be  relatively  simple,  comprehensive  and  predictable  (refer  to 
variography). However, uncertainties related to the data are multiple:
  The paucity of drilling do not enable to build a reliable lithological model allowing
to clearly identify and localise a barren dyke within a mineralized unit. 
Information is partly incomplete, built from various incongruent database.
 
  Uncertainties remain regarding the accuracy and comparativity of the assays as
well as Davis tube test results from the various drilling programs. 
  Most holes are poorly localised and lacking downhole surveying.

  Majority of drill holes and trenches have undescribed and unsampled intervals.
These limitations have a major impact on resource classification. All resources estimated 
in the current report must be classified as inferred.  
 
MINIMUM CUT-OFF VALUE  
 
The cut-off value is defined as the breakeven point considering total potential cost and 
revenue  generated  by  the  operation.  In  the  current  estimation,  potential  milling  and 
processing costs vary with the abundance of magnetite in the mineralization, since only 
magnetite concentrate needs to be processed by roasting. Since roasting capacity is the 
main constraint on production rates, the grade of the roasted concentrate has a major 
impact on potential revenues and cost. Thus, cut-off grade cannot be a simple uniformly 
applied grade, but requires calculation to be a function of magnetite abundance. Table 
19  show  the  calculated  cut-off  when  considering  certain  financial  parameters  as 
constant. The retained scenario is US$5.50 per pound for V2O5 as indicated in Item 24. 
The  three  year  (April  2012-2015)  average  selling  price  of  vanadium  pentoxide  on  the 
European market is US$5.54 per pound for V2O5.  
 
Production cost used the following parameters, as detailed in Item 25:
  Potential mining cost, including waste removal, based on similar operation: $1.80
per tonne.
  Potential  milling  and  beneficiation  cost,  based  on  similar  operation:  $2.50  per
tonne.
  This is based on a power consumption of 17 KwH/t at "L" rate. It includes cost for
tailing management.
  Potential roasting and hydrometallurgy cost at $40/tonne of magnetite. 
  Reactants  are  estimated  at  $21  per  tonne  of  magnetite  (soda  ash  and  coal 
mainly,  without  salt  recovery  plant),  to  which  manpower  and  calcine  disposal 
need to be added.

PIT OPTIMISATION 
 
Pit  optimisation  was  performed  by  iteration  using  in-house  software.  The  following 
parameters were used: 
 
-  Pit slope = 50º. 
-  Minimum content of magnetite = 15%. 
-  Minimum profit required = 25%. 
-  Selectivity can be smaller than cell unit. 
-  Pit depth is limited to 200 m. 
-  Overburden  thickness  is  unknown  over  almost  50%  of  the  proposed  pit.  Even  if
suspected as thin, it was considered as unspecified rock.
-  Mining cost = $1.80 per metric tonne of rock. 
-  Magnetite separation = $2.50 per metric tonne of rock. 
-  V2O5 extraction (roasting) = $40.00 per metric tonne of magnetite concentrate. 
-  Market value for V2O5 = US$5.50 per pound, based on last 3 year average. 
-  Density for unspecified rock = 3.1 g/cm3. 
-  Hydrometallurgical  recovery  of  V2O5  from  magnetite  concentrate  =  95%,  as
suggested from historical metallurgical testing.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE RESULTS  
 
Given all the parameters listed above, the inferred resource located within this pit can be 
estimated  as  99,104,000  tonnes  of  mineralized  rock  containing  26,067,000  tonnes  of 
magnetite  concentrate  grading  1.08%  recoverable  V2O5.  This  represents  a  total  of 
282,370  tonnes  of  V2O5  or  621  million  pounds  of  V2O5.  This  pit  also  contains 
165,690,000 tonnes of waste. Thus thepotential stripping ratio (waste: mineralization) is 
estimated  at  approximately  1.67.  Even  if  headgrade  is  not  a  relevant  figure  for  this 
estimation  procedure,  it  was  calculated  and  reported  for  comparison  purposes. 
Headgrade is estimated 0.43% V2O5 (table 20). 
 
Geopointcom  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  current  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  is 
representative of what is actually known from this zone. This estimate is compliant with 
CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.

COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES  
 
The  resource  and  reserve  estimate  produced  in  2002  by  SNC-Lavalin  within  their 
bankable feasibility study is  obsolete  and  not  current and cannot be compared with 
the current estimate. This non-current estimate used the conventional approach based 
on  headgrade  analysis  and  metallurgical  recovery  factors,  rather  that  magnetite 
abundance as the current one. 
 
The  present  estimation  used  assay  results  of  the  magnetite  concentrate  as  well  as 
measured magnetite abundance (Davis tube). This method is radically different from all 
historic estimation approach, as well as from most other current projects. The result is 
reported  in  terms  of  tonnage  of  magnetite  concentrate  and  grade  of  this  concentrate, 
which  is  more  realistic  when  considering  the  overall  operating  cost  are  dominated 
subsequent roasting and hydrometallurgical processing. To allow a comparative  figure 
with previous estimations as well as with other projects, the author estimated the V2O5 
resource as measured in rock, using unchanged estimation parameters. These results 
were  compiled  using  only  the  cells  selected  within  this  actual  estimation  based  on

magnetite abundance. The value obtained is  99,104,000  tonnes  of  mineralized  rock 
grading  0.43%  V2O5.  An  overall  recovery  factor  of  66.3%  is  calculated,  in  close 
accordance with metallurgical tests, although details in regard of cells may vary greatly. 
 
The recovery factor can be calculated for each cell within the selected pit (figure  47). 
This  factor  varies  proportionally  with  the  magnetite  abundance.  If  considered  as  a 
constant, as done in all previous estimates, it may lead to a high local bias. 
 
The  method  proposed  with  the  current  estimation  certainly  allows  for  a  more  precise 
local estimation.

RECOMMENDATION 
 
Lack  of  drilling  information  and  uneven  quality  of  data  forced  the  author  to  classify 
resources  as  inferred  only.  Upgrading  this  classification  will  necessitate  systematic 
drilling  to  be  conducted  with  the  objective  of  building  a  reliable  lithological  model 
including  accurate  distribution  of  barren  anorthosite  within  the  P2  unit.  The  author 
recommends a drilling program to cover 40 sections spaced 50 metres apart. On each 
odd section, 600 metres of drilling will be required to cover the proposed pit area with 
100  metres  between  each  hole.  On  each  even  section,  300  metres  of  drilling  will  be 
required to drill in-between traces from the previous section in a quincunx pattern. It is 
very  important  that  all  drill  holes  be  entirely  sampled  without  gaps.  The  author  also 
recommends  following  this  drilling  pattern  from  one  end  to  the  other  of  the  deposit 
regardless the presence of historic drill holes or trenches. This will ensure uniformity and 
systematicity for all data. This will require 18,000 metres of drilling.  
 
Drilling  will  require  to  be  optimized  as  well  for  geotechnical  purposes,  metallurgical 
sampling and estimating overburden thickness. This is especially important on the south 
side where the proposed pit will extend outside of currently drilled area.

ITEM 23: ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The  Lac  Doré  and  Lac  Doré  North  properties  are  located  in  vicinity  of  the 
Chibougamau  mining  district.  The  area  has  experienced  intense  exploration  activity  in 
the  past,  and  recurrent  waves  of  staking.  VanadiumCorp  properties  are  currently 
enclaved, and surrounded by various other companies (figure 48) except to the north of 
Lac Doré North. 
 
LAND AVAILABILITY 
 
The area encompassing the 17 kilometres long aeromagnetic anomaly associated with 
the magnetite layers is currently entirely covered by either VanadiumCorp or BlackRock. 
VanadiumCorp's Lac Doré property is surrounded by BlackRock property, while the Lac 
Doré North is partly enclosed. Land is available for staking to the north and to the east 
of the properties, either by conventional posted claims or map designation. 
 
The  whole  area  is  temporarily  substracted  for  staking,  due  to  the  ongoing  process  of 
claim to map-designated cells. Substraction shall be lifted in the coming months. 
 
PROPERTIES IN CONFLICT 
 
No dispute of claims is currently reported in vicinities of Lac Doré and Lac Doré North 
properties. 
 
SURROUNDING PROPERTIES 
 
BlackRock Metals Inc. 
 
BlackRock Metals hold nine (9) map-designated cells and 291 posted claims covering 
the  Southwest  and  Armitage  deposits,  as  well  as  surrounding  lands  for  exploration  or 
infrastructure. Their titles are in good standing and well managed. BlackRock conducted 
important  stripping  and  drilling  efforts  in  order  to  estimate  resource  on  the  Southwest 
and  Armitage  deposits,  and  are  currently  concluding  a  feasibility  study.  Infrastructure 
construction  is  expected  to  begin  in  the  coming  years,  pending  conclusion  of  their 
financing. 
 
A strip of claims to the south of BlackRock Metal property, still recorded under the name 
of Cogitore, were recently acquired by BlackRock (Cogitore press release, November 7, 
2014).

lihhkh
Work conducted by BlackRock metals and available in assessment files includes:
  The Southwest deposit was trenched (1638 metres, 2009) and drilled (103 holes
for 23,066 metres in 2010-2011-2012).
  The  Armitage  deposit  was  trenched  and  drilled  (81  holes  for  18,763  metres
(2011-2012).
In  May  2012,  BlackRock  completed  a  bankable  feasibility  study  (Genivar,  2012). 
However,  being  a  privately  owned  company,  BlackRock  has  no  obligation  to  disclose 
such  study,  which  is  maintained  strictly  confidential.  Resources  estimates  were  not 
published, although incomplete numbers were disclosed in some public presentations. 
Since these are promotional documents, the author notes an unreliability in regards to 
this information. 
 
The  BlackRock  environmental  and  social  assessment  study,  conducted  by  Entraco 
Groupe-Conseil,  was  published  by  the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Agency 
(Federal Agency) on May 2013 (www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents_staticpost/62105/90328/vol1-
eng.pdf).  It  contains  limited  information  regarding  the  mine  and  its  resources,  but  is 
currently the most detailed and reliable description of the project. Descriptions provided 
in other BlackRock presentations cannot be relied upon. 
 
On  April  14,  2014,  Camex  Energy  Corporation  announced  that  a  letter  of  intent  was 
signed  with  BlackRock  Metals  Inc.  for  the  purpose  of  a  reverse  take-over  transaction. 
This transaction is yet to be completed. 
 
LIMITATIONS ON SIMILARITIES 
 
The mineralization found on Lac Doré and Lac Doré North properties is a continuation of 
the mineralization on the adjacent BlackRock Metals properties. However, there is no 
guarantee that VanadiumCorp's deposits are equivalent to BlackRock's deposits 
in regard to the resource and economic viability.  Only a thorough feasibility study, 
including all the various aspects of such a project, will establish the economic viability of 
the project. 
 
Yorbeau Resources Inc. 
 
Yorbeau Resources Inc., recently acquired the former Cogitore property to the south of 
BlackRock Metals, which properties are interlocked to the East. Yorbeau is a company 
dedicated  towards  base  metal  exploration,  and  their  presence  is  not  considered  as  a 
hindrance. Their property is anchored on the former Lemoine Mine, which was a small 
but rich volcanic massive sulphide deposit. Important exploration efforts were conducted 
by Cogitore on this property.

Third parties 
 
To  the  Northeast,  the  Lac  Doré  North  property  is  bounded  by  map  designated  cells 
belonging to 2736-1179 Québec Inc. and Réjean Raymond, both unknown to the author. 
To  the  Southeast,  the  property  is  bounded  by  map  designated  cells  belonging  to 
Ressources  Metchib  (expiry  date  of  November  2nd,  2015)  from  Chibougamau.  A  500 
metres wide band of land is available for staking between Lac Doré North and Metchib's 
claims.  Three  map  designated  cells,  indicated  as  available  for  staking,  were  very 
recently  acquired  by  VanadiumCorp.  Some  of  these  two  properties  cover  weak 
aeromagnetic anomalies. They represent opportunistic staking and are  not considered 
as hindrance. Very limited exploration work was conducted on these properties. 
 
LAND AVAILABLE FOR STAKING 
 
Ample  land  is  available  for  staking  to  the  North  and  North-east  of  Lac  Doré  North 
properties.  A  strip  of  land  will  be  available  to  the  west  of  Lac  Doré,  as  soon  as  the 
staking restriction is lifted by the government. 
 
AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION 
 
Information  regarding  the  adjacent  properties  was  obtained  from  the  Gestim  on-line 
registry of the Natural Resources Ministry. Information regarding exploration work upon 
these  property  was  obtained  from  the  Examine  on-line  report  library  available  at  the 
Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles du Québec. 
 
INDEPENDENCE OF THE AUTHORS 
 
Most of the available information on neighbouring properties was acquired from public 
domain assessment files, government work, press releases and web sites. The author is 
independent of the holders and operators of the adjacent properties. However, IOS was 
involved on BlackRock project in 2008 when the company was structured. In the same 
period, an IOS geologist was hired by Cogitore to work on Lemoine project in 2007-2009 
period. 
 
VALIDATION OF THE INFORMATION 
 
Most of the historical information pertaining to the neighbouring properties was acquired 
under the author’s supervision. This information is considered adequately verified. 
 
Work conducted by BlackRock and Cogitore on their properties has not been verified by 
the author.

ITEM 24: OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION 
 
Most of Item 24 is taken from the previous version of the report, dated June 10, 2014, 
and has not been updated, except for current prices. It is not expected that significant 
changes  occurred  in  the  Vanadium  industry  since  that  date,  except  for  the  decline  in 
Vanadium price.  
 
VANADIUM USES 
 
Vanadium  is  dominantly  used  as  an  alloying  agent  in  high  strength  metals,  which 
represent 95% of its consumption (figure 49) (Roskill, 1985, p. 59). As an alloying agent, 
it can be used in steel (85%) or in aluminum-titanium alloys (11%). The remaining 4% is 
used  as  a  catalyst  agent  by  the  chemical  industry.  Vanadium  and  niobium  are 
interchangeable  in  some  cases  in  microalloyed  steels,  however  the  substitution  is  not 
without  operational  or  performance  compromises.  Vanadium  generally  does  not  have 
any  substitutes  in  oxidation  catalysts  and  titanium  alloys.  Vanadium-based  electrolyte 
currently account for a very small portion of the market. 
 
In  microalloyed  steels,  vanadium  precipitates  as  vanadium  carbide  or  vanadium 
carbonitride  promoting  increased  strength  as  a  result  of  grain  refinement  and 
precipitation  hardening.  In  full  alloy  steels,  precipitation  of  vanadium  carbides  and 
carbonitrides  promotes  fine  grain  structure  leading  to  increase  in  high  temperature 
abrasion resistance. Vanadium is used in a variety of steels which are intended for use 
in rolled condition including hot rolled coil, plate, structural members, bars and forging 
steels, atop of some stainless steel. Vanadium is also used to strengthen titanium and 
aluminum alloys, especially for aircraft structures.

Figure  49:  Pie-chart  of  the  vanadium  usages  in  steel,  which  account  for  85%  of  the 
vanadium  consumption  (Source:  USGS  website).  The  largest  share  is  used  for  HSLA 
steel, such as rolled steel or rebar. 
 
Vanadium  is  used  in  a  variety  of  forms  and  applications  in  catalysis  usually  as  an 
oxidation  reaction  catalyst,  including  vanadium  pentoxide  for  sulfuric  acid  and  maleic 
anhydride  production,  vanadium  chlorides  as  Ziegler  Natta  catalysts  for  the  synthetic 
rubber polyethylene polymerization, and ammonium metavanadate for the production of 
adipic acid. 
 
Some other applications exist including vanadium metal for the nuclear industry and as 
heat sinks in computer hard drives, superconductors, vanadium oxides and downstream 
chemicals in glass coatings, non-food crop micronutrients, anti-fouling agents in marine 
paints,  pollution  control  catalysts  and  pharmaceutical  applications.  Although  strategic, 
these applications consume a minor amount of vanadium. 
 
World  vanadium  consumption  is  basically  driven  by  two  variables:  global  steel 
production rates and specific vanadium consumption rates within the steel industry, or 
"vanadium intensity". In recent years vanadium demand has shown compound annual 
growth  rates  in  excess  of  6%  (figure  50).  High  strength  steel  production  is  growing 
faster  than  the  standard  steel  production,  especially  for  construction  applications  in 
China, vanadium-bearing pipeline and automotive part grade steel. Typically, while the 
amount of steel used for a single car decreases, the amount of vanadium in the same 
car increases.

Figure  50: Vanadium consumption  since 2001. The increase in demand is essentially 
driven by China (Perles, 2013). 
 
Vanadium  is  usually  added  to  steel  in  the  form  of  ferrovanadium  or  vanadium 
carbonitride  alloys,  although  in  some  cases  vanadium  oxides  are  used  in  conjunction 
with vacuum degassing. Converters of oxides to ferrovanadium or vanadium carbonitride 
alloys  are  thus  the  main  consumers  of  pentoxide.  The  ferrovanadium  and  vanadium 
carbonitride converting capacity is divided into integrated and non-integrated producers. 
Integrated plants couple steel plant, pentoxide refinery and converter. They are usually 
large producers, such as Evraz in Russia and South Africa, Panzhihua Iron & Steel and 
Chengde Iron & Steel in China. 
 
Non-integrated  converting  facilities  rely  on  traded  pentoxide  as  feedstock,  such  as 
Masterloy in Ottawa, Bear Metallurgical in USA, Korvan and Woojin in Korea, and a host 
of  Chinese  converters.  The  largest  capacity  for  conversion  of  vanadium  oxides  into 
ferrovanadium and vanadium carbonitride alloys exists in China. The dominant trend in 
the vanadium industry is towards integration of production. 
 
VANADIUM PRICE 
 
The March 2015 published vanadium pentoxide median price was US$3.92 per pound 
FOB  in  Rotterdam  warehouse  (Metal  Pages  website),  down  from  US$4.96  two  month 
ago and US$5.70 last year. The base price was rather stable in the range of US$5.00-
US$5.20  per  pound  for  V2O5  (technical  98%  grade)  over  the  past  10  years  (April  3rd, 
2015,  Resource  Investing  News  website.  US$5.00-5.20  per  pound).  Since  1980,  the 
mean vanadium pentoxide published price was US$6.25/pound V2O5 (not adjusted for 
inflation) and the annual average price has ranged from US$1.34/pound V2O5 in 2002 to

lihhkh
US$16.25/pound V2O5 in 2005 (Metal Bulletin website). Ferrovanadium (80%V) currently 
sells at approximately US$19.50 per kilogram.  According to Metal Bulletin, the average 
three year European vanadium pentoxide price, corrected for inflation, is calculated at 
US$5.53/pounds, the 5 years average at US$5.94/pounds and the 10 years average at 
US$7.79/pounds. 
 
Vanadium prices are characterized by occasional short-term spikes, historically recurring 
every  7-10  years  and  related  to  triggers  or  destabilizations  in  the  market  (figures  51, 
52). In February 1989, vanadium pentoxide prices reached US$10.95/pounds V2O5. In 
years prior to this time, vanadium prices were extremely weak causing the Russian steel 
mill  Nizhny  Tagil  to  eliminate  the  duplex  process  in  the  BOF  shop  which  generated 
vanadium bearing slag. This slag was the source of vanadium production in China and 
eventually the market reacted to the contraction of supply. Once the market reacted the 
Russian supply restarted and prices quickly came back to normal levels.

Figure 52: Price of vanadium on the American market, as monitored by USGS. Most of 
the vanadium remains sold under private contract, the pricing of which is elusive. 
 
In May 2005 vanadium pentoxide prices reached US$26.25/pound V2O5 (equivalent to 
US$35.85/lbs V2O5 today). This relates to the implementation in China of a new standard 
for  high strength,  high  ductility  reinforcing  bar  used  in  construction  applications,  which 
resulted in massive new applications for vanadium and continues to impact the growth 
rate  of  vanadium  consumption  today.  Very  high  prices  for  vanadium  resulted  in 
investment  in  new  sources  for  production,  including  carbon  based  "stone  coal"  ore  in 
China,  and  eventually  added  capacity  combined  with  substitution  of  Vanadium  with 
Niobium in some rebar applications, resulted in prices moving back to reasonable levels 
in a matter of months. 
 
In  2008  power  shortages  and  load  shedding  in  South  Africa  resulted  in  reduced 
vanadium production from this important source of global exports, leading to vanadium 
pentoxide  prices 
to 
US$16.94/pound  V2O5  today).  The  Global  financial  crisis  which  struck  in  mid-2008 
resulted in a significant decrease in global demand and plummeting prices in a matter of 
months. 
 
The  occasional  spikes  in  vanadium  prices  to  very  high  levels  are  typically  a  result  of 
market disruptive events. In the past, these events have proven to be unsustainable over 
the long term and very high prices have exhibited short time duration. These price spikes 
shall not be considered when forecasting prices for economic studies.

The prices shown are FOB in a Rotterdam warehouse, duty unpaid. Chinese domestic 
prices  are  currently  available,  quoted  in  renminbi,  currently  around  80  Rmb/lbs 
(equivalent  of  US$12/pound  of  contained  V).  However,  prior  to  the  influence  of  the 
Chinese  market,  most  vanadium  was  sold  close  to  quarterly  published  prices  set  by 
Highveld (South Africa).  
 
A price of US$6.00 per pound V2O5 can be accepted as a realistic long term price, in 
balance  with  production  costs.  It  should  be  the  maximum  price  accepted  for  any 
feasibility  study.  A  price  of  US$5.50  was  used  as  base  scenario  for  the  current 
resource estimate. 
 
A significant proportion of vanadium is sold through long-term contracts between steel 
makers  and  integrated  vanadium  producers  or  major  traders  with  off-take  agreements 
with producers. Typically this contract business is based on formula prices with a single 
digit discount to the published price indexes. 
 
VANADIUM WORLD PRODUCTION 
 
Reliable figures of world production of vanadium products have been difficult to obtain in 
the  past.  As  a  result  of  the  fact  that  major  producers  are  minor  parts  of  international 
corporations who consolidate production and financial reporting, the specific detail about 
vanadium  production  was  difficult  to  discern.  As  China  has  grown  to  become  a  major 
producer  with  dozens  of  small  producing  plants,  the  situation  has  become  even  more 
opaque since 2004. 
 
In recent years VANITEC (the Vanadium International Technical Committee), an industry 
group  comprised  of  major  vanadium  producers  has  published  statistics  on  vanadium 
production and consumption levels. VANITEC data can be summarized by the following 
table (table 21) (data in units of metric tonnes vanadium contained per year):

The  VANITEC  methodology  for  development  of  the  data  would  seem  to  be  accurate 
regarding  production  data  given  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  the  vanadium  producers 
contribute to the data (figure  53). The consumption data is more difficult to assemble 
particularly  given  the  opaqueness  of  consumption  in  China  and  CIS  countries.  Other 
sources indicate global vanadium consumption in 2015 as high as 92,000 metric tonnes 
vanadium (T. Perles, personal communication).

The  size  of  the  vanadium  market  is  comparable  to  the  cobalt  market,  is  40%  of  the 
molybdenum  market,  or  10%  of  the  chromium  market.  Uses  of  these  metals  are  all 
dominated by the ferroalloys industry. 
 
World reserves of commercially exploitable vanadium are estimated (excluding The Lac 
Doré Vanadium deposit) at 17 million tonnes of vanadium pentoxide (Roskill, 1995, page 
1), including both magnetite ore and oil residues. However, reserve in lower grades are 
enormous, just the Julia Creek deposit in Australia being reported to contain a resource 
of  near  20  million  tonnes  of  vanadium  pentoxide  equivalent.  The  current  resource 
estimate  on  Lac  Doré  suggests  it  may  represent  about  8%  of  the  worlds  disclosed 
resources. 
 
Today's production is concentrated in South Africa, Russia and China, which collectively 
account  for  more  than  90%  of  the  production  of  vanadium  raw  materials  (figure  54). 
China, Russia and South Africa remain major exporters of both vanadium raw materials 
and  refined  vanadium  products.  According  to  Perles  (2013),  there  are  six  (6)  current 
vanadium-slag  producers  in  China,  with  a  production  of  about  42,000  tonnes  of 
equivalent  vanadium,  dominated  by  Pangang  and  Chengde.  Pangang  currently 
produces  about  20,000  tonnes  equivalent  vanadium  per  year,  which  requires  the 
consumption of about 2 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate with a grade of 0.53% 
V2O5  and  the  production  of  1.3  million  tonnes  of  steel.  Total  titano-magnetite 
consumption in China is estimated at 4.5 million tonnes per year, mainly from low grade 
ore (Pangang being mined at 0.27% V2O5). 
 
In  addition  there  are  currently  at  least  10,000  metric  tonnes  of  vanadium  per  year 
capacity from processing of "stone coal" (anthracite) ore in China. Most of this capacity 
is considered relatively high cost and is not in production today.

Figure  54:  Vanadium  production,  by  country.  The  intense  increase  in  production  by 
China since 2005 is driven by their steel production and consumption (Perles, 2013). 
 
In South Africa, three producers of vanadium refined products exist. Highveld Steel and 
Vanadium, formerly part of Anglo-American, acquired by Evraz in 2006, and partly resold 
to a domestic investment fund in August 2014, and recently shut down, was the major 
supplier of vanadium bearing slag. The slag is produced from their steel mill and refined 
at  other  South  African  vanadium  operations  and  Austria.  The  Highveld  steel  mill 
generated approximately 8000 metric tonnes vanadium contained in vanadium slag as a 
co-product  from  the  steel  operations.  This  vanadium  slag  was  processed  by  three 
companies for refinement to final vanadium products with an approximate recovery rate 
of 81% from slag to vanadium oxide. The vanadiferous magnetite ore comes from the 
Mapochs mine, which still have significant reserves, but which is located 110 kilometres 
away  from  the  smelting-roasting  plant.  This  mine  was  opened  in  replacement  to  the 
former Kennedy Vale pipe mine, an exhausted vanadium-rich massive magnetite pipe. 
 
The Vanchem vanadium refinery, adjacent to the Highveld steel mill, used to refine both 
vanadium slag from the steel mill as well as iron ore fines from the Mapochs iron ore 
mine which contain vanadium, but is now limited to process magnetite concentrate. The 
Vanchem vanadium plant, which was sold by Highveld/Evraz to Duferco Steel as part of 
the  agreement  between  the  EU  government  and  Evraz  Group  in  conjunction  with  the 
Highveld Steel and Vanadium acquisition, used tp produces a total of about 4800 metric

chemicals. The current production is not known. 
 
Vametco  Alloys,  also  a  part  of  the  Evraz  group,  similarly  process  both  slag  from  the 
Highveld  steel  mill  and  ore  from  their  mine  in  the  Bushveld  complex.  Vametco  Alloys 
produces  a  total  of  about  3500  metric  tonnes  vanadium  per  year  in  the  form  of  V2O3 
which is converted into vanadium carbonitride alloy (Nitrovan© trade name). 
 
Rhovan, the primary vanadium mine owned by Glencore (formerly a part of Xstrata) also 
mines  vanadium  bearing  titaniferous  ore  from  the  Bushveld  complex  and  produces 
approximately 5000 metric tonnes vanadium per year as oxides and ferrovanadium. 
 
Highveld slag represented the major source of raw material for production of vanadium 
by Treibacher in Austria. Approximately 80% of Treibacher’s annual production of 6500 
metric tonnes of vanadium was based on the processing of Highveld  slag. Treibacher 
production as well as minor production by GFE in Nurembrug is currently based on the 
processing  of  vanadium  bearing  ashes,  slags  or  spent  catalyst  secondary  materials 
resulting from burning vanadium bearing oil in power stations or oil refineries processing 
vanadium bearing crude oil. 
 
In Russia, Evraz Group produces in excess of 14,000 metric tonnes vanadium slag each 
year, as a co-product from the Nizhny Tagil steel mill in Ural. This slag is predominately 
processed  at  the  Evraz  vanadium  refinery  in  Tula,  resulting  in  7800  metric  tonnes  of 
vanadium as vanadium oxides each year. The Tula refinery capacity is apparently not 
capable of processing all of the slag from Nizhny Tagil. As a result in past years Evraz 
has  sent  excess  slag  to  China  as  well  as  to  its  sister  company  Stratcor  facility  in  Hot 
Springs  Arkansas.  The  vanadium  production  line  in  Nizhny  Tagil  has  been  shut  down 
intermitently in the past. 
 
North  America  produces  about  5%  of  the  world  total  vanadium  output,  essentially  as 
secondary  production  from  oil  residues  resulting  from  oil  originating  in  Venezuela 
(Orimulsion)  and  Mexico.  The  Athabasca  oil  sands  of  Alberta  contribute  for  a  small 
amount of vanadium raw materials to North America today, with the potential for future 
growth, as expressed by the ill-fated Carbovan project.  
 
Three  plants  in  the  USA  process  secondary  materials  from  Venezuela,  Mexico  and 
Canada into final vanadium products; Evraz in Hot Springs Arkansas, Gulf Chemical and 
Metallurgical  in  Freeport  Texas,  and  AMG  Vanadium  in  Cambridge  Ohio.  Total 
production of vanadium final products in North America in 2013 was approximately 4000 
metric  tonnes  vanadium  while  consumption  was  close  to  12,000  metric  tonnes

vanadium.  Stratcor,  a  division  of  Evraz,  is  currently  capable  of  producing  high  purity 
vanadium chemical producer, suitable for battery electrolyte. 
 
Windimurra mine (Atlantic Vanadium), the ill-fated Australian producer, has gone back 
into production in 2010, but the accidental destruction of the refinery in February 2014 
re-halted the production. 
 
Maracas Menchen mine, property of Largo Resources in Brazil, started its production in 
the  course  of  2014,  and  is  currently  ramping  up  its  production  toward  7000  tonnes 
vanadium per year. 
 
VANADIUM MARKET STRUCTURE 
 
The  bulk  of  the  vanadium  market  is  steel  related,  60%  of  the  consumption  being  for 
HSLA steel (high-strength low-alloy steel, typically containing 0.015% to 0.55 vanadium) 
plus  25%  for  specialty  steels.  And,  in  this  regard,  metallurgical  grade  vanadium 
pentoxide is a "commodity", which means its value is independent of the producer, as 
long as the specifications are met. The selling price is more or less dictated by market, 
and the ones surviving in difficult periods are producers with lowest production cost or 
greater  flexibility.  Vanadium  is  mainly  (96%)  used  to  make  other  commodities,  and  its 
market remains therefore highly dependent on other commodities performance. 
 
The vast majority of world vanadium production is as co-product (68%, Perles, 2013) or 
secondary  production  (21%),  which  makes  its  production  capacity  rather  non-elastic. 
Only 11% of the vanadium is a primary production which can react to market outcomes. 
Vanadium production is then controlled by demand for other commodities, mainly steel, 
and not by its intrinsic demand. It is therefore a "co-commodity". Furthermore, the steel 
industry  is  simultaneously  its  major  consumer  and  dominant  source  of  supply.  So 
demand  and  production  are  related  and  dependant.  The  only  buffer  available  in  the 
vanadium  market  seems  to  be  stockpiles  accumulation  in  low  market,  and  stockpiles 
depletion in a boom market, and all the impacts of market fluctuation are absorbed by 
the  primary  producers.  Therefore,  as  vanadium  production  is  not  related  to  its  selling 
price, variations in demand are directly reflected in price fluctuation. Because of these 
factors  it  can  be  difficult  to  invest  and  build  new  facilities  for  primary  production. 
Consequently,  during  the  last  20  years  and  despite  a  100%  increase  in  overall 
production,  only  two  facilities  entered  the  market,  Windimurra  (currently  temporarily 
closed) in Australia, and Largo in Brazil. Each of these projects represents about 8% of 
the market.  
 
In the last ten years, American production of vanadium has waned due to the decreasing 
availability of vanadium bearing raw materials. The vast majority of vanadium production

in  North  America  is  based  on  secondary  refinement  of  vanadium  bearing  ashes,  slag 
and residues originating from burning Venezuelan Orimulsion. Each year the vanadium 
grade of these oils decreases. Total oil production in Venezuela is also in a downward 
spiral, and more and more of the Venezuelan oil is being shipped to China rather than 
North America. Today consumption of vanadium in USA plus Canada is approximately 
11,000 metric tonnes per year compared to a production from domestic raw materials 
sources of less than 1000 metric tonnes vanadium per year. The increasing dependency 
of  supply  of  vanadium  demand  in  USA  and  Canada  from  unstable  or  government 
oriented jurisdictions like Venezuela, South Africa, Russia and China is of great concern. 
No strategic stockpile is available anymore in United States. 
 
There  is  a  certain  desire  in  the  manufacturing  industry  for  a  dependable  source  of 
vanadium located in a politically stable and market controlled economy. As a reference, 
a similar situation prevails in the niobium industry, where the Niobec Mine (located near 
Chicoutimi, Québec, a Magris Resources subsidiary) was kept in production for the last 
40 years for the sole sake of market stability. 
 
Ferrovanadium  imports  in  the  USA  from  China  and  South  Africa  are  essentially  non-
existent as a result of dumping duties. Import duty on ferrovanadium from countries not 
subject to dumping are typically 3.7% and imports of V2O5 into the USA generally carry a 
5% import duty. Lac Doré production would be exempted of such duty, considering the 
North America free trade agreement. 
 
VANADIUM BATTERY 
 
Due  to  its  multiple  valences  (V++,  V+++,  V++++  and  V+++++),  its  high  solubility  under  wide 
acidity ranges and its high electrical density, vanadium is a metal with one of the highest 
electroactive capacities. Hence the interest in vanadium based batteries.  
 
Currently, two categories of vanadium based batteries are emerging on the market, the 
vanadium  redox  flow  batteries  and  lithium-vanadium  batteries.  Vanadium  redox  flow 
batteries  “VRB”  are  one  of  the  most  promising  chemistries,  because  of  vanadium’s 
ability  to  maintain  different  states  of  charge  as  a  standalone  element,  unlike  other 
chemistries like zinc-bromine or iron-chromium. But getting these efficiency advantages 
from theoretical to real-world working model status has taken years of effort and some 
significant  changes  along  the  way.  The  vanadium  redox  battery  exploits  the  ability  of 
vanadium to exist in solution in four different oxidation states, and uses this property to 
make  a  battery  that  has  just  one  electroactive  element  instead  of  two.  The  main 
advantages of the VRB’s are that it can offer almost unlimited capacity simply by using 
larger  storage  tanks,  it  can  be  left  completely  discharged  for  long  periods  with  no  ill 
effects,  it  can  be  recharged  simply  by  replacing  the  electrolyte  if  no  power  source  is

available to charge it, and if the electrolytes are accidentally mixed the battery suffers no 
permanent damage.
Figure 55: Diagram of the vanadium redox battery, made of two electrolyte tanks, which 
electrolyte  are  pumped  into  a  fuel  cell  where  electricity  is  generated  or  the  electrolyte 
regenerated (Wikipedia.org). 
 
The  vanadium  redox  flow  battery  was  developed  by  Dr.  Maria  Skyllas-Kazacos,  from 
New-South-Wales  University  (Australia),  patented  in  1989  (figure  55).  Dr.  Skyllas-
Kazacos is currently on the advisory board of VanadiumCorp, as well, she was involved 
+  reduction 
with  the  former  McKenzie  Bay  project.  The  battery  uses  a  VO++  ==>  VO2
electrolyte and V++ ==> V+++ oxidation electrolyte upon discharging. Both electrolytes are 
put  in  semi-contact  through  an  electroporous  membrane  for  electron  exchange.  Since 
both electrolytes are made of the same metal, cross contamination is not an issue. Since 
both electrolytes are liquids, they can be pumped through the cell, and stored in tanks. 
Then, the storage capacity is dependent on the tanks size and power is dependent on 
membrane surface. Thus the battery runs as two electrolyte storage tanks, a membrane 
unit (fuel cell) and pumps for circulating the electrolyte in the charge or discharge cycles. 
These  batteries  then  represent  large  storage  capacity  (Kw/h  to  Mw/h)  suitable  where 
high power is required. Applications are multiple:
  Full  electric  vehicle,  where  the  batteries  can  either  be  recharged  on  grid,  or 
"refuelled" with charged liquid electrolytes. The official release of such a vehicle 
happened  at  the  Sydney  2000  Olympic  Games,  where  it  propelled  public 
transportation. Promoters claim that it may likely replace the standard Pb-Pb car 
battery as well as dominate the electric car market.

  Power back-up for a small community isolated from national electrical grid, such 
as islands, Nordic villages and jungle or desert outposts. Electric power for such 
communities  is  usually  produced  with  diesel  powered  generator,  which  have  a 
near  constant  fuel  consumption  regardless  of  the  power  output.  Therefore,  the 
generators needs to be built to supply peak demands, and thus runs constantly at 
full fuel consumption. Coupling storage battery with generators or even windmills 
enables  to supply  peak  demands  with  significantly  lower  generating capacities. 
An  example  is  the  Windstor  System,  developed  by  Dermont  Engineering,  a 
subsidiary  of  McKenzie  Bay  International,  a  system  which  was  successfully 
installed in Rouyn-Noranda in 2002.
  Grid  stabilization  of  industrialized  areas  subjected  to  supply  reliability  which  do 
not  match  the  needs,  such  as  California's  silicon  valley.  Such  large  scale 
batteries  are  considered  sufficiently  powerful  to  supply  industrial  complexes 
sensitive  to  electrical  power  outage,  such  as  robotized  assembly  lines  and 
computer centers. It is reported that a single power outage of a car assembly line 
cost about a million dollars to restart.
  Grid stabilization for large communities, enabling levelling of peak demands. Cost 
of electricity is, on most grids, dependant on demands, meaning it may quadruple 
during  peak  periods  (such  as  dinner  time  every  day  and  extreme  cold  or  heat 
periods).  The  only  large  power  stations  which  can  easily  cope  with  short-term 
variations  are  hydro-electricity,  which  represents  only  a  fraction  of  North-
American production. As an example, Hydro-Québec is the only utility company 
vastly relying on hydro-electricity. Although its net exports are near to nil, Hydro-
Québec  imports  off-peak  power  from  New-England  at  low  cost,  and  export  at 
peak demands at high prices, generating hundreds of millions dollars in profits.
  The need for grid stabilization for wind farms is self-evident.
The storage capacity of the generation one vanadium redox battery relates directly to the 
amount  of  vanadium,  with  a  capacity  of  250  watt-hours  of  energy  per  1  kilogram  of 
vanadium  used  in  the  electrolyte.  A  megawatt-hour  size  battery  then  requires  5000 
metric  tonnes  of  vanadium  electrolyte,  nearly  a  year  of  eventual  Lac  Doré  production. 
The  commercialization  of  vanadium  batteries  would  create  a  tremendous  pressure  on 
the vanadium price. The reader shall recall the non-elasticity of the current production, 
and  therefore  the  need  for  domestic  primary-source  of  vanadium  to  fulfil  the  battery 
market to both supply vanadium and maintain stability in pricing. 
 
Vanadium  redox  flow  batteries  have  clearly  demonstrated  the  ability  to  meet  the 
challenge of integrating energy from variable and intermittent sources such as wind and 
solar  power  onto  the  electricity  grid  while  maintaining  grid  stability.  However,  these 
batteries have been limited in their ability to perform in a wide range of temperatures,

their relatively high cost, their low energy density and the need for high purity vanadium 
electrolyte. 
 
In 2006, the basic patents relating to the vanadium battery expired and new developers 
entered the market, namely UniEnergy near Seattle in the US and their strategic partner, 
Dalian  Bolong  New  Material  Co.,  Ltd.  “BNM”.  BNM  is  now  the  leading  producer  of 
vanadium  products  in  the  world.  In  2011  scientists  at  the  Pacific  Northwest  National 
Laboratory "PNNL" in the USA improved the performance of redox flow technology by 
increasing  the  energy  density  by  70%  and  simplifying  the  system  in  comparison  with 
standard  storage  batteries.  Purity  requirements  of  the  generation  3  vanadium  redox 
batteries  were  also  decreased,  which  may  result  in  decreased  cost  of  production  for 
vanadium electrolyte suppliers. The advent of this third generation VRB by  PNNL has 
come  at  a  pivotal  time  with  renewable  energy  at  the  forefront  of  the  market,  price 
stability, viable technology and North American VRB companies following the success of 
VRB commercialization in China, Japan, Korea and Europe. North American supply of 
Vanadium will become a significant concern as commercialization increases in scale. 
 
The  second  type  of  vanadium  based  battery  is  the  lithium-metal  (vanadium)-polymer 
“LMP”  battery  and  lithium-vanadium-phosphate  battery  “LVP”.  Originally  developed  by 
Avestor, a Hydro-Québec subsidiary who still owns patents on the technology, in the late 
1990's, the LMP solid-electrolyte battery uses lithium ions as the anode and avanadium 
oxide polymer as the cathode. In 2010, GS Yuasa in Japan developed and prototyped 
the LVP battery with vanadium phosphate as a cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. 
The use of vanadium in the cathode allows the reaction to release more energy under 
discharge  and  to  recharge  more  quickly.  The  battery  stores  more  energy  and  can  be 
recharged much faster than Li-ion batteries. Vanadium also allows the battery to provide 
power while recharging. The LMP & LVP main application is electric vehicles, where it 
may deliver a higher power/weight ratio than regular lithium ion batteries. Although this 
battery  has  numerous  advantages  over  conventional  lithium-cobalt  iron  batteries,  its 
commercialization is uncertain. 
 
MARKET OUTLOOK 
 
Historically,  until  2005,  the  vanadium  demand  and  production  has  grown  about  4-5% 
annually,  related  to  increasing  in  steel  production  and  of  its  vanadium  content.  Since 
2005, due to the Chinese increase in steel production as well as the implementation of 
higher  strength  and  ductility  specifications  for  construction  steels  in  China,  vanadium 
demand  and  production  has  increased  by  about  70%,  for  a  growth  of  7-8%  annually. 
Although the growth rate of the Chinese steel industry has decelerated for the last 2-3 
years, the demand in vanadium as alloying agent increased. The phenomenon related to 
the usage "intensity", which relates to the proportion of the steel produced that is alloyed

or  microalloyed.  Traditional  steel  produced  and  consumed  in  China  is  used  in  regular 
carbon  steel.  However,  the  proportion  of  HSLA  steel  consumption  has  steadily 
increased, and the intensity of world vanadium use in steel has steadily increased by 5% 
in the last decade (50% total), multiplied by the steel production which has doubled. This 
increase  translates  into  0.002  kg  of  vanadium  per  tonne  of  steel  (Perles,  2013).  This 
represent a 7% overall increase in consumption per year by the steel industry. Despite 
the  slowdown  in  steel  production,  the  vanadium  intensity  increase  is  on  a  long  term 
outlook, which shall sustain a 5% annual growth of vanadium consumption by the steel 
industry.  The  bulk  of  the  non-alloyed  steel  produced  by  China  is  dedicated  to  its 
domestic  market.  The  last  quinquennial  economic  plan  of  the  Chinese  government 
indicates the will to improve the quality of domestic steel consumption, thus to sustain 
the trend in vanadium growth consumption. 
 
The market for vanadium chemical to be used in the various types of batteries currently 
stands  at  less  than  2000  tonnes  per  year.  It  is  currently  difficult  to  forecast  future 
demand in this emerging market, but 10,000 tonnes per year by 2017 was proposed by 
Perles  (2013).  However,  the  demand  can  vary  wildly  depending  if  lithium-vanadium-
phosphate batteries get more acceptances by the car industry, and mostly if large scale 
VRB power storage systems get fully commercialized. The construction of a single VRB 
unit to back-up the Hoover Dam electricity production, enough to sustain a city the size 
of Vancouver, would require about 5000 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent as electrolyte! The 
supply  for  such  increase  in  demand  could  not  be  derived  from  an  increase  in  direct 
reduction steel production, and would have to come from primary production.

ITEM 25: INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION 
 
VanadiumCorp owns a significant portion of the series of vanadium bearing magnetite 
layers historically defined on the South limbs of the Lac Doré Anorthositic Complex. It is 
calculated that the Eastern Deposit alone, between sections 6+50 East and 24+50 East 
and  to  a  depth  of  200  metres,  host  an  inferred  resource  99,104,000  tonnes  of 
mineralized  rock  at  26.3%  magnetite,  thus  containing  26,067,000  tonnes  of  titano-
magnetite  grading  1.08%  V2O5.  Resources  were  calculated  using  magnetite  recovery 
from Davis tube testing, and vanadium assay of the magnetite concentrate. This method 
is  considered  more  dependable  than  using  the  conventional  approach  of  calculating 
headgrade and applying uniform magnetite recovery. If calculated back, a headgrade of 
0.43% V2O5 is obtained for the whole resource. It is considered that using Davis tube 
magnetite recovery emulate the performance of a mill, thus no mineralurgical recovery is 
factored  in.  It  is  considered  that  recovery  of  vanadium  from  magnetite,  through 
conventional alkali roasting, is in the order of 95%. Therefore, 282,370 metric tonnes of 
vanadium pentoxide would be present in the concentrate, or near to 621 million pounds. 
No credit was allocated for by-products.  
 
The  resource  model  is  based  on  a  25%  in-bedded  profit  on  each  individual  block. 
Revenues are assuming an average sales price of US$5.50 per pound, while cost are 
estimated on the following:
  Mining cost, based on similar operation: US$1.80 per tonne. 
  Milling and beneficiation cost, based on similar operation: US$2.50 per tonne. 
  This is based on a power consumption of 17 kwH/t at "L" rate. It includes cost for
tailing management.
  Roasting and hydrometallurgy cost at $40/tonne of magnetite. 
  Reactants alone are estimated at $21 per tonne of magnetite (soda ash and coal
mainly), to which manpower and calcine disposal need to be added.
The  current  resource  estimate  is  based  on  data  compiled  from  the  various  historic 
reports. Very little of this data is VanadiumCorp data. Although extensive verification was 
made,  less  than  1%  of  errors  are  likely  remaining  in  the  data  set.  Assaying  results 
generated  since  McKenzie  Bay  Resources  work  in  1997  were  subjected  to  quality 
control, including the insertion of certified reference material. It is in the author opinion 
that these data are coherent and accurate, both in term of headgrade and concentrate 
analysis.  However,  assays  obtained  from  historic  work  completed  by  MRN  and 
SOQUEM are lacking proper quality control. Although their precision is acceptable, their 
accuracy  is  expected  to  be  only  within  5%  of  the  true  grade.  Since  systematic  bias 
observed  on  some  sets  of  conflicting  data  is  uncertain,  correcting  these  data  may

worsen their accuracy. Therefore, no correction for suspected bias were applied. It 
is  considered  that,  whatsoever  the  effort,  conciliation  of  the  dataset  cannot  be 
significantly  improved.  Therefore,  upgrading  the  category  of  the  current  resource 
cannot  be  based  upon  the  current  dataset  and  will  require  a  systematic  and 
properly controlled drilling program over the deposit. 
 
The deposit had experienced advanced stages of development four times in its history, 
including  massive  metallurgical  testing.  Building  on  the  current  resource  estimate  and 
tapping  on  these  previous  studies  shall  enable  VanadiumCorp  to  proceed  with  a 
Preliminary  economic  assessment  “PEA”  of  the  project.  Preparation  of  a  preliminary 
economic assessment from existing data would require about six months of work. 
 
It  is  in  the  author  opinion  that  a  resource  category  upgrade,  involving  a  significant 
investment  in  drilling,  shall  not  be  undertaken  until  profitability  is  suggested  from  the 
preliminary economic assessment.

ITEM 26: RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET 
 
The  author  has  reviewed  relevant  information  to  the  VanadiumCorp  owned  Lac  Doré 
and Lac Doré North properties and the surveys carried out to date. The progress made 
on the Lac Doré deposits and the geological continuity between the various segments of 
these deposits provide abundant evidences of important vanadium endowment and the 
technical capabilities to economically recover this metal. The historic work completed on 
their deposits provides VanadiumCorp with the opportunity to quickly proceed from the 
current  inferred  resources  estimation  to  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment.  The 
author suggested sequence of work for the development as follows: 
 
PHASE 1: PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 
 
Completion  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  for  establishing  primary  vanadium 
production  is  considered  a  prerequisite  to  justify  the  financing  of  a  drilling  program  to 
upgrade categorization of the resource as well as metallurgical testing. 
 
The author recommends that the Preliminary Economic Assessment be based upon the 
inferred resources provided in the current report, since it’s purpose is primarily to justify 
the important investment related to drilling in order to upgrade the resources. 
 
To be completed, the preliminary economic assessment will require:
  Limited field verifications. 
  Detailed  review  of  the  historic  work  regarding  beneficiation,  roasting  and 
hydrometallurgy process. Such review shall be conducted by a metallurgist with 
vast experience with vanadium.
  Elaboration of a preliminary mining plan and pit design, based on the available
resource model.
  Handling, logistic and expediting scenarios. 
  Estimation of the capital cost and operating cost of a vanadium refinery, including
the construction of a large size rotary kiln.
  Detailed market study for the metallurgical grade vanadium pentoxide, including
the outlook for ferrovanadium, carbonitride and high purity electrolyte chemical.
  Review of the available portion of the former McKenzie Bay Environmental and 
Social  impacts  study,  and  upgrade  of  this  study  in  regard  of  the  current  socio-
economic context.
  Evaluation  of  the  capital  requirement,  cash-flows  and  net  present  value  of  the 
project. The author insists this study being carried solely with the perspective of 
metallurgical grade pentoxide production. Such working hypothesis is needed to

ensure  the  robustness  of  the  project,  the  electrolyte  production  being  currently 
too uncertain.
  Outlining  the  weakness  of  the  project,  in  order  to  address  the  sensitive  issues
and provide options for solutions.
Phase 1 program shall be initiated as soon as mandated by VanadiumCorp, likely this 
year.

Conditional  to  a  preliminary  economic  assessment  indicating  a  reasonable  chance  for 
the project to be profitable, the resource will need to be upgraded into the indicated and 
measured category. For this phase, it will be needed to drill the deposit, in a systematic 
pattern and according to the current industry best practices. As detailed in Item 14, it is 
recommended to drill a complete profile every 100 metres, for 20 profiles, with 2 holes of 
300 metres length for 600 metres per profile, plus 20 intermediate profiles at 50 metres 
spacing  on  a  quincunx  pattern  with  one  hole  of  300  metres  length  per  intermediate 
profile.  This  will  sum  to  18,000  metres  of  drilling  in  order  to  cover  the  entire  Eastern 
deposit. It is recommended that drilling being made with PQ diameter (8.5 cm diameter) 
to  enable  collecting  sufficient  material  for  metallurgical  testing,  including  fragment 
sufficiently large for a drop-mill test. This will represent about 350 tonnes of material. For 
this, about 2000 metres of geotechnical holes will be required for pit stability design and 
hydrogeology measurement for a total of 20,000 metres.

The core will need to be logged for both the lithological and geomechanic parameters. 
Sampling 
testing  will  be  needed,  plus  some 
geometallurgical  testing.  It  is  estimated  that  about  12,000  metres  of  core  will  require 
assaying,  for  2400  Davis  tube  testing  and  about  5000  assays.  Subsequent  of  the 
program, resource and block model will require to be recalculated. 
 
Testing for the production of high purity vanadium chemical will require a complete pilot 
plant testing, including magnetite beneficiation on 350 tonnes of material, alkali roasting 
and  hydrometallurgical  testing  as  recommended  and  supervised  by  a  qualified 
metallurgist or process engineer. Planning of such testing is complex and will need to be 
prepared  during  the  drilling  program.  Some  bench-scale  metallurgical  testing  shall  be 
initiated in this regard. Finally, an update of the former environmental base-line study is 
expected as needed. 
 
Budget for phase 2 is as follow, not including VanadiumCorp corporative cost:

The  author  considers  the  budgets  and  targets  presented  in  the  above  recommended 
program  to  be  realistic  and  legitimate,  and,  if  properly  managed,  they  will  provide  a 
reasonable chance of upgrading the category of the resource, notwithstanding the risks

at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi.
3.  I am a member of the Ordre des Géologues du Québec, #521. 
4.  I have worked as a geologist for 30 years since my graduation from university. 
5.  I have been involved as project manager regarding the work conducted on the 
current deposit since 1997 with various past owners, including being McKenzie-
Bay  Resources  representative  during  the  competion  of  the  now-obsolete  SNC-
Lavallin feasibility on the Lac Doré. I have also been involved in numerous other 
vanadium or iron-titanium projects located in Québec, and overall in more than 
1300  different  exploration  projects  across  the  world.  I  have  also  directed  a 
commercial mineralogy and mineralurgy testing facility for 20 years.
6.  I have read the definition of "qualified person" set out in National Instrument 43-
101  ("NI-43-101")  and  certify  that  by  reason  of  my  education,  affiliation  with  a

I have been practicing the profession of geologist on an ongoing basis since May 1985 
From  1985  to  1994  the  practice  of  my  profession  was  mainly  oriented  towards 
exploration. From 1994 to 1999, I worked primarily in the field of mining. Since 1999, I 
have  been  working  predominantly  in  the  evaluation  of  resources,  reserves  and 
geostatistics. 
I am a member of the Order of Geologists of Québec (#226); 
I have read the definition of “qualified person” set out in Regulation 43-101/NI43-101 
and certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional association 
(as  defined  in  Regulation  43-101)  and  past  relevant  work  experience,  I  fulfill  the 
requirements to be a “qualified person” for the purposes of Regulation 43-101. 
I am responsible for the preparation of Section 14 and co-author of sections 1 and 25 
to 27 of the report titled “The Lac Doré Vanadium Project: First Resources Estimate 
(according  to  National  Instrument  43-101  and  Form  43-101F1)”  (the  “Technical 
Report”), effective date of April 10, 2015 and revised on May 21, 2015, prepared for 
VanadiumCorp Resource inc. 
I had no prior involvement with the property that is the subject of the Technical Report. 
I did not visit the property. 
I  am  not  aware  of  any  material  fact  or  material  change  with  respect  to  the  subject 
matter  of  the  Technical  Report  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  Technical  Report,  the 
omission to disclose which would make the Technical Report misleading. 
I am independent of the owners of the lands covered by this report within the meaning 
of  section  1.5  of  National  Instrument  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral 
Properties (“NI 43-101”). 
I have read the NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and hereby certify that this report was 
prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1. The report gives a true 
picture of the state of scientific and technical knowledge as of April 10, 2015.
Dated May 21, 2015
