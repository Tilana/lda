</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The national report of Brazil was presented by the Minister of Human Rights, Maria 
do Ros&#225;rio Nunes. In her introductory statement, the Minister emphasized that, for Brazil, 
the universal periodic review is a mechanism to foster cooperation and constructive 
dialogue on human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Ms. Nunes continued by adding that the protection and promotion of human rights 
are irrevocably enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution and highlighted the Brazilian 
practice of consultative process, involving civil society participation in policy design, 
through national conferences, councils and other collective bodies. 
</p>
<p>7. Ms. Nunes mentioned that the Brazilian development project, which integrates 
economic growth and social inclusion, and guarantees the indivisibility of human rights. 
Brazil has accomplished almost all the Millennium Development Goals, and more than 28 
million citizens have overcome poverty in recent years. 
</p>
<p>8. The Minister drew attention to President Rousseff&#8217;s plan &#8220;Brasil sem Mis&#233;ria&#8221; 
(&#8220;Brazil Without Extreme Poverty&#8221;), which aims at eradicating extreme poverty by 2014, 
thereby rescuing 16 million people from this state. She explained that the Plan builds upon 
the &#8220;Bolsa Fam&#237;lia&#8221; programme, a conditional cash transfer programme, and also innovates </p>


<p>with the &#8220;Active Search&#8221; strategy, which seeks to identify and integrate the most vulnerable 
sectors of society into education, health, housing and other policies. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Nunes added that, despite the global financial and economic crisis, Brazil enjoys 
full employment, and that around 2.<footnote name="4">8. In this context, Mr. Luciano Athayde Chaves, representative of the National Council 
of Justice, spoke about the Collective Mobilization for Prison Reviews, based on three 
pillars: improving the effectiveness of criminal justice, guaranteeing due process of law and 
promoting social re-integration. 
</footnote> million formal jobs have been created since 2011. 
</p>
<p>10. The Minister highlighted other concrete measures, such as the strengthening of the 
goals of the 2008 National Plan for the Eradication of Slave Labor, through the approval of 
a Constitutional Amendment. She mentioned that the right to food had also gained 
constitutional status in 2010, further strengthening policies that ensure the provision of food 
to vulnerable groups and foster food production and family farming. 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, she continued, two strategies are under way to ensure adequate housing: 
the urbanization of slums and the provision of subsidies for the acquisition of homes by 
low-income populations. The latter, called &#8220;My House, My Life&#8221;, includes investments of 
US$ 63 billion and will benefit 2 million families. 
</p>
<p>12. Turning to the area of respect for diversity and combating stigma, Ms. Nunes 
pointed out that Brazil has a vast array of measures covering gender equality, lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people&#8217;s rights, elimination of racism, religious freedom, 
protection of human rights defenders, the rights of indigenous, Quilombola and Roma 
communities, access to justice, the dignity of persons deprived of liberty, the rights of 
migrants, and the protection of children, older persons and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>13. The Minister remarked that, for the first time, Brazil has a woman president, and the 
number of women in ministerial and other key positions is unprecedented. However, she 
stated that gender equality remains a challenge, though Brazil is addressing the issue 
through the Ministry for Women's Policies and, particularly, through the emphasis accorded 
to the implementation of the Maria da Penha Act, which focuses on violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>14. Furthermore, the Minister stated that the establishment of the Truth Commission 
will play a key role in the realization of the right to memory and truth and that the Access to 
Information Act makes secrecy an exception and forbids the confidentiality of documents 
on human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>15. It was recalled that the Supreme Federal Court recently issued landmark decisions. It 
recognized the right of the Patax&#243; H&#227;-H&#227;-H&#227;es to their traditional land and reaffirmed the 
possibility of establishing quotas for people of African descent in public universities. In 
addition, the Executive and Legislative branches have cooperated for the approval of the 
National System for Prevention of Torture and the creation of a national human rights 
institution. 
</p>
<p>16. The Minister concluded by emphasizing that the country shows that human rights 
and development are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Brazil is a country that 
grows, includes and protects, with full respect for human rights.

<p>81. The Czech Republic welcomed the establishment of a Truth Commission and hoped 
that it would facilitate the reconciliation process. It appreciated the policy enabling citizens&#8217; 
access information on the human rights situation. It encouraged Brazil to implement the 
programme to protect human rights defenders. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Denmark voiced concerns about the independence of the projected National 
Preventive Mechanism against torture. It commended efforts to combat unlawful killings 
but expressed concern about threats against judges. Denmark enquired about measures to 
address impunity. Denmark made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Ecuador commended the achievements of Brazil on discrimination, equal 
opportunities, poverty reduction, and effective inclusion of the disabled. It also highlighted 
the participation of women in political life. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Ms. Nunes reiterated that the main goal of Brazil was to take 16 million Brazilians 
out of extreme poverty by 2014, particularly children and adolescents, through the &#8220;Brazil 
Without Extreme Poverty&#8221; Plan, which is closely monitored by President Rousseff. 
</p>
<p>85. In response to questions on extrajudicial executions, the National Secretary of Public 
Security, Regina Miki, acknowledged the challenges related to death squads, which are still 
operating in some federal states. Federal authorities and the Ministry of Justice have been 
active in combating these groups, and have managed to impose serious setbacks on their 
illegal activities. Whenever investigations are in place, police or other officers suspected of 
belonging to death squads are immediately removed from duty and, if proven guilty, are 
expelled from the force and criminally prosecuted. Ms. Miki gave positive examples of 
operations: the dismantlement of a single death squad in Pernambuco, resulting in a 20 per 
cent reduction in the state homicide rate; and the arrest of 30 police officers in Goi&#225;s, and 
45 in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>

<p>The State, he said, is obliged to provide free legal assistance whenever necessary. The 
Judiciary has decided to simplify the process for criminal cases involving women in 
vulnerable situations or older persons. 
</p>
<p>87. Congressman Domingos Dutra, President of the Human Rights Commission of the 
House of Representatives, presented significant progress in the legislative sphere, 
mentioning examples such as the law creating the National Truth Commission; the law 
ensuring Access to Information; and Draft Constitution Amendment 438, on the 
expropriation of properties where slave labour is practised. He expressed commitment to 
the approval of the bill creating the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, the 
bill for the protection of human rights defenders and the bill prohibiting corporal 
punishment of children and adolescents. 
</p>
<p>88. The International Advisor of the Ministry for Promotion of Racial Equality, Magali 
Naves, highlighted successful policies for the promotion of racial equality. The 2010 
Census, she noted, recorded an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as 
black, as well as an improvement in their education and income figures. However, due to 
the persistence of racial inequality, more efforts are required to foster their social inclusion. 
In 2010 the Federal Government approved the Racial Equality Statute, which resulted in 
guidelines and 20 specific programmes to combat racism in several government areas for 
the four years to come, and the National System for Racial Equality Promotion, aimed at 
decentralizing policies and taking them to the local level. An intergovernmental forum and 
a national ombudsman have also been established. 
</p>
<p>89. Concerning trafficking in persons, the Special Advisor to the Minister of Justice, 
Marcelo Veiga, presented the National Policy to Combat Human Trafficking, coordinated 
by the Ministry of Justice in cooperation with civil society. The policy gave rise to the first 
National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, which has been in place since 2007. The Plan 
includes measures to combat sexual exploitation, slave labour and the abuse of women and 
children. The delegate stated that in the last five years, Brazil had established 15 centers to 
combat human trafficking in different federal states and to provide victims with free legal, 
psychological and social assistance. The Government is currently finalizing the Second 
National Plan of Action against trafficking in persons, which has already been widely 
discussed with civil society and international organizations, and includes specific action in 
borders and other key areas. 
</p>
<p>90. Egypt recognized the accession by Brazil to most international conventions and 
standing invitation to special procedures. Egypt encouraged Brazil to guarantee the rights of 
indigenous peoples and to cooperate with international mechanisms vis-&#224;-vis human rights 
defenders. It made four recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Estonia commended the ratification by Brazil of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and both protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the participation of women in political life. Estonia encouraged Brazil 
to address domestic violence, maternal mortality rates, the freedom of the press and the 
independence of the judiciary. Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. Finland welcomed the efforts of Brazil to promote the rights of LGBT persons, and 
noted that the ruling of the Brazilian Supreme Court concerning the constitutionality of 
same-sex unions was considered very important.  It noted that continued reports on 
homophobic crimes and violence indicate that additional measures are needed and asked 
what legislative measures and steps were being taken to combat these crimes. Finland made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. France welcomed the ratification by Brazil of the main human rights instruments, 
the standing invitation to special procedures, its fight against poverty, and the establishment </p>


<p>of the Truth Commission. It voiced concern about the level of maternal mortality. France 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Germany welcomed the progress made by Brazil in the protection of human rights 
activists and its commitment to the &#8220;Blue Group&#8221; but voiced particular concern about 
indigenous people not benefiting from the economic progress. Germany made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>95. Greece expressed satisfaction at the fact that Brazil has made a successful effort to 
implement most recommendations submitted during the first cycle. While referring to 
efforts to improve the situation in detention facilities, it asked about other intended 
measures. It asked the delegation to provide more information on the reduced number of 
women in Congress. Greece made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. Guatemala commended the methodology in the drafting of its national report. It 
encouraged Brazil to establish a national human rights council in accordance with the Paris 
Principles. Guatemala asked Brazil about the normative content of the indigenous people&#8217;s 
statute which had been up for adoption in Parliament since 2009 and the legal definition of 
rural violence. Guatemala made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>97. The Holy See appreciated the efforts by Brazil in areas such as democratic 
governance, security, economy, child labour and access to education. It acknowledged 
challenges in poverty, health, education, street children and child workers.  It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>98. Honduras commended the progress made by Brazil on equal opportunities and noted 
the number of women in the cabinet. It expressed the need to examine the observations of 
the Committee on the Elimination Discrimination against Women vis-&#224;-vis the gender wage 
gap, and the segregation of indigenous and Afro-descendant women in the workplace; as 
well as observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 
illiteracy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>99. Hungary commended Brazil on fulfilling nearly all the Millennium Development 
Goals, the reduction of poverty and social inequality and the promotion of the autonomy of 
persons with disabilities. While welcoming efforts to improve prison conditions, it noted 
that some prisons face overcrowding and do not meet adequate medical care standards.  
Hungary noted that the lack of a concerted approach has delayed improvements in 
combating various forms of sexual exploitation. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>104. Italy welcomed the progress of Brazil in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals. It asked about measures to prevent violence in detention centres for juvenile

recommendation.

</p>

and protection of human rights. It requested information on the implementation challenges 
of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Lebanon made one 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>107. Malaysia noted efforts to strengthen the legislative and institutional human rights 
framework, particularly to improve its national human rights programme. It congratulated 
Brazil for strengthening its legislative and institutional framework, combating poverty and 
reducing inequality and discrimination. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>108. Ms. Nunes highlighted the recognition of same-sex stable unions as family units by 
the Supreme Federal Court and the National Plan for Promotion of LGBT Citizenship and 
Human Rights. The Minister, while reaffirming the commitment of Brazil to combating 
homophobic crimes and violence, acknowledged that the challenges are still significant. 
</p>
<p>109. The Minister considered positively the establishment of a National Human Rights 
Institution and mentioned that a congressional bill to adapt the National Council on the 
Rights of the Human Being to the Paris Principles is under discussion. At the same time, 
Brazil already has in place various National Councils on specific human rights issues with 
the participation of civil society. 
</p>
<p>110. In response to comments on poverty eradication, Ms. Nunes explained the initiative 
&#8220;Brasil Carinhoso&#8221; (&#8220;Caring Brazil&#8221;), established within the &#8220;Brazil Without Extreme 
</p>
<p>Poverty&#8221; Programme, aimed at providing benefits for children up to six years old. This will 
reach 2 million Brazilians, extending &#8220;Bolsa fam&#237;lia&#8221;, day-care services, health services and 
distribution of free medicines to them, among other benefits. 
</p>

<p>Internationally, she added, Brazil is advancing the rights of older persons within the United 
Nations system and the Organization of American States. 
</p>
<p>114. Ms. Nunes stated that Brazilian National development policies promote human 
rights, including those of indigenous and Quilombola populations. She acknowledged that 
human rights must enjoy special attention in the context of events such as the FIFA World 
Cup and the Olympic Games, to guarantee that sporting events will be held in full 
compliance with human rights and for the benefit of all Brazilians. She also said that, in 
order to guarantee adequate housing, including in the preparation of those events, the 
Ministry of Cities is developing a national legal framework for urban dislocations, the draft 
of which is available on the Internet for civil society participation. 
</p>
<p>115. With regard to indigenous peoples, Ms. Nunes said that the current development 
projects contribute not only to economic growth, but also to the creation of clean energy, 
which accounts for a large part of the country&#8217;s supply. Moreover, infrastructure creates 
regional and local benefits. 
</p>
<p>116. On the Truth Commission, the Minister clarified that it is not a Government entity, 
but rather a State institution and explained that it will provide answers on enforced 
disappearances, homicides, kidnappings and other crimes. Its legacy will strengthen 
democracy, which, together with human rights, has been a permanent beacon for Brazil for 
the past 28 years. 
</p>
<p>117. Ms. Nunes&#8217; final remarks presented Brazilian participation in the universal periodic 
review as a great contribution to human rights in the country &#8211; an ongoing exercise which 
involves the entire Brazilian Government. The Ministry of Human Rights will be attentive 
to the best ways to follow up on and monitor the implementation of the accepted 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>118. Ms. Nunes concluded that, despite the challenges ahead, Brazil is on the right track 
for the effective realization of human rights in the lives of all Brazilians.
