Dear Ms Hewitt 
 
RE: 
 
We refer to the ASX price and volume query letter received from you on 23 August 2016. Set 
out below are the Company’s responses to your questions (using the same numbered points 
contained in your letter):
Response to ASX Price and Volume Query
1.  Yes
2.  a)  Yes,  the  Company  is  relying  on  Listing  Rule  3.1A,  as  the  information  concerns 
incomplete  negotiations  and  the  information  is  insufficiently  definite  to  warrant 
disclosure.
b)  No,  due  to  the  above,  the  Company  does  not  believe  an  announcement  can  be 
made immediately.
c) The Company has non-binding agreements in place with third parties concerning 
the  Company’s  100%  owned  Kvanefjeld  Project,  and  potential  commercial 
involvement.  Due  diligence  in  relation  to  the  non-binding  agreements  is  ongoing, 
and  of  considerable  breadth  owing  the  jurisdictions  to  which  the  project  is 
associated (Greenland, Denmark, Australia).
At  this  point  in  time,  the  outcome  of  the  due  diligence  processes,  associated 
timelines,  or  the  nature  of  any  formal  agreements  remains  uncertain.  As  a  result, 
there is no level of certainty that any binding agreements will be reached.
The  Company  outlined  in  the  December  2015  Quarterly  Report,  and  2015  Annual 
Report that with the permitting process for Kvanefjeld underway, an increased focus 
would  be  placed  on  commercial  development,  and  progressing  strategic  partner 
relationships. Non-binding agreements and associated due diligence are in-line with 
this stated objective.

diligence  outcomes,  negotiations  with  third  parties,  and  the  establishment  of  any 
formal, or binding agreements.

Listing Rule 3.1

Dear Mr Guy
Greenland Minerals and Energy Limited (“the Entity”)
PRICE AND VOLUME QUERY 
 
We have noted a change in the price of the Entity’s securities from a close of 3.6 cents on 22 August 2016 to 
an intra-day high of 4.3 cents today. We have also noted an increase in the volume of trading in the Entity’s 
securities over this period.
In  light  of  the  price  change  and  increase  in  volume,  ASX  asks  you  to  respond  separately  to  each  of  the 
following questions:
1.
Is the Entity aware of any information concerning it that has not been announced to the market which, 
if known by some in the market, could explain the recent trading in its securities?
2.
If the answer to question 1 is “yes”:
a.
Is the Entity relying on Listing Rule 3.1A not to announce that information under Listing Rule 3.1?
Please  note  that  the  recent  trading  in  the  Entity’s  securities  would  suggest  to  ASX  that  such 
information may have ceased to be confidential and therefore the Entity may no longer be able 
to rely on Listing Rule 3.1A. Accordingly, if the answer to this question is “yes”, you need to contact 
us immediately to discuss the situation.
b.  Can an announcement be made immediately?
Please note, if the answer to this question is “no”, you need to contact us immediately to discuss 
requesting a trading halt (see below).
c.
If  an  announcement  cannot  be  made  immediately,  why  not  and  when  is  it  expected  that  an 
announcemant will be made?
3.
If the answer to question 1 is “no”, is there any other explanation that the Entity may have for the 
recent trading in its securities?
4.
Please confirm that the Entity is in compliance with the Listing Rules and, in particular, Listing Rule 3.1.

When and where to send your response
This request is made under, and in accordance with, Listing Rule 18.7. Your response is required as soon as 
reasonably possible and, in any event, by not later than 12pm WST on Tuesday, 23 August 2016.  If we do 
not have your response by then, ASX will have no choice but to consider suspending trading in the Entity’s 
securities under Listing Rule 17.3.
You should note that if the information requested by this letter is information required to be given to ASX 
under Listing Rule 3.1 and it does not fall within the exceptions mentioned in Listing Rule 3.1A, the Entity’s 
obligation is to disclose the  information “immediately”. This may  require the information to be  disclosed 
before the deadline set out in the previous paragraph.
ASX reserves the right to release a copy of this letter and your response on the ASX Market Announcements 
Platform under Listing Rule 18.7A. Accordingly, your response should be in a form suitable for release to the 
market.
Your  response  should  be  sent  to  me  by  e-mail  to  tradinghaltsperth@asx.com.au.  It  should  not  be  sent 
directly to the ASX Market Announcements Office. This is to allow me to review your response to confirm 
that  it  is  in  a  form  appropriate  for  release  to  the  market,  before  it  is  published  on  the  ASX  Market 
Announcements Platform.
Listing Rule 3.1
Listing  Rule 3.1  requires  a  listed  entity  to  give  ASX  immediately  any  information  concerning  it  that  a 
reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity’s securities. 
Exceptions to this requirement are set out in Listing Rule 3.1A.
The obligation of the Entity to disclose information under Listing Rules 3.1 and 3.1A is not confined to, nor is 
it necessarily satisfied by, answering the questions set out in this letter.
In responding to this letter, you should have regard to the Entity’s obligations under Listing Rules 3.1 and 
3.1A and also to Guidance Note 8 Continuous Disclosure: Listing Rules 3.1 – 3.1B.
Trading halt
If you are unable to respond to this letter by the time specified above, or if the answer to question 1 is “yes” 
and an announcement cannot be made immediately, you should discuss with us whether it is appropriate to 
request a trading halt in the Entity’s securities under Listing Rule 17.1.
If you wish a trading halt, you must tell us:
the reasons for the trading halt;
how long you want the trading halt to last;
the event you expect to happen that will end the trading halt;
that you are not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be granted; and
any other information necessary to inform the market about the trading halt, or that we ask for.
