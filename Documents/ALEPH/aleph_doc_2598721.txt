MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2016
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  of  Getty  Copper  Inc.  (the 
“Company”)  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  2016  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  June  30,  2016  financial 
statements and the related notes which have been prepared adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).  
All dollar amounts in this Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) are stated in Canadian dollars.  The effective 
date of this report is date of filing.   
 
 
Forward Looking Statements 
 
This document may contain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking 
statements”) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.  All statements other than statements of historical fact 
are  forward-looking  statements.  Such  forward-looking  statements  include  any  projections  or  estimates  made  by  the 
Company  and  the  Company’s  management  in  connection  with  the  Company’s  business  operations.  Forward-looking 
statements  relate  to  future  events  or  our  future  financial  performance.  In  some  cases  you  can  identify  forward-looking 
statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, 
“potential” or “continue” or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. Although the Company believes 
the expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements should 
not be in any way construed as guarantees of the ultimate size, quality or commercial feasibility of the Company’s mineral 
exploration projects or of the Company's future performance. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A speak only as of 
the date of this MD&A or as of the date specified in such statement.
Such  statements  are  based  on  a  number  of  assumptions  that  may  prove  to  be  incorrect,  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
assumptions about the following: the availability of financing for the Company’s exploration and development activities; 
operating and exploration costs; the Company’s ability to retain and attract skilled staff; timing of the receipt of regulatory 
and governmental approvals for exploration projects and other operations; market competition; and general business and 
economic conditions.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those 
contemplated  in  such  forward-looking  statements.  Risk  factors  that  could  cause  the  Company's  actual  results  and 
performance to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements include adverse market prices for metals, the 
conclusions of detailed feasibility and technical analyses, lower than expected grades and quantities of resources, mining 
rates and metal recovery rates and the fact that necessary capital may not be available to the Company on terms acceptable 
to  it  or  at  all.  The  need  for  compliance  with  extensive  environmental  and  socio-economic  rules  and  practices  and  the 
requirement for the Company to obtain government permitting can cause a delay or even abandonment of a mineral project. 
The Company is subject to the specific risks inherent in the mining business as well as general economic and business 
conditions.  See  the  heading  “Risk  Factors”  in  the  Company’s  annual  information  form  filed  at  www.sedar.com  for 
additional information on risks and uncertainties relating to the Company’s forward-looking statements.
There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements referenced herein will prove to be accurate, as actual results and 
future  events  could  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such  statements.  Also,  many  of  the  risk  and  uncertainty 
factors are beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-
looking statements contained in this MD&A. All forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by this cautionary 
statement. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements 
whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Please consult the 
Company’s public filings at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov for more detailed information concerning these matters.

Overall Performance 
 
The Company is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. Since 1993, the Company has 
been focusing on exploration, when funds permit, on parts of its approximately 269 km2 (104 miles2) mineral properties in 
Highland  Valley,  British  Columbia,  comprised  primarily  of  the  Getty  North,  Getty  South  and  satellite  properties 
(collectively,  the  “Getty  Copper  Project”).    The  Getty  Copper  Project  is  immediately  adjacent  to  the  large  porphyry 
copper mining and milling operations of Highland Valley Copper. 
 
Over  the  past  year  a  compilation  of  historic  data  was  conducted  over  the  Getty  Copper  Property.  The  compilation  was 
aimed at the expansion of known target areas, along with identifying new areas of interest.  
 
In June of 2015, a detailed property wide airborne magnetic survey was undertaken to further aid with this compilation. As 
a result of this, a number of target areas have been identified, with ground follow up commencing in mid-September.  
 
During the 2015 3rd quarter, the review of the 2015 aeromagnetic data in conjunction with the historic data compilation 
yielded a number of targets of interest on the Getty Property.  
 
Subsequently  a  detailed  30  kilometer  induced  polarization  program  is  permitted  and  scheduled  to  commence  in  late 
November, to follow up on some of the high priority areas.  
 
In late November 2015, 15 line kilometers of deep induced polarization surveying was conducted expanding on the historic 
Titan 24 Survey.  The survey was designed to investigate a number of features identified in the regional compilation and 
the 2015 detailed airborne magnetic survey proximal to the Getty North and Getty West areas.    
 
During the period the Company entered into an agreement with Robak Industries Ltd., a company owned and controlled by 
John Lepinski a company director, whereby the Getty South property in which each of the Company and Robak owns a 
50%  interest,  will  be  unitized  with  the  balance  of  the  Company’s  property  in  the  Highland  Valley  adjacent  to  Teck 
Resources Inc., Highland Valley Copper mine and a former copper producer, Bethlehem Copper.
The parties had been in favour of forming a holding company, Getty Mineral Holdings Ltd., to hold the unitized property 
and the Company would hold 82% of the shares and Robak 18% of the shares.  All claims remain subject to 1½% net 
smelter return royalty in favour of Robak Industries Ltd.   Subsequently it was determined to form a joint venture with the 
same  terms  as  stated  in  the  unitization  agreement.        The  joint  venture  terms  include  establishment  of  a  management 
committee,  provisions  governing  the  operation  of  the  joint  venture,  operator  duties  and  responsibilities,  exploration 
programs and budgets, possible construction decisions, potential third party agreements, property details, information and 
data  sharing,  preparation  of  technical  report,  financing  arrangements  an  Robak’s  18%  carried  interest  in  the  unitized 
property.    Also  included in  the  joint  venture  are  provisions  for  mine  financing, mine  operation,  insurance, taxation and 
related matters.
The ratio was agreed upon by using the reserve calculations on the Company’s property and the portion of such reserves 
located on the Getty South deposit in relation to the reserves on the balance of the property based on the Pre-Feasibility 
technical report filed on SEDAR on May 25, 2010.   The Joint Venture is subject to regulatory approval.
The Company believes that unitizing the property will be beneficial to its potential development.
The above transaction is subject to certain TSX Venture Exchange approvals.   
 
At present the Company is currently seeking parties to finance the Company for its minimum requirements and advance the 
Getty  Copper  Project  to  the  next  phase.    However,  there  can  be  no  assurances  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  raise

additional financing on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all.  If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it will 
need to curtail operations and the Company may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 
Result of Operations  
 
Due to reduced commodity prices and a lack of working capital, nominal exploration work was carried out by the Company 
between  1998  and  2003.  Consequently  at  the  years  ended  December  31,  2001  to  December  31,  2003  the  financial 
statements were adjusted to reflect a provision for impairment of mineral properties.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $15,831 and working capital deficit of $606,394 compared to $6,751 cash and 
working capital deficit $535,275 at March 31, 2016.  The net change in cash and working capital during the three months 
ended June 30, 2016 is due to payment and accruals of administrative expenses.   
  
Current payable and long term liabilities totalled $1,247,876 at June 30, 2016.   The Company’s cash as at June 30, 2016 is 
insufficient to pay its current liabilities.
During the year ending December 31, 2015, the Company completed a private non-brokered private placement offering 
of 3,466,668 common shares at a price of $0.075 per Share for gross proceeds of $260,000.   2,773,333 of the Shares 
issued are designated as flow-through common shares.  Approximately 75% of the private placement was purchases 
by  insiders  of  the  Corporation.    All  securities  issued  in  connection  with  the  Private  Placement  were  subject  to  a 
statutory hold period which expired on October 4, 2015.  Proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to fund 
Getty’s exploration programs on its Getty Copper project adjacent to the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia. 
 
The Company’s total assets during the six months ending June 30, 2016 totalled $5,463,755, a decrease of $22,935 from 
June 30, 2015, is due the private placement completed during June 2015 and the spending of the flow through funds to 
deferred  exploration.    During  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  2016,  the  Company’s  liabilities  increased  by  $383,754 
compared to the six months ending June 30, 2015.  The increase in liabilities is a result of an increase in payables due to 
administrative expenses and accrued interest.    The Company has no significant source of working capital other than 
funds raised through private placements, exercising of warrants and Incentive Stock Options.   
 
The loss from operations for the six months ending June 30, 2016 decreased by $22,895 over the loss reported at June 30, 
2015.  The increase can be attributed to recognizing $73,458 in stock option compensation for the period ending June 30, 
2016 and by the following expense comparisons: a decrease of $50,000 Consulting and a decrease of $48,051 Professional 
fees.  Operation expenditures for the six months ending June 30, 2016 decreased to $224,246 compared to $247,144 at June 
30, 2015.    Professional fees for the six months ending June, 2016 $78,156 (2015 - $126,207) which include legal fees 
of $77,170 (2015 - $119,951), $986 (2015 - $6,256) in accounting fees.  Consulting fees for the six months ending 
June 30, 2016, $Nil (2015 – $50,000).

Liquidity 
 
The  Company  has  no  operating  revenues  and  therefore  must  utilize  its  current  cash  reserves  and  other  financing 
transactions to maintain its capacity to meet ongoing discretionary and committed exploration and operating activities.   
 
The Company has no producing properties at this time  and receives no revenues.  All of the Company’s properties are 
prefeasibility stage  projects  (Getty  North  and  Getty  South)  and/or exploration projects,  and there  is  no  assurance  that  a 
commercially viable ore deposit exists in any such properties. The Getty North and Getty South deposits were the subject 
of a 2010 Pre-Feasibility Study, however until further exploration work and a comprehensive evaluation based upon unit 
costs, grades, tonnages, recoveries, and other technical and economic factors are evaluated, no conclusion about current 
economic feasibility of these projects is possible.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2016
Financing  for  the  Company’s  operations  has historically  been  funded  primarily  from  private  placements  and  to a  lesser 
extent the exercise of share purchase warrants and share purchase options. The Company is currently pursuing financing 
opportunities, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional financing on terms that are 
acceptable  to  it,  or  at  all;  nor  can  there  be  any  assurance  that  any  of  the  outstanding  share  purchase  warrants  or  stock 
options of the Company will be exercised.  If the Company is unable to raise additional capital it will need to curtail its 
operations and the Company may be materially adversely affected.
As of June 30, 2016, and to the date of this MD&A, the cash resources of the Company are held with a Canadian bank.
The Company owns land and a small office and storage building in Logan Lake, British Columbia, which was encumbered by a 
first mortgage in the amount of $80,000 as of October 1, 2012 at a 6% interest per annum, amortized over 10 years.
The Company’s use of cash at present occurs, and in the future is expected to occur, principally in two areas, namely, funding of 
its general and administrative expenditures and funding of its investment activities. Those investing activities include the cash 
components of the cost of exploring and developing the Getty Property. 
 
The Company has funds available of $15,831 as of June 30, 2016.  The Company has an administrative expenditures rate of 
approximately $17,000 per month, excluding legal fees.  
 
 
 Financial Instruments 
 
The  Company  keeps  its  financial  instruments  denominated  in  Canadian  dollars  and  does  not  engage  in  any  hedging 
operations  with  respect  to  currency  or  in-situ  minerals.  Funds  which  are  currently  excess  to  the  Company’s  needs  are 
invested in government of Canada or like debt obligations and other short term near cash investments pending the need for 
the funds. 
 
Capital Resources 
 
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it based on available funds in order to support the 
acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  mineral  properties.    The  Board  of  Directors  does  not  establish  quantitative 
return on capital criteria for management but rather relies on the expertise of the Company's management to sustain future 
development  of  the  business.    The  Company  defines  capital  to  include  its  working  capital  position  and  capital  stock, 
warrant, and option components of its shareholders' equity.
The  Company  manages  its  capital  structure  in  a  manner  that  provides  sufficient  funding  for  mine  development  and 
operational activities.  Funds are primarily secured through a combination of equity capital raised by way of issuing equity 
instruments  and  external  debt.    In  order  to  maintain  or  adjust  the  capital  structure,  the  Company  may  attempt  to  raise 
additional financing through the issuance of new equity instruments, the exercise of outstanding common share purchase 
warrants and stock options.  Management reviews its capital management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that 
this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. 
 
There were no changes in the Company's approach to capital management during six months ending  June 30, 2016.  The 
Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
JUNE 30, 2016
Outlook 
 
The Company continues its efforts to advance the status of its mineral properties.  Although the 2010 Pre-Feasibility Study 
has accorded probable reserve status to a portion of the known resources, it is uncertain whether the Company currently has 
potentially economically recoverable reserves as the 2010 estimates must be considered in need of updating and further 
refinement. It is unclear whether the Company will be able to obtain the necessary financing to complete the exploration 
and commercial development of its properties.  The Company believes that it may be able to economically develop the 
Getty North and Getty South deposits on its mineral properties depending on continuing strength in the copper market and 
future financing conditions which are currently quite weak.  The ability to raise funds to develop its properties may be 
challenging in light of current metal prices and market conditions for financing junior exploration companies. However, 
International Financial Reporting Standards require that development costs related to mineral properties be written down 
for impairment unless there is persuasive evidence that impairment has not occurred.
The  Company  advises  that  the  previous  litigation  it  was  involved  in  no  longer  impacts  the  levels  of  performance  or 
achievements. 
 
The Company’s management remains committed to the advancement of the Company’s Highland Valley mineral claims, 
subject to a positive feasibility study, production permitting and financing.
Related Party Transactions
Except as disclosed in this report there were no related party transactions. During the six months ending June 30, 2016, 
Cinnamon Jang Willoughby, a professional accounting firm to which director and CFO Donald Willoughby is associated,
