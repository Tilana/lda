<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association carried out an official visit to Rwanda from 20 to 27 January 2014 at the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the Government. The aim of the visit was to examine the state of promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of the rights under his mandate.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur commends Rwanda for being the first country in Africa to 
</p>
<p>extend an invitation to him.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited the cities of Kigali and Huye. In Kigali, he met with 
</p>
<p>the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Internal Security, the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Local Government, the Minister of Public Service and Labour, the Minister of Trade and 
</p>
<p>Industry, the Minister of the East African Community, the Permanent Secretary of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the Inspector General of the Rwanda National Police. He 
</p>
<p>also met the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Prosecutor General, the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, and the Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Unity, 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and Fight against Genocide of the Chamber of Deputies, and its members. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also had meetings with the National Unity and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission, the Director of the Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration, the 
</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer of the Rwanda Governance Board, and representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Rwanda Human Rights Commission and the Private Sector Federation. He further met with 
</p>
<p>the representatives of the United Nations country team and diplomatic missions. In Huye, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur met the Governor of the South Province and the Mayor of Huye. In 
</p>
<p>both cities, he met with representatives of political parties and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations (NGOs). 
</p>
<p>4. He thanks the Government for its exemplary cooperation before and during the visit. 
</p>
<p>In addition, he expresses his gratitude for the support received from the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator and his office, the United Nations country team, and from the Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Rwanda.  
</p>
<p>5. In carrying out his visit, the Special Rapporteur was guided by several international 
</p>
<p>legal standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>articles 21 and 22 in particular; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, especially article 8. Rwanda ratified both Conventions without reservations 
</p>
<p>on 16 April 1975. He was also guided by articles 10 and 11 of the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur considers the invitation, support and facilitation of the visit 
</p>
<p>as a sign of the willingness of Rwanda to continue to open up to constructive dialogue. He 
</p>
<p>therefore presents his findings and offers his recommendations in a spirit of constructive 
</p>
<p>engagement, supporting the efforts of Rwanda towards the realization of the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and the strengthening of its democratic 
</p>
<p>system.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical and political background 
</b></p>
<p>7. For nearly 80 years, the colonial administration manipulated ethnic identities and 
</p>
<p>institutionalized them in government organs.1 Independence from Belgium in 1962 came in 
</p>
<p>a context of fierce ethnic tensions. Tutsi domination ended and people identified as Hutu 
</p>
<p>ruled the country until the 1994 genocide. That period was marked by rising ethnic conflict 
</p>
<p>and violence that forced hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to seek shelter, primarily in 
</p>
<p>neighbouring countries.2 In 1987, Rwandans exiled in Uganda, mainly people identified as 
</p>
<p>Tutsis, founded the Rwandan Patriotic Front, an opposition political and military 
</p>
<p>movement. The ethnic tensions were exacerbated in the 1990s by the Front&#8217;s military 
</p>
<p>attacks on Rwanda, the deliberate State propaganda against all people identified as Tutsis in 
</p>
<p>the country and opposition members identified as Hutu, and the role of the media in 
</p>
<p>spreading unfounded rumours.  
</p>
<p>8. In 1993, the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front signed the 
</p>
<p>Arusha Peace Agreements. Later that same year, the Security Council established a 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping operation in Rwanda, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda 
</p>
<p>(UNAMIR), to support the peace process, contribute to the security of the city of Kigali, 
</p>
<p>and provide humanitarian assistance.3 Concerns over the proliferation of arms, the activities 
</p>
<p>of the Interahamwe militia, killings and increased ethnic tension continued throughout the 
</p>
<p>early months of 1994. On 6 April 1994, the deaths of the Presidents of Burundi and 
</p>
<p>Rwanda in a plane crash caused by a rocket attack triggered political massacres and 
</p>
<p>critically deteriorated the ethnic conflict. During the approximately 100-day-long genocide 
</p>
<p>in Rwanda, militia, armed forces and civilians killed 800,000 people in some of the most 
</p>
<p>horrific brutality humankind had seen in the twentieth century. &#8220;Rwandans killed 
</p>
<p>Rwandans, brutally decimating the Tutsi population of the country, but also targeting 
</p>
<p>moderate Hutus.&#8221;4 The international community failed Rwanda: neither the political will, 
</p>
<p>nor the troops were there to prevent most of the killings.5 
</p>
<p>9. On 18 July 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front gained control of Rwanda and 
</p>
<p>declared a unilateral ceasefire. On the next day, a government of national unity was sworn 
</p>
<p>in with Paul Kagame as Vice-President. In 1999, Rwanda held its first local elections, and 
</p>
<p>in 2003, its first post-genocide presidential and legislative elections. Mr. Kagame won the 
</p>
<p>presidential elections that year and was re-elected in 2010. He was still holding that 
</p>
<p>position during the official visit. 
</p>
<p>10. In the past 20 years since the genocide, Rwanda has reconstructed its social, political 
</p>
<p>and economic portfolios. It has made progress in the areas of good governance, including 
</p>
<p>rule of law and institution-building, and in ensuring stability and security. In addition, it has 
</p>
<p>steadily developed the country&#8217;s infrastructure, widened access to education and health, and 
</p>
<p>opened its doors to foreign and domestic investment. Furthermore, Rwanda has made 
</p>
<p>significant improvements in the area of housing and access to sanitation, and set agriculture

<p>and environmental protection as one of its priorities. Rwanda is also known today for its 
</p>
<p>commitment to empowering women and to gender equity.  
</p>
<p>11. However, the armed conflict that had begun in 1990 and culminated with the 
</p>
<p>genocide continues to leave its mark on the historical and geopolitical context of Rwanda. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur believes that attempts at reconstruction, reconciliation and 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights can only succeed if Rwanda calls for an honest, robust and civil 
</p>
<p>debate, hence the need for an active and unfettered civil society. He calls on the authorities 
</p>
<p>of Rwanda to take an inclusive and holistic approach to the consequences of the conflicts 
</p>
<p>and of genocide, on all sides, including making efforts to shed light on the killings of 
</p>
<p>moderate Hutus and alleged crimes committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur invites Rwanda to learn from the Truth and 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation Commission of South Africa that delved into the alleged crimes by the 
</p>
<p>African National Congress despite vociferous opposition.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework to prevent and punish the crime of 
genocide and its impact on the exercise of the rights 
to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association 
</b></p>
<p>12. In the wake of the 1994 genocide, the post-conflict Government of the Rwandan 
</p>
<p>Patriotic Front built a legal framework to prevent it from ever happening again. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur paid particular attention to the following legal provisions of the Organic 
</p>
<p>Law 01/2012/OL on instituting the Penal Code. They concern further national legal 
</p>
<p>provisions on penalizing and punishing the crime of genocide.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 116 punishes the crime of negationism and minimization of the genocide 
</p>
<p>against the Tutsis, which is defined as an action to publicly negate, minimize, justify 
</p>
<p>or approve the genocide against the Tutsis, or to hide or destroy its evidence. It gives 
</p>
<p>judges the right to dissolve an association, including political organizations, found 
</p>
<p>guilty of committing this crime. According to article 5 of Law 84/2013, to negate 
</p>
<p>genocide is an act committed in public to state that the killings of 1994 did not 
</p>
<p>amount to genocide, to deliberately misconstrue facts about the genocide, to support 
</p>
<p>a double genocide theory for Rwanda, or to say that the genocide was unplanned. 
</p>
<p>Article 6 of the Law defines the minimization of genocide as the public act of 
</p>
<p>downplaying the gravity or consequences of genocide and/or the methods through 
</p>
<p>which genocide was committed. Finally, article 7 defines justifying genocide as any 
</p>
<p>deliberate act committed in public to glorify, support and/or legitimize genocide. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 136 punishes the crime of sectarianism. Law 47/2001, in article 1, paragraph 
</p>
<p>2, defines sectarianism as &#8220;the use of any speech, written statement or action that 
</p>
<p>divides people, that is likely to spark conflicts among people, or that causes an 
</p>
<p>uprising which might degenerate into strife among people based on discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>In the case of an association, including a political party, found guilty of sectarianism 
</p>
<p>with grave consequences on the population, a court may decide under article 6 of the 
</p>
<p>Law to dissolve it and fine it up to RF 20 million (US$ 29,390). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 451 criminalizes the action of spreading false information with intent to 
</p>
<p>create a hostile international opinion against the State of Rwanda. People found 
</p>
<p>guilty of this offence face up to 10 years in prison in peacetime and life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment during wartime. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 462 makes it punishable by 20 years&#8217; imprisonment to incite others to 
</p>
<p>conspire to commit violence to undermine the established Government. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 463 defines as inciting insurrection the actions of: spreading rumours, 
</p>
<p>exciting the population against the established government, inciting or attempting to 
</p>
<p>incite citizens against each other or, attempting to alarm the population with 
</p>
<p>intention to cause trouble in the country. A person found guilty of inciting 
</p>
<p>insurrection is liable to a term of imprisonment of 10 to 15 years. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Articles 468 and 469 define a seditious group as one that, among other unspecified 
</p>
<p>objectives, aims to use violence to undermine or overthrow the established 
</p>
<p>government. These articles impose prison terms of up to 20 years for all individuals 
</p>
<p>taking part in a seditious group caught in a seditious meeting, hold liable to the same 
</p>
<p>penalty the leadership of the group, regardless of whether it was present at the 
</p>
<p>meeting, and foresee imprisonment of up to five years for anyone taking part in such 
</p>
<p>a meeting and caught in the act. In addition, article 470 punishes as an accomplice 
</p>
<p>anyone who knowingly provides help, including the meeting venue, to a seditious 
</p>
<p>group. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur notes the progress Rwanda has made in meeting the needs 
</p>
<p>of preventing acts of genocide and gross violations of human rights. However, he sees areas 
</p>
<p>for improvement, as certain legal provisions ostensibly meant to prevent genocide also 
</p>
<p>interfere with the full enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</p>
<p>association. He expresses concerns over the aforementioned provisions of Organic Law 
</p>
<p>01/2012/OL and Law 84/2013 on the crime of genocide ideology and other related offences 
</p>
<p>and Law 47/2001 on prevention, suppression and punishment of the crime of discrimination 
</p>
<p>and sectarianism. He considers them overly broad and open to abuse with a view to limiting 
</p>
<p>any opposition, even moderate and peaceful, to the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to the exercise of the right to freedom  
of peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. Article 36 of the Constitution of Rwanda guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>It sets a regime of prior authorization which is only necessary &#8220;if the law so requires and 
</p>
<p>solely in the case of assembly in the open air, in a public space or on a public road, to the 
</p>
<p>extent that such is necessary in the interests of public safety, public health or public order&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, peaceful assemblies are regulated by the following provisions of 
</p>
<p>Law 33/91: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 1 provides for prior written notification of demonstrations on public roads, 
</p>
<p>public assemblies in the open air or in a closed venue, and games, sport 
</p>
<p>competitions, fairs and shows. Religious processions and public social ceremonies 
</p>
<p>are exempted from this requirement. The notification should be made to the Mayor, 
</p>
<p>Prefect or Minister of the Interior if the event takes place in a town, in several towns 
</p>
<p>of the same prefecture, or in several prefectures respectively. The notification period 
</p>
<p>is 30 days by mail, or six days if delivered in person to the authority concerned, 
</p>
<p>prior to the said event. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 5 sets prior authorization requirements for assemblies held at open air 
</p>
<p>venues, on public roads or in a public space in the interests of public safety, 
</p>
<p>tranquillity or health. In case of rejection of the application, the authorities 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>concerned must inform the applicant 48 hours before the event is to take place, and 
</p>
<p>justify their decision. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 8 provides for a right to appeal against the denial of permission before a 
</p>
<p>higher administrative authority, which must make a decision within six days. Failure 
</p>
<p>to notify the authorities or to comply with the decision of the authority rejecting the 
</p>
<p>notification is punishable by a maximum of two months&#8217; imprisonment and/or a fine 
</p>
<p>of up to RF 100,000 (US$ 150). In addition, if a demonstration of which the 
</p>
<p>authorities have not been notified undermines public safety, tranquillity or health, 
</p>
<p>organizers face a maximum of two months&#8217; imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 
</p>
<p>RF 500,000 (US$ 730). In the event of rejection of the notification by the notified 
</p>
<p>authority, the fine increases to up to RF 1 million (US$ 1,475) (art. 9). 
</p>
<p>16. Article 685 of Organic Law 01/2012/OL increased the penalties set under article 8 of 
</p>
<p>Law 33/91 in case of: (a) failure to notify the competent authority, a term of imprisonment 
</p>
<p>between eight days and six months and/or a fine of RF 100,000 to RF 1 million (US$ 150&#8211;
</p>
<p>1,470); (b) holding a public meeting or demonstration on public ways despite refusal by a 
</p>
<p>competent authority, a term of imprisonment of six months to one year and/or a fine of 
</p>
<p>RF 200,000 to RF 3 million (US$ 290&#8211;4,410); (c) failure to notify the competent authority 
</p>
<p>and in the event that the public meeting or demonstration impairs security, order or public 
</p>
<p>health, a term of imprisonment of six months to two years and/or a fine of RF 2 million to 
</p>
<p>RF 5 million (US$ 2,940&#8211;7,350); (d) holding a public meeting or demonstration on public 
</p>
<p>ways, despite refusal by a competent authority, which impairs security, order or public 
</p>
<p>health, a term of imprisonment of one to three years and a fine of RF 2 million to 
</p>
<p>RF 5 million (US$ 2,940&#8211;7,350).  
</p>
<p>17. In addition, Organic Law 10/2013/OL governing political organizations and 
</p>
<p>politicians provides that, whenever a political organization plans to hold a public meeting 
</p>
<p>of its members, it must inform the relevant administrative authorities at least five working 
</p>
<p>days prior to the meeting (art. 19). As for demonstrations, the political organization must 
</p>
<p>obtain the authorization of the authorities at least five days before the event (art. 20). 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur finds that the aforementioned legal framework is not 
</p>
<p>conducive to a free and unhindered exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>He firmly believes that such exercise should not be subject to prior authorization by the 
</p>
<p>authorities, including de facto authorization as stipulated by the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>provisions. At most, a prior notification requirement is sufficient to facilitate peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies and demonstrations and to take measures to protect public safety and order and 
</p>
<p>the rights and freedoms of others. Further spontaneous assemblies and demonstrations 
</p>
<p>should be recognized in law, exempted from prior notification and, therefore, not be 
</p>
<p>sanctioned.  
</p>
<p>19. Furthermore, the law should contain a clear presumption in favour of holding 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and demonstrations to facilitate the exercise of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly. The Human Rights Council has called upon States to  
</p>
<p>promote a safe and enabling environment for individuals and groups to exercise their 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association, including 
</p>
<p>by ensuring that their domestic legislation and procedures relating to the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly, of expression and of association are in conformity 
</p>
<p>with their international human rights obligations and commitments, clearly and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>explicitly establish a presumption in favour of the exercise of these rights, and that 
</p>
<p>they are effectively implemented.
7
 
</p>
<p>20. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, there are insufficient guarantees attached to the 
</p>
<p>right to appeal against rejected decisions concerning notification: such appeal should be 
</p>
<p>made before an impartial and independent court. The disproportionate sanctions of Rwanda 
</p>
<p>are also a serious concern as they significantly contribute to dissuading people from holding 
</p>
<p>peaceful assemblies and demonstrations. Finally, the Special Rapporteur stresses that 
</p>
<p>organizers of peaceful assemblies and demonstrations should never be held liable for the 
</p>
<p>unlawful behaviour of others. In this regard, the principle of individual liability of 
</p>
<p>participants is of utmost importance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Practice 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in practice, only peaceful assemblies 
</p>
<p>which the authorities favour are allowed to take place. This includes the commemorative 
</p>
<p>marches organized by Ibuka &#8212; Memory and Justice, the NGO which honours the memory 
</p>
<p>of victims of the 1994 genocide and provides support to survivors of the genocide. In the 
</p>
<p>case of those marches, the Special Rapporteur noted that the police protected and facilitated 
</p>
<p>Ibuka&#8217;s processions, including by rerouting the traffic.  
</p>
<p>22. However, peaceful protests voicing dissent and criticizing government policies are 
</p>
<p>reportedly not allowed. For instance, on 25 March 2013, law enforcement officials arrested 
</p>
<p>Sylvain Sibomana, Secretary-General of the opposition Unified Democratic Forces (FDU-
</p>
<p>Inkingi) and Dominique Shyrambere, a fellow party member, outside the trial of Victoire 
</p>
<p>Ingabire, Chair of the same party. Mr. Sibomana was injured in the course of his arrest. The 
</p>
<p>two party members were wearing T-shirts and badges with the inscriptions &#8220;democracy and 
</p>
<p>justice&#8221; and &#8220;free Ingabire&#8221;. Both men were charged with contempt of public officials, 
</p>
<p>illegal demonstration and inciting insurrection of public disorder. The Primary Court of 
</p>
<p>Nyarugunga sentenced Mr. Sibomana to two years in prison and a fine of RF 1 million 
</p>
<p>(US$ 1,470) and Mr. Shyrambere to five months imprisonment and the same fine. 
</p>
<p>23. On 23 July 2013, the police arrested 11 members of the Intwarane group, a 
</p>
<p>breakaway Catholic group, for illegally demonstrating as they were marching towards the 
</p>
<p>presidential palace in Kigali. The group intended to deliver a petition to the President, 
</p>
<p>asking him to make a series of reforms.  
</p>
<p>24. In September 2013, at least 20 students were arrested after they had presented a 
</p>
<p>petition to the Prime Minister protesting against the reduction of State loans to students 
</p>
<p>enrolled in public universities. While most students were later released without charges, 
</p>
<p>four of them were charged with holding an illegal protest and taken to court. The court, 
</p>
<p>however, found them not guilty and ordered their release. 
</p>
<p>25. The authorities claim that peaceful protests do not occur because there are other 
</p>
<p>avenues to express criticism and solve contentious issues. The Special Rapporteur has taken 
</p>
<p>note of that assessment, but he finds that such avenues are limited and, as illustrated by the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned cases, the fear of being targeted has contributed to individuals and 
</p>
<p>associations refraining from exercising their right to peaceful assembly to voice their 
</p>
<p>grievances.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Resolution 25/38 on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests, 
</p>
<p>para. 3. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>26. It was clear from the meeting with representatives of the police force that law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials view their role in policing peaceful assemblies solely as an issue of 
</p>
<p>ensuring public order. They have not adopted an approach that would facilitate assemblies 
</p>
<p>as an integral right of every person in Rwanda to be fully protected. The Inspector General 
</p>
<p>of the Police stated that there had been no instance of police misconduct during the policing 
</p>
<p>of assemblies and demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>27. Law 46/2010 determining the powers, responsibilities, organization and functioning 
</p>
<p>of the Rwanda National Police8 contains provisions on the use of force and firearms. 
</p>
<p>Article 38 provides that: &#8220;A police officer may, where necessary, use a firearm if: 
</p>
<p>(1) he/she has unsuccessfully tried other means of force; (2) he/she is subject to violence or 
</p>
<p>has to assist other persons who are subject to violence when no other means are available; 
</p>
<p>(3) he/she is fighting armed persons and cannot protect persons or property he/she is 
</p>
<p>supposed to protect by any other means; (4) he/she has to arrest notorious criminals or any 
</p>
<p>other armed persons.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur finds that this provision fails to comply with 
</p>
<p>the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials9 
</p>
<p>owing to its overly broad and vague language. According to principle 9,  
</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-
</p>
<p>defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, 
</p>
<p>to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to 
</p>
<p>life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to 
</p>
<p>prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to 
</p>
<p>achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be 
</p>
<p>made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.  
</p>
<p>He therefore urges the authorities to amend Law 09/2000 to bring it into compliance with 
</p>
<p>the Basic Principles, as called upon by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 25/38.10 
</p>
<p>28. While noting with appreciation the statement of the Minister of Justice, made during 
</p>
<p>a meeting, that the Government was &#8220;fine with dissent&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
</p>
<p>emphasize that peaceful assemblies should not be feared. Rather they should be encouraged 
</p>
<p>for there is value in expressing disagreement and differences peacefully and publicly. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no better gauge of what citizens think than peaceful protests. And it is in the 
</p>
<p>interests of the State to allow public and peaceful assemblies as a &#8220;release valve&#8221; in order to 
</p>
<p>avoid recourse to other means of dissent and disagreement, including violence.  
</p>
<p>29. As stated by the Human Rights Council, &#8220;everyone must be able to express their 
</p>
<p>grievances or aspirations in a peaceful manner, including through public protests without 
</p>
<p>fear of reprisals or of being intimidated, harassed, injured &#8230; arbitrarily arrested and 
</p>
<p>detained&#8221;.11 The Council further stressed that &#8220;peaceful protests should not be viewed as a 
</p>
<p>threat &#8230; therefore encouraging all States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful 
</p>
<p>dialogue when dealing with peaceful protests and their causes&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>30. The undue restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly also had a negative impact 
</p>
<p>on the enjoyment of freedom of association. Several associations have been prevented from 
</p>
<p>holding general assemblies, a key requirement for forming a political party or an NGO.

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>In the run-up to the 2010 presidential elections, the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda and 
</p>
<p>FDU-Inkingi were both denied permission to hold their congress meetings.  
</p>
<p>31. In addition, political activists who express dissenting views can be arrested for 
</p>
<p>holding meetings to recruit members in public spaces. In September 2012, Mr. Sibomana, 
</p>
<p>FDU-Inkingi Secretary-General, was arrested in a bar in Karongi while holding a 
</p>
<p>recruitment meeting. Mr. Sibomana was charged with &#8220;inciting insurrection or trouble 
</p>
<p>amongst the population&#8221;.13 The High Court in Karongi sentenced him, and Anselme 
</p>
<p>Mutuyimana, a fellow political activist, to six years&#8217; imprisonment. The people in the bar 
</p>
<p>listening to Mr. Sibomana were also charged for &#8220;concealing an offence or failing to inform 
</p>
<p>security organs of a felony that is being committed&#8221;14 and sentenced to two years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges to the exercise of the right to freedom 
of association  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association under article 35, &#8220;which shall 
</p>
<p>not require prior authorization&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Political parties 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>33. The process of establishing a political party in Rwanda is long, laborious and far too 
</p>
<p>often, arbitrary. According to article 11 of Organic Law 10/2013/OL, the founders of a new 
</p>
<p>political party must first submit a letter requesting registration to the Rwanda Governance 
</p>
<p>Board, the authority in charge of registering political organizations. The letter must be 
</p>
<p>accompanied by a number of documents, details of which are in article 12. The documents 
</p>
<p>include three copies of the minutes of the general assembly that established the political 
</p>
<p>organization, certified by the notary of the district where the general assembly took place, 
</p>
<p>and three copies of the statutes that prove that the political organization has at least 
</p>
<p>200 members, with a minimum of five people residing in each of the 30 districts of 
</p>
<p>Rwanda. In practice, this means that a non-registered political organization has to call 
</p>
<p>multiple public meetings across the country and a general assembly as a precondition to 
</p>
<p>comply with registration requirements. That is a serious financial and logistical burden. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also notes that public meetings and founding meetings of political 
</p>
<p>organizations are subject to discretional de facto authorization by local authorities. They 
</p>
<p>further potentially expose organizers to a long list of vaguely defined crimes, such as 
</p>
<p>negating and minimizing the genocide, creating divisions and sectarianism, spreading false 
</p>
<p>information, inciting others to conspire to commit violence, inciting insurrection, 
</p>
<p>participating in a seditious meeting, illegally forming or leading a political organization, 
</p>
<p>etc. The Special Rapporteur regrets the obvious dissuasive effects that that legal and 
</p>
<p>political environment has upon on individuals keen on forming opposition political parties. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur sees as another challenge the criminalization of the &#8220;illegal 
</p>
<p>formation or leadership of a political organization&#8221; (Organic Law 01/2012/OL, art. 686). 
</p>
<p>Under the law, any person who forms or leads an &#8220;illegal&#8221; political organization is liable to 
</p>
<p>up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to RF 2 million (US$ 3,000). Moreover, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 Organic Law 01/2012/OL instituting the penal code, chap. 1, art. 463.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>anyone who claims to belong to a suspended or dissolved political organization may be 
</p>
<p>sentenced to up to five years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of up to RF 5 million (US$ 7,350). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Space for opposition political parties  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur recognizes Rwanda&#8217;s efforts to rebuild its society and move 
</p>
<p>towards reconciliation following the atrocities committed in its recent history. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that Organic Law 10/2013/OL that 
</p>
<p>governs political organizations and politicians recognizes in article 3 that &#8220;political 
</p>
<p>organizations shall be formed and allowed to operate freely&#8221; and &#8220;be equal before 
</p>
<p>Government institutions&#8221;.15 However, he is deeply concerned about the unequal 
</p>
<p>opportunities presented to political parties for the pursuit of their legitimate activities. He 
</p>
<p>observes that there are undue restrictions on political parties, curtailing opportunities for 
</p>
<p>genuine political participation and dialogue. He was informed that Rwanda favoured a 
</p>
<p>political order based on consensus led by the ruling party, which discourages public 
</p>
<p>criticism and dissent. The Organic Law frames the recruitment processes, operations and 
</p>
<p>activities of political parties, which &#8220;must constantly reflect the unity of the people of 
</p>
<p>Rwanda&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is sensitive to the need to unite Rwandans, but considers 
</p>
<p>that unity must include openness to express legitimate dissent. He believes that ordinary 
</p>
<p>dissent and genocide ideology are divided by a thin boundary in Rwanda. In a country that 
</p>
<p>can dissolve any political organization carrying out divisive acts,17 the legitimate fights 
</p>
<p>against terrorism and heinous crimes such as genocide stand in a tenuous balance of forced 
</p>
<p>consensus. It also puts any opposition political party keen to compete against the ruling 
</p>
<p>party at risk of falling victim to various laws punishing the crimes of negationism, 
</p>
<p>minimizing genocide, sectarianism, spreading false information, inciting or attempting to 
</p>
<p>incite insurrection, and sedition.  
</p>
<p>38. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Rwanda had 11 registered political 
</p>
<p>organizations. Out of those, 10 were part of the National Consultative Forum of Political 
</p>
<p>Organizations. The Forum is provided for in the Constitution of Rwanda and partially 
</p>
<p>funded by the Government and a variety of international donors. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes that it provides a capacity-building platform for partners through training, regular 
</p>
<p>meetings and three-monthly general assemblies. In the 2010 presidential elections, the 
</p>
<p>Rwandan Patriotic Front and eight other Forum members actively supported the Front, 
</p>
<p>while one, the Social Democratic Party of Rwanda, remained independent. The newly-
</p>
<p>registered eleventh party is the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda (Green Party), an 
</p>
<p>opposition party that had sought registration for almost four years. It was finally registered 
</p>
<p>on 9 August 2013. The delay in registration was reportedly due to technical difficulties 
</p>
<p>encountered by the organization in completing the registration process, an assessment that 
</p>
<p>the Green Party contested. However, the Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern over 
</p>
<p>the process, which he considers was an excessive deferral and a burden on the political 
</p>
<p>party seeking registration, contrary to the spirit of the fundamental right to freely associate.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur expresses similar concern over the fates of unregistered 
</p>
<p>opposition parties whose leaders have been imprisoned in recent years. He finds it troubling 
</p>
<p>that virtually all the publicly critical political leaders are in jail or in exile. This is the case 
</p>
<p>of the opposition party, FDU-Inkingi, led by Victoire Ingabire. She started operating from 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 Organic Law 10/2013/OL of 11 July /2013 governing political organizations and politicians, chap. I,

</p>
<p>Europe in 2007, and unsuccessfully tried to register the party in Rwanda from January 2010 
</p>
<p>until her arrest on 21 April 2010. During that period, the police summoned her on numerous 
</p>
<p>occasions on account of her public statements and for alleged links with the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. On 14 October 2010, the High Court in Kigali found 
</p>
<p>her guilty of conspiracy to undermine the established Government and of denying the 
</p>
<p>genocide. The latter charge was brought against her for publicly calling for the construction 
</p>
<p>of a memorial site for individuals identified as Hutus reportedly killed during the genocide. 
</p>
<p>On 13 December 2013, the Supreme Court upheld the judgement and sentenced her to 
</p>
<p>15 years on an additional count of collaborating with armed groups. Sylvain Sibomana and 
</p>
<p>Anselme Mutuyimana, other FDU-Inkingi members, were also sentenced to six years in 
</p>
<p>prison each for spreading rumours and participating in illegal gatherings.  
</p>
<p>40. Other opposition party leaders have received similar treatment. The president of PS-
</p>
<p>Imberakuri, Bernard Ntaganda, was arrested weeks before the presidential elections on 
</p>
<p>24 June 2010 and charged with endangering national security, attempting to organize an 
</p>
<p>illegal demonstration and resorting to actions that divide people. The Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>confirmed his sentence of four years in prison on 27 April 2012.  
</p>
<p>41. Under Rwandan law, individuals sentenced to prison terms of over six months are 
</p>
<p>banned for life from ever holding leadership positions in a political organization (Organic 
</p>
<p>Law 10/2013/OL, art. 13, item 5), unless they undergo a process of rehabilitation as 
</p>
<p>required in Law 30/2013 of 24 May 2013. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern 
</p>
<p>at the reported disappearance of Aimable Sibomana Rusanganwa, personal assistant of 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ntaganda, in Kigali on 13 June 2010. He calls on the authorities to shed light on his 
</p>
<p>whereabouts and hold the alleged perpetrators accountable.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the recent history and reconciliation efforts of 
</p>
<p>Rwanda. However, he considers that resorting to criminalizing peaceful public 
</p>
<p>disagreement inculcates fear, and quashes dissent and pluralism in a way that is adverse to 
</p>
<p>Rwanda and its people. It sends an unacceptable message to Rwandans. This criticism also 
</p>
<p>applies to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s dismay at the public comments from the Government of 
</p>
<p>Rwanda which was celebrating the murder of exiled opposition politician Patrick Karegeya 
</p>
<p>in South Africa on 1 January 2014. Twenty years after the genocide, the successful 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of the State of Rwanda should give the Government the confidence that it 
</p>
<p>can and should allow peaceful dissent and criticism.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>43. The right to freedom of association for NGOs is laid out in laws enacted in 2012. 
</p>
<p><i>  National non-governmental organizations 
</i></p>
<p>44. Law 04/2012 governs the organization and functioning of national NGOs.18 The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur expresses the following concerns about the Law. 
</p>
<p>45. Article 15 requires registration for public interest organizations, defined under 
</p>
<p>article 3 (1) as those organizations which &#8220;carry out activities in the development of various 
</p>
<p>sectors, including civil society, economy, social welfare, culture, science and human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221;. The Rwanda Governance Board is the authority in charge of registering, granting 
</p>
<p>legal personality and monitoring the functioning of national NGOs (art. 16). However, as 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>pointed out by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders: &#8220;[R]egistration should not be compulsory. NGOs should be allowed to exist and 
</p>
<p>carry out activities without having to register if they so wish.&#8221;19 In addition, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur stated that &#8220;the right to freedom of association equally protects associations that 
</p>
<p>are not registered&#8221;.20  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur finds it problematic that legal personality is not granted 
</p>
<p>automatically upon submission of NGO documents in support of registration. Article 17 of 
</p>
<p>Law 04/2012 provides that a temporary certificate of registration valid for 12 months is 
</p>
<p>issued to national NGOs. National NGOs must then wait nine months after the issuance of 
</p>
<p>this certificate to apply for legal personality. In that regard, the then Special Representative 
</p>
<p>of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders &#8220;encourage[d States] to adopt regimes 
</p>
<p>of &#699;declaration&#8217; or &#699;notification&#8217; whereby an organization is considered a legal entity as 
</p>
<p>soon as it has notified its existence to the relevant administration by providing basic 
</p>
<p>information, including the names and addresses of the founder(s) and the name, address, 
</p>
<p>statutes and purpose of the organization&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p>47. In addition, the Special Rapporteur finds the registration requirements of Rwanda 
</p>
<p>for national NGOs overly bureaucratic. Under article 18 of Law 04/2012, the applicant for a 
</p>
<p>temporary certificate must provide an application letter addressed to the Rwanda 
</p>
<p>Governance Board, together with authenticated statutes; the head office and full address of 
</p>
<p>the organization; the name of the legal representative of the organization, the name of 
</p>
<p>his/her deputy, their duties, full address, curriculum vitae and judicial records; the minutes 
</p>
<p>of the general assembly which appointed the legal representative of the organization and the 
</p>
<p>signatures of all members that attended such a general assembly meeting.  
</p>
<p>48. Local NGOs are also required to secure &#8220;letters of collaboration&#8221; with the authorities 
</p>
<p>in the main district in which they operate. These letters must then be submitted with the 
</p>
<p>application for legal personality. The Special Rapporteur finds that the financial cost, time 
</p>
<p>and energy it takes to obtain these letters constitute a serious drain on the resources of 
</p>
<p>organizations. As stated in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first thematic report, registration 
</p>
<p>procedures should be simple, non-onerous and expeditious.22  
</p>
<p><i>  International non-governmental organizations 
</i></p>
<p>49. Law 05/2012 governs the organization and functioning of international NGOs.23 
</p>
<p>Under article 6, the Directorate General of Immigration and Emigration is responsible for 
</p>
<p>the registration of international NGOs and the monitoring of their operations. 
</p>
<p>50. As with national NGOs, the procedure for registration of international NGOs is 
</p>
<p>onerous. Under article 7 of Law 05/2012, international NGOs must submit an authenticated 
</p>
<p>copy of the statutes of the organization; an official document allowing the organization to 
</p>
<p>operate in the country of origin and indicating its geographical establishment throughout 
</p>
<p>the world if any; the nature of the activities in which the organization intends to engage in 
</p>
<p>and an action plan; the budget and its source. Those documents must be presented to the 
</p>
<p>local authorities of every district in which the international NGOs wish to operate. 
</p>
<p>International NGOs must also produce letters of approval from the relevant ministry 
</p>
<p>covering their area of work. The enormous time and energy necessary to put together the 
</p>
<p>registration requirements could be devoted to activities benefiting the community.

<p>51. Under article 11 of Law 05/2012, the registration is valid for up to five years. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur found that it was rare for international NGOs to actually 
</p>
<p>obtain registration for that period. That is because the Directorate General of Immigration 
</p>
<p>and Emigration requires that international NGOs provide evidence of funding for the entire 
</p>
<p>period for which they seek registration. Most funding sources are unable to guarantee 
</p>
<p>funding for multiple years, let alone five years, thus forcing them to seek annual 
</p>
<p>registration.  
</p>
<p>52. When the registration period expires, international NGOs must renew their 
</p>
<p>registration certificate (Law 05/2012, arts. 11&#8211;12). Each district immigration officer must 
</p>
<p>check that the NGO has fulfilled its &#8220;objectives&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
</p>
<p>imposing such a renewal procedure unduly restricts the exercise of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association, placing excessive discretion in the hands of the Government. In his opinion, the 
</p>
<p>requirement fails to meet the test of being &#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221; to protect 
</p>
<p>national security, public safety, public order, public health, morals or the rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms of others, as laid down in article 22, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, and recalled in Human Rights Council resolution 24/5. 
</p>
<p>53. Another issue of concern to the Special Rapporteur is the 20 per cent limit of 
</p>
<p>Rwanda on overhead costs in programmes that are not in the interest of its beneficiaries, as 
</p>
<p>specified under article 18, paragraph 4, of Law 05/2012. Should an international NGO want 
</p>
<p>to spend more than 20 per cent, it must provide justification to the Directorate General of 
</p>
<p>Immigration and Emigration. He finds that that provision unduly interferes with the 
</p>
<p>functioning of international NGOs. As stated previously, &#8220;associations should be free to 
</p>
<p>determine their statutes, structure and activities and to make decisions without State 
</p>
<p>interference&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the reporting requirement for international 
</p>
<p>NGOs is burdensome as they must submit the activity report of the previous year and the 
</p>
<p>plan of action for the following year to the relevant authority.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the disagreement between the Government and 
</p>
<p>the international NGO Human Rights Watch. He calls on the authorities to settle the matter 
</p>
<p>amicably. 
</p>
<p><i>  Stark contrast with legislation governing the establishment of private companies 
</i></p>
<p>56. The contrast between the registration process for national and international NGOs, 
</p>
<p>and that of companies in the private sector, is particularly striking. Companies in the private 
</p>
<p>sector find the process much easier and faster and are subject to far fewer requirements to 
</p>
<p>register. 
</p>
<p>57. It takes a maximum of six hours for companies to register online. The Rwanda 
</p>
<p>Development Board is in charge of registering private companies. The registration 
</p>
<p>requirements are as follows: an identification card, the name of the company to be 
</p>
<p>registered and its purpose. The company&#8217;s financial statements are not required. The 
</p>
<p>procedure is free if completed online; otherwise the fees are less than US$ 50. Following 
</p>
<p>registration, a company&#8217;s only requirements are to observe the laws and to submit their 
</p>
<p>financial accounts. This framework enabling private companies to operate without 
</p>
<p>hindrance is one reason for the positive economic transformation of Rwanda since the 
</p>
<p>genocide.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur believes that a similar approach in terms of ease of 
</p>
<p>registration and reporting requirements should apply to the civil society sector. This would 
</p>
<p>yield significant economic, social and political dividends, allowing for innovation and 
</p>
<p>creativity. More importantly, it would strengthen sustainable peace and democracy.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur raised the issue of the unconducive legal framework for 
</p>
<p>NGOs with the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Unity, Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and Fight against Genocide, and its members. He welcomes the statement made by the 
</p>
<p>Chair and some of the members, acknowledging that the legislation governing NGOs can 
</p>
<p>be improved, in particular in relation to registration procedures. He calls on the Chair to 
</p>
<p>lead that important process with a view to bringing the legislation into compliance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights norms and standards governing freedom of association. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Practice 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Interference with the functioning of non-governmental organizations 
</i></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was informed that while some national organizations were 
</p>
<p>not required to notify local authorities prior to holding their general assemblies, others &#8212; 
</p>
<p>particularly the ones more critical of the Government &#8212; reported that they had to obtain 
</p>
<p>prior authorization for those meetings. He finds the practice disconcerting, and calls on the 
</p>
<p>authorities to comply with the principle of equity.  
</p>
<p>61. Many of the interlocutors the Special Rapporteur met highlighted the invasive role 
</p>
<p>of the Rwanda Governance Board in the life of local NGOs and faith-based organizations. 
</p>
<p>According to article 30 of Law 04/2012, the Board is tasked with &#8220;supervising&#8221; national 
</p>
<p>NGOs, i.e. monitoring whether local NGOs and faith-based organizations conform to 
</p>
<p>article 29 of the same Law in relation to the responsibilities of NGOs. That broad language 
</p>
<p>provides unjustifiable room for the Board to interfere with the internal affairs of local 
</p>
<p>NGOs as the following example demonstrates.  
</p>
<p>62. The case of the Rwandan League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(LIPRODHOR) was brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. On 21 July 2013, a 
</p>
<p>group of LIPRODHOR members organized a meeting and voted in a new board, ousting 
</p>
<p>the leadership of the organization known for its independence. The then president, vice-
</p>
<p>president and executive secretary claimed that they had not been informed that the meeting 
</p>
<p>would be held, as required by the LIPRODHOR internal rules, which provide that elections 
</p>
<p>of a board may only take place during a general assembly. In addition, they claimed that the 
</p>
<p>meeting did not meet quorum requirements. The board takeover also violated article 27 of 
</p>
<p>Law 04/2012, which states that any conflict arising in a local NGO must be resolved by the 
</p>
<p>organization&#8217;s internal conflict resolution organ set up under article 6. On 24 July, the 
</p>
<p>Rwandan Governance Board, despite being alerted of the situation by the ousted leadership, 
</p>
<p>sent a letter to the organization in which it formally recognized the new board. On the same 
</p>
<p>day, the ousted president of LIPRODHOR legally challenged the voting in of the new 
</p>
<p>board. He subsequently received threats from board officials and from anonymous 
</p>
<p>individuals. On 10 April 2014, the High Court of Nyarugenge postponed the hearing on the 
</p>
<p>case to 15 May 2014.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur sought to clarify the matter with the Head of the Rwandan 
</p>
<p>Governance Board who denied that his institution had made any intervention in the 
</p>
<p>appointment of the new leaders of LIPRODHOR. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless 
</p>
<p>remains very concerned about the case, which he was told was not an isolated one. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Board had been implicated in 
</p>
<p>determining the leadership of the Rwandan Collective of Leagues and Associations for the 
</p>
<p>Defense of Human Rights.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>64. The independence and ability of associations to run their internal affairs without 
</p>
<p>external interference are of paramount importance in the exercise of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>association. The Special Rapporteur sees no justification for the Rwandan Governance 
</p>
<p>Board involving itself in leadership wrangles within local NGOs. Resolution of such 
</p>
<p>conflict should be the responsibility of the membership of the organization and ultimately 
</p>
<p>the courts. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that, as a general principle, Government&#8217;s role in 
</p>
<p>the civil society sector should mirror the role it plays in the private sector, i.e. solely that of 
</p>
<p>registering entities within the sector.  
</p>
<p><i>  Compulsory development partnership 
</i></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was struck by the clarity of the Government&#8217;s vision of 
</p>
<p>where it wants the country to be by 2020. This vision of development is largely inclusive 
</p>
<p>and creates various spaces for interaction amongst the different stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>67. At the local level, interactions take place in the context of the Joint Action 
</p>
<p>Development Forum, established by ministerial instruction No. 04/07 of July 2007.25 As 
</p>
<p>defined in article 2, the Forum is &#8220;a consultative level of information dissemination, 
</p>
<p>promoting cooperation among people or actors in development and social welfare of the 
</p>
<p>population. The Forum aims at coordinating activities of all development actors so as to 
</p>
<p>promote coordination of efforts, efficiency and avoid duplication of efforts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. While the Special Rapporteur understands that collaborations under the Joint Action 
</p>
<p>Development Forum have been fruitful, he is concerned that the development partnerships 
</p>
<p>between the Government and local and international NGOs are of a compulsory nature. 
</p>
<p>This is evidenced by the necessity for the aforementioned collaboration letters, action plans 
</p>
<p>that must align with the development objectives of the district, down to the level of 
</p>
<p>activities, and in some cases demands for performance contracts to be concluded between 
</p>
<p>local authorities and NGOs. In fact, the perception of some in Government, but also in the 
</p>
<p>civil society sector, appears to be that NGOs are implementers of governmental policies, or 
</p>
<p>merely service providers that should act at the behest of the Government. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that since his visit, the Government has decided to end 
</p>
<p>the compulsory financial contributions local and international NGOs had to make to the 
</p>
<p>Forum. 
</p>
<p>69. In order to protect the autonomy and independence of NGOs, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is of the view that any partnership between the Government and civil society should be 
</p>
<p>voluntary rather than compulsory. In the development field, NGOs should be able to 
</p>
<p>determine and operate within their priority areas of concern without interference or 
</p>
<p>direction by authorities, including working on issues that authorities do not consider to be 
</p>
<p>priorities. The power of innovation is enhanced through openness. A multiplicity of 
</p>
<p>interventions and approaches will serve to strengthen the capacity of the sector to respond 
</p>
<p>to the needs of beneficiaries and ultimately, to all Rwandans. 
</p>
<p><i>  Environment in which non-governmental organizations operate 
</i></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by the stigmatization of local and international 
</p>
<p>NGOs that has persisted in State-controlled media, and on the part of government officials, 
</p>
<p>especially following the decisions of some donor agencies to channel funding for 
</p>
<p>development through NGOs. He was informed that there was a general perception that 
</p>
<p>national NGOs that receive foreign funding and international NGOs are vehicles for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>advancing a foreign &#8212; or so-called western &#8212; agenda. It is understandable to require 
</p>
<p>transparency between donors and the State with regard to the sectors they are supporting 
</p>
<p>and how much support they are providing. But aside from that, the State should not treat 
</p>
<p>NGOs any differently than it treats the private sector &#8212; which is itself a key actor in 
</p>
<p>development.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the climate of suspicion and self-censorship 
</p>
<p>within civil society. NGOs show little openness among themselves, and do not dare to 
</p>
<p>discuss issues which they deem controversial for fear of retaliation, including the 
</p>
<p>cancellation of visas for foreign staff. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur was deeply disturbed to learn about the July 2013 murder of 
</p>
<p>Gustave Sharangabo Makonene, coordinator of Transparency International Rwanda&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Advocacy and Legal Advice Centre in Rubavu. Mr. Makonene worked to uncover cases of 
</p>
<p>corruption, some of which allegedly involved police officers. A few days before the killing, 
</p>
<p>a police officer in civilian clothes allegedly went to the premises of Transparency 
</p>
<p>International Rwanda and enquired about Mr. Makonene&#8217;s physical appearance and 
</p>
<p>movements. The Special Rapporteur deplores that at the time of his visit the authorities had 
</p>
<p>made no progress in investigating the case.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur stresses again that as long as the circumstances of 
</p>
<p>Mr. Makonene&#8217;s death remain unclear, the case will have a strong chilling effect on the 
</p>
<p>NGO community in Rwanda. He reiterates the recommendation made in his first thematic 
</p>
<p>report that &#8220;any association, including unregistered associations, should be allowed to 
</p>
<p>function freely, and their members operate in an enabling and safe environment&#8221;.26 
</p>
<p><b> VI. National Commission for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Rwanda National Commission for Human Rights is governed by Law 19/2013 
</p>
<p>which sets out the mission, organization and functioning of the Commission. Under 
</p>
<p>article 5, the Commission is mandated to, inter alia,  
</p>
<p>(1) educate and sensitize the population on matters relating to human rights &#8230;; 
</p>
<p>(2) to collaborate with other organs in designing strategies to prevent violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights; (3) to prepare and disseminate reports on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>in Rwanda, annually and whenever necessary; (4) to provide views, upon request or 
</p>
<p>at its own initiative on laws, regulations of public organs in force in the country and 
</p>
<p>bills so as to ensure their conformity to fundamental principles of human rights; &#8230; 
</p>
<p>(7) to propose to relevant government authorities measures to be taken to address 
</p>
<p>and punish in accordance with law any violation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that, among other activities, the 
</p>
<p>Rwanda National Commission for Human Rights has reportedly followed up on 
</p>
<p>observations made by United Nations treaty bodies and in the context of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review; visited detention facilities and police stations; provided legal advice to 
</p>
<p>associations; presented reports to Parliament; and raised awareness on laws. 
</p>
<p>76. He notes that in 2013 the Rwanda National Commission for Human Rights was 
</p>
<p>reaccredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International Coordinating Committee of National 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 A/HRC/20/27, para. 96. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/29/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.27 However, he is concerned 
</p>
<p>that the Commission has insufficient human and financial resources to carry out its mission 
</p>
<p>adequately. In addition, he was troubled to learn from several of his interlocutors, including 
</p>
<p>independent civil society organizations, of the little confidence they had in the 
</p>
<p>Commission, stating that they did not see it as an effective partner. They mainly questioned 
</p>
<p>the Commission&#8217;s independence and lack of a public critical stand on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>77. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur echoes the following recommendation of the 
</p>
<p>International Coordinating Committee addressed to the Rwanda National Commission for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights:  
</p>
<p>It is critically important to ensure the formalization of a clear, transparent and 
</p>
<p>participatory selection and appointment process of the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Institution&#8217;s decision-making body in relevant legislation, regulations or binding 
</p>
<p>administrative guidelines, as appropriate. A process that promotes merit-based 
</p>
<p>selection and ensures pluralism is necessary to ensure the independence of, and 
</p>
<p>public confidence in, the senior leadership of a National Institution.28 
</p>
<p>78. It is important that the Rwanda National Commission for Human Rights become a 
</p>
<p>robust, highly visible and well-respected institution in Rwanda. It should play a key role in 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and monitoring 
</p>
<p>their effective enjoyment by everyone. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Assistance activities of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>79. In the framework of the Rwanda United Nations Development Assistance Plan 
</p>
<p>2013&#8211;2018, the United Nations and the Government committed to, inter alia, ensuring that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;human rights, justice and gender equality [be] promoted and implemented at all levels&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur commends the One UN Rwanda programme with the 
</p>
<p>support of OHCHR, for developing the following joint programmes: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint programme on access to justice, human rights and peace consolidation, which 
</p>
<p>aims at increasing capacity of key institutions at the central and local levels between 
</p>
<p>2013 and 2018. To that end, the following key actions, among others, will be taken: 
</p>
<p>(a) support capacity-building of civil society organizations to effectively participate 
</p>
<p>in the preparation of parallel reports on the implementation of international 
</p>
<p>conventions; (b) provide technical and financial support to build the capacity of the 
</p>
<p>Task Force on Treaty Body Reporting for effective and timely reporting (treaty body 
</p>
<p>and universal periodic review) and oversight on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations; and (c) support capacity-building of the National Commission for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and relevant stakeholders to develop and implement human rights 
</p>
<p>related policies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint programme on strengthening civil society organizations for responsive and 
</p>
<p>accountable governance in Rwanda. Under the programme, grants will be provided 
</p>
<p>through the Rwandan Governance Board to civil society organizations to carry out 
</p>
<p>capacity development programmes on strengthening civil society organizations.

<p>In addition, support will be provided to United Nations Development Programme-
</p>
<p>Rwandan Governance Board priority areas, i.e. human rights and access to justice, 
</p>
<p>effective citizen engagement in key decision-making processes, media development 
</p>
<p>and accountability. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the aforementioned 
</p>
<p>grants, he believes that they should not be channelled through the Board in the light 
</p>
<p>of the above-mentioned concerns about the institution. He believes that OHCHR 
</p>
<p>should handle the direct allocation of those grants to civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>81. Finally, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the work of OHCHR in the country, in 
</p>
<p>particular the capacity-building and technical assistance activities it has undertaken over the 
</p>
<p>years. This includes the provision of training to judicial officers, legal practitioners and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors on the application of international human rights law in domestic courts, an area 
</p>
<p>that should be further expanded. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur urges OHCHR to 
</p>
<p>continue its work in providing technical support to government institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>in the context of the implementation of the recommendations made by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council to the Government of Rwanda under the universal periodic review process.

<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are essential for 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy and sustainable peace. They are all the more important in a society deeply 
</b></p>
<p><b>traumatized by genocide which is still seeking to heal and reconcile. Those rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>accommodate and foster pluralistic views, help ensure that dissent is peaceful, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen democrac</b>y&#8217;s ability to prevent social unrest. While acknowledging the 
</p>
<p><b>progress that Rwanda has achieved, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about 
</b></p>
<p><b>the prevailing opposition to vigorous debate and free expression of opinions, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>makes the current social reconciliation process unstable.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Despite the vibrancy of the economy of Rwanda and its remarkable progress in 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing infrastructure, building institutions and ensuring stability and security, 
</b></p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government&#8217;s pre<b>vailing hostility 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards peaceful initiatives by its critics and the existence of a legal framework that 
</b></p>
<p><b>silences dissent. He believes that the fear of a new genocide cannot be invoked to 
</b></p>
<p><b>impede fundamental freedoms in any society, as they are in fact necessary to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts and genocide. He also stresses that a society without room for critical voices 
</b></p>
<p><b>speaking freely and peacefully is unsustainable.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur is confident that the Government will see the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations as an opportunity to consolidate the progress of Rwanda towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>the realization of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. Its 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts would undoubtedly resonate at the regional and international levels, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>influence other countries positively.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In that regard, the Special Rapporteur stands ready to provide technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation to the Government when it implements the following recommendations.  </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the relevant authorities to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Recognize in law and in practice that the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association play a decisive role in the emergence and maintenance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective democratic systems as they are a channel for dialogue, pluralism, tolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and broadmindedness, where minority or dissenting views or beliefs are respected; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure a conducive and safe environment for everyone exercising or 
</b></p>
<p><b>seeking to exercise his or her rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that no one is criminalized for exercising the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and of association, nor subject to threats or use of violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Release all those arrested because of the exercise of their rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that any restrictions on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association are prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and proportionate to the aim pursued, and do not harm the principles of pluralism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance and broadmindedness. Any restrictions should be subject to an independent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial and prompt judicial review; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association with the protection offered by the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that administrative and law enforcement officials are adequately 
</b></p>
