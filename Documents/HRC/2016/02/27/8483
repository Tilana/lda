<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011.  The review of Austria was held at the 6th 
meeting on 26 January 2011. The delegation of Austria was headed by Michael 
Spindelegger, Minister for European and International Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 
28 January 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Austria.  
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Austria: Argentina, Bahrain and Mauritania. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of  Austria: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/AUT/1 and Corr.1);   
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/AUT/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/AUT/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Finland, Namibia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland  and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Austria through the 
troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Austrian delegation stated that the support of human rights was a core concern 
to its Government. Austria had a long-standing record of active engagement not only to 
ensure the protection of human rights at the national level, but also to advance the 
international system for the promotion and protection of human rights at the United Nations 
and in regional organizations such as the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union.   
</p>
<p>6. Austria&#8217;s international human rights engagement had always been guided by a spirit 
of cooperation and dialogue. Dialogue and partnerships were crucial for turning the 
promises of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into reality for everyone. Austria 
had consistently worked with all actors towards this goal.  
</p>
<p>7. As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2009 and 2010, Austria 
had continuously and actively advocated the advancement of human rights, the adherence 
to the rule of law, the protection of civilians in armed conflict and the promotion of the 
contribution of women as a measure to preserve peace and security.  
</p>
<p>8. Austria&#8217;s international engagement in human rights was based on a firm 
commitment to ensure full respect of human rights domestically. Austria had acceded to all 
major international human rights treaties and had extended a standing invitation to all 
United Nations special procedures.  </p>


<p>9. Austria was currently a candidate for membership of the Human Rights Council 
from June 2011. On the basis of the voluntary pledges and commitments made by Austria 
in the context of this candidacy, it had been possible to achieve notable progress in their 
implementation: 
</p>
<p> (a) Austria had recently incorporated children&#8217;s rights into the Constitution;  
</p>
<p> (b) Considerable progress had been made with regard to the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the creation of a national 
preventive mechanism, which will be incorporated into the Austrian Ombudsperson Board. 
The already existing Human Rights Advisory Board would be expanded at the same time;  
</p>
<p> (c) Austria would soon deposit the ratification document for the Council of 
Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual 
Abuse;  
</p>
<p> (d) Legislation was being prepared to introduce a separate crime of torture in the 
Austrian Penal Code;  
</p>
<p> (e) The ratification process of the Convention on Enforced and Involuntary 
Disappearance (CED) and the inclusion of enforced disappearances as a criminal offence in 
the Austrian Penal Code were on the way;  
</p>
<p> (f) Special provisions on crimes against humanity and war crimes were also 
being prepared for inclusion in the Austrian Penal Code; 
</p>
<p> (g) The Parliament would start discussion this spring of the ratification of the 
UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education.  
</p>
<p>10. Austria was aware of its specific historical responsibility and was committed to the 
fight against xenophobia, anti-Semitism, discrimination against Muslims and all other 
forms of racism and intolerance.  
</p>
<p>11. The current government programme envisaged a series of measures to enhance the 
protection against racism and discrimination, including a commitment to the 
implementation of the European Union (EU) Framework Decision against Racism and 
Xenophobia as well as the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>12. Anti-discrimination laws had been tightened in recent years. The Equal Treatment 
Commission, the Ombudsperson for Equal Treatment and the relevant bodies in the federal 
regions provided for protection against discrimination in employment and access to goods 
and services. Sanctions for all forms of discrimination had been continuously expanded and 
were consistently applied by Austrian courts. This would include compensation for material 
and immaterial damage. These efforts had contributed to an ever-increasing awareness and 
public sensitivity about discrimination issues. 
</p>
<p>13. Austria had a strict &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy towards all forms of discrimination and 
ill-treatment by law-enforcement officials. An independent body, the Federal Anti-
Corruption Bureau, had been established in January 2010 to investigate alleged ill-
treatment by law enforcement officials. Criminal police and the public prosecutor were 
obliged to investigate any suspicion of ill-treatment by law.  
</p>
<p>14. To ensure the protection of migrants&#8217; human rights, Austrian immigration legislation 
would provide the possibility to use the full spectrum of legal instruments and appeal 
procedures, including appeals to the Constitutional and Administrative Courts. In addition, 
Austria had enhanced human rights training for the justice and law enforcement sector. 
</p>
<p>15. On the preventive side, Austria was working to reinforce a tolerant and open social 
climate. The National Action Plan on Integration had been adopted in January 2010 to </p>


<p>support this policy. Areas of action included language, education, employment, rule of law, 
social services and health, intercultural dialogue, leisure and sports, housing and the 
regional dimension. An expert commission including civil society organisations closely 
followed up on the implementation of the Action Plan.  
</p>
<p>16. Austria was committed to further advance the protection and promotion of the rights 
of the Slovenian and the other five autochthonous national minorities in Austria. The 
educational, socio-economic and legal situation of minorities in Austria was presently 
reviewed by different expert groups with all relevant stakeholders. The aim was to amend 
and adapt the National Minority Act by next year. Concerning the bilingual topographical 
signs in Carinthia, the government was committed to fully implement Austria&#8217;s obligations 
under the State Treaty of 1955. Constructive negotiations were being held between all 
stakeholders with the aim of finding a sustainable solution soon.  
</p>
<p>17. Gender equality, including in the labour market, was considered a major issue. 
Measures had been taken to end inequalities. A National Action Plan had been presented in 
June 2010. The Law on Equal Treatment had recently been amended to ensure greater 
transparency with regard to incomes in the private sector. In addition, 50 per cent of the 
national budget for labour market policy was being spent on specific programmes to 
improve women&#8217;s chances on the labour market, inter alia through capacity-building and 
training.  
</p>
<p>18. Victims of domestic violence received free legal and psychosocial support to help 
them secure their rights in criminal procedures. Domestic violence cases were covered by 
prosecutors with special training. Victims could also rely on a well-established system of 
crisis intervention centres in all federal regions: There were 21 State-financed women&#8217;s 
shelters with 750 places and a 24-hour hotline.  
</p>
<p>19. The revised Violence Protection Law of 2009 had furthermore introduced new and 
stricter sanctions in case of continuous violence. Migrant women who had come to Austria 
on the basis of family reunification were in a particularly vulnerable position to become 
victims of domestic violence. Austrian legislation therefore provided for the possibility of 
granting them a separate residence permit to protect them from further violence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the comprehensive national report, Austria&#8217;s participation in and 
commitment to the UPR as well as the participative approach for the preparation of the 
report and the involvement of NGOs in the follow-up to the review. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. Algeria noted the lack of consensus to include social rights in the Constitution and 
inquired about the causes of this situation. Algeria mentioned difficulties for the 
consecration of gender equality and made reference to reported racist and xenophobic 
behaviours targeting specific groups. Algeria noted that Austria was not ready to ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland commended Austria&#8217;s 
commitment to implement the 2001 judgment of the Constitutional Court regarding the 
Slovenian minority. It welcomed the National Plan for Integration. The United Kingdom 
requested information on measures to remedy the reluctance of victims of discrimination to 
bring cases to courts. It was concerned about persistent inequalities regarding the status of 
same-sex partners. The United Kingdom made recommendations. </p>


<p>23. Turkey noted Austria&#8217;s indication that it considered the fight against xenophobia and 
racism a priority task and took measures for the promotion of equal treatment and 
integration.  In this regard, Turkey welcomed the establishment of the Ombudsperson for 
Equal Treatment.  It was pleased that police officers were provided with human rights 
training with a special focus on non-discriminatory police work in a multicultural society.  
Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Morocco noted that social rights were not enshrined in the Constitution and inquired 
whether Austria intended to implement the constitutional reforms mentioned in its national 
report. Morocco welcomed efforts to fight discrimination, xenophobia, racism and 
intolerance and listed a few best practices in this regard. On migration, Morocco shared 
Austria&#8217;s views to associate the States of origin and State of reception. Morocco inquired 
about efforts undertaken to help migrants in preserving their identity and keeping links with 
their State of origin.   
</p>
<p>25. Egypt noted Austria&#8217;s policies to ensure the promotion and protection of human 
rights, which included efforts to address gender inequality and the rights of the child, as 
well as combating racial discrimination.  It was nevertheless concerned about the persistent 
protection gap of the rights of minorities in Austria, including their cultural and linguistic 
rights.  Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Iraq noted Austria&#8217;s engagement in promoting human rights, reflected in the 
ratification of many human rights instruments. It noted that human rights were the main 
pillar of Austria&#8217;s policies and that Austria had contributed financially to human rights 
funds. Iraq referred to the measures taken to integrate migrants and to ensure dialogue 
between civilizations, and commended Austria for having taken steps to fight human 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>27. Azerbaijan stated that a number of national institutions had been set up in Austria to 
promote and protect human rights.  It indicated that it had taken a positive note of the 
accomplishments realized within the implementation of the wide-ranging National 
Programs and Plans in the different spheres, particularly in the field of protection of 
women&#8217;s rights.  Azerbaijan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>28. India requested Austria to inform on the measures taken to enforce the principle of 
equal pay for equal work as well as the review of the anti-discrimination laws.  It asked 
whether Austria considered it useful to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to 
visit the country.  India made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. The Islamic Republic of Iran was deeply concerned about human rights problems, 
such as the alarming instances of hate speech, the atmosphere of hostility by politicians and 
the media, and the discriminatory attitudes and manifestations of neo-Nazism, racism, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrant communities including Muslims and 
Roma. It requested information about concrete measures to address these issues. Iran made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>30. Canada welcomed Austria&#8217;s standing invitation to the special procedures and the 
recent visit of two European human rights bodies. It welcomed the intention of creating a 
compendium of all human rights related provisions. Canada encouraged Austria to pursue 
the integration of migrants and to ensure that they fully enjoy their rights. Canada was 
ready to pursue its dialogue with Austria on this issue. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. France welcomed Austria&#8217;s commitment to ratify CED and asked when this would 
happen. France noted that criminal law did not yet include war crimes and crimes against 
humanity in accordance with the Rome Statute and inquired about the reasons of this 
situation. France welcomed the recent measures aimed at preventing ill-treatment and racist </p>


<p>behaviour by law enforcement officials. France referred to national provisions in labour law 
discriminating against foreign nationals. France made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Spain welcomed the presentation of the national report and made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Jordan stated that Austria had been instrumental in advancing multilateralism and 
the agenda of human rights at all levels, including the conferences that resulted in the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. It indicated that it was encouraging to note 
Austria&#8217;s efforts to further develop and strengthen its longstanding legislative and 
institutional framework, including through the establishment of the Ombudsman Board.  
Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. The Czech Republic expressed its appreciation for Austria&#8217;s national report.  It 
commended the entry into force of the Criminal Procedure Reform Act 55 in January 2008, 
which provided more rights for defendants and additional transparency in proceedings to 
those who contested the excessive use of power by law enforcement officials.  The Czech 
Republic made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Slovenia noted the significant decrease in the size of the Slovenian-speaking 
community, especially in Carinthia. It noted with concern Austria&#8217;s failure to implement 
the rights of the Slovenian minority under the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Austrian 
State Treaty, as well as the failure to implement decisions of the Austrian Constitutional 
Court regarding the Slovenian minority language. Slovenia made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>36. Indonesia stated that the establishment of the Independent Human Rights Advisory 
Board with its notable inclusion of many civil society organizations must be noted as an 
important aspect of Austria&#8217;s commendable human rights approach and strategy.  It also 
recognized Austria&#8217;s initiatives in the promotion of dialogue aiming at strengthening 
mutual understanding and respect among people of different religions, ethnicities and 
languages.  Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Malaysia recognized that Austria had in place a strong legal framework with 
regional and international norms and standards.  It also noted that, at the national level, 
Austria had a number of Ombuds institutions.  It recognized, however, that Austria faced 
several challenges, including incidences of racial stereotyping and prejudice by the media, 
cases of human trafficking, and issues concerning migrant communities and gender parity.  
Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. The Republic of Moldova noted that Austria&#8217;s constitutional reform will incorporate 
the rights of the child in the Federal Constitution.  Referring to the 2007 recommendations 
of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to ensure more active 
participation by women at the decision-making levels, the Republic of Moldova asked 
which additional measures Austria planned to take in order to promote their full and equal 
participation in political and economic life.  Republic of Moldova made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Burkina Faso noted Austria&#8217;s investment in cooperation and development, of which 
it was a beneficiary. It noted Austria&#8217;s commitment to the international human rights 
system, the ratification of most human rights instruments, and its standing invitation to 
special procedures. Burkina Faso appreciated the measures taken for asylum seekers and 
migrants and asked Austria to continue to ensure respect of their rights. Burkina Faso made 
a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>40. The Russian Federation referred to sectors of the population which were vulnerable 
to racism and xenophobia, such as sub-Saharan Africans, Muslims, and Roma. It also 
referred to the continuing problem of anti-Semitism. It mentioned that asylum-seekers, 
refugees and migrants were the target of racist and xenophobic political statements. It also 
referred that 60 per cent of people in custody awaiting trial were non-citizens. The Russian 
Federation made recommendations.  </p>


<p>41. Bangladesh commended Austria for standing next to developing countries in their 
efforts to attain the MDGs and in fulfilling their right to development.  It took note of the 
actions taken by Austria to combat racism and to protect ethnic groups, migrants and 
asylum-seekers.  It was, however, concerned about Austria&#8217;s policies to cut its GNI share of 
official development assistance (ODA).  Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Palestine commended Austria for the transparency and objectivity of its national 
report, which also outlined persistent challenges such as discrimination and violence 
against women, and the efforts taken to protect the rights of vulnerable populations. 
Palestine also referred to Austria&#8217;s efforts to protect freedom of religion and religious 
minorities. Palestine made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>43. Guatemala acknowledged Austria&#8217;s assessment of the human rights situation and the 
challenges in areas such as gender equality, discrimination, migration laws, human 
trafficking and children&#8217;s rights. Guatemala commended Austria&#8217;s policies on human 
rights, and for its leadership regarding cooperation for development. Guatemala noted with 
satisfaction that the fight against racism was a priority and asked about measures to 
counteract racist acts. Guatemala made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>44. Switzerland welcomed Austria&#8217;s commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and to establish a national preventive mechanism. Switzerland referred to 
domestic violence and incidents of detention of women who were victims of trafficking. 
Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Brazil commended Austria for placing the fight against xenophobia and racism 
among its priorities.  It was encouraged by Austria&#8217;s determination to prevent and 
investigate cases of anti-Semitism. Notwithstanding these remarkable efforts, Brazil was 
concerned about the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and stated that it was 
necessary to change the mindset of some State officials in this regard.  Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. The Philippines commended Austria&#8217;s commitment to strengthening dialogue 
between different cultures and religions.  It asked about challenges in implementing the 
intercultural approach in the school system and to what extent human rights education was 
part of the intercultural curriculum.  It recognized Austria&#8217;s measures to combat racism and 
commended national action plans for the promotion of gender equality in the labour market 
as well as for combating trafficking in persons.  The Philippines made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. In reply to questions of delegations during the interactive dialogues, Austria 
explained that the Austrian Ombudsperson Board was independently monitoring Austria&#8217;s 
public administration according to the Austrian Constitution and thus fulfilled the function 
of a national human rights institution. Anybody could complain to the Board regardless of 
age, nationality or residence and at any time and at no charge.  It was intended to expand 
the mandate of the Board in the context of Austria&#8217;s ratification of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT).  
</p>
<p>48. Austrian reservations to international human rights conventions were regularly re-
examined. So far, no gaps or deficits in the protection of human rights in Austria had been 
identified. The aim of Austria's reservations was to harmonize Austria's international 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>49. Hate speech in politics and media was being strongly condemned by the Austrian 
public and politicians and was prohibited by criminal law. 
</p>
<p>50. Nazi activities and Holocaust denial were strictly prohibited by Austrian law. These 
provisions were strictly enforced by Austrian courts. The education system aimed at 
promoting inter-cultural understanding and tolerance.  </p>


<p>51. Human rights education was an integral part of primary, secondary and university 
education as well as of the training of police and justice personnel.  
</p>
<p>52. Austria supported equal participation in society and independent living of persons 
with disabilities. Austria was among the first states to sign and ratify the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. An independent monitoring 
mechanism was established in the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer 
Protection. High labour law standards in Austria, special measures to enhance integration in 
the labour market and the promotion of inclusive education further helped the 
empowerment of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>53. Austria already benefitted from a high standard with regard to the protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights. The inclusion of such rights in the constitution was 
presently under discussion and numerous economic, social and cultural rights were already 
implemented by Austrian legislation and jurisprudence. In addition, since 2009 certain 
economic, social and cultural rights were made applicable in Austria through the EU 
Charter of Fundamental Rights.  
</p>
<p>54. Roma were well integrated in Austria. Special programmes included language 
training, educational and cultural projects. Special support measures were provided to 
enhance integration in the labour market.  
</p>
<p>55. In addition to the general protection against discrimination on the basis of the 
European Human Rights Convention and the Law on Equal Treatment, since January 2010 
same-sex couples in Austria had the possibility to register their partnership. Registered 
partnerships were in most aspects equal to marriage, e.g. the rights to subsistence and 
inheritance. There was presently no consensus in Austria with regard to the adoption of 
children by same-sex couples; therefore no legislative changes in this regard could be 
expected for the time being.  
</p>
<p>56. The possibility of serving in the Austrian army already at the age of 17 was on a 
purely voluntary basis and had to be seen in the context of the Austrian education system, 
which allowed young people to complete compulsory education at an early age. However, 
participation of soldiers below age 18 in combat was strictly prohibited.  
</p>
<p>57. Detention conditions for juvenile prisoners were constantly being improved in 
Austria, including by offering possibilities of training and education. In all detention 
centers, juveniles were detained separately from adults. A special detention centre for 
juveniles had been established in Gerasdorf.  
</p>
<p>58. In the framework of the planned revision of the Alien Law, it was foreseen to 
provide legal assistance free of charge, also during detention.  
</p>
<p>59. The two Austrian National Action Plans on Human Trafficking contained a 
comprehensive list of measures for prevention, victim protection and prosecution of 
perpetrators as well as for national and international coordination and cooperation. Austria 
intensively cooperated with its neighbours in the fight against human trafficking and 
organized crime. In the framework of its development cooperation, Austria also supported 
victims in the States of origin.  
</p>
<p>60. It was not foreseen to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, since this Convention was 
in contradiction with other international obligations. Many of the rights contained therein 
were already protected through national as well as European legislation. The Convention 
would restrict the authorities&#8217; capacity to take regulatory measures in the access to the labor 
market.   </p>


<p>61. In Austria asylum-seekers had a right to basic care, including accommodation, food, 
comprehensive medical care and free education for minors. Every asylum-seeker had the 
right to free and independent legal assistance during the asylum procedure. Three months 
after their application, asylum-seekers were allowed to enter the Austrian labour market. 
</p>
<p>62. Austria was still committed to the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of Austria&#8217;s GNI 
However, due to necessary cuts in the Austrian budget, the achievement of this target by 
2015 would almost certainly be delayed. 
</p>
<p>63. Pakistan highlighted Austria&#8217;s role in strengthening the protection of human rights. 
It mentioned, in this regard, the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action and the 
ratification of almost all human rights treaties. Pakistan expressed concerns about 
xenophobic and intolerant attitudes and discrimination against minorities and migrants. It 
requested information on whether additional measures were required to address such issues. 
Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Sweden stated that, although the law and judiciary provided effective means of 
addressing individual cases of abuse, instances of use of excessive force by the police, 
especially in connection with refugees and asylum seekers, had been reported.  Sweden also 
stated that it was disconcerting to hear reports that xenophobic statements and agitation 
against a national or ethnic group were not uncommon features in the Austrian political 
sphere and in the media.  Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Slovakia stated that Austria had been a democracy which gave high respect to the 
promotion of human rights. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Uzbekistan noted that international treaty bodies had expressed the concern about 
Austria&#8217;s reported instances of hate speech by politicians, in particular targeting migrants 
and members of minorities.  Deep concern had also been expressed at the manifestations of 
neo-Nazism, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance towards migrant communities and 
those of certain ethnic backgrounds, and at their impact on children belonging to these 
groups. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Chile commended Austria&#8217;s commitment to the protection of human rights, 
manifested by the high number of human rights treaties ratified and its standing invitation 
to the special procedures. Chile noted with appreciation the support given by Austria to 
NGOs. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>68. The United States of America commended Austria for its advocacy for women&#8217;s 
rights, its support to national and international NGOs, and its role in the protection of 
civilians in armed conflicts and in combating human trafficking.  It welcomed the 
incorporation of children&#8217;s rights in the Constitution and the recent Constitution Court&#8217;s 
decision on religious groups. It noted reports of societal discrimination and xenophobia. 
The United States made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Botswana praised Austria&#8217;s commitment to continue placing as a priority the 
promotion of human rights, which was exemplified by its participation in the work of the 
Council. It noted the comprehensive measures taken in respect of violence against women. 
It requested information about measures to handle complaints of ill-treatment by law-
enforcement officials. Botswana made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>70. Cuba welcomed the approval of the National Plan for Integration and the adoption of 
other measures to fight racism. It called on Austria to address issues such as political 
statements inciting to hatred against migrants, asylum-seekers, African descendants, and 
minorities; vulnerability of Africans, Muslims and Roma to racial discrimination, 
discrimination in employment, and racial profiling. Cuba also referred to the salary gap 
between women and men. Cuba made recommendations. </p>


<p>71. Bosnia and Herzegovina praised Austria for its overall humanitarian supports and 
care for numerous refugees who had found shelter there.  It noted that one of Austria&#8217;s State 
priorities was the fight against xenophobia, racism and stereotyping and that Austria had 
developed a national action plan against human trafficking.  In this regard, it asked Austria 
to share information on the cooperation with other countries in the region.  It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Ghana commended Austria for strengthening human rights institutions by 
establishing an Independent Human Rights Advisory Board.  It noted that the situation of 
women in Austria revealed deficits in attaining the actual equality of women and men in 
many areas.  It asked about the status of the implementation of a National Action Plan for 
the Equality of Women and Men in the Labour Market.  Ghana made recommendations.  
</p>
