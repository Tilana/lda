ICAHN ENTERPRISES HOLDINGS L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
1.Description of Business and Basis of Presentation.
General
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn
Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987.
References to "we," "our" or "us" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries,
unless the context otherwise requires.
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn
Enterprises GP”), which is owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn
Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of June 30, 2016. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own
substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of
Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt, as
discussed further in Note 10, "Debt," and to the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate
1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. In addition to the above, Mr. Icahn and his
affiliates owned approximately 89.5% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of June 30, 2016.
We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses:
Investment, Automotive, Energy, Metals, Railcar, Gaming, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. We also
report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn
Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with the Holding Company.
Further information regarding our reporting segments is contained in Note 2, “Operating Units,” and Note 13, “Segment
Reporting.”
We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “'40 Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be
invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the '40 Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in
securities as our primary business. We intend to structure our investments to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than
as a corporation under the applicable publicly traded partnership rules of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) related to interim financial statements. Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. The financial information contained herein is unaudited; however, management believes all adjustments have
been made that are necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications from the prior year presentation have been made to conform to the current year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
As of June 30, 2016, our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (i) Icahn Enterprises and Icahn
Enterprises Holdings and (ii) the wholly and majority owned subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings,
in addition to variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which we are the primary beneficiary. In evaluating whether we have a
controlling financial interest in entities that we consolidate, we consider the following: (1) for voting interest entities, including
limited partnerships and similar entities that are not VIEs, we consolidate these entities in which we own a majority of the
voting interests; and (2) for VIEs, we consolidate these entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. See below for a
discussion of our VIEs. Kick-out rights (which are the rights underlying the limited partners' ability to dissolve the limited
partnership or otherwise remove the general partners and which are collectively referred to as "kick-out" rights) held through
voting interests of partnerships and similar entities that are not VIEs are considered the equivalent of the equity interests of
corporations that are not VIEs. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

ICAHN ENTERPRISES HOLDINGS L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
Except for our Investment segment, for those investments in which we own 50% or less but greater than 20%, we generally
account for such investments using the equity method, while investments in affiliates of 20% or less are accounted for under
the cost method.
Variable Interest Entities
As further discussed below, the Financial Statement Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update
("ASU") No. 2015-02 became effective during the first quarter of 2016. ASU No. 2015-02 amends the current consolidation
guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited partnerships and other similar
entities. Specifically, under the revised consolidation analysis, limited partnerships and other similar entities are considered
VIEs unless the limited partners hold substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.  Although ASU No. 2015-02 changed
the status of certain of our limited partnership entities as VIEs (as discussed below), we continue to consolidate these entities
because we are the primary beneficiaries of such entities.
Investment
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds, including Icahn Partners L.P. ("Icahn Partners") and
Icahn Partners Master Fund LP ("Master Fund") (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), through which we invest our proprietary
capital. See Note 2, "Operating Unit - Investment," for further discussion regarding our Investment segment's business.
We determined that each of the Investment Funds are considered VIEs because these limited partnerships lack both
substantive kick-out and participating rights. Because we are the general partner in each of the Investment Funds and have
significant limited partner interests in each of the Investment Funds, coupled with our significant exposure to losses and
benefits in each of the Investment Funds, we are the primary beneficiary of each of the Investment Funds and therefore
continue to consolidate each of the Investment Funds. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our Investment segment
pertain to the Investment Funds. See Note 13, "Segment Reporting," for details of our condensed balance sheets for our
Investment segment.
Energy
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority ownership in CVR Energy Inc. ("CVR"). CVR owns petroleum refining
and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses held through CVR Refining, LP (“CVR Refining”) and CVR Partners, LP
(“CVR Partners”), respectively, and each are considered VIEs. See Note 2, "Operating Unit - Energy," for further discussion
regarding our Energy segment's business.
Our Energy segment determined that CVR Refining and CVR Partners are each considered VIEs because each of these
limited partnerships lack both substantive kick-out and participating rights. In addition, our Energy segment also concluded that
based upon its general partner's roles and rights in CVR Refining and CVR Partners as afforded by their respective partnership
agreements, coupled with its exposure to losses and benefits in each of CVR Refining and CVR Partners through its significant
limited partner interests, intercompany credit facilities and services agreements, CVR determined that it is the primary
beneficiary of both CVR Refining and CVR Partners. Based upon this evaluation, CVR continues to consolidate both CVR
Refining and CVR Partners. The assets and liabilities of our Energy segment that are directly related to CVR Refining and
CVR Partners included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

Icahn Enterprises Holdings
As discussed above, Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and
conduct substantially all of our operations. We determined that Icahn Enterprises Holdings is a VIE because it lacks both
substantive kick-out and participating rights. Icahn Enterprises is the primary beneficiary of Icahn Enterprises Holdings
principally based on its 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings and therefore continues to consolidate Icahn
Enterprises Holdings. The condensed consolidated financial statements of Icahn Enterprises Holdings are included in this
Report.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, cash held at consolidated affiliated partnerships and restricted cash,
accounts receivable, due from brokers, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and due to brokers are
deemed to be reasonable estimates of their fair values because of their short-term nature.
See Note 4, “Investments and Related Matters,” and Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a detailed discussion of our
investments.
The fair value of our long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates
offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. The carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt as of
June 30, 2016 was approximately $13.0 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively. The carrying value and estimated fair value of
our long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $12.6 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively.
Restricted Cash
Our restricted cash balance was $507 million and $966 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Inventories
As further discussed in Note 2, "Operating Units - Automotive," we acquired Pep Boys - Manny, Moe and Jack ("Pep Boys") on
February 3, 2016. Pep Boys' inventories are valued at lower of cost or market and cost of goods sold is determined using the
last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. Pep Boys is currently the only subsidiary of ours that uses LIFO in determining cost of goods
sold. As inventories of Pep Boys have been revalued to fair value as a result of our acquisition on February 3, 2016, there are
immaterial differences between inventory balances calculated using LIFO as compared to inventory balances calculated using
first-in, first-out as of June 30, 2016.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidations. This ASU
amends the current consolidation guidance, including introducing a separate consolidation analysis specific to limited
partnerships and other similar entities. This ASU requires that limited partnerships and similar legal entities provide partners
with either substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner in order to be considered a
voting interest entity. The specialized consolidation model and guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities have
been eliminated. There is no longer a presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. For limited
partnerships and similar legal entities that qualify as voting interest entities, a limited partner with a controlling financial
15

ICAHN ENTERPRISES HOLDINGS L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
interest should consolidate a limited partnership. A controlling financial interest may be achieved through holding a limited
partner interest that provides substantive kick-out rights. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2015. As a result of adopting this guidance in the first quarter of 2016, while certain of our limited partnership entities are
now considered VIEs, we continue to consolidate these limited partnerships. See above for further discussion regarding our
VIEs.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends FASB ASC
Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest. The new standard requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. Given the absence of authoritative guidance
within this ASU regarding debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit, the SEC staff has stated that it would not object to an
entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs
ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this
guidance resulted in a reclassification of debt issuance costs on our condensed consolidated balance sheets to debt in the
amount of $39 million as of December 31, 2015.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,
which amends FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust
provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition dates of business combinations. Rather, this ASU requires that an acquirer
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
which the adjustment amounts are determined. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to
adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements
that have not been issued. The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our
condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, creating a new topic, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, superseding revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU requires
that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, an entity is
required to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU was amended by ASU No. 2015-14,
issued in August 2015, which deferred the original effective date by one year; the effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years,
and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, using one of two retrospective application
methods. In addition, the FASB issued other amendments during 2016 to FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, that include implementation guidance to principal versus agent considerations, guidance to identifying
performance obligations and licensing guidance and other narrow scope improvements. Early adoption is permitted only as of
the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. We are currently evaluating the impact of these guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which amends FASB ASC Topic
330, Inventory. This ASU requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and eliminates the
option that currently exists for measuring inventory at market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the
ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU
should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim period or annual reporting
period. We anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall, which amends FASB ASC Topic 825,
Financial Instruments. This ASU requires that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of
accounting or those that result in the consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in
earnings. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at
16

ICAHN ENTERPRISES HOLDINGS L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
cost minus impairment. In addition, there were other amendments to certain disclosure and presentation matters pertaining to
financial instruments, including the requirement of an entity to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of
financial instruments for disclosure purposes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied by means of a cumulative-
effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity
securities without readily determinable fair values should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the
date of adoption. Early application is permitted for certain matters only. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases.
This ASU requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating
leases under previous guidance. In addition, among other changes to the accounting for leases, this ASU retains the distinction
between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and
operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating
leases in the previous guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
Early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the transition to equity method of accounting, which amends
FASB ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This ASU eliminates the retroactive adjustment of an
investment that qualifies for the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence as if
the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments in this
ASU are effective for interim and annual fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. We
anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which amends
FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU requires financial assets measured at amortized cost
to be presented at the net amount to be collected and broadens the information, including forecasted information incorporating
more timely information, that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured. We
are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
comprehensive income, cash flows and disclosures.

Automotive
We conduct our Automotive segment through our majority ownership in Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ("Federal-
Mogul"), our wholly owned subsidiary IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC ("IEH Auto"), effective June 1, 2015, and our wholly owned
subsidiary Pep Boys, effective February 3, 2016 (see "Pep Boys Acquisition" below).
Federal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories and systems to the automotive, small
engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial and transport markets, including
customers in both the original equipment manufacturers and servicers (“OE”) market and the replacement market
(“aftermarket”). Federal-Mogul’s customers include the world’s largest automotive OEs and major distributors and retailers in
the independent aftermarket.
Federal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business unit focuses on original
equipment products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. The Motorparts business unit sells and distributes a
broad portfolio of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with products
including braking, chassis, wipers and other vehicle components.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of Federal-Mogul.
On February 28, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a proposal to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul to purchase the
remaining shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to which Federal-Mogul
shareholders would receive $7.00 per share in cash for their shares of Federal-Mogul common stock. Federal-Mogul’s board of
directors subsequently authorized the formation of a special committee that has been charged with the review and evaluation
of Icahn Enterprises' proposal and alternatives thereto. Subsequent to submitting its proposal, Icahn Enterprises advised
Federal-Mogul's board of directors that it was not considering selling its stake in Federal-Mogul at the current time.
On June 17, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a revised proposal to the board of directors of Federal-Mogul to purchase the
remaining shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to which Federal-Mogul
shareholders would receive $8.00 per share in cash for their shares of Federal-Mogul common stock, an increase from the
previous offer, as discussed above, of $7.00 in cash per share. The proposed merger process is ongoing as of the date of this
Report.
Pep Boys has 805 locations in the automotive aftermarket industry located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Pep
Boys stores are organized into a hub and spoke network consisting of Supercenters and Service & Tire Centers. Supercenters
average approximately 20,000 square feet and combine a parts and accessories store with professional service centers that
perform a full range of automotive maintenance and repair services. Most of the Pep Boys Supercenters also have a
commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts, tires and equipment to automotive repair shops and dealers.
Service & Tire Centers, which average approximately 6,000 square feet, provide automotive maintenance and repair services
in neighborhood locations that are conveniently located where our customers live or work.
IEH Auto has 21 distribution centers and 277 corporate-owned jobber stores (including 11 satellite locations) in the United
States and supports a network of more than 2,000 independent wholesalers. Through its banner and technical support
programs as well as its offering of premium auto parts, IEH Auto has built its reputation on being the partner of choice for
independent entrepreneurs eager to tap into the strength of large network.
Pep Boys and IEH Auto are being operated together in order to grow their sales to do-it-for-me ("DIFM") distributors and DIFM
service professionals, to grow their automotive service business, and to maintain their do-it-yourself customer bases by offering
the newest and broadest product assortment in the automotive aftermarket.
In addition, Federal-Mogul is operated independently from Pep Boys and IEH Auto. Transactions among Federal-Mogul, Pep
Boys and IEH Auto have been eliminated in consolidation.
Pep Boys Acquisition
On February 3, 2016, pursuant to a tender offer, Icahn Enterprises acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of Pep Boys.
On February 4, 2016, Icahn Enterprises completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Pep Boys and our
wholly owned subsidiary, IEP Parts Acquisition LLC, merged with and into Pep Boys, with Pep Boys surviving the merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises Holdings. The total value for the acquisition of Pep Boys was approximately $1.2
billion, including the fair value of our equity interest in Pep Boys just prior to our acquisition of a controlling interest.

Prior to obtaining a controlling interest, we remeasured our equity interest in Pep Boys to its acquisition-date fair value of $121
million. The difference between the carrying value and the acquisition-date fair value of our equity interest in Pep Boys was
immaterial.
A preliminary valuation of the net assets of the Pep Boys acquisition resulted in $950 million allocated to tangible net assets
and $253 million allocated to goodwill and other intangible net assets as of the acquisition date. Our allocation to other
intangible net assets includes $59 million allocated to unfavorable leases liability which is included in accrued expenses and
other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We are in the process of valuing the Pep Boys acquisition and
have recorded provisional amounts based on preliminary estimates of fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill. The
provisional measurements of net assets are subject to change as we finalize the purchase price allocation.
During the first half of 2016, the acquisitions of Pep Boys, CVR Nitrogen (as defined below), Trump (as defined below), and
other miscellaneous acquisitions, as described below, were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our condensed
consolidated financial statements.
Other Acquisition
On May 26, 2016, Federal-Mogul completed the acquisition of the assets of a filter manufacturing business in Mexico, which
primarily serves the Mexican market, for a purchase price of $25 million, net of cash acquired. The estimated fair value of net
assets acquired at the acquisition date is $25 million. Federal-Mogul is in the process of finalizing certain customary post-
closing adjustments which could affect the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Accounts Receivable, net
Federal-Mogul's subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and the United States are party to accounts receivable
factoring and securitization facilities. Gross accounts receivable transferred under these facilities were $566 million and $408
million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of those gross amounts, $556 million and $401 million,
respectively, qualify as sales as defined in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. The remaining transferred
receivables were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets within accounts receivable, net and debt. Under the terms of these facilities, Federal-Mogul is not obligated to
draw cash immediately upon the transfer of accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Federal-Mogul
had withdrawn cash related to such transferred receivables of $1 million and $1 million, respectively. Proceeds from the
transfers of accounts receivable qualifying as sales were $429 million and $410 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and $842 million and $800 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Expenses associated with transfers of receivables were $4 million and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and $7 million and $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such
expenses were recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations within other income (loss), net. Where
Federal-Mogul receives a fee to service and monitor these transferred receivables, such fees are sufficient to offset the costs
and as such, a servicing asset or liability is not incurred as a result of such activities.
Certain of the facilities contain terms that require Federal-Mogul to share in the credit risk of the sold receivables. The
maximum exposure to Federal-Mogul associated with certain of these facilities' terms were $4 million and $11 million as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Restructuring
Federal-Mogul recorded restructuring expenses of $6 million and $27 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $21 million and $39 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These
restructuring expenses, primarily consisting of employee costs and headcount reductions, pertain to all restructuring programs
that Federal-Mogul has initiated in order to improve its operating performance.
Federal-Mogul's restructuring expenses are aimed at optimizing its cost structure. Federal-Mogul expects to complete these
programs in 2017 and incur additional restructuring and other charges of less than $1 million. For programs previously initiated
in prior periods, Federal-Mogul expects to complete these programs in 2018 and incur additional restructuring charges of
approximately $4 million.

Energy
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority ownership in CVR. CVR is a diversified holding company primarily
engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining and
CVR Partners, respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels.
CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") and ammonia. As of
June 30, 2016, CVR owned 100% of the general partners of CVR Refining and CVR Partners and approximately 66% of the
common units of CVR Refining and approximately 34% of the common units of CVR Partners.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 82.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR. In addition, as of June 30,
2016, we owned approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding common units of CVR Refining directly.
CVR Nitrogen, LP Acquisition
On April 1, 2016, CVR Partners completed its acquisition of CVR Nitrogen, LP ("CVR Nitrogen") (formerly known as East
Dubuque Nitrogen Partners, L.P. and also formerly known as Rentech Nitrogen Partners L.P.) and CVR Nitrogen GP, LLC
("CVR Nitrogen GP") (formerly known as East Dubuque Nitrogen GP, LLC and also formerly known as Rentech Nitrogen GP,
LLC). In connection with this acquisition, CVR Partners issued approximately 40.2 million common units to CVR Nitrogen
common unitholders with a fair market value of $336 million and paid $99 million in cash consideration and assumed $368
million fair value of debt. The total fair value of the purchase price consideration to be allocated was $440 million and the
estimated fair value of net assets acquired at the acquisition date was $440 million. There were no identifiable intangible
assets related to this acquisition. CVR Partners is in the process of finalizing certain customary post-closing adjustments which
could affect the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
CVR Nitrogen's debt arrangements that remained in place after the closing date of the acquisition included $320 million of its
6.5% notes due 2021, the majority of which were purchased in June 2016, as discussed further in Note 10, "Debt." On April 1,
2016, in connection with the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen, CVR Partners entered into a new $320 million senior term loan
facility with AEPC ("AEPC Facility"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises, as the lender. In connection with the
repayment of the substantial majority of CVR Nitrogen's 6.5% notes due 2021, the AEPC Facility was terminated.
CVR Nitrogen, located in East Dubuque, Illinois, owns and operates a nitrogen fertilizer facility, producing primarily ammonia
and UAN using natural gas as its facility's primary feedstock. The primary reasons for the mergers were to expand CVR
Partners' geographical footprint, diversify its raw material feedstocks, widen its customer reach and increase its potential cash-
flow generation.
Petroleum Business
CVR Refining's petroleum business includes a 115,000 barrels per calendar day ("bpcd") rated capacity complex full coking
medium-sour crude oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas and a 70,000 bpcd rated capacity complex crude oil refinery in
Wynnewood, Oklahoma. The Coffeyville refinery is situated on approximately 440 acres in southeast Kansas, approximately
100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma, a major crude oil trading and storage hub. The Wynnewood refinery is situated on
approximately 400 acres located approximately 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 miles from
Cushing, Oklahoma.
In addition to the refineries, CVR's petroleum business owns and operates the following: (i) a crude oil gathering system with a
gathering capacity of over 65,000 barrels per day ("bpd") serving Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado and
Texas; (ii) a 170,000 bpd pipeline system (supported by approximately 340 miles of active owned and leased pipeline) that
transports crude oil to its Coffeyville refinery from its Broome Station facility near Caney, Kansas; (iii) approximately 6.4 million
barrels of company owned and leased crude oil storage capacity; (iv) a rack marketing division supplying product through
tanker trucks directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma
and at throughput terminals on Magellan and NuStar Energy, LP's ("NuStar") refined products distribution systems; and (v) over
4.5 million barrels of combined refinery related storage capacity.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Business
CVR Partners' nitrogen fertilizer business consists of a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility located in Coffeyville, Kansas
that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer and a nitrogen fertilizer
manufacturing facility located in East Dubuque, Illinois that uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer (as a result of the
acquisition of CVR Nitrogen as discussed above). The facility in Coffeyville includes a 1,300 ton-per-day ammonia unit, a

Railcar
We conduct our Railcar segment through our majority ownership interest in ARI and our wholly owned subsidiary American
Railcar Leasing, LLC ("ARL").
ARI manufactures railcars that are offered for sale or lease, custom and standard railcar components and other industrial
products, primarily aluminum and special alloy steel castings. These products are sold to various types of companies including
shippers, leasing companies, industrial companies, and Class I railroads. ARI leases railcars that it manufactures to certain
markets that include the chemical, mineral, petrochemical, food and agriculture, and energy industries. ARI provides railcar
services consisting of railcar repair services, ranging from full to light repair, engineering and on-site repairs and maintenance
through its various repair facilities, including mini repair shops and mobile repair units.
ARL is engaged in the business of leasing railcars to customers with specific requirements whose products require specialized
railcars dedicated to transporting, storing, and preserving the integrity of their products. These products are primarily in the
chemical, mineral, petrochemical, food and agriculture, and energy industries.
Transactions between ARI and ARL have been eliminated in consolidation.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 61.2% of the total outstanding common stock of ARI.
Gaming
We conduct our Gaming segment through our majority ownership in Tropicana and our wholly owned subsidiary, Trump
Entertainment Resorts, Inc. (“Trump”) which owns and operates Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort. As discussed below, we
obtained control and began consolidating the results of Trump upon its emergence from bankruptcy on February 26, 2016.
Tropicana owns and operates a diversified, multi-jurisdictional collection of casino gaming properties. The eight casino
facilities it operates feature approximately 392,000 square feet of gaming space with 8,000 slot machines, 280 table games
and 5,500 hotel rooms with two casino facilities located in Nevada and one in each of Mississippi, Missouri, Indiana,
Louisiana, New Jersey and Aruba.
Trump owns and operates Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort ("Trump Taj Mahal") which is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
 Trump Taj Mahal features approximately 160,000 square feet of gaming space with 2,500 slot machines, 130 table games and
2,000 hotel rooms. In addition, Trump also owns an idled casino property in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino, which ceased operations in September 2014.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 68.5% of the total outstanding common stock of Tropicana.
Trump Acquisition
On September 9, 2014, Trump and its subsidiaries filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware in Wilmington, Delaware. On February 26, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), Trump emerged from
bankruptcy. Icahn Enterprises was the sole holder of Trump's senior secured debt. On the Effective Date, among other things,
the existing pre-petition senior secured debt with a face amount of $286 million held by Icahn Enterprises was extinguished
and

converted into 100% of Trump’s New Common Stock (as defined in the bankruptcy plan). As a result, we became the 100%
owner of Trump after reorganization and accordingly, obtained control and began consolidating the results of Trump on
February 26, 2016. We accounted for this this acquisition as a business combination under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business
Combinations.
Prior to obtaining a controlling interest in Trump upon its emergence from bankruptcy, we remeasured our interest in Trump to
its acquisition-date fair value of $126 million, resulting in a $16 million gain on investment activities.
A preliminary valuation of the net assets of the Trump business resulted in $112 million allocated to tangible net assets and
$14 million to intangible assets. We are in the process of valuing the Trump acquisition and have recorded provisional
amounts based on preliminary estimates of fair value of net assets acquired. The provisional measurements of net assets are
subject to change as we finalize the purchase price allocation. Additionally, at the acquisition date, Trump had a full valuation
allowance on its deferred tax assets.  We are in the process of obtaining the information necessary for evaluating the valuation
allowance and deferred tax assets acquired.  It is possible that a portion of the valuation allowance on the Trump deferred tax
assets will be adjusted in future periods. 
Mining
We conduct our Mining segment through our majority ownership in Ferrous Resources. We obtained control of and
consolidated the results of Ferrous Resources during the second quarter of 2015.
Ferrous Resources acquired certain rights to iron ore mineral resources in Brazil and develops mining operations and related
infrastructure to produce and sell iron ore products to the global steel industry. Ferrous Resources has acquired significant iron
ore assets in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, known as Viga, Viga Norte, Esperança, Serrinha and Santanense. In addition,
Ferrous Resources has acquired certain mineral rights near Jacuípe in the State of Bahia, Brazil. Of the assets acquired, Viga,
Esperança and Santanense are already extracting and producing iron ore, while the other assets are at an early stage of
exploration.
In response to the current depressed iron ore price environment, Ferrous Resources decided to temporarily suspend
Esperança's and Santanense's operations during the first quarter of 2015 in order to study alternatives to further reduce cost of
production and improve product quality and therefore to improve profitability and margin per metric ton.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 77.2% of the total outstanding common stock of Ferrous Resources.
Food Packaging
We conduct our Food Packaging segment through our majority ownership in Viskase Companies, Inc. ("Viskase"). Viskase is a
worldwide leader in the production and sale of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings for the processed meat and poultry
industry. Viskase currently operates nine manufacturing facilities, six distribution centers and three service centers throughout
North America, Europe, South America and Asia and derived approximately 69% of its total net sales from customers located
outside the United States for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned approximately 73.3% of the total outstanding common stock of Viskase.
Real Estate
Our Real Estate segment consists of rental real estate, property development and club activities.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned 15 commercial rental real estate properties. Our property development operations are run

Icahn, to acquire the remaining 25% economic interest in ARL not already owned by us. Pursuant to this contribution
agreement, we contributed 685,367 newly issued depositary units of Icahn Enterprises to IRL in exchange for the remaining
25% economic interest in ARL. As a result of the transaction, we own a 100.0% economic interest in ARL. This transaction was
authorized by the independent committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises. The independent
committee was advised by independent counsel and retained an independent financial advisor which rendered a fairness
opinion.
Agreements with ACF Industries LLC
ARI has from time to time purchased components from ACF Industries LLC ("ACF"), an affiliate of Mr. Icahn, under a long-term
agreement, as well as on a purchase order basis. ACF is a manufacturer and fabricator of specialty railcar parts and
miscellaneous steel products. Under the manufacturing services agreement entered into in 1994 and amended in 2005, ACF
agreed to manufacture and distribute, at ARI’s instruction, various railcar components. In consideration for these services, ARI
agreed to pay ACF based on agreed upon rates. The agreement automatically renews unless written notice is provided by ARI.
Also in April 2015, ARI entered into a parts purchasing and sale agreement with ACF. The agreement was unanimously
approved by the independent directors of ARI’s and Icahn Enterprises' audit committee. Under this agreement, ARI and ACF
may, from time to time, purchase and sell to each other certain parts for railcars ("Railcar Parts"). ARI also provides a non-
exclusive and non-assignable license of certain intellectual property related to the manufacture and sale of Railcar Parts to
ARI. The buyer under the agreement must pay the market price of the parts as determined in the agreement or as stated on a
public website for all ARI customers. ARI may provide designs, engineering and purchasing support, including all materials
and components to ACF. Subject to certain early termination events, the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020.

ARI purchased $1 million and $7 million of components from ACF for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $3 million and $9 million of components from ACF for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
In January 2013, ARI entered into a purchasing and engineering services agreement and license with ACF. The agreement
was unanimously approved by the independent directors of ARI’s and Icahn Enterprises' audit committee on the basis that the
terms of the agreement were not materially less favorable to ARI than those that could have been obtained in a comparable
transaction with an unrelated person. Under this agreement, ARI provides purchasing support and engineering services to
ACF in connection with ACF’s manufacture and sale of tank railcars at its facility in Milton, Pennsylvania. Additionally, ARI has
granted ACF a nonexclusive, non-assignable license to certain of ARI’s intellectual property, including certain designs,
specifications, processes and manufacturing know-how required to manufacture and sell tank railcars during the term of the
agreement. In November 2015, ARI and ACF amended this agreement to, among other provisions, extend the termination date
to December 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, subject to certain early termination events.
In consideration for the services and license provided by ARI to ACF in conjunction with the agreement, ACF pays ARI a
royalty and, if any, a share of the net profits ("ACF Profits") earned on each railcar manufactured and sold by ACF under the
agreement, in an aggregate amount equal to 30% of such ACF Profits, as calculated under the agreement. ACF Profits are net
of certain of ACF’s start-up and shutdown expenses and certain maintenance capital. If no ACF Profits are realized on a railcar
manufactured and sold by ACF pursuant to the agreement, ARI will still be entitled to the royalty for such railcar and will not
share in any losses incurred by ACF in connection therewith. In addition, any railcar components supplied by ARI to ACF for
the manufacture of these railcars are provided at fair market value.
Under the agreement, ACF had the exclusive right to manufacture and sell subject tank railcars for any new orders scheduled
for delivery to customers on or before January 31, 2014. ARI has the exclusive right to any sales opportunities for such tank
railcars for any new orders scheduled for delivery after that date and through termination of the agreement. ARI also has the
right to assign any sales opportunity to ACF, and ACF has the right, but not the obligation, to accept such sales opportunity.
Any sales opportunity accepted by ACF will not be reflected in ARI’s orders or backlog.
ARI's revenues under this agreement were less than $1 million and $4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $1 million and $6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such
revenues were recorded for sales of railcar components to ACF and for royalties and profits on railcars sold by ACF.
In April 2015, ARI entered into a repair services and support agreement with ACF. The agreement was unanimously approved
by the independent directors of ARI’s and Icahn Enterprises' audit committee. Under this agreement, ARI provides certain sales
and administrative and technical services, materials and purchasing support and engineering services to ACF to provide repair
and retrofit services ("Repair Services"). Additionally, ARI provides a non-exclusive and non-assignable license of certain
intellectual property related to the Repair Services for railcars. ARI receives 30% of the net profits (as defined in the agreement)
for Repair Services related to all railcars not owned by ARL or its subsidiaries and 20% of the net profits for Repair Services
related to all railcars owned by ARL or its subsidiaries, if any, but does not absorb any losses incurred by ACF.
Under the agreement, ARI has the exclusive right to sales opportunities related to Repair Services, except for any sales
opportunity related to Repair Services presented to ACF by ARL with respect to ARL-owned railcars. ARI also has the right to
assign any sales opportunities related to Repair Services to ACF, and ACF has the right, but not the obligation, to accept such
sales opportunity. Subject to certain early termination events, the agreement terminates on December 31, 2020.
For each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, revenues of less than $1 million were recorded under this
agreement. No revenues were recorded under this agreement for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
In April 2013, AEP Leasing LLC entered into an agreement (the "ACF Agreement") with ACF whereby AEP Leasing would
purchase railcars from ACF. The ACF Agreement was assumed by ARL in connection with our purchase of economic interest
in ARL. The ACF Agreement was unanimously approved by Icahn Enterprises' audit committee consisting of independent
directors, who were advised by independent counsel and an independent financial advisor on the basis that the terms were not
less favorable than those terms that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction with an unaffiliated third party.
Under this agreement, purchases of railcars from ACF were $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. There were no
purchases of railcars from ACF under this agreement for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

5.Fair Value Measurements.
U.S. GAAP requires enhanced disclosures about investments and non-recurring non-financial assets and non-financial
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value and has established a hierarchal disclosure framework that prioritizes
and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments or non-financial assets and liabilities at fair
value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics
specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from
actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used
in measuring fair value.
Investments and non-financial assets and/or liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one
of the following categories:
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of
investments included in Level 1 include listed equities and listed derivatives. We do not adjust the quoted price for these
investments, even in situations where we hold a large position.
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of
the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments that
are generally included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities and
certain over-the-counter derivatives. The inputs and assumptions of our Level 2 investments are derived from market
observable sources including reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and other pertinent data.
Level 3 - Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and non-financial asset and/or liability and include situations
where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment or non-financial asset and/or liability. The inputs into the
determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Fair value is determined using comparable
market transactions and other valuation methodologies, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk
factors.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an
investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment and consideration of factors specific to the investment. Significant transfers, if any, between the levels within the fair
value hierarchy are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period when changes in circumstances require such transfers.

months ended June 30, 2015 relating to investments still held at June 30 of each respective period and which are included in
net (loss) gain from investment activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
During the first quarter of 2016, we transferred out a Level 3 corporate debt investment in the amount of $126 million.  See Note
2, "Operating Units - Gaming," for further discussion regarding this transaction.
During 2015, the Holding Company made a certain investment classified as trading securities in the amount of $100 million,
which is considered a Level 3 investment due to unobservable market data and is measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
We purchased an additional $50 million of this investment during the six months ended June 30, 2016. We determined the fair
value of this investment using internally developed models and other valuation techniques. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the fair value of this investment was $207 million and $157 million, respectively.
During 2015, the Holding Company obtained control of, and consolidated, Ferrous Resources, which was previously
considered a Level 3 investment due to unobservable market data. The fair value of our investment in Ferrous Resources
immediately prior to obtaining control was $36 million, which was transferred out of Level 3 investments during the second
quarter of 2015.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis for Which We Use Level 3 Inputs to Determine Fair Value
We have certain investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity within our Gaming segment since we have the
ability and intent to hold the bonds to maturity. The debt securities are classified as Level 3 investments measured at fair value
on a non-recurring basis and therefore are excluded from the roll forward of Level 3 investments measured on a recurring basis
above. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of these debt securities was $21 million and $9 million,
respectively, with the increase resulting from our acquisition of Trump during the first quarter of 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our Energy segment recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $574 million,
which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to this segment. Refer to Note 8, "Goodwill and
Intangible Assets, Net," for further discussion. Additionally, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, our Automotive
segment recorded $3 million of impairment relating to property, plant and equipment in connection with its restructuring
activities.
6.Financial Instruments.
Certain derivative contracts with a single counterparty executed by the Investment Funds, by our Automotive segment with a
single counterparty or by our Energy segment with a single counterparty, or by our Holding Company with a single counterparty
are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis where a legal right of offset exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Values
for the derivative financial instruments, principally swaps, forwards, over-the-counter options and other conditional and
exchange contracts, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis. As a result, the net exposure to counterparties is reported in
either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Investment Segment and Holding Company
The Investment Funds currently maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with financial institutions. Certain account
balances may not be covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, while other accounts may exceed federally
insured limits. The Investment Funds have prime broker arrangements in place with multiple prime brokers as well as a
custodian bank. The Investment Funds also have relationships with several financial institutions with which they trade
derivative and other financial instruments.
In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds and the Holding Company may trade various financial instruments and
enter into certain investment activities, which may give rise to off-balance-sheet risks, with the objective of capital appreciation
or as economic hedges against other securities or the market as a whole. The Investment Funds' and the Holding Company's
investments may include futures, options, swaps and securities sold, not yet purchased. These financial instruments represent
future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments or to exchange an amount of cash based on the change in
an underlying instrument at specific terms at specified future dates. Risks arise with these financial instruments from potential
counterparty non-performance and from changes in the market values of underlying instruments.
Securities sold, not yet purchased, at fair value represent obligations to deliver the specified security, thereby creating a liability
to repurchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance-sheet risk, as
the satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our
investments in securities and amounts due from brokers are partially restricted until we satisfy the obligation to deliver the
securities sold, not yet purchased.
The Investment Funds and the Holding Company may enter into derivative contracts, including swap contracts, futures
contracts and option contracts. The Investment Funds may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with the
objective of capital appreciation or to economically hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks on all or a portion of
their non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.
The Investment Funds and the Holding Company have entered into various types of swap contracts with other counterparties.
These agreements provide that they are entitled to receive or are obligated to pay in cash an amount equal to the increase or
decrease, respectively, in the value of the underlying shares, debt and other instruments that are the subject of the contracts,
during the period from inception of the applicable agreement to its expiration. In addition, pursuant to the terms of such
agreements, they are entitled to receive or obligated to pay other amounts, including interest, dividends and other distributions
made in respect of the underlying shares, debt and other instruments during the specified time frame. They are also required to
pay to the counterparty a floating interest rate equal to the product of the notional amount multiplied by an
29

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016 (Unaudited)
agreed-upon rate, and they receive interest on any cash collateral that they post to the counterparty at the federal funds or
LIBOR rate in effect for such period.
The Investment Funds and the Holding Company may trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or
sell a specified quantity of a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, security, currency or cash at a specified
price and specified future date unless the contract is closed before the delivery date. Payments (or variation margin) are made
or received by the Investment Funds and the Holding Company each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of
the contract, and the whole value change is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss by the Investment Funds and the Holding
Company. When the contract is closed, the Investment Funds and the Holding Company record a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.
The Investment Funds and the Holding Company may utilize forward contracts to seek to protect their assets denominated in
foreign currencies and precious metals holdings from losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and spot rates. The
Investment Funds' and the Holding Company's exposure to credit risk associated with non-performance of such forward
contracts is limited to the unrealized gains or losses inherent in such contracts, which are recognized in other assets and
accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Investment Funds may also enter into foreign currency contracts for purposes other than hedging denominated securities.
When entering into a foreign currency forward contract, the Investment Funds agree to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of
foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon future date unless the contract is closed before such date. The
Investment Funds record unrealized gains or losses on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward
foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into such contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date.
The Investment Funds may also purchase and write option contracts. As a writer of option contracts, the Investment Funds
receive a premium at the outset and then bear the market risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the underlying financial
instrument. As a result of writing option contracts, the Investment Funds are obligated to purchase or sell, at the holder's option,
the underlying financial instrument. Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance-sheet risk, as the Investment Funds'
satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. At June 30,
2016, there were no put options written by the Investment Funds as these contracts expired during the second quarter of 2016.
At December 31, 2015, the maximum payout amounts relating to certain put options written by the Investment Funds were
approximately $5.9 billion, of which approximately $5.9 billion related to covered put options on existing short positions on
certain stock and credit indices. As of December 31, 2015, there were unrealized gains of $67 million with respect to these put
options.
Certain terms of the Investment Funds' contracts with derivative counterparties, which are standard and customary to such
contracts, contain certain triggering events that would give the counterparties the right to terminate the derivative instruments. In
such events, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net
liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all of the Investment Funds' derivative instruments with credit-risk-related
contingent features that are in a liability position at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $448 million and $33 million,
respectively.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Investment Funds had approximately $423 million and $883 million,
respectively, posted as collateral for derivative positions, including those derivative instruments with credit-risk-related
contingent features; these amounts are included in cash held at consolidated affiliated partnerships and restricted cash in our
condensed consolidated balance sheets.
U.S. GAAP requires the disclosure of information about obligations under certain guarantee arrangements. Such guarantee
arrangements requiring disclosure include contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the
guaranteed party based on another entity's failure to perform under an agreement as well as indirect guarantees of the
indebtedness of others.
Each Investment Fund's assets may be held in one or more accounts maintained for the Investment Fund by its prime brokers
or at other brokers or custodian banks, which may be located in various jurisdictions. The prime brokers, brokers and custodian
banks are subject to various laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions in the event of their insolvency. Accordingly, the
practical effect of these laws and their application to the Investment Funds' assets may be subject to substantial variations,
limitations and uncertainties. The insolvency of any of the prime brokers, brokers, custodian banks or clearing corporations
may result in the loss of all or a substantial portion of the Investment Funds' assets or in a significant delay in the Investment
Funds' having access to those assets.

Credit concentrations may arise from investment activities and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political
factors. The Investment Funds and the Holding Company routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial
services industry, resulting in credit concentration with respect to this industry. In the ordinary course of business, the
Investment Funds and the Holding Company may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty.
The Investment Funds and the Holding Company seek to mitigate these risks by actively monitoring exposures, collateral
requirements and the creditworthiness of our counterparties.
Automotive
Commodity Price Risk
Federal-Mogul's production processes are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials that are exposed to price
fluctuations on the open market. The primary purpose of Federal-Mogul's commodity price forward contract activity is to
manage the volatility associated with forecasted purchases. Federal-Mogul monitors its commodity price risk exposures
regularly to maximize the overall effectiveness of its commodity forward contracts. Principal raw materials hedged include
copper, nickel, tin, zinc, high-grade aluminum and aluminum alloy. Forward contracts are used to mitigate commodity price risk
associated with raw materials, generally related to purchases forecast for up to 15 months in the future.
Federal-Mogul had commodity price hedge contracts outstanding with combined notional values of $21 million and $28 million
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, substantially all of which mature within one year in each of the
respective periods and all of which were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Federal-Mogul had a net
liability balance of zero and $3 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, with respect to these hedging
positions. Unrealized net losses of zero and $2 million were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Foreign Currency Risk
Federal-Mogul manufactures and sells its products in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Africa. As a result,
Federal-Mogul's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates
or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which it manufactures and sells its products. Federal-Mogul's operating
results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various global currencies.
Federal-Mogul generally tries to use natural hedges within its foreign currency activities, including the matching of revenues
and costs, to minimize foreign currency risk. Where natural hedges are not in place, Federal-Mogul considers managing certain
aspects of its foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts.
Principal currencies hedged have historically included the euro, British pound and Polish zloty. Foreign currency forwards are
also used in conjunction with Federal-Mogul's commodity hedging program. As part of its hedging program, Federal-Mogul
attempts to limit hedge ineffectiveness by matching terms of the commodity purchases with the hedging instrument. Federal-
Mogul does not hold any foreign currency price hedge contracts as of June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments including cash equivalents, derivative contracts, and accounts receivable, expose Federal-Mogul to
counter-party credit risk for non-performance. Federal-Mogul’s counterparties for cash equivalents and derivative contracts are
banks and financial institutions that meet its requirement of high credit standing. Federal-Mogul's counterparties for derivative
contracts are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivatives. Federal-Mogul
manages its credit risk through policies requiring minimum credit standing and limiting credit exposure to any one counter-party
and through monitoring counter-party credit risks. Federal-Mogul's concentration of credit risk related to derivative contracts at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was not material.
Energy
CVR is subject to price fluctuations caused by supply conditions, weather, economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations and
other factors. To manage price risk on crude oil and other inventories and to fix margins on certain future production, CVR from
time to time enters into various commodity derivative transactions.
CVR has adopted accounting standards that impose extensive record-keeping requirements in order to designate a derivative
financial instrument as a hedge. CVR holds derivative instruments, such as exchange-traded crude oil futures and

certain over-the-counter forward swap agreements, which it believes provide an economic hedge on future transactions, but
such instruments are not designated as hedges for GAAP purposes. Gains or losses related to the change in fair value and
periodic settlements of these derivative instruments are included in other income (loss), net in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.
Commodity Swaps
CVR Refining enters into commodity swap contracts in order to fix the margin on a portion of future production. The physical
volumes are not exchanged and these contracts are net settled with cash. The contract fair value of the commodity swaps is
reflected on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value currently recognized in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 2) are considered to
determine the fair values for the purpose of marking to market the hedging instruments at each period end. At December 31,
2015, CVR Refining had open commodity hedging instruments consisting of 2.5 million barrels of crack spreads primarily to fix
the margin on a portion of its future gasoline and distillate production. During the first quarter of 2016, CVR Refining settled a
number of the open crack spread positions and entered into offsetting positions to effectively lock in the gain on the remaining
positions to be settled in 2016. At June 30, 2016, CVR Refining had open commodity hedging instruments consisting of 0.4
million barrels net of crack spreads and 0.6 million barrels of price and basis swaps. The fair value of the outstanding contracts
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was a net asset of $13 million and $45 million, respectively. CVR Refining
recognized a net loss of $2 million and $12 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net
loss of $3 million and $63 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in other
income (loss), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Interest Rate Swaps
Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC ("CRNF"), a subsidiary of CVR Partners, had two floating-to-fixed interest rate
swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with a portion of its $125 million floating rate term
debt, which matured in April 2016. The aggregate notional amount covered under these agreements totaled $63 million (split
evenly between the two agreements) which commenced on August 12, 2011 and expired on February 12, 2016. The interest
rate swaps agreements terminated in February 2016. The realized losses on the interest rate swaps reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense was less than $1 million for each of the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

The short notional amount on our credit default swap positions is approximately $2.6 billion and $10.0 billion as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. However, because credit spreads cannot compress below zero, our downside
short notional exposure to loss is approximately $0.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.
The short notional amount on certain of our interest rate contracts with a six month duration is approximately $16.0 billion as
of December 31, 2015. We assume that interest rates will not fall below zero and therefore our downside short notional
exposure to loss on these contracts is $74 million (of the total $137 million disclosed in the above table) as of December 31,
2015.

For our segments discussed below, the fair values of our reporting units are based upon consideration of various valuation
methodologies, one of which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved
(“Discounted Cash Flow” or “DCF”). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including
judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future
cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on
assumed growth rates. We believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the
underlying businesses. The discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used
in a DCF are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital of a market participant. Such estimates are derived
from our analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market
participant perspective.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Automotive
As further discussed in Note 2, "Operating Units - Automotive," during the first quarter of 2016, we acquired Pep Boys and
allocated $48 million to trademarks and brand names, $15 million to customer relationships, $3 million to other definite-lived
intangible assets and $246 million to goodwill as of the acquisition date. We are in the process of valuing the Pep Boys
acquisition and have recorded provisional amounts based on preliminary estimates of fair value of net assets acquired,
including goodwill. The provisional measurements of net assets are subject to change as we finalize the purchase price
allocation. The Pep Boys acquisition is not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
We perform the annual goodwill impairment test for our Automotive segment as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently if
impairment indicators exist. Based on "Step 2" of the goodwill impairment analysis of our Automotive segment's Motorparts
reporting unit, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $312 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the
complexity in the "Step 2" goodwill impairment analysis, we are currently expecting to finalize our Automotive segment's
goodwill impairment for the Motorparts reporting unit during the third quarter of 2016 and any resulting difference in the amount
of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.
Energy
Due to worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Petroleum reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill
impairment analysis during the first quarter of 2016. Based on this analysis, our Energy segment recognized a goodwill
impairment charge of $574 million, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Petroleum
reporting unit. Due to the complexity in the "Step 2" goodwill impairment test performed during the first quarter of 2016, we
expect to finalize the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment during the third quarter of 2016 and any
resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.
We perform the annual goodwill impairment test for our Energy segment as of April 30 of each year, or more frequently if
impairment indicators exist. Due to worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit, we performed an
interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on "Step 2" of the goodwill impairment analysis
of our Energy segment's Fertilizer reporting unit, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $253 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Fertilizer reporting unit. Due
to the complexity in the "Step 2" goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2015, we finalized the
assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment for the Fertilizer reporting unit during the first quarter of 2016 and
noted that no additional adjustments to goodwill were required for the first quarter of 2016.
Railcar
We perform the annual goodwill impairment test as of November 1 of each year for our Railcar segment. For purposes of
goodwill impairment testing, our Railcar segment's manufacturing reporting unit is the only reporting unit with allocated
goodwill. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is
greater than its carrying amount. If, however, we had determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the
reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, then we would perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. In
evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, we
considered various qualitative and quantitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, railcar industry trends and the fact
that our railcar manufacturing reporting unit has historical positive operating cash flows that we anticipate will continue. After
assessing these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not the fair value of our railcar manufacturing reporting unit
was greater than its carrying amount, and therefore no further testing was necessary.
Gaming
As further discussed in Note 2, "Operating Units - Gaming," during the first quarter of 2016, we acquired Trump and allocated
$13 million to trademarks and brand names and $1 million to customer relationships as of the acquisition date. We are in the
process of valuing the Trump acquisition and have recorded provisional amounts based on preliminary estimates of fair value
of net assets acquired. The provisional measurements of net assets are subject to change as we finalize the purchase price
allocation. The Trump acquisition is not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Federal-Mogul
During the first quarter of 2016, Federal-Mogul increased its borrowing capacity under a certain revolving credit facility (the
"Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility") by $50 million to $600 million. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the outstanding balance on the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility was $390 million and $340 million, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the borrowing availability under the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver
Facility was $171 million and $170 million, respectively. Federal-Mogul had $39 million and $40 million of letters of credit
outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, pertaining to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver
Facility. To the extent letters of credit associated with the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility are issued, there will
be a corresponding decrease in borrowings available under this facility.
IEH Auto and Pep Boys
On November 25, 2015, IEH Auto entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the "IEH Auto Credit
Facility") with Bank of America as agent, sole lead arranger, and sole bookrunner for $125 million. On January 25, 2016, the
IEH Auto Credit Facility was amended and restated to include Citizens Bank as the documentation agent and to increase the
revolver commitments to $210 million.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the IEH Auto Credit Facility had an outstanding balance of $95 million and $75
million, respectively, and $3 million and $3 million, respectively, in letters of credit.  As of June 30, 2016, the availability on the
IEH Auto Credit Facility was $48 million.
Pep Boys has a revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and other parties thereto
providing for borrowings of up to $300 million, with an original maturity date of July 26, 2016. The maturity date of this revolving
credit agreement was extended to October 24, 2016. The interest rate on this facility is LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% to 2.50%
for LIBOR rate borrowings or Prime plus 1.00% to 1.50% for Prime rate borrowings. The margin is based upon the then current
availability under the facility. As of June 30, 2016, Pep Boys had $60 million outstanding under the facility and $43 million of
availability was utilized to support outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account the borrowing base requirements (including
reduction for amounts outstanding under the trade payable program), as of June 30, 2016, there was $77 million of availability
remaining under the facility.

by the issuers. Interest on the CVR Partners 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of
each year, beginning on December 15, 2016. The CVR Partners 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all
of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership’s existing subsidiaries.
The CVR Partners 2023 Notes were issued at a $16 million discount, which is being amortized over the term of the CVR
Partners 2023 Notes as interest expense using the effective-interest method. CVR Partners received $623 million of cash
proceeds, net of the original issue discount and underwriting fees, but before deducting other third-party fees and expenses
associated with the offering. The net proceeds from the sale of the CVR Partners 2023 Notes were used to: (i) repay all
amounts outstanding under the senior term loan credit facility with Coffeyville Resources, LLC; (ii) finance the CVR Nitrogen
2021 Notes tender offer (discussed below) and (iii) to pay related fees and expenses.
The CVR Partners 2023 Notes contain customary covenants for a financing of this type that, among other things, restrict CVR
Partners' ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase
CVR Partners' units or redeem or repurchase its subordinated debt; (iii) make investments; (iv) incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness or issue preferred units; (v) create or incur certain liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or
other payments from CVR Partners' restricted subsidiaries to CVR Partners; (vii) consolidate, merge or transfer all or
substantially all of CVR Partners' assets; (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates; and (ix) create unrestricted subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2016, CVR Partners was in compliance with the covenants contained in the CVR Partners 2023 Notes.
CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes
Prior to the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen by CVR Partners, CVR Nitrogen and CVR Nitrogen Finance Corporation (together the
"CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers") issued $320 million of 6.5% senior secured notes due 2021 (the "CVR Nitrogen 2021
Notes"). The CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15
and October 15 of each year. The CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2021, unless repurchased or
redeemed earlier in accordance with their terms.
On April 29, 2016, the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers commenced a cash tender offer (the "CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer") to
purchase any and all of the outstanding CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes. In connection with the CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer, the
CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers solicited the consents of holders of the notes to certain proposed amendments to the
indenture governing the notes (the "Consent Solicitation"). As a result of the CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer, on June 10, 2016, the
CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers repurchased $315 million of the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes, representing approximately
98.5% of the total outstanding principal amount of the notes at a purchase price of $1,015 per $1,000 in principal amount. The
total amount paid related to the CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer was $320 million, including a premium of $5 million. Additionally,
the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers paid $3 million for accrued and unpaid interest for the tendered notes up to the
settlement date. CVR Partners received the requisite consents in respect of the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes in connection with
the Consent Solicitation to amend the indenture governing the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes. As a result, the CVR Nitrogen 2021
Notes Issuers executed a supplemental indenture, dated as of June 10, 2016, which eliminated or modified substantially all of
the restrictive covenants relating to CVR Nitrogen and its subsidiaries, eliminated all events of default other than failure to pay
principal, premium or interest on the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes, eliminated all conditions to satisfaction and discharge, and
released the liens on the collateral securing the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes. The repurchase of a portion of the CVR Nitrogen
2021 Notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
Concurrently with, but separately from the CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer, the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes Issuers also commenced
an offer to purchase all of the outstanding CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
as required as a result of the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen (the "Change of Control Offer"). The offer expired on June 28, 2016.
As a result of the Change of Control Offer, CVR Partners repurchased less than $1 million of CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes at a
purchase price of $1,010 per $1,000 in principal amount. The total amount paid related to the Change of Control offer was less
than $1 million, including a nominal amount of premium and accrued and unpaid interest.
$4 million of principal amount of the CVR Nitrogen 2021 Notes that remained outstanding following the consummation of the
CVR Nitrogen Tender Offer and the Change of Control Offer will continue to be obligations of CVR Partners.

11.Pension, Other Post-employment Benefits and Employee Benefit Plans.
Federal-Mogul, ARI and Viskase each sponsor several defined benefit pension plans (the ''Pension Benefits'') (and, in the case
of Viskase, its pension plans include defined contribution plans). Additionally, Federal-Mogul and Viskase each sponsors
OPEB
health care and life insurance benefits (''Other Post-Employment Benefits'' or "OPEB") for certain employees and retirees
around the world. The Pension Benefits are funded based on the funding requirements of federal and international laws and
regulations, as applicable, in advance of benefit payments and the Other Post-Employment Benefits as benefits are provided to
participating employees. As prescribed by applicable U.S. GAAP, Federal-Mogul, ARI and Viskase each uses, as applicable,
appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions in accounting for its defined benefit pension plans, non-pension post-
employment benefits, and disability, early retirement and other post-employment benefits. The measurement date for all
defined benefit plans is December 31 of each year.

14.Income Taxes.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax
expense of $50 million on pre-tax loss of $235 million compared to an income tax expense of $113 million on pre-tax income of
$654 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was (21.3)% and 17.3% for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35%, primarily due
to partnership losses for which there was no tax benefit, as such losses are allocated to the partners.
For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35%, primarily due
to partnership income not subject to taxation, as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings recorded an income tax
expense of $66 million on pre-tax loss of $1.8 billion compared to an income tax expense of $162 million on pre-tax income of
$1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective income tax rate was (3.6)% and 14.4% for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35%, primarily due to
partnership losses for which there was no tax benefit, as such losses are allocated to the partners, and goodwill impairment not
deductible for tax purposes.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35%, primarily due to
partnership income not subject to taxation, as such taxes are the responsibility of the partners.

Automotive
Environmental Matters
Federal-Mogul is a defendant in lawsuits filed, or the recipient of administrative orders issued or demand letters received, in
various jurisdictions pursuant to the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(“CERCLA”) or other similar national, provincial or state environmental remedial laws. These laws provide that responsible
parties may be liable to pay for remediating contamination resulting from hazardous substances that were discharged into the
environment by them, by prior owners or occupants of property they currently own or operate, or by others to whom they sent
such substances for treatment or other disposition at third party locations. Federal-Mogul has been notified by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, other national environmental agencies, and various provincial and state agencies that it may
be a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under such laws for the cost of remediating hazardous substances pursuant to
CERCLA and other national and state or provincial environmental laws. PRP designation often results in the funding of site
investigations and subsequent remedial activities.
Many of the sites that are likely to be the costliest to remediate are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities
to which numerous companies sent wastes. Despite the potential joint and several liability that might be imposed on Federal-
Mogul under CERCLA and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites, its share of the total waste sent to these sites has
generally been small. Federal-Mogul believes its exposure for liability at these sites is limited.
Federal-Mogul has also identified certain other present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up or
addressing environmental contamination, in some cases as a result of contractual commitments and/or federal or state
environmental laws. Federal-Mogul is actively seeking to resolve these actual and potential statutory, regulatory and
contractual obligations. Although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues, Federal-Mogul has accrued
amounts corresponding to its best estimate of the costs associated with such regulatory and contractual obligations on the
basis of available information from site investigations and best professional judgment of consultants.
Total environmental liabilities, determined on an undiscounted basis, were $13 million and $14 million as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated
balance sheets.
Federal-Mogul believes that recorded environmental liabilities will be adequate to cover its estimated liability for its exposure in
respect to such matters. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded by Federal-Mogul,
our Automotive segment's results of operations could be materially affected. At June 30, 2016, Federal-Mogul estimates
reasonably possible material additional losses, above and beyond its best estimate of required remediation costs as recorded,
to approximate $44 million.

Asset Retirement Obligations
Federal-Mogul has identified sites with contractual obligations and several sites that are closed or expected to be closed and
sold. In connection with these sites, Federal-Mogul has accrued $16 million and $16 million as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, for asset retirement obligations ("ARO"), primarily related to anticipated costs of removing
hazardous building materials at its facilities, and has considered impairment issues that may result from capitalization of these
ARO amounts.
Federal-Mogul has conditional asset retirement obligations ("CARO"), primarily related to removal costs of hazardous materials
in buildings, for which it believes reasonable cost estimates cannot be made at this time because it does not believe it has a
reasonable basis to assign probabilities to a range of potential settlement dates for these retirement obligations. Accordingly,
Federal-Mogul is currently unable to determine amounts to accrue for CARO at such sites.
Other Matters
On April 25, 2014, a group of plaintiffs brought an action against Federal-Mogul Products, Inc. (“F-M Products”), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Federal-Mogul, alleging injuries and damages associated with the discharge of chlorinated hydrocarbons
by the former owner of a facility located in Kentucky.  Since 1998, when F-M Products acquired the facility, it has been
cooperating with the applicable regulatory agencies on remediating the prior discharges pursuant to an order entered into by
the facility’s former owner. Federal-Mogul does not currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will have a material effect
on its condensed consolidation financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Energy
Unconditional Purchase Obligations
CVR leases various equipment, including railcars, and real properties under long-term operating leases expiring at various
dates. For each of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 lease expense was $2 million and for each of the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 lease expense was $4 million. The lease agreements have various remaining terms.
Some agreements are renewable, at CVR's option, for additional periods. It is expected, in the ordinary course of business, that
leases will be renewed or replaced as they expire. Additionally, in the normal course of business, CVR has long-term
commitments to purchase oxygen, nitrogen, electricity, storage capacity and pipeline transportation services.
Crude Oil Supply Agreement
On August 31, 2012, Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC ("CRRM"), a subsidiary of CVR Refining, and Vitol Inc.
("Vitol") entered into an Amended and Restated Crude Oil Supply Agreement (the "Vitol Agreement"). Under the Vitol
Agreement, Vitol supplies the petroleum business with crude oil and intermediation logistics, which helps to reduce the
Refining Partnership's inventory position and mitigate crude oil pricing risk. The Vitol Agreement will automatically renew for
successive one-year terms (each such term, a "Renewal Term") unless either party provides the other with notice of
nonrenewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of any Renewal Term. The Vitol Agreement currently extends through
December 31, 2017.
Litigation
From time to time, CVR is involved in various lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including matters such as
those described below under "Environmental, Health and Safety Matters." Liabilities related to such litigation are recognized
when the related costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and
adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events
pertaining to a particular case. It is possible that management’s estimates of the outcomes will change due to uncertainties
inherent in litigation and settlement negotiations. Except as described below for our Energy segment, there were no new
proceedings or material developments in proceedings that we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of CVR's management, the ultimate resolution of any other litigation matters is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. There can
be no assurance that management’s beliefs or opinions with respect to liability for potential litigation matters are accurate.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters ("EHS")
The petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to various stringent federal, state, and local EHS rules and
regulations. Liabilities related to EHS matters are recognized when the related costs are probable and can be reasonably
estimated. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site-specific costs, and
currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting EHS liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries.
CRRM, CRNF, Coffeyville Resources Crude Transportation, LLC ("CRCT"), Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC ("WRC")
and Coffeyville Resources Terminal, LLC ("CRT") own and/or operate manufacturing and ancillary operations at various
locations directly related to petroleum refining and distribution and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing. Therefore, CRRM, CRNF,
CRCT, WRC and CRT have exposure to potential EHS liabilities related to past and present EHS conditions at these
locations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and related state laws, certain persons may be liable for the release or threatened
release of hazardous substances. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or
threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons
who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability
under CERCLA is strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable
for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. Similarly, the Oil Pollution Act
generally subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and clean-up costs,
natural resource damages, and potential governmental oversight costs arising from oil spills into the waters of the United
States, which has been broadly interpreted to include most water bodies including intermittent streams.
CRRM, CRNF, CRCT, WRC and CRT are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental
and health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment,
the treatment and discharge of waste water, and the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen
products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. The ultimate impact of complying with evolving
laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over
time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act, have not yet been finalized, are under
governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating
and compliance costs.
As previously reported in our 2015 Form 10-K, the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are party to, or otherwise
subject to administrative orders and consent decrees with federal, state and local environmental authorities, as applicable,
addressing corrective actions under RCRA, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The petroleum business also is subject
to (i) the Mobile Source Air Toxic II ("MSAT II") rule which requires reductions of benzene in gasoline; (ii) the Renewable Fuel
Standard ("RFS"), which requires refiners to either blend "renewable fuels" in with their transportation fuels or purchase
renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, in lieu of blending; and (iii) "Tier 3" gasoline sulfur standards. Except as otherwise
described below, there have been no new developments or material changes to the environmental accruals or expected capital
expenditures related to compliance with the foregoing environmental matters from those provided in our 2015 Form 10-K.
CRRM, CRNF, CRCT, WRC and CRT each believe it is in substantial compliance with existing EHS rules and regulations.
There can be no assurance that the EHS matters described or referenced herein or other EHS matters which may develop in
the future will not have a material adverse effect on our Energy segment's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
On July 25, 2016, CRCT received an advance copy of a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed
Compliance Order (the "NOPV") from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (the "PHMSA"). The NOPV alleges violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations. The alleged violations include alleged failures (during various time periods) to (i) conduct quarterly notification
drills, (ii) maintain certain required records, (iii) utilize certain required safety equipment (including line markers), (iv) take
certain pipeline integrity management activities, (v) conduct certain cathodic protection testing, and (vi) make certain
atmospheric corrosion inspections. The preliminary assessed civil penalty is approximately $0.5 million and the NOPV
contained a compliance order outlining remedial compliance steps to be undertaken by CRCT. CRCT is reviewing the
allegations contained in the NOPV and will engage in discussions with PHMSA to attempt to resolve these matters. Although
CVR Refining cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of the claims asserted, CVR Refining does not believe that
the claims in the NOPV will have a material adverse effect on CVR Refining's business, financial condition or results of
operations.

As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our Energy segment had environmental accruals of $6 million and $4 million,
respectively. CVR's management periodically reviews and, as appropriate, revises its environmental accruals. Based on
current information and regulatory requirements, CVR's management believes that the accruals established for environmental
expenditures are adequate.
Environmental expenditures are capitalized when such expenditures are expected to result in future economic benefits. Capital
expenditures incurred for environmental compliance and efficiency of the operations were $3 million and $7 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6 million and $18 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
The cost of RINs was $51 million and $38 million for three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $94
million and $74 million for six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the petroleum business' biofuel blending obligation was $51 million and $10 million, respectively, which was recorded in
accrued expenses and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Metals
Environmental Matters
Certain of PSC Metals' facilities are environmentally impaired in part as a result of operating practices at the sites prior to their
acquisition by PSC Metals and as a result of PSC Metals' operations. PSC Metals has established procedures to periodically
evaluate these sites, giving consideration to the nature and extent of the contamination. PSC Metals has provided for the
remediation of these sites based upon management's judgment and prior experience. PSC Metals has estimated the liability to
remediate these sites to be $28 million and $29 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Management
believes, based on past experience, that the vast majority of these environmental liabilities and costs will be assessed and
paid over an extended period of time. PSC Metals believes that it will be able to fund such costs in the ordinary course of
business.
Estimates of PSC Metals' liability for remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation require a
number of assumptions that are inherently difficult to make, and the ultimate outcome may be materially different from current
estimates. Moreover, because PSC Metals has disposed of waste materials at numerous third-party disposal facilities, it is
possible that PSC Metals will be identified as a PRP at additional sites. The impact of such future events cannot be estimated
at the current time.
PSC Metals has been designated as a PRP under U.S. federal and state superfund laws with respect to certain sites with
which PSC Metals may have had a direct or indirect involvement. It is alleged that PSC Metals and its subsidiaries or their
predecessors transported waste to the sites, disposed of waste at the sites or operated the sites in question.  In addition, PSC
Metals recently learned that its Knoxville location was the subject of investigations by the State of Tennessee under the federal
Superfund law. These investigations were performed by the State of Tennessee pursuant to a contract with the EPA. PSC
Metals is exploring a potential settlement of the matter. Currently, PSC Metals cannot assess the impact of any cost or liability
associated with these investigations. With respect to all other matters in which PSC Metals has been designated as a PRP
under U.S. federal and state superfund laws, PSC Metals has reviewed the nature and extent of the allegations, the number,
connection and financial ability of other named and unnamed PRPs and the nature and estimated cost of the likely remedy.
Based on reviewing the nature and extent of the allegations, PSC Metals has estimated its liability to remediate these sites to
be immaterial as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. If it is determined that PSC Metals has liability to remediate
those sites and that more expensive remediation approaches are required in the future, PSC Metals could incur additional
obligations, which could be material.
In November and December of 2011, PSC Metals received three notices of violation ("NOV") from the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources (“MDNR”) for hazardous waste and water violations related to its Festus, Missouri location. PSC Metals has
entered into a settlement with MDNR that resolves these NOVs.  Currently, PSC Metals believes that it has established
adequate reserves for the cost of this settlement.  In addition, PSC Metals believes that it has a claim for indemnification
against the prior owner of the facility associated with the above-referenced notices of violation. MDNR and PSC Metals, as part
of the resolution of MDNR's NOVs, have undertaken sampling for lead at residences near PSC Metals' Festus yard.
Approximately 67 residences were sampled and tested, and of those, approximately 15 tested above residential standards for
lead contamination. PSC Metals has entered into a settlement agreement with MDNR which resolves MNDR’s claims and
requires limited soil remediation at the 15 residences. PSC Metals is in the process of completing the remediation required by
the settlement agreement. Currently, PSC Metals believes that it has adequately reserved for the cost of remediation

associated with its Festus yard and the residential areas near the yard. However, PSC Metals cannot assess its liability with
certainty at this time. Additionally, PSC Metals believes that liability for off-site contamination was retained by the prior owner of
the Festus yard and accordingly, it would have a claim for indemnification against the prior owner.
In late February 2016, the PSC Metals shredder in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania unknowingly processed scrap obtained from a
third party containing radioactive material.  Processing and transfer of that material resulted in the contamination of equipment
there, and two other PSC Metals facilities.  PSC Metals notified the appropriate governmental authorities and is working with
those agencies and qualified specialist companies to properly remediate the contaminated facilities and dispose of the
contaminated material.  PSC Metals believes that the cost of the remediation effort and any business interruption costs are
covered by insurance and its financial exposure would be immaterial. Remediation efforts are ongoing and PSC Metals
expects that the impacted facilities will be operational in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.

On October 24, 2014, ARI filed a complaint in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against
Gyansys, Inc. ("Gyansys"). The complaint asserts a claim against Gyansys for breaching its contract with ARI to implement an
enterprise resource planning system. ARI seeks to recover monetary damages in an amount still to be determined, but which
ARI alleged exceeds $25 million. Gyansys filed a response to the suit denying its responsibility. It also counterclaimed against
ARI for a breach of contract and wrongful termination, seeking damages in excess of $10 million and equitable relief. At this
time, ARI does not have sufficient information to reasonably form an estimate of the potential outcome (gain or loss) of this
litigation. On September 12, 2015, the court denied ARI's motion to dismiss the wrongful termination counterclaim. A trial date
has been tentatively scheduled for January 17, 2017. However, ARI believes that Gyansys' counterclaims lack merit and will
continue to vigorously defend against these counterclaims.
Other Matters
Mr. Icahn, through certain affiliates, owns 100% of Icahn Enterprises GP and approximately 89.5% of Icahn Enterprises'
outstanding depositary units as of June 30, 2016. Applicable pension and tax laws make each member of a “controlled group”
of entities, generally defined as entities in which there is at least an 80% common ownership interest, jointly and severally
liable for certain pension plan obligations of any member of the controlled group. These pension obligations include ongoing
contributions to fund the plan, as well as liability for any unfunded liabilities that may exist at the time the plan is terminated. In
addition, the failure to pay these pension obligations when due may result in the creation of liens in favor of the pension plan or
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") against the assets of each member of the controlled group.
As a result of the more than 80% ownership interest in us by Mr. Icahn’s affiliates, we and our subsidiaries are subject to the
pension liabilities of entities in which Mr. Icahn has a direct or indirect ownership interest of at least 80%. As a result of our
ownership of more than 80% in our subsidiaries, we and our subsidiaries are subject to the pension liabilities of all entities in
which Mr. Icahn has a direct or indirect ownership interest of at least 80%. ACF and Federal-Mogul, are the sponsors of several
pension plans. All the minimum funding requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for these plans have been met as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. If the plans were voluntarily terminated, they would be underfunded by
approximately $533 million and $589 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These results are
based on the most recent information provided by the plans’ actuaries. These liabilities could increase or decrease, depending
on a number of factors, including future changes in benefits, investment returns, and the assumptions used to calculate the
liability. As members of the controlled group, we would be liable for any failure of ACF and Federal-Mogul to make ongoing
pension contributions or to pay the unfunded liabilities upon a termination of the pension plans of ACF and Federal-Mogul. In
addition, other entities now or in the future within the controlled group in which we are included may have pension plan
obligations that are, or may become, underfunded and we would be liable for any failure of such entities to make ongoing
pension contributions or to pay the unfunded liabilities upon termination of such plans.
The current underfunded status of the pension plans of ACF and Federal-Mogul requires them to notify the PBGC of certain
“reportable events,” such as if we cease to be a member of the ACF and Federal-Mogul controlled group, or if we make certain
extraordinary dividends or stock redemptions. The obligation to report could cause us to seek to delay or reconsider the
occurrence of such reportable events.
Starfire Holding Corporation ("Starfire") which is 99.4% owned by Mr. Icahn, has undertaken to indemnify us and our
subsidiaries from losses resulting from any imposition of certain pension funding or termination liabilities that may be imposed
on us and our subsidiaries or our assets as a result of being a member of the Icahn controlled group. The Starfire indemnity

(which does not extend to pension liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be imposed on us as a result of our interest in these
subsidiaries and not as a result of Mr. Icahn and his affiliates holding more than an 80% ownership interest in us, and as such
would not extend to the unfunded pension termination liability for Federal-Mogul) provides, among other things, that so long as
such contingent liabilities exist and could be imposed on us, Starfire will not make any distributions to its stockholders that
would reduce its net worth to below $250 million. Nonetheless, Starfire may not be able to fund its indemnification obligations
to us.

Icahn Enterprises
Distribution
On August 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of Icahn Enterprises declared a quarterly distribution in the
amount of $1.50 per depositary unit. The quarterly distribution is payable in either cash or additional depositary units, at the
election of each depositary unit holder and will be paid on or about September 19, 2016 to depositary unit holders of record at
the close of business on August 15, 2016. Depositary unit holders have until September 7, 2016 to make an election to receive
either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected
to receive the dividend in cash. Depositary unit holders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units
valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending
September 14, 2016. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the dividend payment. Icahn Enterprises will
make a cash payment in lieu of issuing fractional depositary units to any holders electing to receive depositary units. Any
holders that would only be eligible to receive a fraction of a depositary unit based on the above calculation will receive a cash
payment.
Sale of CVR Refining Units
On August 2, 2016, we sold 250,000 common units of CVR Refining.  As a result of this transaction, we and our affiliates
collectively own 69.99% of CVR Refining. Pursuant to CVR Refining’s partnership agreement, in certain circumstances, the
general partner of CVR Refining has the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of CVR Refining common units held by
unaffiliated unit holders at a price not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of such
partnership agreement (the “Call Right”). Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, because our holdings were
reduced to less than 70.0%, the ownership threshold for the application of such Call Right was permanently reduced from 95%
to 80%.  Accordingly, if at any time the general partner of CVR Refining and its affiliates owns more than 80% of CVR Refining
common units, it will have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise such Call Right.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our present business and the results of operations together
with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016
(this "Report").
Overview
Introduction
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn
Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987.
References to "we," "our" or "us" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries,
unless the context otherwise requires.
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn
Enterprises GP”), which is owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn
Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of June 30, 2016. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own
substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of
Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to debt and to
the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial
statements of Icahn Enterprises. In addition to the above, Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 89.5% of Icahn
Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of June 30, 2016.
We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries currently engaged in the following continuing operating businesses:
Investment, Automotive, Energy, Metals, Railcar, Gaming, Mining, Food Packaging, Real Estate and Home Fashion. We also
report the results of our Holding Company, which includes the results of certain subsidiaries of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn
Enterprises Holdings (unless otherwise noted), and investment activity and expenses associated with the Holding Company.

Icahn Enterprises Holdings
Due to the structure of our business, the consolidated results of operations for Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises
Holdings are substantially the same with minor differences primarily related to non-cash portions of interest expense that are
only reflected in the results of operations for our Holding Company.
Overview
Our operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis. Due to the structure of our business, we discuss the results
of operations below by individual reporting segments. See Note 2, “Operating Units,” to the condensed consolidated financial
statements for a description of each of our operating segments and Note 13, "Segment Reporting," for a reconciliation of each
of our reporting segment's results of operations to our consolidated results.

Investment
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds, including Icahn Partners L.P. ("Icahn Partners") and
Icahn Partners Master Fund LP ("Master Fund") (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), through which we invest our proprietary
capital. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. Icahn Onshore LP
and Icahn Offshore LP (together, the "General Partners") act as the general partner of Icahn Partners and the Master Fund,
respectively. The General Partners provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the
Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment
Funds are not offered to outside investors.
Mr. Icahn, along with his affiliates (excluding Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings), makes investments in the
Investment Funds. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total fair market value of investments in the Investment
Funds made by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates was approximately $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, representing
approximately 69% and 55%, respectively, of the Investment Funds' assets under management.
Our Interests in the Investment Funds
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had investments with a fair market value of approximately $1.7 billion and
$3.4 billion, respectively, in the Investment Funds.
Our share of the Investment Funds' net (loss) income through our interests in the Investment Funds was $(107) million and
$176 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and $(557) million and $360 million for the six months ended

We conduct our Automotive segment through our majority ownership in Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation ("Federal-
Mogul"), our wholly owned subsidiary, IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC ("IEH Auto"), which acquired substantially all of the auto
parts assets in the United States of Uni-Select, Inc. through an acquisition that was consummated during the second quarter of
2015, and effective February 3, 2016, through our wholly owned subsidiary Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack ("Pep Boys").  See
Note 2, "Operating Units - Automotive," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Pep Boys
acquisition. Intercompany transactions among Federal-Mogul, Pep Boys and IEH Auto have been eliminated in consolidation.
On February 28, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a proposal (the "Federal-Mogul Offer") to the board of directors of Federal-
Mogul to purchase the remaining shares of Federal-Mogul common stock not owned by us in a merger transaction pursuant to
which Federal-Mogul shareholders would receive $7.00 per share in cash for their shares of Federal-Mogul
$ 3,851
  3,290
  $ 561

common stock. On June 17, 2016, Icahn Enterprises issued a revised proposal to increase the Federal-Mogul Offer to $8.00
per share in cash from $7.00 per share in cash. The proposed merger process is ongoing as of the date of this Report. See
Note 2, "Operating Units - Automotive," for further discussion regarding this proposed transaction.
Federal-Mogul is a leading global supplier of a broad range of components, accessories and systems to the automotive, small
engine, heavy-duty, marine, railroad, agricultural, off-road, aerospace and energy, industrial and transport markets, including
customers in both the original equipment manufacturers and servicers (“OE”) market and the replacement market
(“aftermarket”). Federal-Mogul’s customers include the world’s largest automotive OEs and major distributors and retailers in
the independent aftermarket, including Pep Boys and IEH Auto.
Federal-Mogul operates with two end-customer focused businesses. The Powertrain business focuses on original equipment
products for automotive, heavy duty and industrial applications. The Motorparts business sells and distributes a broad portfolio
of products in the global aftermarket, while also serving original equipment manufacturers with products including braking,
chassis, wipers, and other vehicle components.
Federal-Mogul's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q contain a detailed description of its
business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Federal-Mogul's filings with the SEC are available on the
SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Pep Boys has 805 locations in the automotive aftermarket industry located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Pep
Boys stores are organized into a hub and spoke network consisting of Supercenters and Service & Tire Centers. Supercenters
average approximately 20,000 square feet and combine a parts and accessories store with professional service centers that
perform a full range of automotive maintenance and repair services. Most of the Pep Boys Supercenters also have a
commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts, tires and equipment to automotive repair shops and dealers.
Service & Tire Centers, which average approximately 6,000 square feet, provide automotive maintenance and repair services
in neighborhood locations that are conveniently located where our customers live or work.
IEH Auto has 21 distribution centers and 277 corporate-owned jobber stores (including 11 satellite locations) in the United
States and supports a network of more than 2,000 independent wholesalers. Through its locations, IEH Auto sells
predominantly to commercial aftermarket customers in the do-it-for-me ("DIFM") market as well as retail and do-it-yourself
("DIY") customers.
Pep Boys and IEH Auto are being operated together in order to grow their sales to DIFM distributors and DIFM service
professionals, to grow their automotive service business, and to maintain their DIY customer bases by offering the newest and
broadest product assortment in the automotive aftermarket.
Federal-Mogul is operated independently from Pep Boys and IEH Auto.
Major Influences Impacting Results of Operations
There is inherent uncertainty in the continuation of certain trends, as discussed below, which, among other factors, may have
an effect on our Automotive segment. Our Automotive segment is affected by the relative strength of:
Global vehicle production levels
Global light vehicle production increased by 1.7% in the first half of 2016.  European light vehicle production rose 3.6%
and North American light vehicle production increased 3.8%, with positive growth in Canada and the United States.  Light
vehicle production in the Asia-Pacific region increased by 1.4% with positive growth in China and India.  Among the major
regions, only South America posted a decline during the first half of 2016, which was down 20.4%. Global commercial vehicle
production was up slightly in the first half of 2016, with a significant decrease in our Automotive segment's primary market,
North America.
Global vehicle sales levels
Global light vehicle sales increased by 3.6% in the first half of 2016. European light vehicle sales rose 5.6% and North
American vehicles sales increased 3.0%, with positive growth in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Light vehicle sales in
the Asia-Pacific region increased 4.9%, with positive growth in China and India. Among the major regions, only South America
posted a decline during the six months ended June 30, 2016, which was down 18.5%. Global commercial vehicle sales were
up slightly in the first half of 2016, with a significant decrease in our Automotive segment's primary market, North America.
Part replacement trends
The strength of our Automotive segment's aftermarket business is influenced by several key drivers. These include the vehicle
population (or "parc"), average vehicle age, fuel prices and vehicle distance traveled. The vehicle parc is estimated to have
expanded in most major markets, including the United States, Japan, China, and Germany.  Average vehicle ages also
increased, despite growth in new vehicle sales, in most regions. Vehicle distance traveled varies by region and is sensitive to
56
several factors, including fuel prices and transportation alternatives. Average vehicle distance traveled has declined in China
in the recent past, partially offsetting generally favorable trends in the country.
Geopolitical risk
Our Automotive businesses are global, subjecting them to numerous risks and uncertainties. For example, the recent
referendum in the United Kingdom ("UK") to leave the European Union has created economic uncertainty effects in both the
UK and Europe. In addition, our Automotive segment has an interest in a certain joint venture in Turkey, which may be affected
by recent turmoil in that region.
Foreign currencies
Our Automotive segment's operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates given the nature of their global
operations and there has been significant volatility in foreign currency rates.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for our Automotive segment for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $457 million (23%) as compared
to the comparable prior year period. As discussed above, we acquired Pep Boys on February 3, 2016 and IEH Auto on June 1,
2015, resulting in an aggregate $495 million in additional consolidated net sales within our Automotive segment during the
second quarter of 2016. Federal-Mogul's net sales, before eliminations, decreased by $38 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, principally due to a decrease in Motorparts sales. Federal-
Mogul's net sales were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several global currencies which
resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $15 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Federal-Mogul's
sales decreased by $23 million, which includes an increase of $23 million from acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from
acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales volumes in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and the
Rest of the World ("ROW") increased by 1.1%, 0.9% and 0.9%, respectively, and the Motorparts business' sales in North
America, EMEA and ROW (decreased) increased by (5.7)%, (1.2)% and 1.6%, respectively.
Cost of goods sold for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $280 million (16%) as compared to the comparable
prior year period. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions of IEH Auto in June
2015 and Pep Boys in February 2016.
Gross margin on net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $177 million (57%) as compared to the
comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 20% and 15% for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales over the respective periods
was due to the inclusion of the acquisitions of IEH Auto in June 2015 and Pep Boys in February 2016. The gross margins on
sales of IEH Auto and Pep Boys products are generally higher than those of Federal-Mogul's.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for our Automotive segment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $943 million (24%) as compared to
the comparable prior year period. As discussed above, we acquired Pep Boys on February 3, 2016 and IEH Auto on June 1,
2015, resulting in an aggregate $919 million in additional consolidated net sales within our Automotive segment for the first six
months of 2016. Federal-Mogul's net sales, before eliminations, increased by $24 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year period. Federal-Mogul's net sales were negatively impacted by the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several global currencies which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact of
$67 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Federal-Mogul's sales increased by $91 million, including $73 million
from acquisitions. Including the impact of sales from acquisitions, the Powertrain business' sales volumes in North America,
Europe, EMEA and ROW increased by 1.6%, 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively, and the Motorparts business' sales in North
America, EMEA and ROW increased (decreased) by 1.0%, (0.7)% and 0.6%, respectively.
Cost of goods sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $608 million (18%) as compared to the comparable
prior year period. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisitions of IEH Auto in June
2015 and Pep Boys in February 2016.
Gross margin on net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $335 million (60%) as compared to the
comparable prior year period. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 19% and 15% for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales over the respective periods was due to
the inclusion of the acquisitions of IEH Auto in June 2015 and Pep Boys in February 2016. The gross margins on sales of IEH
Auto and Pep Boys products are generally higher than those of Federal-Mogul's.

CVR Energy, Inc.'s ("CVR") Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q contain a detailed description of
its business, products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. CVR's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov.
As of June 30, 2016, we owned 82% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR. In addition, as of June 30, 2016, we owned
approximately 4.0% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Refining, LP ("CVR Refining").

CVR is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing
industries through its holdings in CVR Refining and CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners”), respectively. CVR Refining is an
independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen
fertilizers in the form of urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN") and ammonia.
As further discussed in Note 2, "Operating Units - Energy," on April 1, 2016, CVR Partners completed the acquisition of CVR
Nitrogen, LP.
Major Influences Impacting Results of Operations
Our Energy segment's earnings and cash flows from its petroleum operations are primarily affected by the relationship between
refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. In the nitrogen fertilizer business, earnings and cash
flows from operations are primarily affected by the relationship among nitrogen fertilizer product prices, on-stream factors and
direct operating expenses.
The earnings and cash flows of the petroleum business are primarily affected by the relationship between refined product
prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks that are processed and blended into refined products. The cost to
acquire crude oil and other feedstocks and the price for which refined products are ultimately sold depend on factors beyond its
control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, as well as gasoline and other refined products which, in turn, depend
on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs,
production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation.
Because the petroleum business applies first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) accounting to value its inventory, crude oil price movements
may impact net income in the short term because of changes in the value of its unhedged on-hand inventory. The effect of
changes in crude oil prices on our results of operations is influenced by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to
reflect these changes.
The prices of crude oil and other feedstocks and refined product prices are also affected by other factors, such as product
pipeline capacity, local market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of
refined products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. Widespread expansion or upgrades of competitors’
facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an
important role in refining industry economics. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the
market, resulting in price volatility and a reduction in product margins. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences
seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving
season and for home heating oil during the winter, primarily in the Northeast. In addition to current market conditions, there are
long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards,
proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles. The petroleum business is also
subject to the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), which
requires it to either blend “renewable fuels” in with its transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as
renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), in lieu of blending.
On December 14, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule establishing the renewable fuel volume
mandates for 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the biomass-based diesel mandate for 2017. The volumes included in the EPA's final
rule increase each year, but are lower, with the exception of the volumes for biomass-based diesel, than the volumes required
by the Clean Air Act. The EPA used its waiver authority to lower the volumes, but its decision to do so has been challenged in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In addition, in the final rule establishing the renewable volume
obligations for 2014-2016 and biomass based diesel for 2017, the EPA articulated a policy to incentivize additional
investments in renewable fuel blending and distribution infrastructure by increasing the price of RINs.
The cost of RINs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $51 million and $38 million, respectively, and for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $94 million and $74 million, respectively. The price of RINs has been
extremely volatile and has increased over the last year. The future cost of RINs for the petroleum business is difficult to
estimate. Additionally, the cost of RINs is dependent upon a variety of factors, which include EPA regulations, the availability of
RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, transportation fuel production levels, the mix of the petroleum
business' petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at its refineries and downstream terminals, all of which
can vary significantly from period to period. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other
variable factors, the petroleum business currently estimates that the total cost of RINs will be approximately $200 million to
$235 million for the year ending December 31, 2016.
If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase at times when the petroleum business seeks to purchase RINs, if the petroleum
business has to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if the petroleum business is otherwise unable to meet the EPA’s
RFS mandates, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of
goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization, direct operating expenses and fair value inventory adjustments) and
refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between
net sales and cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization, direct operating expenses and fair value inventory
adjustments) adjusted for FIFO impacts. Refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact are non-GAAP
measures that we believe are important to investors in evaluating our Energy segment refineries' performance as a general
indication of the amount above our Energy segment's cost of goods sold (taking into account the impact of utilization of FIFO)
they are able to sell refined products. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is
important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our Energy segment's ongoing operating results and allow for
greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. In addition, we believe that
presenting refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is useful to investors because this measure
more accurately reflects the current operating environment.
In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, our Energy segment utilizes the total dollar figures for
refining margin, as derived above, and divides that by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. Our
Energy segment's calculation of refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of
other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our Energy segment's FIFO
accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our Energy segment's
crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in favorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices increase and
unfavorable FIFO impacts when crude oil prices decrease.
In order to assess the operating performance of the nitrogen fertilizer business, CVR calculates the product pricing at gate as
an input to determine its operating margin. Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product
sales volume in tons. CVR believes product pricing at gate is a meaningful measure because it sells products at its plant gate
and terminal locations' gates ("sold gate") and delivered to the customer's designated delivery site ("sold delivered"). The
relative percentage of sold gate versus sold delivered can change period to period. The product pricing at gate provides a
measure that is consistently comparable period to period.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to
approximately $1.2 billion from approximately $1.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales
for the petroleum business was largely due to significantly lower sales prices for the petroleum business' transportation fuels
and by-products, coupled with a slight decrease in sales volumes. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, CVR's
petroleum business sold approximately 10.5 million and 8.3 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an
average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.44 and $1.37, respectively. For the three months ended June 30,
2015, CVR's petroleum business sold approximately 10.3 million and 9.0 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively,
with an average sales price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.87 and $1.81, respectively.
Net sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $120 million
from $81 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net sales for the fertilizer business was primarily
due to the inclusion of the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, CVR sold 339,400 and
73,600 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales gate price per ton of $199 and $417, respectively. For the three
months ended June 30, 2015, CVR sold 249,800 and 6,300 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales gate price
per ton of $269 and $546, respectively.
Cost of goods sold for the petroleum business for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.1
billion and approximately $1.3 billion, respectively. Cost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil,
other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with
the actual operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as "direct operating expenses") such as energy
and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental
compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.
The decrease in cost of sales for the petroleum business was primarily due to a decrease in cost of consumed crude oil, which
was partially offset by an increase in purchased products for resale and an increase in RINs costs. The average cost per barrel
of crude oil consumed for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $42.47 compared to $54.60 for the comparable period in
2015, a decrease of approximately 22%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of product sold during the
comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory
valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact when crude
oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the three months ended
June 30, 2016, the petroleum business had a favorable FIFO inventory impact of $46 million compared to a favorable FIFO
inventory impact of $37 million for the corresponding prior year period.
60
Refining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput decreased to $12.07 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $19.12
for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact decreased to $9.56 per crude oil
throughput barrel for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $17.22 per crude oil throughput barrel for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Gross margin per barrel was $5.37 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a gross
margin per barrel of $13.66 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in refining margin and gross margin per
barrel was primarily due to a weaker spread between crude oil and transportation fuels pricing and higher RINs costs, which
was partially offset by a favorable change in the gasoline basis and distillate basis over the prior year period.
The fertilizer business' cost of goods sold for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $112 million from $51 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen.
Cost of goods sold for the fertilizer business is primarily comprised of pet coke expense, freight expense, distribution expense,
purchased ammonia costs, direct operating expenses and depreciation and amortization.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for the petroleum business, before eliminations, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to approximately
$2.0 billion from approximately $2.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net sales for the
petroleum business was largely due to significantly lower sales prices for the petroleum business' transportation fuels and by-
products, as well as decrease in sales volumes. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, CVR's petroleum business sold
approximately 21.3 million and 15.7 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales price per
gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.24 and $1.22, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, CVR's petroleum
business sold approximately 21.1 million and 17.2 million barrels of gasoline and distillate, respectively, with an average sales
price per gallon for gasoline and distillate of $1.67 and $1.75, respectively.
Net sales for the fertilizer business, before eliminations, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $193 million from
$174 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net sales for the fertilizer business was primarily due to
the inclusion of the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, CVR sold 606,400 and 98,000 tons
of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales gate price per ton of $202 and $405, respectively. For the six months ended
June 30, 2015, CVR sold 524,300 and 19,100 tons of UAN and ammonia, respectively, with a sales gate price per ton of $265
and $551, respectively.
Cost of goods sold for the petroleum business for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.9
billion and approximately $2.5 billion, respectively. Cost of goods sold for the petroleum business includes cost of crude oil,
other feedstocks and blendstocks, purchased products for resale, RINs, transportation distribution costs, costs associated with
the actual operations of CVR's refineries (such costs are collectively referred to as "direct operating expenses") such as energy
and utility costs, property taxes, catalyst and chemical costs, repairs and maintenance and labor and environmental
compliance costs. In addition, cost of goods sold includes depreciation and amortization.
The decrease in cost of sales for the petroleum business was primarily due to a decrease in cost of consumed crude oil. The
average cost per barrel of crude oil consumed for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $37.35 compared to $51.15 for the
comparable period in 2015, a decrease of approximately 27%. The impact of FIFO accounting also impacted cost of product
sold during the comparable periods. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in
the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO inventory impact
when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO inventory impact when crude oil prices decrease. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016, the petroleum business had a favorable FIFO inventory impact of $37 million compared to a favorable
FIFO inventory impact of $12 million for the corresponding prior year period.
Refining margin per barrel of crude oil throughput decreased to $9.50 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $16.47 for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact decreased to $8.44 per crude oil throughput
barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $16.15 per crude oil throughput barrel for the six months ended June 30,
2015. Gross margin per barrel was $1.51 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a gross margin per barrel of
$10.21 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in refining margin and gross margin per barrel was primarily due
to a weaker spread between crude oil and transportation fuels pricing, an increase in RINs costs and an unfavorable change in
gasoline basis over the prior year period, which was partially offset by a favorable change in distillate basis over the prior year
period.
The fertilizer business' cost of goods sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $161 million from $111 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquisition of CVR Nitrogen.
Cost of goods sold for the fertilizer business is primarily comprised of pet coke expense, freight expense, distribution expense,
purchased ammonia costs, direct operating expenses and depreciation and amortization.

We conduct our Metals segment through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, PSC Metals, Inc. ("PSC Metals").
The scrap metals business is highly cyclical and is substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the U.S.
and other global markets. Ferrous and non-ferrous scrap have been historically vulnerable to significant declines in
consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn or stagnation. 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $27 million (26%) compared to the corresponding prior year
period. The decrease was due to lower shipment volumes and selling prices for most product types for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.
Ferrous shipments decreased by 48,000 gross tons (21%) while the average price decreased by $8 per gross ton (3%) during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The shipment decrease was
attributable to the slower flow of raw materials into the recycling yards due to efforts to reduce net unprofitable accounts from
the supply base, and lower mill pricing which reduced peddler supply.
Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 7.2 million pounds (22%) while average selling prices for non-ferrous decreased
$0.06 per pound (8%) during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to corresponding prior year period, reflecting
lower market pricing and its unfavorable impact on raw material availability.
Cost of goods sold for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $35 million (32%) compared to the corresponding
prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes, lower material costs and lower processing costs.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was 1% as compared to a loss of 7% in
the corresponding prior year period. The material margin component of gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, improved
over the respective periods, reflecting a continued focus on disciplined buying in the face of strong competition for shredder
feedstock and lower pricing for non-ferrous auto shredder residue. In addition, while processing costs were lower in the three
months ended June 30, 2016 than in the comparable prior year period, those costs increased as a percentage of net sales due
to decreased volumes and increased costs associated with certain environmental costs.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $75 million (36%) compared to the comparable prior year
period. The decrease was due to lower shipment volumes and selling prices for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to the corresponding prior year period.
Ferrous shipments decreased by 82,000 gross tons (19%) while the average price decreased by $57 per gross ton (22%)
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period. The shipment decrease was
attributable to reduced demand from domestic steel mills and to the slow flow of raw materials into the recycling yards. Low
priced iron ore, direct-reduced iron pellets, and reduced demand from steel mills during the current quarter continued to hold
down market prices.
62
Non-ferrous shipment volumes decreased by 16.6 million pounds (25%) and average selling prices for non-ferrous decreased
$0.08 per pound (11%) during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period reflecting
lower market pricing and its unfavorable impact on raw material availability.
Cost of goods sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $87 million (38%) compared to the comparable prior
year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes, lower material costs and lower processing costs.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was a loss of 4% and 8% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The material margin component of gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, improved during the first six
months of 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, reflecting a continued focus on disciplined buying in the
face of strong competition for shredder feedstock and lower pricing for non-ferrous auto shredder residue. In addition, while
processing costs were lower in the six months ended June 30, 2016 than in the comparable prior year period, those costs
increased as a percentage of net sales due to decreased volumes. PSC Metals continued to expend considerable effort to
bring costs in line with volumes and market pricing. PSC Metals closed nine feeder yards after March 31, 2015 in order to
better align its cost structure to the current market environment.

compared to 5,065 railcars for the comparable prior year period, including 3,533 railcars to leasing customers.
As of June 30, 2016, our Railcar segment had a backlog of 5,601 railcars, including 1,556 railcars for lease customers. In
response to changes in customer demand, our Railcar segment continues to adjust production rates at its railcar manufacturing
facilities.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Total manufacturing revenues, before elimination of estimated railcar sales to our Railcar segment's leasing business, for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $161 million (60%) over the comparable prior year period. The decrease was
primarily due to lower volume of shipments and an overall decrease in the average selling prices with a higher mix of hopper
railcars, which generally sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content, more competitive pricing
on both hopper and tank railcars, coupled with a decrease in revenue from certain material cost changes that ARI generally

sell at lower prices than tank railcars due to less material and labor content, in addition to more competitive pricing of both
railcar types.
Railcar leasing revenues increased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year

Entertainment Resorts, Inc. (“Trump”) which currently owns and operates Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort ("Trump Taj Mahal").
As discussed further in Note 2, "Operating Units - Gaming," we obtained control and consolidated the results of Trump upon its
emergence from bankruptcy on February 26, 2016. Trump owns and operates Trump Taj Mahal which is located in Atlantic
City, New Jersey.  Trump Taj Mahal adds approximately 160,000 square feet of gaming space with 2,500 slot machines, 130
table games and 2,000 hotel rooms to our existing gaming operations.
Tropicana's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q contain a detailed description of its business,
products, industry, operating strategy and associated risks. Tropicana's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov.

Gaming revenues and expenses are classified in other revenues from operations and other expenses from operations,
respectively, in our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Casino revenues are one of our gaming segment's main performance indicators and account for a significant portion of its net
revenues. In addition, casino revenues can vary because of table games hold percentage and differences in the odds for
different table games. High end play may lead to greater fluctuations in table games hold percentage and, as a result, greater
revenue fluctuation between reporting periods may occur.

was primarily due to an increase in consolidated gaming volumes of 28.0%, primarily due to the inclusion of results from Trump
upon its emergence from bankruptcy on February 26, 2016, coupled with higher gaming volumes and table hold percentage at
Tropicana Evansville ("Evansville") in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Our Gaming segment's consolidated

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
The increase in casino revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period was

Evansville. Our Gaming segment's consolidated slot hold percentage was flat at 9.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2016

We are a holding company. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make distributions with
respect to depositary units likely will depend on the cash flow resulting from divestitures, equity and debt financings, interest
income, returns on our interests in the Investment Funds and the payment of funds to us by our subsidiaries in the form of
loans, dividends and distributions. We may pursue various means to raise cash from our subsidiaries. To date, such means
include receipt of dividends from subsidiaries, obtaining loans or other financings based on the asset values of subsidiaries or
selling debt or equity securities of subsidiaries through capital market transactions. To the degree any distributions and
transfers are impaired or prohibited, our ability to make payments on our debt or distributions on our depositary units could be
limited. The operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. In addition, our
subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and distributions and intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries
to us may be restricted by applicable law or covenants contained in debt agreements and other agreements.
As of June 30, 2016, based on covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes, we are not permitted to incur additional
indebtedness. See Note 10, “Debt,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning

the close of business on August 15, 2016. Depositary unit holders have until September 7, 2016 to make an election to receive
either cash or additional depositary units; if a holder does not make an election, it will automatically be deemed to have elected
to receive the dividend in cash. Depositary unit holders who elect to receive additional depositary units will receive units
valued at the volume weighted average trading price of the units on NASDAQ during the 5 consecutive trading days ending
September 14, 2016. No fractional depositary units will be issued pursuant to the dividend payment. Icahn Enterprises will

segment which received contributions from affiliates of Mr. Icahn of $490 million. This was offset in part by payment of
distributions to our LP unitholders and payments of dividends and distributions to non-controlling interests in certain of our
subsidiaries.
Discussion of Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources
There have been no material changes to our capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
the estimated capital expenditures for 2016 as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.

Investment
As of June 30, 2016, the Investment Funds' net notional exposure was -149%. The Investment Funds' long exposure was
174% (166% long equity and 8% long credit) and the Investment Funds' short exposure was 323% (301% short equity, 22%
short credit and other).  The notional exposure represents the ratio of the notional exposure of the Investment Funds' invested
capital to the net asset value of the Investment Funds at June 30, 2016.
Of our long exposure of 174%, the fair value of our long positions (with certain adjustments) represented 167% of our long
exposure. The notional value of our other long positions, which primarily included single name equity forward contracts and
credit contracts, represented 7% of our long exposure.
Of our short exposure of 323%, the fair value of our short positions represented 24% of our short exposure. The notional value
of our other short positions, which primarily included short credit default swap contracts and short broad market index swap
derivative contracts, represented 299% of our short exposure.
With respect to both our long positions that are not notionalized (167% long exposure) and our short positions that are not
notionalized (24% short), each 1% change in exposure as a result of purchases or sales (assuming no change in value) would
have a 1% impact on our cash and cash equivalents (as a percentage of net asset value). Changes in exposure as a result of
purchases and sales as well as adverse changes in market value would also have an effect on funds available to us pursuant
to prime brokerage lines of credit.
With respect to the notional value of our other short positions (299% short exposure), our liquidity would decrease by the
balance sheet unrealized loss if we were to close the positions at quarter end prices. This would be offset by a release of
restricted cash balances collateralizing these positions as well as an increase in funds available to us pursuant to certain prime
brokerage lines of credit. If we were to increase our short exposure by adding to these short positions, we would be required to
provide cash collateral equal to a small percentage of the initial notional value at counterparties that require cash as collateral
and then post additional collateral equal to 100% of the mark to market on adverse changes in fair value. For our counterparties
who do not require cash collateral, funds available from lines of credit would decrease.
The Investment Funds historically have had access to significant amounts of cash available from prime brokerage lines of
credit, subject to customary terms and market conditions.
Automotive
During the first quarter of 2016, Federal-Mogul increased its borrow capacity under a certain revolving credit facility (the
"Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility") by $50 million to $600 million. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance
on the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility was $390 million. As of June 30, 2016, the borrowing availability under
the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility was $171 million. Federal-Mogul had $39 million of letters of credit
outstanding as of June 30, 2016 pertaining to the Federal-Mogul Replacement Revolver Facility. As of June 30, 2016, Federal-
Mogul had an aggregate availability of approximately $201 million with respect to its consolidated revolving credit facilities.
Federal-Mogul's subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and the United States are party to accounts receivable
factoring and securitization facilities. Gross accounts receivable transferred under these facilities were $566 million and $408
million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of those gross amounts, $556 million and $401 million,
respectively, qualify as sales as defined in FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. The remaining transferred
receivables were pledged as collateral and accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets within accounts receivable, net and debt. Under the terms of these facilities, Federal-Mogul is not obligated to
draw cash immediately upon the transfer of accounts receivable. As of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Federal-
Mogul had withdrawn cash related to such transferred receivables of $1 million. Proceeds from the transfers of accounts
receivable qualifying as sales were $842 million and $800 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, the availability on the IEH Auto ABL Credit Facility was $48 million.
Pep Boys has a revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and other parties thereto
providing for borrowings of up to $300 million with an original maturity date of July 26, 2016. The maturity date of this revolving
credit agreement was extended to October 24, 2016. The interest rate on this facility is LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% to 2.50%
for LIBOR rate borrowings or Prime plus 1.00% to 1.50% for Prime rate borrowings. The margin is based upon the then current
availability under the facility. As of June 30, 2016, Pep Boys had $60 million outstanding under the facility and $43 million of
availability was utilized to support outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account the borrowing
72
base requirements (including reduction for amounts outstanding under the trade payable program), as of June 30, 2016, there
was $77 million of availability remaining under the facility.
Energy
As of June 30, 2016, Coffeyville Resources, LLC had availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility of
$$255 million and had letters of credit outstanding of $28 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit
Facility as of June 30, 2016. Availability under the Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility was limited by borrowing base
conditions as of June 30, 2016. In addition, CVR Partners had $25 million availability under its revolving credit facility, with an
uncommitted incremental facility of up to $50 million. On April 1, 2016, CVR Partners repaid all amounts outstanding under the
term loan with respect to this credit facility and the credit facility was terminated.
On June 10, 2016, CVR Partners completed a private offering of $645 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% senior
secured notes due 2023. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, CVR Partners repurchased approximately $315
million of its 6.5% notes due 2021 pursuant to a certain tender offer and a change of control offer. See Note 10, "Debt - Energy,"
for further discussion regarding these transactions.
On January 24, 2013, the board of directors of CVR adopted a quarterly cash dividend policy. CVR began paying regular
quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of CVR's board of directors
and may change from quarter to quarter. In addition, the current policy of the respective board of directors of CVR Refining and
CVR Partners is to distribute all of the respective available cash of CVR Refining and CVR Partners each quarter. CVR
Refining and CVR Partners do not have a legal obligation to pay distributions and there is no guarantee that they will pay any
distributions on the units in any quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received $71 million in dividends from CVR. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, CVR
declared a quarterly dividend, which will result in an additional $36 million in dividends paid to us in the third quarter of 2016.
Railcar
In December 2015, ARI completed a financing of its railcar lease fleet with availability of up to $200 million under a credit
agreement (the "ARI 2015 Credit Agreement"). The ARI 2015 Credit Agreement contains an incremental borrowing provision
under which ARI, as debtor and subject to the conditions set forth in the ARI 2015 Credit Agreement, has the right but not the
obligation to increase the amount of the facility in an aggregate amount of up to $100 million (the amounts extended under the
2015 Credit Agreement, inclusive of any amounts extended under the incremental facility, the Revolving Loans), to a maximum
principal amount of $300 million. In February 2016, ARI repaid amounts outstanding under the Revolving Loan in full and as of
the date of this Report has borrowing availability of $200 million under this credit facility.
On July 28, 2015, ARI's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of its outstanding common stock
("ARI Stock Repurchase Program"). The ARI Stock Repurchase Program will end upon the earlier of the date on which it is
terminated by ARI's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are completed. The timing and amount of stock
repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon ARI's evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The ARI Stock
Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time and ARI has no obligation to repurchase any
amount of its common stock under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program. Under the ARI Stock Repurchase Program, ARI
repurchased shares of its common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2016 at a cost of $17 million.
Gaming
On July 31, 2015 Tropicana's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock
with no set expiration date ("Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program"). The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program will end upon
the earlier of the date on which the plan is terminated by Tropicana's board of directors or when all authorized repurchases are
completed. The timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be determined based upon Tropicana's evaluation of
market conditions and other factors. The Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued
at any time and Tropicana has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the Tropicana Stock
Repurchase Program. Under the Tropicana Stock Repurchase Program, Tropicana repurchased shares of its common stock
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 at a cost of approximately $4 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Other than the goodwill impairment for our Energy segment as discussed below, there have been no material changes to our
critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to those reported in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Energy
Due to worsening sales trends for our Energy segment's Petroleum reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill
impairment analysis during the first quarter of 2016. Based on this analysis, our Energy segment recognized a goodwill
impairment charge of $574 million, which represented the full amount of the remaining goodwill allocated to the Petroleum
reporting unit. Due to the complexity in the "Step 2" goodwill impairment test performed during the first quarter of 2016, we
expect to finalize the assessment of our Energy segment's goodwill impairment during the third quarter of 2016 and any
resulting difference in the amount of the impairment will be adjusted at that time.
Our Energy segment's reporting unit fair values are based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, one of
which is projecting future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved (“Discounted Cash Flow” or
“DCF”). Assumptions used in a DCF require the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate
discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash
flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan, the estimates are based on assumed growth rates. We
believe that our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. The
discount rates, which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections, used in a DCF are based on
estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”) of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our
analysis of peer companies and consider the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant
perspective.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Refer to Part I, Note 1, "Description of Business and Basis of Presentation," of this Report for a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements applicable to us.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements included in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” which are
not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the safe
harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
by Public Law 104-67.
Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject
to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from trends, plans, or expectations set forth in the
forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties may include the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and those set forth in this Report.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Information about our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for each of our segments discussed below did
not differ materially from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of our 2015 Form 10-K.
Investment
Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our Investment segment and the sensitivities to movements in the fair
value of the Investment Funds' investments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Investment Funds primarily fluctuates in response to changes in the
value of securities. The net effect of these fair value changes impacts the net gains from investment activities in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations. The Investment Funds' risk is regularly evaluated and is managed on a position basis
as well as on a portfolio basis. Senior members of our investment team meet on a regular basis to assess and review certain
risks, including concentration risk, correlation risk and credit risk for significant positions. Certain risk metrics and other
analytical tools are used in the normal course of business by the General Partners.
74
Market Risk
The Investment Funds hold investments that are reported at fair value as of the reporting date, which include securities owned,
securities sold, not yet purchased and derivatives as reported on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Based on their
respective balances as of June 30, 2016, we estimate that in the event of a 10% adverse change in the fair value of these
investments, the fair values of securities owned, securities sold, not yet purchased and derivatives would decrease by
approximately $922 million, $131 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. However, as of June 30, 2016, we estimate that the
impact to our share of the net gain (loss) from investment activities reported in our condensed consolidated statement of
operations would be less than the change in fair value since we have an investment of approximately 31% in the Investment
Funds, and the non-controlling interests in income would correspondingly offset approximately 69% of the change in fair value.
Credit Risk
We and certain of our consolidated Investment Funds are subject to certain inherent risks through our investments.
Our entities typically invest excess cash in large money market funds. The money market funds primarily invest in government
securities and other short-term, highly liquid instruments with a low risk of loss. The Investment Funds also maintain free credit
balances with their prime brokers and in interest bearing accounts at major banking institutions. We seek to diversify our cash
investments across several accounts and institutions and we monitor performance and counterparty risk.
The Investment Funds and, to a lesser extent, other entities hold derivative instruments that are subject to credit risk in the
event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. When the Investment Funds make such
investments or enter into other arrangements where they might suffer a significant loss through the default or insolvency of a
counterparty, the General Partners monitor the credit quality of such counterparty and seek to do business with creditworthy
counterparties. Counterparty risk is monitored by obtaining and reviewing public information filed by the counterparties and
others.
Automotive
See Note 6, “Financial Instruments-Automotive,” to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding
our Automotive segment's interest rate risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk.
The translated values of revenue and expense from our Automotive segment's international operations are subject to
fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our Automotive segment
derived 38% of its sales in the United States and 62% internationally. Of these international sales, 55% were denominated in
the euro, with no other single currency representing more than 10% of international sales. To minimize foreign currency risk,
our Automotive segment generally maintains natural hedges within its non-U.S. activities, including the matching of operational
revenues and costs. Where natural hedges are not in place, our Automotive segment manages certain aspects of its foreign
currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts.
Energy
The risk inherent in our Energy segment's market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss from adverse
changes in commodity prices, RINs prices and interest rates. Our Energy segment is exposed to market pricing for all of the
products sold in the future both at its petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, as all of the products
manufactured in both businesses are commodities.
Our Energy segment's earnings and cash flows and estimates of future cash flows are sensitive to changes in energy prices.
The prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially in recent years. These prices depend on many
factors, including the overall demand for crude oil and refined products, which in turn depends, among other factors, general
economic conditions, the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products, the availability of imports of
crude oil and refined products, the marketing of alternative and competing fuels, the extent of government regulations and
global market dynamics. The prices our Energy segment receives for refined products are also affected by factors such as local
market conditions and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets. The prices at which our Energy segment can
sell gasoline and other refined products are strongly influenced by the price of crude oil. Generally, an increase or decrease in
the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products. The
timing of the relative movement of the prices, however, can impact profit margins, which could significantly affect our Energy
segment's earnings and cash flows.
75
Commodity Price Risk
At June 30, 2016, CVR Refining had open commodity hedging instruments consisting of 0.4 million barrels of crack spreads
and 0.6 million barrels of price and basis swaps. A change of $1.00 per barrel in the fair value of the benchmark crude or
product basis would result in an increase or decrease in the related fair value of the commodity hedging instruments of
approximately $1.0 million.
Compliance Program Price Risk
As a producer of transportation fuels from petroleum, CVR Refining is required to blend biofuels into the products it produces or
to purchase RINs in the open market in lieu of blending to meet the mandates established by the EPA. CVR Refining is
exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of RINs needed to comply with the RFS. To mitigate the impact of this
risk on the results of operations and cash flows, CVR Refining purchases RINs when prices are deemed favorable. See Note
17, "Commitments and Contingencies," to Part I, Item 1 of this Report and “Energy - Major Influences on Results of Operations”
in Part I, Item 2 of this Report for further discussion about compliance with the RFS.
Interest Rate Risk
CVR Partners had two floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk
associated with a portion of its $125 million floating rate term debt. The interest rate swaps agreements expired February 12,
2016, and subsequently, CVR Partners had exposure to interest rate risk on 100% of its $125 million floating rate debt under its
credit facility. On April 1, 2016, CVR Partners repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan with respect to this credit
facility and the credit facility was terminated.
Railcar
Our Railcar segment is exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials, especially steel and heavy
castings. The cost of steel, heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of railcars represents a significant
amount of the direct manufacturing costs per railcar. Given the significant volatility in the price of raw materials, this exposure
can affect the costs of production. Our Railcar segment believes that the risk to its margins and profitability has been somewhat
reduced by its practice to generally adjust the purchase prices of the railcars to reflect fluctuations in the cost of certain raw
materials and components and, as a result, our Railcar segment is generally able to pass on to its customers most increases in
raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars it plans to produce and deliver to them. Our Railcar segment
believes that it currently has good supplier relationships and does not currently anticipate that material constraints will limit its
production capacity. Such constraints may exist if railcar production were to increase beyond current levels, or other economic
changes were to occur that affect the availability of certain raw materials.
Our Railcar segment's financial results could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on
its variable rate debt obligation as of June 30, 2016. A one percentage point increase in the rate of the average variable rate
debt as of June 30, 2016 would have a $10 million impact on our Railcar segment's annualized interest expense.
Gaming
Interest Rate Risk
Tropicana's primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with its Tropicana New Term Loan Facility that
bears interest based on floating rates. Based on Tropicana's borrowings as of June 30, 2016, assuming a 1% increase over the
4% floor specified in its Tropicana New Term Loan Facility, Tropicana's annual interest cost would change by approximately
$3 million.
Mining
Commodity Price Risk
Ferrous Resources’ revenues are based on the sale of iron ore fines. Our Mining segment's financial results can vary
significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of iron ore. International prices for this commodity have fluctuated
historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond Ferrous Resources' control. The price index that is utilized in our
Mining segment's iron ore sales contracts is the Platts 62 percent Fe fines spot rate pricing, which can fluctuate widely due to
numerous factors, such as global economic growth or contraction, change in demand for steel or changes in availability of
supply. Our Mining segment estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the international price of iron ore for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 would have decreased net income attributable to Icahn Enterprises for our Mining segment by
$2 million.
76
Foreign Currency Risk
Ferrous Resources' principal objective is to produce iron ore which is typically priced in U.S. dollars. The majority of its funding
and cash balances are also denominated in U.S. dollars. A proportion of Ferrous Resources' costs are incurred in Brazilian
reals while significant capital expenditures are expected to be incurred in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, our Mining segment's
financial results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. Our Mining
segment estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 would have decreased net income attributable to Icahn Enterprises for our Mining segment by $2
million.
Holding Company
Equity Price Risk
The carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management's estimates
of fair value as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in
the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a
security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of
alternative investments and general market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may
be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.
Based on sensitivity analysis for our equity price risks as of June 30, 2016, the effects of a 10% adverse change in the fair
value of these investments would result in loss of approximately $32 million.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
As of June 30, 2016, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Icahn Enterprises' and Icahn Enterprises Holdings' and subsidiaries' disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to the Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
77
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I, Item I of
this Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, for a description of the litigation, legal and administrative
proceedings and environmental matters.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Except for the risk factor related to our Automotive segment as discussed below, there were no other material changes to our
risk factors during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
Our Automotive segment's operations in foreign countries exposes it to risks related to economic and political conditions and
foreign currency fluctuations:
As a global business operating in a time of increasing global economic and political instability, our Automotive segment is
exposed to global market risks, the consequences of which cannot always be anticipated or quantified.  One example is the
recent decision of voters in the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”). While any
ultimate effects of Brexit on our Automotive segment are difficult to predict (particularly given the potentially lengthy negotiation
period to accomplish a formal withdrawal), because our Automotive segment currently conduct its business in the United
Kingdom and in Europe, the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create
uncertainty for our Automotive segment's businesses, including affecting its relationships with its customers and suppliers, and
could also alter the relationship among currencies, including the value of the British Pound relative to the US Dollar. Such
disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect our Automotive segment's financial condition, operating results and cash
flows. Any ultimate effects of Brexit on our Automotive segment will also depend on whether the UK negotiates to retain access
to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.  The failed coup attempt in Turkey, a
country in which our Automotive segment has various ownership and economic interests, is another example of a recent global
political development for which any potential consequences for our Automotive segment are uncertain.  These and other
developments may increase volatility in the results our Automotive segment's operations and may adversely affect our
Automotive segment's financial condition.
Item 5. Other Information.
On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the
"Agreement"), effective on August 2, 2016.  The Agreement incorporates amendments No. 1 through No. 6, previously
