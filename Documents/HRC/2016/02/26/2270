</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that women and men have the right to enjoy, on an equal basis, all 
their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is essential for the enjoyment of other human 
rights and freedoms, and constitutes a fundamental pillar for building a democratic society 
and strengthening democracy, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, 
indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,

expression and, in this context, expressing concern at the risks faced by these women in the 
exercise of their work, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the critical importance of women&#8217;s political participation in all contexts, 
including in times of peace and of conflict and at all stages of political transition, concerned

with men, and noting in that regard that situations of political transition may provide a 
unique opportunity to address such obstacles,

realization of all human rights, to the promotion of democracy, sustainable development

</p>
<p> <i>Highly concerned</i> that women in every part of the world, including women 
belonging to racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities and indigenous women, 
continue to be marginalized from the political, economic, cultural and social spheres, often 
as a result of discrimination, unequal access to education, lack of access to health care, the 
disproportionate effect of poverty on women, and violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i> the fundamental role that freedom of opinion and expression plays in 
the ability of women to interact with society at large, in particular in the realms of 
economic and political participation, and reaffirms that the active participation of women,

equality, sustainable development, peace and democracy;
