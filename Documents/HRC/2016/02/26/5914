</p>
<p>1. On 14 July 2005, in its resolution 59/113 B, the General Assembly adopted the plan of 
action for the first phase (2005-2007) of the World Programme for Human Rights Education. 
The first phase of the World Programme focused on the infusion of human rights education into 
the primary and secondary school systems. Drawing from the principles and frameworks set by 
international human rights instruments, the plan of action highlights that human rights education 
in the school system involves not only the integration of human rights in all educational 
processes and tools (curricula, textbooks, materials, methods and training) but also the practice 
of human rights in the education system. The main responsibility for implementing the plan rests 
with the ministry of education or equivalent institution in each country, which should assign or 
strengthen a department or unit responsible for coordinating the development and 
implementation of a related national strategy, in close cooperation with all relevant actors. 
Member States are also encouraged to identify and support a resource centre for collecting and 
disseminating related initiatives and information, such as good practices, educational materials 
and events. On 28 September 2007, in its resolution 6/24, the Human Rights Council decided to 
extend the first phase of the World Programme for two more years, until December 2009. 
</p>
<p>2. The previous report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
World Programme and related activities undertaken by her Office (A/HRC/4/85) was dated 
30 January 2007. The present report, submitted in accordance with Council resolution 6/24, 
provides additional information on activities held from January 2007 to June 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under consideration, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) focused on promoting and assisting the national 
implementation of the plan of action, as well as on coordinating related international efforts.  
</p>
<p>4.  OHCHR has devoted a section of its website to the World Programme and regularly 
replies to related queries. To facilitate information-sharing, OHCHR is making available 
information on national initiatives undertaken in connection with the plan of action through 
the World Programme web page www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/national-
initiatives.htm., which also contains the text of national human rights education plans as well as 
excerpts on human rights education from overall human rights plans and information on national 
focal points for the World Programme.  
</p>
<p>5.  OHCHR has supported the collection and documentation of good practices on human 
rights education in the school system at the regional level. Together with the Office for 
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and 
the Council of Europe, OHCHR is developing a compendium of good practices from Central 
Asia, Europe and North America, which will be launched on 10 December 2008, as a 
contribution to the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As part of 
this initiative, a regional meeting on the World Programme was organized in Strasbourg (France) 
on 5 and 6 November 2007, gathering more than 100 participants from ministries of education, 
teacher training institutions, non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions 
and other relevant actors from the region. OHCHR is also sponsoring the collection of good 
practices in Asia, both locally (Tamil Nadu/India) and subregionally (South-East Asia). </p>

</p>
<p>6. OHCHR has continued to liaise with a wide range of actors, including Governments, civil 
society actors, United Nations entities and other intergovernmental organizations, through the 
provision of advice and information, participation in related events, distribution of OHCHR 
publications and expression of support through messages from the High Commissioner and the 
Deputy High Commissioner.  
</p>
<p>7.  OHCHR has also continued to ensure the secretariat of the United Nations Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Committee on Human Rights Education in the School System, in accordance with 
the World Programme plan of action. The Committee is composed of 12 United Nations entities 
(the International Labour Organization, OHCHR, the Joint United Nations Programme for 
HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Development Group, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the Department of Public Information, the International Bureau of Education of 
UNESCO, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the World Bank) and aims to facilitate coordinated 
United Nations support for the national integration of human rights education in primary and 
secondary school systems.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>8.  During the period under consideration, the United Nations Inter-Agency Coordinating 
Committee on Human Rights Education in the School System met four times: on 
20 and 21 February 2007, in Geneva; on 1 June 2007, in Geneva; on 17 and 18 January 2008, in 
Paris; and on 13 June 2008, in Geneva. It undertook various initiatives to raise awareness on the 
plan of action and to promote inter-agency cooperation at the national level.  
</p>
<p>9. In December 2007, the High Commissioner addressed correspondence to all ministers of 
education on behalf of the Coordinating Committee, encouraging national implementation of the 
plan of action and requesting further information on national progress. As at 30 June 2008, 
OHCHR had received responses from 36 countries (see annex). Letters were also addressed to 
United Nations Resident Coordinators to solicit the support of United Nations country teams for 
the national implementation of the plan of action.  
</p>
<p>10. The Coordinating Committee organized events during the fourth and sixth sessions of the 
Council (on 21 and 22 March 2007, and 24 and 25 September 2007), to disseminate information 
about the plan of action and to share examples of related initiatives undertaken by national 
authorities with the support of the United Nations. On the occasion of the World Day against 
Child Labour on 12 June 2008, the Coordinating Committee released a joint statement 
encouraging Member States &#8220;to ensure education, and in particular human rights education, as a 
concrete response to child labour&#8221;.

<p>11. OHCHR has continued to contribute to the implementation of the World Programme and 
its plan of action by conducting the following activities:<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> (a) Facilitating information-sharing and networking among all actors through the 
ongoing development of the OHCHR Database on Human Rights Education and Training, which 
provides information on relevant institutions, programmes and materials (accessible at 
http://hre.ohchr.org/hret), and of the Resource Collection on Human Rights Education and 
Training, a specialized section of the OHCHR library that includes a variety of human rights 
education and training materials. OHCHR continues to respond on a daily basis to related queries 
from governmental and non-governmental actors, including by providing human rights education 
and training reference services and advice. OHCHR has also supported international and regional 
human rights education activities organized by other actors through grants, publications, 
participation of specialized staff and other initiatives, as appropriate;  
</p>
<p> (b) Supporting national capacities for human rights education and training through 
projects undertaken within the framework of the OHCHR programme of technical cooperation in 
the field of human rights.<b>3</b> OHCHR has continued to devote enhanced efforts to strengthening 
national capacities for human rights training of military, police and other staff deployed to 
peacekeeping operations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Supporting grass-roots human rights education initiatives through the Assisting 
Communities Together Project, a joint initiative of OHCHR and UNDP. The project provides 
small grants to national and local non-governmental organizations for community-based human 
rights education and training projects. In the fifth phase (2005-2008), which focused on 
supporting activities within the school system, OHCHR supported 155 projects in 44 countries.<b>4</b> 
In May 2008, UNDP and OHCHR launched the sixth phase (2008-2009) of the Project, in which 
the participation of 33 countries is envisaged. To create synergy with the first phase of the World 
Programme, the sixth phase of the Project will focus on supporting projects contributing to the
