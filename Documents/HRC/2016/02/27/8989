<p> The General Assembly, in its resolution 63/178 on the right to development, reaffirmed its 
request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the right 
to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership 
for development between Member States, development agencies and the international 
development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in her next 
report to the Human Rights Council. It also requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to 
the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and an interim report to the Council on the 
implementation of resolution 63/178.  
</p>
<p> In accordance with the above-mentioned requests, relevant reporting practice and taking 
into account the fact that the Working Group on the Right to Development will submit a report 
on its next session, from 22 to 26 June 2009, to the Council at its twelfth session, a consolidated 
report of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner will be submitted to the Council at 
that session.
