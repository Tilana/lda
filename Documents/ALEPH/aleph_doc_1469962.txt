FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are
not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by 
terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential” or “continue”, the 
negative  of  such  terms  or  other  comparable  terminology.  In  evaluating  these  statements,  you  should  consider  various  factors,  including  the 
assumptions, risks and uncertainties outlined in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2011, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, 
and, from time to time, in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These factors or any of them may 
cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue 
reliance on such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this quarterly report include, among others, statements regarding:
(cid:122) our capital needs;
(cid:122) business plans; and
(cid:122) expectations.
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment 
regarding future events, our actual results will likely vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other
future performance suggested herein. Some of the risks and assumptions include:
(cid:122) our need for additional financing;
(cid:122) our limited operating history;
(cid:122) our history of operating losses;
(cid:122) our exploration activities may not result in commercially exploitable quantities of ore on our current or any future mineral properties;
(cid:122) the  risks  inherent  in  the  exploration  for  minerals  such  as  geologic  formation,  weather,  accidents,  equipment  failures  and  governmental
restrictions;
(cid:122) the competitive environment in which we operate;
(cid:122) changes in governmental regulation and administrative practices;
(cid:122) our dependence on key personnel;
(cid:122) conflicts of interest of our directors and officers;
(cid:122) our ability to fully implement our business plan;
(cid:122) our ability to effectively manage our growth; and
(cid:122) other regulatory, legislative and judicial developments.
We advise the reader that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirety all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons 
acting on our behalf. Important factors that you should also consider, include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in our 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2011.
The forward-looking statements in this quarterly report are made as of the date of this quarterly report and we do not intend or undertake to update
any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws 
of the United States.

(formerly Geneva Resources Inc.) 
(An exploration stage company) 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOVEMBER 30, 2011 (unaudited) 
 
NOTE 1 –BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Basis of Presentation  
These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in  United  States  dollars  and  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s May 31, 2011 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the
periods ended November 30, 2011 and the same period last year are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally 
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the
information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2011 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those
financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting 
solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the six months ended November 30, 2011 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending May 31, 2012.
Going concern  
To date the Company has generated minimal revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $11,087,971.
As at November 30, 2011, the Company has a working capital deficit of $736,469. The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing
obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund
its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its mineral exploration business by way of private placements and advances
from related parties as may be required. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Bonnyridge (PTY) Ltd., a Botswana 
company, acquired effective August 2, 2011 (refer to Note 3). All significant inter-company transactions and account balances have been eliminated 
upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions  
Preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Mineral Property Expenditures 
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining,” when management has 
determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate financial resources are
available  or  are  expected  to  be  available  as  required  to  meet  the  terms  of  property  acquisition  and  budgeted  exploration  and  development
expenditures.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  if  the  criteria  for  capitalization  are  not  met.  In  the  event  that  mineral
property  acquisition  costs  are  paid  with  Company  shares,  those  shares  are  recorded  at  the  estimated  fair  value  at  the  time  the  shares  are  due  in
accordance with the terms of the property agreements.

(formerly Geneva Resources Inc.)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOVEMBER 30, 2011 (unaudited) 
 
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and pre-
feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production basis. 
Costs,  which  include  production  equipment  removal  and  environmental  remediation,  are  estimated  each  period  by  management  based  on  current
regulations,  actual  expenses  incurred,  and  technology  and  industry  standards.  Any  charge  is  included  in  exploration  expense  or the  provision  for
depletion and depreciation during the period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred.
Prior to the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred only property option payments and exploration costs which
have been expensed.
To date the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties.
Asset Retirement Obligations  
The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 410-20 “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations,” which establishes standards for 
the  initial  measurement  and  subsequent  accounting  for  obligations  associated  with the  sale,  abandonment  or  other  disposal of  long-lived  tangible 
assets arising from the acquisition, construction or development and for normal operations of such assets. The adoption of this standard has had no
effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. As of November 30, 2011, any potential costs relating to the ultimate disposition
of the Company’s mineral property interests are not yet determinable.
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Net Income (Loss) per Share  
The Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both 
basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income
(loss)  per  share  gives  effect  to  all  dilutive  potential  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Dilutive  loss  per  share  excludes  all  potential
common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance with FASB ASC 830-10, “Foreign Currency Matters,”
foreign  denominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  to  their  United  States  dollar  equivalents  using  foreign  exchange  rates  which
prevailed  at  the  balance  sheet  date.  Revenue  and  expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  during  the  period.  Related  translation
adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are 
included in results of operations.
Stock-based Compensation  
On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB ASC 718-10, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” under this method, compensation cost recognized 
for the year ended May 31, 2007 included: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of May 31, 2006,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based 
payments granted subsequent to May 31, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718-10. 
In addition, deferred stock compensation related to non-vested options is required to be eliminated against additional paid-in capital upon adoption of 
FASB ASC 718-10. The results for the prior periods were not restated.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with
the  conclusions  reached  by  the  FASB  ASC  505-50.  Costs  are  measured  at  the  estimated  fair  market  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  the 
estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration
other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or
services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
In  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  FASB  ASC  820-10,  the  Company  has  determined  the  estimated  fair  value of  financial  instruments  using
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities
approximate their carrying value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments.
NOTE 3 –MINERAL EXPLORATION PROPERTIES
Botswana leases  
On March 14, 2011 the Company entered into a formal Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Tignish (PTY) Ltd., a Botswana company 
(the “Vendor”), to purchase 95 percent of the issued and outstanding shares (the “Shares”) of Bonnyridge (PTY) Ltd., also a Botswana company 
(“Bonnyridge”), which is the legal and beneficial owner of three mineral license blocks located in Northwestern Botswana, Africa (the “Property”).
In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, and in order to purchase the Shares, the Company was required to provide the Vendor with: (i) an
initial cash payment of $200,000 by April 20, 2011 (paid); (ii) a further cash payment of $100,000 on or before closing; and (iii) 6,500,000 restricted
common shares of the Company at closing; and which closing was required to occur prior to April 29, 2011 unless otherwise mutually determined.
The closing date was subsequently extended to provide adequate time to obtain final regulatory approvals in Botswana. These regulatory approvals
were obtained on July 22, 2011. The further cash payment of $100,000 was paid on July 29, 2011 and the 6,500,000 restricted common shares of the
Company were issued to the Vendor on August 2, 2011.
In addition to the consideration payable above, under this purchase agreement Sono was required to pay a further $600,000 in cash over a three-year 
period.
On August 11, 2011 Sono agreed to acquire the remaining 5% Shares of Bonnyridge by paying $100,000 (paid September 23 2011) in cash and
issuing  1,000,000  additional  restricted  common  shares  from  treasury  (issued  on  August  30,  2011);  thereby  also  eliminating  the  additional  cash
payments of $600,000 as referred to above.
For  the  period  from  August  2,  2001  to  August  11,  2011,  Bonnyridge  had  no  significant  operations  or  cash  flows  and  accordingly  the  above
transactions have been accounted for as a single business combination effective August 2, 2011 using the purchase method.

On November 15, 2011, the Company closed a private placement of 2,480,000 units of the Company (each, a “Unit”) at US$0.50 per Unit, for total 
gross proceeds of US$1,064,925, net of offering cost. Each Unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant of the Company, with
each warrant exercisable to purchase one additional common share at US$0.75 per share for a period of 24 months from closing. The Company issued

On September 17, 2011, the Company granted 2,275,000 stock options to officers and directors of the Company at $0.50 per share. The term of these
options are ten years. The total fair value of these options at the date of grant was $1,296,750 and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model with an expected life of 10 years, a risk free interest rate of 2.08%, a dividend yield of 0%, and expected volatility of 260%.
On November 30, 2011, the Company granted 300,000 stock options to consultants at $0.50 per share. The term of these options are five years. The
total fair value of these options at the date of grant was $123,000 and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with an expected 
life of 5 years, a risk free interest rate of 2.08%, a dividend yield of 0%, and expected volatility of 260%.
On November 15, 2011, in connection with the closing of the above private placement, and in accordance with the terms of an agency agreement

units (each, an “Agent’s Units”) at a price of $0.50 per Agent’s Unit for a period of 24 months from closing. The total fair value of these options at the
date of grant was $121,520 and since the options have been accounted for as the offering costs related to the private placement and reduction of the
equity, the impact on the financial statement is nil.

The  following  discussion  of  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended
November 30, 2011 and 2010 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for the
three  and  six  months  ended  November  30,  2011  and  2010.  The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  involve  risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many
factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” below and elsewhere throughout this quarterly report.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s May 31, 2011 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the
periods ended November 30, 2011 and the same period last year are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.
Overview of our Business
We are currently engaged in the business of exploration of precious metals with a focus on the exploration and development of gold deposits in North
America and internationally. As of the date of this quarterly report, our mineral interests consist mainly of prospecting licences on exploration stage
properties as discussed below. We have not established any proven or probable reserves on our mineral property interests.
We  were  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Nevada  on  April  5,  2004  under  the  name  “Revelstoke  Industries,  Inc.”  for  the  purpose  of 
reclaiming  and stabilizing land in preparation for construction in Canada.  Effective November 27, 2006,  we changed our name  to “Geneva Gold 
Corp.” Subsequently, effective March 1, 2007, we changed our name to “Geneva Resources, Inc.” On February 10, 2011 we merged with our wholly-
owned subsidiary, Sono  Resources, Inc., pursuant to Articles of Merger that the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.  This  merger
became effective March 11, 2011 and we changed our name to Sono Resources, Inc. We are an exploration stage enterprise, as defined in FASB ASC
915 “Development Stage Entities.”
Our principal offices are located at Suite 125, 2533 N. Carson Street, Carson City, Nevada 89706; our telephone number is (775) 348-9330. The 
principal offices of Bonnyridge (Pty) Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, are located at Acumen Park, Plot 50370, Fairgrounds Office Park, P.O. Box

Mineral Properties
Vilcoro Gold Property
On February 23, 2007, we entered into a Property Option Agreement with St. Elias Mines Ltd., (“St. Elias”) a publicly traded company on the TSX-V 
exchange,  to  acquire  not  less  than  an  undivided  66%  legal,  beneficial  and  registerable  interest  in  certain  mining  leases  in  Peru  comprised  of
approximately 600 hectares in Peru.
On  December  1,  2007,  we  entered into  an extension  agreement  with  St.  Elias  (the  “December  Extension  Agreement”).  The  December  Extension 
Agreement (i) acknowledged that in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Property Option Agreement, we must incur and pay exploration
expenditures  of  not  less  than  $500,000  prior  to  January  17,  2008,  and  (ii)  provided  an  extension  until  March  31,  2008  to  incur  and  pay  such
Exploration Expenditures. On June 4, 2008, an indefinite extension  was granted by St. Elias to  pay such Exploration Expenditures, based on the
Operator’s work on schedule.
Under  the  terms  of  the  Property  Option  Agreement,  and  in  order  to  exercise  its  Option  to  acquire  the  properties,  we  were  required  to  make  the
following non-refundable cash payments to St. Elias totaling $350,000 in the following manner:
1. 
2.
3.
Payment of $50,000 in cash (paid). 
The second payment of $100,000 in cash and issuance of 12,500 shares of the Company’s common stock were due on or before the 
twelve month anniversary of the signing of the Property Option Agreement (paid and issued).
The third payment of $200,000 in cash was due on or before the twenty fourth month anniversary of the signing of the Property Option 
Agreement.
15
We were also required to incur costs totaling $2,500,000 as follows:
1.
2.
3.
expenditures  of  $500,000  were  to  be  incurred  on  or  before  the  twelve  month  anniversary  (subsequently  indefinitely  extended  as 
described  above)  of  the  signing  of  the  Property  Option  Agreement.  ($551,000  was  incurred  from  the  inception  of  the  agreement 
through May 31, 2009); 
expenditures of $750,000 were to be incurred on or before the twenty-fourth-month anniversary (subsequently indefinitely extended as 
described above) of the signing of the Property Option Agreement; and
expenditures of $1,250,000 were to be incurred on or before the thirty-sixth-month anniversary (subsequently indefinitely extended as 
described above) of the signing of the Property Option Agreement.
Also under the terms of the Property Option Agreement, St. Elias would be the operator of the properties and would receive an 8% operator fee on all
exploration  expenditures.  Once  we  exercised  the  Option  defined  above,  we  agreed  to  pay  100%  of  all  ongoing  exploration,  development  and
production costs until commercial production and we had the right to receive 100% of any cash flow from commercial production of the properties
until we had recouped our production costs, after which the cash flow would be allocated 66% to us and 34% to St. Elias.
On November 10, 2008, we commenced legal proceedings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada against each of St. Elias and John
Brophy, P. Geol. We sought rescission of the Property Option Agreement and the return of all funds and shares advanced by us to St. Elias. We
alleged that St. Elias failed to properly discharge its duty as an operator of the Vilcoro Property and also alleged that each of St. Elias and Mr. Brophy
failed to provide us with complete and accurate information relating to the ownership of the Vilcoro Property and to the ownership of the adjacent
property, including failing to disclose that Mr. Brophy and his wife had an interest in the Vilcoro Property and the adjacent property. We also alleged
that St. Elias used some of the exploration funds provided by us to fund the exploration of the adjoining property.
A statement of Defense was filed by St. Elias and Mr. Brophy on December 23, 2008, denying the majority of the allegations made by us. In addition
St. Elias and John Brophy also filed a counterclaim against us for abuse of process and punitive damages.
On May 5, 2010, we entered into a mutual release with St. Elias pursuant to which St. Elias and we agreed to release one another from all causes of
action, claims and demands of any nature of kind whatsoever arising out of or in any way related to any of the subject matter of the Statement of
Claim. As part of the mutual release St. Elias agreed to return to us the 12,500 shares of common stock that we previously issued to St. Elias. On July
12, 2010, the 12,500 shares were returned to treasury and cancelled.
During fiscal 2009, we recorded  a mineral  property  recovery  of  $50,000 in connection  with  the  return of funds  originally paid  into trust  to  fund
exploration activities.
San Juan Property
On November 16, 2006, we entered into a Property Option Agreement with Petaquilla Minerals Ltd (“Petaquilla”). Petaquilla therein granted us the 
sole and exclusive option to acquire up to a 70% undivided interest in and to five exploration concessions situated in the Republic of Panama owned
and controlled by Petaquilla’s wholly-owned subsidiary.
During 2007, certain disputes arose between us and Petaquilla which were resolved during 2008 by way of a settlement agreement (the “Settlement”), 
mutual release and the ultimate termination of the original option agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement: (i) Petaquilla issued 100,000
shares of its common stock to us, subject to pooling and release in four equal monthly tranches commencing no later than December 31, 2008 and
certain other conditions, (ii) the 1,000,000 shares of the restricted common stock that we previously issued to Petaquilla were returned to us; and (iii)
the $100,000 that we previously paid in order to exercise the initial portion of the Option was returned to us.
As of May 31, 2008, we had received $100,000 and the return of the 1,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of
$5,440,000. In addition, we recorded the 100,000 common shares of Petaquilla, with an estimated fair value of $270,000, as accounts receivable as of
May 31, 2008. The total proceeds of $5,810,000 was included in amounts recorded as gain on settlements during 2008.
During fiscal 2009, we received the 100,000 common shares receivable from Petaquilla, previously valued at $270,000. As of May 31, 2009, the
100,000 shares received had an estimated fair value of $55,000 ($0.55 per share). During 2010, we sold the shares for net proceeds to us of $54,810
for a loss on disposal of $215,190.

Amelia and San Martin
On November 20, 2009, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Glenn Patrick Schmitz (“Optionor”) in connection with the proposed acquisition of 
an 80% interest in 39 mineral concessions located near Domyeko in Chile. The parties agreed to complete their due diligence and the execution of a
Formal Agreement within 60 days of the execution of the Letter Agreement. The material terms and conditions (based on successful due diligence as
defined) set out in the term sheet were as follows:
1. 
2.
3.
We were to pay the Optionor $5,000 upon the parties execution of the Letter Agreement. Funds were paid on November 23, 2009.
We would transfer and deliver 500,000 restricted common shares in our capital stock to the Optionor as follows: 125,000 shares as the 
initial tranche within thirty days of the Formal Agreement date; 250,000 shares upon the expiry of the first twelve month period after 
the Formal Agreement date; and 125,000 shares upon the expiry of the second twelve month period after the Formal Agreement date.
We  would pay  the  Optionor further  amounts  as  follows: $300,000  prior  to the  first  anniversary  of the  Formal  Agreement  date; an 
amount to be solely and exclusively determined by us in our judgment, based on the first year term drilling and exploration results, 
would  be  paid  as  exploration  expenditures  by  us  prior  to  the  second  anniversary;  and  an  amount  to  be  solely  and  exclusively 
determined  by  us  in  our  judgment,  based  on  the  second  year  term  drilling  and  explorations  results,  would  be  paid  as  exploration 
expenditures by us prior to the third anniversary.
Based on the results of the due diligence, we decided not to proceed with this proposed acquisition and made a request for a refund of the $5,000
deposit. As of May 31, 2010, the $5,000 was written off to loss on option deposit based on uncertainty as to collection.
Botswana Share Purchase Agreement
During the year ended May 31, 2011, we entered into a formal Share Purchase Agreement, as amended, (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with 
Tignish (PTY) Ltd., a Botswana company (the “Vendor”), to purchase 95 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Bonnyridge (PTY) Ltd., also
a Botswana company (“Bonnyridge”), which is the legal and beneficial owner of three mineral license blocks located in Northwestern Botswana,
Africa (the “Property”).
Effective July 25, 2011, we completed the acquisition from the Vendor of 950 common shares of Bonnyridge (the “Purchased Shares”), representing 
95% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bonnyridge. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Vendor has sold, and the Company has
purchased, the Purchased Shares for the following consideration: (i) an initial cash payment of US$200,000 (paid April 20, 2011); (ii) a further cash
payment  of  US$100,000  (paid  July  29,  2011);  and  (iii)  6,500,000  restricted  common  shares  of  the  Company  (issued  July  31,  2011).  In  order  to
maintain  its  Property  interests,  Bonnyridge  continued  to  be  obligated  to  provide  the  Vendor  with  USD$900,000  payable  in  three  instalments  of
USD$300,000  per  year  over  a  three-year  period  and,  in  addition,  carry  out  an  exploration  program  on  the  2,965.6  square  km  of  mineral  rights 
covering the Property with an expenditure commitment over the three-year period of approximately USD$1,750,000. As such, Sono became obligated 
to pay such $900,000 in cash over a three-year period ($300,000 of which was covered by the two cash payments described above).
The foregoing description of the Share Purchase Agreement and the four amending agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Share Purchase Agreement and the four amending agreements that were filed as Exhibits to our current reports on Form 8-
K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2011, April 29, 2011, May 25, 2011, June 21, 2011 and July 27, 2011, respectively, and incorporated by reference
herein.
Effective on August 11, 2011, we entered into an agreement in principle to acquire the remaining 5% of the shares of Bonnyridge to hold 100% of its
shares. Sono has now acquired the remaining 5% of the shares by paying $100,000 in cash (paid September 7, 2011) and issuing 1,000,000 additional
shares from treasury (issued August 30, 2011); thereby also eliminating the additional cash payments of $600,000, which had been required under the
Share Purchase Agreement described above.
The foregoing description of the agreement in principle does not does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
agreement in principle which was filed as an Exhibit to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 17, 2011, and is incorporated by 
reference herein.

Proposed Future Business Operations
Our current strategy is to complete further acquisitions of other mineral property opportunities which fall within the criteria of providing a geological
basis for development of mining initiatives that can provide near term revenue potential and production cash flows to create expanding reserves. We
anticipate that our ongoing efforts, subject to adequate funding being available, will continue to be focused on successfully concluding negotiations
for additional interests in mineral properties. We plan to build a strategic base of producing mineral properties.
Our ability to continue to complete planned exploration activities and expand acquisitions and explore mining opportunities is dependent on adequate
capital resources being available and further sources of debt and equity being obtained. However, there can be no assurance that further sources of
debt or equity will be available or on acceptable terms.
Development of Mineral Properties
The requirement to raise further funding for mineral exploration and development for the next twelve months and beyond may be dependent on the
outcome  of  geological  and  engineering  testing  occurring  over  this  interval  on  potential  properties.  If  future  results  provide  the  basis  to  continue
development and geological studies indicate high probabilities of sufficient mineral production quantities, we will attempt to raise capital to further
our programs, build production infrastructure, and raise additional capital for further acquisitions. This includes the following activity:
(cid:122) Target further leases for exploration potential and obtain further funding to acquire new development targets.
(cid:122) Review all available information and studies.
(cid:122) Digitize all available factual information.
(cid:122) Completion of a NI 43-101 Compliant Report with a qualified geologist familiar with mineralization in the respective area.
(cid:122) Determine feasibility and amenability of extracting the minerals.
(cid:122) Create investor communications materials, corporate identity.
(cid:122) Raise funding for mineral development.
Competition
We  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  industry,  competing  with  other  mining  and  exploration  companies,  and  institutional  and  individual  investors,
which are actively seeking metal and mineral based exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials
required to exploit such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources, staff and facilities substantially greater than ours. The principal
area of competition is encountered in the financial ability to cost effectively acquire prime metal and minerals exploration prospects and then exploit
such  prospects.  Competition  for  the  acquisition  of  metal  and  minerals  exploration  properties  is  intense,  with  many  properties  available  in  a
competitive  bidding  process  in  which  we  may  lack  technological  information  or  expertise  available  to  other  bidders.  Therefore,  we  may  not  be
successful in acquiring and developing profitable properties in the face of this competition. No assurance can be given that a sufficient number of
suitable metal and minerals exploration properties will be available for acquisition and development.
18
Minerals Exploration Regulation
Our minerals exploration activities are, or will be, subject to extensive foreign laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, production,
exports,  taxes,  labor  standards,  occupational  health,  waste  disposal,  protection  and  remediation  of  the  environment,  protection  of  endangered  and
protected species, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. Minerals exploration is also subject to risks and liabilities associated with pollution
of  the  environment  and  disposal  of  waste  products  occurring  as  a  result  of  mineral  exploration  and  production.  Compliance  with  these  laws  and
regulations may impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require us to
expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on
our business operations.
Exploration and production activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance
of our operations. In general, our exploration and production activities are subject to certain foreign regulations and may be subject to federal, state
and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities
and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Compliance with these laws and regulations does not appear to
have a future material effect on our operations or financial condition to date. Specifically, we may be subject to legislation regarding emissions into
the environment, water discharges and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. However, such laws and regulations, whether foreign or local, are
frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. Generally, environmental requirements do not appear to affect us
any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry and our current operations have not expanded to a point where
either compliance or cost of compliance with environmental regulation is a significant issue for us. Costs have not been incurred to date with respect
to compliance with environmental laws but such costs may be expected to increase with an increase in scale and scope of exploration.
Minerals exploration operations are subject to comprehensive regulation which may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of
those anticipated causing an adverse effect on our business operations. Minerals exploration operations are subject to foreign, federal, state, and local
laws  relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment,  including  laws  regulating  removal  of  natural  resources  from  the  ground  and  the  discharge  of
materials  into  the  environment.  Minerals  exploration  operations  are  also  subject  to  federal,  state,  and  local  laws  and  regulations  which  seek  to
maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and equipment. Various permits from government bodies are
required for drilling operations to be conducted; no assurance can be given that such permits will be received. Environmental standards imposed by
federal, state, or local authorities may be changed and any such changes may have material adverse effects on our activities. Moreover, compliance
with  such  laws  may  cause  substantial  delays  or  require  capital  outlays  in  excess  of  those  anticipated,  thus  causing  an  adverse  effect  on  us.
Additionally, we may be subject to liability for pollution or other environmental damages which we may elect not to insure against due to prohibitive
premium costs and other reasons. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have not been required to spend any material amount on compliance with
environmental regulations. However, we may be required to do so in the future and this may affect our ability to expand or maintain our operations.
Research and Development Activities
No research and development expenditures have been incurred, either on our account or sponsored by customers, during the past three years.
Employees
We do not employ any persons on a full-time or on a part-time basis. Peter Wilson is our President/Chief Executive Officer and William D. Thomas is 
our Treasurer/Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are primarily responsible for all our day-to-day operations. Other services are provided by 
outsourcing, consultant, and special purpose contracts.
Stock Incentive Plan
On September 17, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized and approved the adoption of the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, effective September 17, 2011,
under which an aggregate of 3,000,000 of our shares may be issued. On the same date, our Board of Directors unanimously approved and granted in
aggregate 2,275,000 fully vested stock options under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan to certain of our directors and executive officers at an exercise
price of $0.50 per share and an expiry date of ten years from the date of grant. On November 30, 2011, the Company granted 300,000 stock options to
consultants at an exercise price of $0.50 per share and an expiry date of 5 years from the date of grant.
Subsidiaries
The Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, Bonnyridge (Pty) Ltd., a Botswana company.
19
Patents and Trademarks
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
Plan of Operations
Our plan of operations over the next twelve months is to focus on the exploration of our newly acquired Bonnyridge copper/silver concession area
located within the central portion of the Kalahari Copper Belt in Botswana. We are implementing a complementary exploration technique, namely 
analyzing for mobile metal ions - a method using soil samples to detect mineralization at depth where small concentrations of metals coating sand 
grains are brought to the surface by the action of water in the soil. The procedure of analyzing mobile metal ions or MMI is used to chemically strip
off the adhered elements, which have migrated upwards from depth, from the surface of soil grains and then determine the low-level range of metal 
ion concentrations, which are commonly in the parts per billion range. By measuring mobile metal ions in surface soils, the technology has provided
sharp anomalies over deeper seated ore deposits below the Kalahari in other areas. Utilizing this method, we anticipate reducing exploration costs by
improving target generation for follow-up high resolution airborne and ground geophysics and drilling. We estimate that we will be in a position to
commence a drilling program in the first quarter of calendar year 2012.
We estimate that our exploration costs for the next twelve months will be approximately $1,750,000. In addition, we estimate that our other expenses
during that period will be approximately $300,000, for total estimated expenditures of $2,050,000. As at November 30, 2011, we had cash on hand of
$230,486, total current assets of $298,215, and a working capital deficit of $736,469. As such, we will require additional capital in order to pursue our
plan of operations.

Six Months Ended November 30, 2011 Compared to Six Months Ended November 30, 2010
Our comprehensive loss during the six months ended November 30, 2011 was ($2,569,651) compared to comprehensive loss of ($143,699) for six
months  ended  November  30,  2010  (an  increase  in  comprehensive  loss  of  $2,425,952).  During  the  six  months  ended  November  30,  2011  and
November 30, 2010, respectively, we did not generate any revenue.
During the six months ended November 30, 2011, we incurred general and administrative expenses in the aggregate amount of $2,584,141 compared
to $105,328 incurred during the six months ended November 30, 2010 (an increase of $2,478,813). The general and administrative expenses incurred
during the six months ended November 30, 2011 consisted of: (i) office and general of $121,042 (2010: $10,198) which increased in 2011 due to
increased exploration activity in Botswana; (ii) consulting fees of $86,214 (2010: $42,000) which increased in 2011 due to increased exploration
activity in Botswana; (iii) management fees of $1,538,470 (2010: 35,000) which increased in 2011 due to issuance of stock options and exploration
activity in Botswana; (iv) marketing fees of $52,341 ( 2010: $Nil); (v) mineral property expenditures of $518,024 (2010: $Nil) which increased in
2011 due to the increased exploration activity in Botswana and (vi) professional fees of $268,050 (2010: $18,130) which increased in 2011 due to
exploration activity in Botswana. General and administrative expenses generally include corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted
services, marketing and consulting costs.
This resulted in a net operating loss of ($2,584,141) during the six months ended November 30, 2011 compared to a net operating loss of ($105,328)
during the six months ended November 30, 2010.
During  the  six  months  ended  November  30,  2011,  we  recorded  total  other  expense  in  the  amount  of  ($14,650)  compared  to  total  other  expense
recorded  during  the  six  months  ended  November  30,  2010  in  the  amount  of  ($38,371).  The  other  expense  incurred  during  the  six  months  ended
November 30, 2011 consisted of: (i) interest expense of $(14,650) (2010: $(371)); and (ii) legal settlements of $Nil (2010: $(38,000)).
This resulted in a net loss of ($2,598,791) during the six months ended November 30, 2011 compared to a net loss of ($143,699) during the six
months ended November 30, 2010.
During the six months ended November 30, 2011, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $29,140 (2010: $Nil)
This resulted in a comprehensive loss of ($2,569,651) during the period ended November 30, 2011 compared to a comprehensive loss of ($143,699)
during the six months ended November 30, 2010.
The  increase  in  comprehensive  loss  during  six  months  ended  November  30,  2011  compared  to  the  six  months  ended  November  30,  2010  is
attributable  primarily  to  higher  general  and  administrative  costs  for  consulting,  professional,  management  fees,  and  exploration  costs  related  to
mineral property as we increased our business activity in Botswana.
Three Months Ended November 30, 2011 Compared to Three Months Ended November 30, 2010
Our comprehensive loss during the three months ended November 30, 2011 was ($2,374,528) compared to comprehensive loss of ($81,693) for three
months  ended  November  30,  2010  (an  increase  in  comprehensive  loss  of  $2,292,835).  During  the  three  months  ended  November  30,  2011  and
November 30, 2010, respectively, we did not generate any revenue.
During  the  three  months  ended  November  30,  2011,  we  incurred  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the  aggregate  amount  of  $2,394,718
compared  to  $81,322  incurred  during  the  three  months  ended  November  30,  2010  (an  increase  of  $2,313,396).  The  general  and  administrative
expenses incurred during the three months ended November 30, 2011 consisted of: (i) office and general of $89,831 (2010: $6,997) which increased
in 2011 due to increased exploration activity in Botswana; (ii) consulting fees of $49,072 (2010: $27,000); (iii) management fees of $1,486,950 (2010:
$35,000) which increased in 2011 due to issuance of stock options and exploration activity in Botswana; (iv) marketing fees of $52,341 (2010: $Nil);
(v) mineral property expenditures of $518,024 (2010: $Nil) which increased in 2011 due to the increased exploration activity in Botswana and (vi)
professional fees of $198,500 (2010: $12,325), which increased in 2011 due to exploration activity in Botswana. General and administrative expenses
generally include corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, marketing and consulting costs.
This resulted in a net operating loss of ($2,394,718) during the three months ended November 30, 2011 compared to a net operating loss of ($81,322)
during the three months ended November 30, 2010.
During  the  three  months  ended  November  30,  2011,  we  recorded  total  other  expense  in  the  amount  of  ($8,950)  compared  to  total  other  expense
recorded during the three months ended November 30, 2010 in the amount of ($371). The other expense incurred during the three months ended
November 30, 2011 consisted of: (i) interest expense of $8,950 (2010: $371).
21
This resulted in a net loss of ($2,403,668) during the three months ended November 30, 2011 compared to a net loss of ($81,693) during the three
months ended November 30, 2010.
During the three months ended November 30, 2011, we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $29,140(2010: $Nil).
This resulted in a comprehensive loss of ($2,374,528) during the period ended November 30, 2011 compared to a comprehensive loss of ($81,693)
during the three months ended November 30, 2010.
The  increase  in  comprehensive  loss  during  three  months  ended  November  30,  2011  compared  to  the  three  months  ended  November  30,  2010  is
attributable  primarily  to  higher  general  and  administrative  costs  for  consulting,  professional,  management  fees,  and  exploration  costs  related  to
mineral property as we increased our business activity in Botswana.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating
to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
As  at  November  30,  2011, our current  assets were  $298,215  and  our  current  liabilities  were  $1,034,684, resulting  in  a  working capital  deficit  of
($736,469).  Our  current  assets  as  at  November  30,  2011  consisted  of  $230,486  in  cash,  $6,000  due  from  a  related  company,  $11,729  in  prepaid
expenses and $50,000 in deposits on mineral property. Our current liabilities consisted of $919,690 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and
$114,994 due to related parties.
Deficit accumulated during the exploration stage increased from ($8,489,180) as at May 31, 2011 to ($11,087,971) as at November 30, 2011.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
We  have  not  generated  positive  cash  flows  from  operating  activities.  For  the  six  months  ended  November  30,  2011,  net  cash  used  in  operating
activities was $(429,121) compared to net cash used in operating activities of $(67,089) for the six months ended November 30, 2010. Net cash flow
used in operating activities during the six months ended November 30, 2011 consisted primarily of a net loss of ($2,598,791) adjusted by $1,419,750
for  stock  based  compensation,  $1,571  for  depreciation  expense,  $428,918  for  non  cash  mineral  property  expenditure,  $(11,500)  for  changes  to
prepaids, $325,214 for changes to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $5,717 for accrued interest on shareholder’s loan. Net cash used in 
operating activities during the six months ended November 30, 2010 consisted of a net loss of ($143,699) adjusted by non-legal cash settlements for 
$(2,000), changes in accrued interest on shareholder’s loan of $371 and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $78,239.

During the six months ended November 30, 2011, net cash provided from financing activities was $1,017,425 compared to net cash flow provided
from financing activities of $70,000 for the six months ended November 30, 2010. Net cash flow provided from financing activities during the six
months  ended  November  30,  2011  pertained  primarily  to  $1,064,925  received  as  net  proceeds  on  sale  and  subscriptions  of  common  stock,  and
$490,000 from shareholder advances offset by repayments of shareholder advances of $(537,500).
Going Concern
We  have  not  attained  profitable  operations  and  are  dependent  upon  obtaining  financing  to  pursue  any  extensive  exploration  activities.  For  these
reasons our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2011 that they have substantial doubt we will
be able to continue as a going concern.
22
Future Financings
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional
shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or
arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned exploration activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, 
changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity,  capital  expenditures  or  capital  resources  that  is  material  to
stockholders.
Subsequent Events
At  a  special  meeting  of  shareholders  of  the  Company  held  on  January  19,  2012,  the  Company’s  shareholders  approved  a  proposal  to  amend  the 
Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 50,000,000 shares of common stock to
1,000,000,000 shares of common stock with the same par value of $0.001 per share. This increase in the Company’s authorized shares of common 
stock will become effective upon the Company filing a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State
Critical Accounting Policies
Our  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
applied  on  a  consistent  basis.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are 
based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.
Mineral Property Expenditures
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining,” when management has 
determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate financial resources are
available  or  are  expected  to  be  available  as  required  to  meet  the  terms  of  property  acquisition  and  budgeted  exploration  and  development
expenditures.  Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  if  the  criteria  for  capitalization  are  not  met.  In  the  event  that  mineral
property  acquisition  costs  are  paid  with  Company  shares,  those  shares  are  recorded  at  the  estimated  fair  value  at  the  time  the  shares  are  due  in
accordance with the terms of the property agreements.
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and pre-
feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production basis. 
Costs,  which  include  production  equipment  removal  and  environmental  remediation,  are  estimated  each  period  by  management  based  on  current
regulations,  actual  expenses  incurred,  and  technology  and  industry  standards.  Any  charge  is  included  in  exploration  expense  or the  provision  for
depletion and depreciation during the period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred.
As  of  the  date  of  these  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  incurred  property  acquisition  costs  that  have  been  capitalized  and  property  option
payments and exploration costs which have been expensed.
23
To date the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties.
Stock-based Compensation
On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB ASC 718-10, “Compensation-Stock Compensation”, under this method, compensation cost recognized 
for the year ended May 31, 2007 includes: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of May 31, 2006,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based 
payments granted subsequent to May 31, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718-10. 
In addition, deferred stock compensation related to non-vested options is required to be eliminated against additional paid-in capital upon adoption of 
FASB ASC 718-10. The results for the prior periods were not restated.
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with
FASB ASC 505-50 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued
for  consideration  other  than  employee  services  is  determined  on  the  earliest  of  a  performance  commitment  or  completion  of  performance  by  the
provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We  are  subject  to  risks  related  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  However,  they  have  not  had  a  material  impact  on  our  results  of
operations to date.
Our functional currency is the United States dollar. However, a portion of our business is transacted in other currencies (the Canadian dollar and the
Botswana pula). As a result, we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure to manage our foreign currency fluctuation risk.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules 
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Peter Wilson
(being our principal executive officer), and our Chief Financial Officer, William Thomas (being our principal financial and accounting officer), to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing
and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for our Company.
Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2011 (under the supervision and with
the  participation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer),  pursuant  to  Rule  13a-15(b)  promulgated  under  the  Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As part of such evaluation, management considered the matters discussed below relating to internal control over
financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our Company’s 
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of November 30, 2011.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The  term  “internal  control  over  financial  reporting”  is  defined  as  a  process  designed  by,  or  under  the  supervision  of,  the  registrant’s  principal 
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant’s board of directors, management 
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
(cid:122) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
registrant;
24
(cid:122) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  registrant  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with 
authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and
(cid:122) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
A material weakness is defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5 as a significant deficiency, or a combination
of  significant  deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  results  in  there  being  more  than  a  remote  likelihood  that  a  material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2011 that
have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 1.      Legal Proceedings
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
We are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the
date of this quarterly report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in
any legal proceedings. We are not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this
item.
Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Effective  on  November  14,  2011,  we  completed  a  private  placement  financing  (the  “Private  Placement”)  involving  the  sale  of  an  aggregate  of
2,480,000 units of our Company (each a “Unit”) at a subscription price of $0.50 per Unit, for gross proceeds of $1,240,000.
Each  Unit  is  comprised  of  one  common  share  (each  a  “Share”)  and  one  transferable  common  stock  purchase  warrant  (each  a  “Warrant”)  of  our 
Company, with each such Warrant being exercisable for one additional common share of our Company (each a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price 
of $0.75 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from closing.
In connection with such Private Placement closing, and in accordance with the terms of an agency agreement between our Company and an agent (the
“Agent”), we issued to the Agent 248,000 Options (each, an “Agent’s Option”) exercisable into 248,000 units (each, an “Agent’s Units”) at a price of 
$0.50 per Agent’s Unit for a period of 24 months from closing. Each Agent’s Unit is comprised of one common share (each, an “Agent’s Share”) and 
one warrant (each an “Agent’s Warrant”), with each such Agent’s Warrant being exercisable for one additional common share (each an “Agent’s 
Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of $0.75 per Agent’s Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from closing.
In connection with the issuance of the Units and the Agent’s Options, we relied on exemptions from registration under the United States Securities
Act  of  1933,  as  amended,  provided  by  Regulation  S,  based  on  representations  and  warranties  provided  by  the  purchasers  of  the  Units  in  their
respective  subscription  agreements  entered  into  between  each  purchaser  and  the  Company  and  by  the  Agent  in  its  agency  agreement  with  the
Company.

I have reviewed this report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended November 30, 2011 of Sono Resources, Inc.; 
 
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make 
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered 
by this report; 
 
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
