NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.       Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC
On August 25, 2015 Solitario Exploration & Royalty Corp. (“Solitario” or the “Company”), along
with DHI Minerals (U.S.) Ltd. (“DHI”), sold their combined interests in the Mt. Hamilton gold
project (“Mt. Hamilton”) to Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC (“Waterton”), for total cash proceeds of
US$30 million (the “Transaction”) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on June 10,
2015. Solitario sold its 80% interest in Mt. Hamilton LLC (“MH-LLC”), a limited liability company
which held 100% of the Mt. Hamilton project assets, and DHI sold its 20% interest in MH-LLC.
DHI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely Gold and Minerals, Inc. (“Ely”). Solitario received gross
cash proceeds of US$24 million and Ely received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million.
Solitario’s costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional
service fees, were $439,000. The Transaction was structured as the sale of Solitario’s and DHI’s
combined membership interests in MH-LLC.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 virtually all of the costs associated with
MH-LLC and the assets sold were directly related to the development of the Mt. Hamilton project,
which were capitalized to mineral property. Accordingly, separate presentation of discontinued
operations would not have resulted in any material change to the results presented in the
unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015.
See Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the annual financial
statements included in Solitario’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a more
complete discussion of the sale of Solitario’s interest in MH-LLC.
Business and company formation
Solitario is an exploration stage company at June 30, 2016 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by
the SEC. Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ("Crown"). In July 1994, Solitario became a
publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange through its initial public offering.
Solitario has been actively involved in mineral exploration since 1993. Solitario’s primary
business is to acquire and hold a portfolio of exploration properties and other related assets for
future sale or joint venture or to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable
reserves. As a result of the completion of the Transaction, Solitario has shifted its primary focus
from the development of the Mt. Hamilton project to the furtherance of its other assets and to
Solitario’s historical focus on the acquisition of additional precious and base metal properties
and assets with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests.
Solitario has recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture
property payments and the sale of a royalty on its Mt. Hamilton property. Revenues from the sale
or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a
consistent source of revenue and would only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis.
The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Solitario for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They do not include all
disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements,
but in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
items, necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results,
which may be achieved in the future or for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto which are included in Solitario’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The accounting policies set forth in those annual financial statements are
the same as the accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements,
except as modified for appropriate interim financial statement presentation.
7
Table of Contents
Financial reporting
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Solitario and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("generally accepted
accounting principles"), and are expressed in US dollars.
Revenue recognition
Solitario records delay rental payments as revenue in the period received. Any payments
received for the sale of property interests are recorded as a reduction of the related property's
capitalized cost. Proceeds which exceed the capitalized cost of the property without reserves are
recognized as revenue. Payments received on the sale of properties with reserves are
recognized as revenue to the extent the proceeds exceed the proportionate basis in the assets
sold.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant
estimates included in the preparation of Solitario's financial statements pertain to: (i) the fair value
of Solitario’s short-term investments; (ii) the fair value of Solitario's stock option grants to
employees; (iii) the fair value of Solitario's investment in marketable equity securities; and (iv) the
fair value of Solitario’s liability for warrants Solitario issued to RMB Australia Holdings Limited in
2012 (the “RMB Warrants”).
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid money-market securities with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased. Solitario has concentrations of cash at June
30, 2016 deposited in banks and brokerage accounts of $234,000 which are not covered under
the federal deposit insurance rules for the United States. At June 30, 2016 Solitario holds short-
term investments in United States Treasury securities of $7,506,000.
Mineral properties
Solitario expenses all exploration costs incurred on its mineral properties prior to the
establishment of proven and probable reserves through the completion of a feasibility study.
Initial acquisition costs of Solitario’s mineral properties are capitalized. Solitario began
capitalizing all of its development expenditures on Mt. Hamilton, subsequent to the completion of
a feasibility study in 2012 through the date of the Transaction. Solitario regularly performs
evaluations of its investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability and/or the residual
value of its investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable, utilizing established guidelines based upon undiscounted future net cash
flows from the asset or upon the determination that certain exploration properties do not have
sufficient potential for economic mineralization.
Derivative instruments
Solitario accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." Solitario has not designated its covered calls as
hedging instruments and any changes in the fair value of covered calls and the RMB Warrants
are recognized in the statement of operations in the period of the change.

Table of Contents
Fair value
FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”) establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. For certain of Solitario's financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their
short-term maturities. Solitario's short-term investments and marketable equity securities are
carried at their estimated fair value based on quoted market prices. See Note 7, “Fair Value”
below.
Marketable equity securities
Solitario's investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the securities owned. Solitario records
investments in marketable equity securities as available-for-sale for investments in publicly
traded marketable equity securities for which it does not exercise significant control and where
Solitario has no representation on the Board of Directors of those companies and exercises no
control over the management of those companies. The cost of marketable equity securities sold
is determined by the specific identification method. Changes in fair values are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity, unless a decline in fair
value is considered other than temporary, in which case the decline is recognized as a loss in the
consolidated statements of operations.
Foreign exchange
The United States dollar is the functional currency for all of Solitario's foreign subsidiaries.
Although Solitario's exploration activities outside of the United States for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 have been conducted primarily in Peru and Mexico, a portion of the
payments under the land, leasehold and exploration agreements of Solitario are denominated in
United States dollars. Foreign currency gains and losses are included in the results of operations
in the period in which they occur.
Income taxes
Solitario accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions
reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related
to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax
reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return
consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets
and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses
and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income and income taxes, respectively.
A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's
financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. ASC 740 provides that a
company's tax position will be considered settled if the taxing authority has completed its
examination, the company does not plan to appeal, and it is remote that the taxing authority
would reexamine the tax position in the future. These provisions of ASC 740 had no effect on
Solitario's financial position or results of operations. See Note 8, “Income Taxes” below.
Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015. Potentially dilutive shares related to outstanding common stock options of
390,000 and 3,748,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, and the RMB Warrants (exercisable to acquire 1,624,748 shares of common stock) for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were excluded from the calculation of
diluted income (loss) per share because the effects were anti-dilutive.

Table of Contents
Employee stock compensation and incentive plans
Solitario classifies all of its stock options as equity options in accordance with the provisions of
ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”
Recent accounting pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting
Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-19, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (“ASU
2016-19”), as part of its simplification initiative, which affects all entities that issue share-based
payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the
recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits
on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an
employer can withhold for income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the
classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-19 is effective for
fiscal year ending March 2018 using either the prospective, retrospective or modified
retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered by ASU 2016-19.
In December 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be
classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within the year, beginning after December 15, 2016. The
standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets
and liabilities. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 did not have a material impact on the financial
statements of Solitario as of June 30, 2016 or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.

All exploration costs on our other exploration properties, none of which have proven and
probable reserves, including any additional costs incurred for subsequent lease payments or
exploration activities related to our projects are expensed as incurred. During the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario acquired certain net smelter royalty previously owned by
Atna Resources Ltd. for $40,000.
Discontinued projects
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario closed its exploration office in
Mexico. Solitario sold its Norcan and Aconchi exploration projects in Mexico for a retained a 1%
royalty on both the Norcan and Aconchi properties. Solitario recorded a mineral property write-
down of $10,000 related to the Norcan and Aconchi properties during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016. In addition Solitario recorded a loss on other assets in Mexico of $14,000
related to the exit from its exploration activities in Mexico during the three and six months ended

Capitalization of Mt. Hamilton cost during 2015
On February 22, 2012, Solitario earned an 80% interest in MH-LLC as a result of the completion
of a feasibility study on the Mt. Hamilton project (the “Feasibility Study”) prepared by SRK
Consulting (US), Inc. of Lakewood, Colorado (“SRK”). In October 2014, SRK, on behalf of
Solitario completed an updated feasibility study on Mt. Hamilton. Solitario sold its interest in the
Mt. Hamilton project on August 25, 2015 through the Transaction. Capitalization of costs for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, prior to the Transaction, is detailed in the following

3. Marketable Equity Securities
Solitario's investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the securities owned. The cost of
marketable equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Changes in
market value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within
shareholders' equity, unless a decline in market value is considered other than temporary, in
which case the decline is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations.
The following tables summarize Solitario’s marketable equity securities and accumulated other
comprehensive income related to its marketable equity securities:

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 Solitario purchased 7,240,000 units of
Vendetta Mining Corp. for $289,000. Each unit included one common share and one purchase
warrant which allows the holder to purchase one share of Vendetta Mining Corp. common stock
at a price of Cdn$0.10 per share for a period of two years (the “Vendetta Warrants”). As of June
30, 2016, the Vendetta Mining Corp shares are carried at their fair value and included in
marketable equity securities, see Note 3, above. The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their fair
value, based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, Solitario recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $215,000 related to the
Vendetta Warrants.
5.       Short-term Debt
RMB Facility Agreement
On August 10, 2012, Solitario entered into a Facility Agreement and borrowed
$5,000,000 from RMB Australia Holdings, Limited (the “RMB Loan”). In connection with the
Facility Agreement, Solitario recorded a warrant discount related to the RMB Warrants issued in
connection with the RMB Loan. Solitario also recorded deferred offering costs related to the RMB
Loan. The warrant discount and deferred offering costs were amortized on a straight-line basis to
interest cost over 36 months, the term of the Facility Agreement. The RMB Loan amounts bore
interest at the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 5%, payable in arrears on the last day of each quarterly
interest period. The RMB Loan was repaid on August 25, 2015, in connection with the
Transaction. Solitario had no balance due on the RMB Loan as of December 31, 2015 or June
30, 2016.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, Solitario capitalized all of its interest to
mineral property. See Note 2, “Mineral property,” above.
6.        Derivative Instruments
RMB Warrants
The RMB Warrants entitle the holder to purchase a total of 1,624,748 shares of Solitario common
stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of the RMB Warrants. As amended, the RMB Warrants
expire on August 21, 2016, and have an exercise price of $1.5387 per share, subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments. Solitario recorded a warrant discount at the time it entered
into the Facility Agreement, which it amortized on a straight-line basis. See Note 5, short-term
debt, above.
Solitario has recorded a zero liability for the fair value of the RMB Warrants as of June 30, 2016
as Solitario does not expect the exercise of the RMB Warrants, prior to their expiration on August
25, 2016. Solitario recorded a $4,000 liability for the RMB Warrants as of December 31, 2015 for
the fair value of the RMB Warrants based upon a Black-Scholes model. Solitario adjusts the fair
value of the warrants at each balance sheet date, with changes in value recorded in other income
(loss) in the statement of operations.
Covered Call Options
From time to time Solitario has sold covered call options against its holdings of Kinross Gold
Corporation (“Kinross”). The business purpose of selling covered calls is to provide additional
liquidity on a limited portion of shares of Kinross that Solitario may sell in the near term, which is
generally defined as less than one year. Solitario has not designated its covered calls as
hedging instruments and records gains or loss on the covered call in the period of the change. As
of June 30, 2016, Solitario had written two covered calls, one covering 50,000 shares, expiring
January 20, 2017, with an exercise price of $4.00 per share and another covering 50,000 shares,
expiring January 20, 2017 with an exercise price of $4.50 per share. Solitario has recorded a
liability of $128,000 for the fair value of its Kinross covered call as of June 30, 2016, based on
quoted market prices.

7.        Fair Value
For certain of Solitario’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short term
maturities. Solitario’s marketable equity securities are carried at their estimated fair value
primarily based on quoted market prices. The Vendetta Warrants are carried at their estimated
fair value at June 30, 2016 of $321,000; based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model, see Note
4, “Other Assets,” above. The RMB Warrants are carried at their estimated fair value based on a
Black-Scholes option pricing model, see Note 6, “Derivative Instruments,” above.
Solitario accounts for its financial instruments under ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC
820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC
820 also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and
establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on
significant levels of inputs as follows:
·Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
·Level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability; or
·Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. During the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 there were no reclassifications in financial assets or liabilities
between Level 1, 2 or 3 categories.
The following is a listing of Solitario’s financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at
fair value on a recurring basis and where they are classified within the hierarchy as of June 30,
2016:

8.        Income Taxes
Solitario accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. Under ASC 740, income taxes
are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of
taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in
different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be
taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are
also recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable
income and income taxes, respectively. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
14
Table of Contents
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Solitario has recorded no net deferred tax assets. A
valuation allowance, which fully offsets the net deferred tax assets, has been recorded because it
is more likely than not that the Company will not realize some portion or all of its deferred tax
assets.  The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their
expiration.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario recorded deferred tax benefits of
$175,000 and $237,000, respectively, in the statement of operations and recorded a deferred tax
expense of the same amounts to other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains on
marketable equity securities.
9. Employee Stock Compensation Plans
Solitario’s outstanding options on the date of grant have a five year term, and vest 25% on date of
grant and 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates. Solitario recognizes stock option
compensation expense on the date of grant for 25% of the grant date fair value, and
subsequently, based upon a straight line amortization of the unvested grant date fair value of
each of its outstanding options. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario
recorded $29,000 and $31,000, respectively, of stock option expense for the amortization of grant
date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, Solitario recorded $157,000 and $313,000, respectively, of stock option expense
for the amortization of grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital.
The 2006 Plan
On June 27, 2006 Solitario’s shareholders approved the 2006 Stock Option Incentive Plan (the
“2006 Plan”). Under the terms of the 2006 Plan, prior to June 26, 2016, an aggregate of
2,800,000 shares were reserved under the 2006 Plan for the award of options to directors,
officers and employees with exercise prices equal to the market price of Solitario’s common stock
at the date of grant.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario granted options to acquire
350,000 shares of common stock under the 2006 Plan. The options have a five-year term, with an
exercise price Cdn$0.72 per share, the closing price of a share of Solitario common stock as
quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) on the date of grant. The options vested 25%
on the date of grant and thereafter vest 25% on each of the next three anniversary dates of the
date of grant, and had a grant date fair value based upon a Black-Scholes model with a 63%
expected volatility, and 1% risk-free interest rate. No options were granted during the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015. No options were exercised during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 or 2015 under the 2006 Plan.
On June 26, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Plan, the ability to grant any
additional options under the 2006 Plan terminated and no additional options will be granted
under the 2006 Plan.
The 2013 Plan
On June 18, 2013 Solitario’s shareholders approved the 2013 Solitario Exploration & Royalty
Corp. Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”). Under the terms of the 2013 Plan, the
Board of Directors may grant awards for up to 1,750,000 shares to directors, officers, employees
and consultants. Such awards may take the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The terms and conditions of the awards are pursuant
to the 2013 Plan and are granted by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the
Board of Directors.
There were no stock grants or awards or exercises of options or awards under the 2013 Plan
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Share Repurchase Program
(1)
On October 28, 2015, Solitario’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that

purchased 232,000 and 406,000 shares of Solitario common stock, respectively, for an
aggregate purchase price of $118,000 and $201,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2016,
Solitario has purchased a total of 551,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $268,000
under the share repurchase program since its inception.

Item 2.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the
consolidated financial statements of Solitario for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
contained in Solitario’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Solitario's financial condition and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of what may
be expected in future periods. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to dollars are to U.S.
dollars.
(a) Recent Developments
Sale of Mt. Hamilton LLC
On August 25, 2015 we, along with DHI, sold our combined interests in Mt. Hamilton to Waterton,
for total cash proceeds of US$30 million. We sold our 80% interest in MH-LLC and received
gross cash proceeds of US$24 million and DHI received gross cash proceeds of US$6 million.
Solitario’s costs and fees related to the Transaction, including broker fees and professional
service fees, were $439,000. The Transaction was structured as the sale of Solitario’s and DHI’s
combined membership interests in MH-LLC.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 virtually all of the costs associated with
MH-LLC and the assets sold were directly related to the development of the Mt. Hamilton project,
which were capitalized to mineral property during all periods. Accordingly, separate presentation
of discontinued operations would not have resulted in any material change to our results
presented in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June
30, 2015.
See Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the annual financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed with the SEC for a more complete discussion of the sale of Solitario’s interest in MH-LLC.
(b) Business Overview and Summary
We are an exploration stage company with a focus on the acquisition of precious and base metal
properties with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests. Prior to
the Transaction, our primary focus was on the development of Mt. Hamilton, where we had an
80% interest in Mt. Hamilton through MH-LLC. Our current focus is to acquire and hold a portfolio
of mineral exploration properties and assets for future sale, joint venture or to create a royalty
prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves. Although our mineral properties may
be developed in the future by us, through a joint venture or by a third party, we have never
developed a mineral property.
We have recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property
payments and the sale of a royalty on our Mt. Hamilton property. The revenue from the sale of
MH-LLC is included in gain on sale of discontinued operations. Revenues from the sale or joint
venture of our other properties have not historically been a significant annual source of revenue
and would occur, if at all, on an infrequent basis in the future.
We currently consider our carried interest in our Bongará project in Peru to be our core mineral
property asset. We expect our joint venture partner will continue the development and
furtherance of the Bongará asset and will monitor progress at Bongará.
As of June 30, 2016 we have significant balances of cash and short-term investments that we
anticipate using to, in part, acquire additional mineral property assets. The fluctuations in
precious metal and other commodity prices has contributed to a challenging environment for
mineral exploration and development, which has created opportunities as well as challenges for
the potential acquisition of advanced mineral exploration projects or other related assets at
potentially attractive terms. We have, and expect to, focus on evaluating and potentially acquiring
one or more additional assets if we believe it will enhance shareholder value. During the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, Solitario acquired a royalty on non-producing exploration
leases in Montana previously owned by Atna Resources, Ltd.

(c) Results of Operations
Comparison of the quarter ended June 30, 2016 to the quarter ended June 30, 2015
We had a net loss of $162,000 or approximately $0.00 per basic and diluted share for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $141,000 or approximately $0.00 per
basic and diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2015. As explained in more detail
below, the primary reason for the increase in the net loss in the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the loss in the three months ended June 30, 2015 was (i) an increase in
exploration expense to $220,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
exploration expense of $7,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2015, (ii) a reduction in
the a gain on sales of marketable equity securities to $30,000 during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $364,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2015,
and (iii) a loss on other assets of $14,000 and property abandonment expense of $10,000 related
to the closure of our exploration office in Mexico during the three months ended June 30, 2016,
with no similar item during the three months ended June 30, 2015. These were partially offset by
(i) an decrease in general and administrative costs to $256,000 during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to general and administrative costs of $478,000 during the three
months ended June 30, 2015, (ii) a gain of $133,000 on derivative instruments during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $1,000 during the three months ended June
30, 2015 and (iii) the recording of an income tax benefit of $175,000 during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, with no similar item during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The
significant changes for these items are discussed in more detail below.
Our net exploration expense increased to $220,000 during the three months ended June
30, 2016 compared to exploration expense of $7,000 during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015. We increased our reconnaissance exploration activities primarily related to the
shift in focus to the evaluation of mineral properties for acquisition as discussed above. These
activities were focused on the evaluation of exploration properties and /or companies for potential
acquisition or other strategic transactions. In addition we increased our reconnaissance
exploration activities in Peru for the same purpose. During three months ended June 30, 2016 we
had one contract geologist in each of Peru and Mexico, however, our Denver personnel are
spending the majority of their time on exploration activities described above in this paragraph.
We anticipate we will continue with our current exploration activities, and to the extent we acquire
new exploration projects or assets to expand those activities further and as a result expect our
full-year exploration expenditures for 2016 to exceed the expenditures for full-year 2015.
Exploration expense (in thousands) by project for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015 consisted of the following:

General and administrative costs, excluding stock option compensation costs discussed below,
were $227,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $321,000 during the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The major components of these costs were related to (i)
salaries and benefit expense during the first three months of 2016 of $161,000 compared to
salaries and benefits expense of $181,000 in the same period of 2015; (ii) legal and accounting
expenditures of $11,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $95,000 in the
three months ended June 30, 2015, which during the 2015 period included additional costs
related to the RMB Loan, and the Transaction; (iii) office rent and expenses of $20,000 during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $19,000 during 2015 and (iv) travel and
shareholder relation costs of $35,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared
$26,000 during 2015. We anticipate the general and administrative costs will be incurred at a
comparable rate to the rate in the three months ended June 30, 2016 for the remainder of 2016.

Solitario recorded stock option expense for the amortization of unvested grant date fair value with
a credit to additional paid-in-capital of $29,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared $157,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. During the three months
ended June 30, 2016, Solitario granted 350,000 options, which vested 25% on the date of grant,
as further described in Note 9, “Employee Stock Compensation Plans,” above. On November 24,
2015, holders of option awards voluntarily cancelled awards for 1,990,000 options from our 2006
Plan and 1,250,000 options from our 2013 Plan to allow Solitario to have additional financial
flexibility. No consideration was given or received by the holders of the options to cancel the
awards. The cancellation of the awards reduced the non-cash stock option compensation during
2016 compared to 2015.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we sold marketable equity securities for proceeds
of $40,000 and recorded a gain on the sales of $30,000, compared to sales of marketable equity
security sales for proceeds of $519,000 and a recorded gain on the sales of $364,000 for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. During 2015, the sales of marketable equity securities were
a significant source of our cash needs prior to the Transaction, which was not the case during
2016. We anticipate we will continue to sell some of our holdings of marketable equity securities
during the remainder of 2016 related to our overall cash management strategy.
As a result of the purchase of the Vendetta Mining Corp. units, we adjust the fair value of the
Vendetta Warrants at each balance sheet date, based upon a Black-Scholes model. During the
three months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $215,000
related to the Vendetta Warrants, with no similar item in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we extended the term and increased the exercise
price of outstanding Kinross calls covering our holdings of Kinross and as of June 30, 2016 we
have two outstanding calls covering 50,000 shares of Kinross at $4.00 per share and 50,000
shares of Kinross at $4.50 per share, each with a January 20, 2017 expiration date. Due to an
increase in the price of the underlying shares of Kinross we recorded a loss on derivative
instruments related to our Kinross calls of $82,000 during 2016 compared to a gain on derivative
instruments during 2015 of $1,000. Given that the current price of Kinross has been in excess of
the exercise price as of June 30, 2016, our covered calls may be called during the remainder of
2016. We may also extend the price of the outstanding calls and or increase the exercise price
during the remainder of 2016 as market conditions warrant.
As a result of the classification of the RMB Warrants as a liability in accordance with ASC 815-
40, “Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” we adjust the fair value of the
warrants at each balance sheet date, with changes in value recorded in other income/expense in
the statement of operations based upon a Black-Scholes model. Solitario recorded a gain on the
RMB Warrants of $1,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a gain of
$28,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The value of the RMB Warrants is influenced
by fluctuations in the price of a share of our common stock, among other things that are beyond
our control. As of June 30, 2016, we have assigned no value to the RMB Warrants, based upon a
Black-Scholes model and we do not expect significant further changes in the value of the RMB
Warrants prior to their expiration in August 2016.
We regularly perform evaluations of our mineral property assets to assess the recoverability of
our investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable utilizing guidelines based upon future net cash flows from the asset as well as our
estimates of the geological potential of early stage mineral property and its related value for
future sale, joint venture or development by us or others. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 we recorded a loss on other assets of $14,000 and property abandonment
expense of $10,000 related to the closure of our exploration office in Mexico. During the three
and six months ended June 30 2015 we recorded a gain of $7,000 on the disposal of other
assets and no property impairments.
At June 30, 2016 and 2015 our net operating loss carry-forwards exceed our unrealized gains on
marketable equity securities and we are in a net tax asset position and we provide a valuation
allowance for all deferred taxes payable. However we recorded a deferred tax benefit in the
statement of operations for the amount of the deferred taxes recorded in other comprehensive
income of $175,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. We did not record any income
tax benefits related to the tax losses generated during the three months ended June 30, 2015. As
a result of our exploration activities and other tax deductible expenses, we anticipate we will not
have currently payable income taxes during 2016. In addition to the valuation allowance
discussed above, we provide a valuation allowance for our foreign net operating losses, which
are primarily related to our exploration activities in Peru. We anticipate we will continue to
provide a valuation allowance for these net operating losses until we are in a net tax liability
position with regards to those countries where we operate or until it is more likely than not that we
will be able to realize those net operating losses in the future.

Comparison of the six months ended June 30, 2016 to the six months ended June 30, 2015
We had a net loss of $651,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted shared for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $591,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the
increase in our net loss were (i) an increase in our exploration expense to $342,000 during the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to exploration expense of $32,000 during the six
months ended June 30, 2015; (ii) property abandonment and impairment loss of $10,000 and
loss on sale of assets of $14,000 related to our decision to close our Mexican exploration office,
discussed above, with no similar item during the six months ended June 30, 2015; and (iii) a
decrease in the gain on sale of marketable equity securities to $30,000 during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of $364,000 in
the six months ended June 30, 2015. These causes of the increase in our net loss were partially
offset by (i) a reduction in our general and administrative costs to $698,000 during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to general and administrative costs of $1,032,000 during the six
months ended June 30, 2015; (ii) we recorded interest income of $13,000 during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1,000 of interest income during the six months ended June
30, 2015; (iii) we recorded an income tax benefit of $237,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and there was no similar item during the six months ended June 30, 2015; and (iv) a gain
on derivative instruments of $132,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a
gain on derivative instruments of $83,000 recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
significant changes for these items are discussed in more detail below.
Our net exploration expense increased to $342,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $32,000 in the comparable period of 2015. See the discussion of the comparison of
the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015
above. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we capitalized $491,000 of development
costs at Mt. Hamilton.
General and administrative costs, excluding stock option compensation costs discussed below,
were $667,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $719,000 in the same
period of 2015. The major components of the costs were (i) salaries and benefit expense during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $481,000 compared to salaries and benefit expense of
$421,000 in the same period of 2015; (ii) legal and accounting expenditures of $22,000 in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $135,000 in the same period of 2015, which were in
large part related to Transaction costs; (iii) other costs of $42,000 during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $44,000 in the same period of 2015; and (iv) travel and shareholder
relation costs of $122,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $119,000 in
the same period of 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Solitario
recorded $31,000 and $313,000, respectively, of stock option expense for the amortization of
unvested grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in capital, which was at an
increased level during in 2015 as a result of options granted during 2014.
We recorded a deferred tax benefit in the statement of operations for the amount of the deferred
taxes recorded in other comprehensive income of $237,000 during the six months ended June
30, 2016. We did not record any income tax benefits related to the tax losses generated during
the six months ended June 30, 2015. See the discussion above regarding the comparison of the
deferred tax expense recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
(d) Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash
As of June 30, 2016 we have $251,000 in cash. We intend to utilize a portion of this cash in our
exploration activities and the potential acquisition of mineral properties and other assets over the
next several years. We expect to also use a portion of this cash to continue to repurchase shares
of our common stock, pursuant to the terms of a stock buy-back program announced on October
28, 2015. The stock buy-back program may be terminated at any time and does not require
Solitario to purchase a minimum number of shares.
20
Table of Contents
Short-term Investments
As of June 30, 2016, we have invested $7,505,000 of our current assets in United States
Treasury securities (“USTS”) with maturities of 15 days to 13 months. The USTS are recorded at
their fair value, based upon quoted market prices. The USTS are highly liquid and may be sold in
their entirety at any time at their quoted market price and are classified as a current asset. We
anticipate we will roll over that portion of our USTS not used for operating costs or mineral
property acquisitions as they mature during the remainder of 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we have invested $8,497,000 in separate bank certificates of deposit
(“CDs”) with maximum values of $250,000, each of which is covered by Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation insurance to the full face value of the CDs. At June 30, 2016, the CDs
have maturities of between 30 days and 13 months. The CDs are recorded at their fair value,
based upon quoted market prices. The CDs are highly liquid and may be sold in their entirety at
any time at their quoted market price and are classified as a current asset. We anticipate we will
roll over that portion of our CDs not used for operating costs or mineral property acquisitions as
they mature during the remainder of 2016.
RMB Warrants
Pursuant to the Facility Agreement, we issued RMB Warrants to acquire 1,624,748 shares of our
common stock to RMB Australia Holdings Limited (“RMBAH”) as partial consideration for
financing services provided in connection with the Facility Agreement. Each RMB Warrant
entitles the holder to purchase one share of Solitario common stock pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the RMB Warrants. As of June 30, 2016, the RMB Warrants have no estimated fair
value based upon a Black-Scholes model and we recorded a gain of $4,000 on the fair value of
the RMB Warrants during the six months ended June 30, 2015. We currently do not expect
RMBAH to exercise any of these warrants prior to their expiration in August 2016.
Investment in Marketable Equity Securities
Our marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value,
which is based upon market quotes of the underlying securities. We owned 100,000 shares of
Kinross common stock at June 30, 2016. The Kinross shares are recorded at their fair value of
$489,000 at June 30, 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we purchased
7,240,000 units of Vendetta Mining Corp. for a purchase price of $289,000. Each unit consists of
one share of Vendetta Mining Corp. common stock and one Vendetta Warrant. As of June 30,
2016 we have recorded our investment in the shares of Vendetta Mining Corp. at their fair market
value of $501,000 based upon quoted market prices. In addition we own other marketable equity
securities with a fair value of $39,000 as of June 30, 2016 based upon quoted market prices.
Changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities are recorded as gains and losses in
other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. During the six months ended June 30,
2016 we recorded a net gain on marketable equity securities in other comprehensive income of
$403,000, which was net of deferred taxes of $237,000.
Working Capital
We had working capital of $17,050,000 at June 30, 2016 compared to working capital of
$17,811,000 as of December 31, 2015. Our working capital at June 30, 2016 consists primarily of
our cash and cash equivalents, our investment in USTS and CDs, discussed above, and our
investment in marketable equity securities of $1,029,000, less our accounts payable of $145,000
and the fair value of our Kinross calls, discussed above, of $128,000. As of June 30, 2016, our
cash balances along with our short-term investments and marketable equity securities are
adequate to fund our expected expenditures over the next year.
The nature of the mineral exploration business requires significant sources of capital to fund
exploration, development and operation of mining projects. We expect we will need additional
capital if we decide to develop or operate any of our current exploration projects or any projects
or assets we may acquire. We anticipate we would finance any such development through the
use of our cash reserves, short-term investments, joint ventures, issuance of debt or equity, or the
sale of other exploration projects or assets.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we granted options for 350,000 shares from our
2006 Plan with an exercise price of Cdn$0.72 per share. No options were granted during the six
months ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, no options were
exercised from the 2006 Plan. On June 26, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Plan,
the ability to grant any additional options under the 2006 Plan terminated and no additional
options will be granted under the 2006 Plan. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 there were no stock awards granted or exercised from the 2013 Plan. As of June 30, 2016,
we have outstanding options for 390,000 shares, which expire in 2019 and 2021. We do not
anticipate the exercise of options during the remainder of 2016 will be a significant source of
cash.
Share Repurchase Program
On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program that
authorizes us to purchase up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock through
December 31, 2016. All shares purchased have been and will be cancelled and reduce the
number of shares of outstanding common stock. The amount and timing of any shares purchased
has been and will be determined by our management and the purchases will be effected in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions based upon market conditions and other
factors, including price, regulatory requirements and capital availability and in compliance with
applicable state and federal securities laws. Purchases may also be made in accordance with
Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The
repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares of common
stock by the Company, and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without
prior notice. No purchases will be made outside of the United States, including on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Payment for shares of common stock repurchased under the program will be
funded using the Company’s working capital. As of June 30, 2016, we have purchased a total of
551,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $268,000 under the share repurchase
program and these shares are no longer included in our issued and outstanding shares.
(e) Cash Flows
Net cash used in operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $1,000,000
compared to $631,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily as a result of the
increase in exploration expenses and an increase in non-stock option general and administrative
expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared the same period of 2015. Based
upon projected expenditures in our 2016 budget, we anticipate continued use of funds from
operations through the remainder of 2016. See “Results of Operations” discussed above for
further explanation of some of these variances.
We used $16,266,000 in cash from investing activities during the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the use of $611,000 in cash from investing activities during the six months
ended June 30, 2015. The primary use of cash was for the purchase of $7,510,000 of CDs and
$8,505,000 of USTS, discussed above under “Short-term Investments” in “Liquidity and Capital
Resources.” In addition, we used $289,000 for the purchase of units of Vendetta Mining Corp.,
discussed above under “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and we used $40,000 for the
purchase of royalties on certain non-producing mineral leases in the state of Montana, previously
owned by Atna Resources Ltd. We received $40,000 from the sale of marketable equity
securities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $519,000 from the sale of
marketable equity securities during the six months ended June 30, 2015, when we were utilizing
the funds from the sale of marketable equity securities as a significant source of operating funds
prior to the Transaction. The $763,000 of cash used in discontinued operations was primarily
related to the cash additions to Mt. Hamilton during the six months ended June 30, 2015, prior to
the Transaction. We do not anticipate significant additional uses of cash during the remainder of
2016 from investing activities, pending the purchase of any additional exploration projects which
would be offset by the use of funds from the sale of our short-term investments.
We used $201,000 for the purchase of our common stock during the six months ended June 30,
2016, as discussed above discussed above under “Share Repurchase Program” in “Liquidity and
Capital Resources.” There was no net cash used from financing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. We anticipate the use of funds for additional purchases of our common
stock during the remainder of 2016, however, this will be limited to the maximum number of
shares, pursuant to the share repurchase program.

(h) Discontinued Projects
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we closed our exploration office in
Mexico. We sold our Norcan and Aconchi exploration projects in Mexico for a retained a 1%
royalty on both the Norcan and Aconchi properties. We recorded a mineral property write-down of
$10,000 related to the Norcan and Aconchi properties during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016. In addition we recorded a loss on other assets in Mexico of $14,000 related to the
exit from our exploration activities in Mexico during the three and six months ended June 30,
2016.
We did not record any mineral property write-downs during the three and six months ended June
30, 2015.
