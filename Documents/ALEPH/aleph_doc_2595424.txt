December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and June 30 2016, recent
Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other SEC filings, including the registration statement on Form
S-4, as amended, that includes a joint proxy statement of Range and MRD and constitutes a
prospectus of Range, discuss some of the important risk factors identified that may affect these
factors and Range’s and MRD’s respective business, results of operations and financial
condition.  Range and MRD undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-
looking statements for any reason. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. The SEC permits oil and gas
companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as
the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose the
Company’s probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain
broader terms such as "resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” "unproved resource
potential" or "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable
through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible
reserves as defined by the SEC's guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable
and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from
including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are
by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and
accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource
potential refers to Range's internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially
discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery
techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential
does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer's
Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide
unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range's management. “EUR,” or
estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that
may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not
necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum
Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas
disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range's interests could differ
substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range's drilling program,
which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs,
commodity prices, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, lease
expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas
in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling and completion results, including geological
and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential
may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data. In
addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many
assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the
undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant
commodity price declines or drilling cost increases. Investors are urged to consider closely the
disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at
www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort
Worth, Texas 76102. You can also obtain this Form 10-K on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov
or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

near expanding natural gas and NGL demand centers Combination of two low-cost gas
producers with opportunities to drive costs lower, improve margins and returns and increase cash

220,000 Acres of Lower Cotton Valley Potential The position is anchored to the north by
Terryville Field, to the south by Vernon Field, to the east by Choudrant Field and to the west by
Driscoll Field Multiple vertical Lower Cotton Valley wells show: Section exists across acreage
Gas charged Good vertical production Good vertical wells should lead to good horizontal wells
The Lower Cotton Valley gets thicker and higher pressured as you move south from Terryville

2017 Growth Trajectory 30% growth represents Range full-year 2016 production with one quarter
of MRD (4Q16) and a 2017 organic growth rate of 10+% based on strip prices as of 07/27/2016
Assumes MRD in 4th Qt. 2016 Current estimates and strip pricing indicate that Range (post-
merger) can grow 10+% organically in 2017 at or near cash flow, which represents 30+% growth
y/y ~2 Bcfepd 30+% Growth (a)
Why Invest in Range? (a) Based on 10% organic growth at strip pricing on 7/27/16 Ability to
allocate capital between the two highest return, lowest cost natural gas plays Unhedged recycle
ratio of ~2x near strip prices allows for efficient development of asset base 2017 growth of 30+%
(spending at or near cash flow with strip pricing(a)); also positions Range well for growth in 2018
~90% of natural gas production will be sold in favorable markets by end of 2017 Improving
differentials expected on natural gas, NGLs and condensate from improved marketing
agreements
