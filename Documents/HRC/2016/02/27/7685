<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/9, 
contains the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his visit to Malawi 
from 12 to 22 July 2013. The Special Rapporteur outlines the state of food and nutrition 
insecurity in the country (sect. III), characterized by chronic malnutrition among half of 
children under the age of 5; significant disparities between regions and urban and rural 
areas; and recurrent need for the provision of food aid in response to acute food insecurity 
during the lean season. He examines the legal, institutional and policy framework for the 
realization of the right to food (sect. IV), noting the need for greater accuracy of national 
surveys of poverty and food insecurity. The Special Rapporteur assesses the country&#8217;s main 
agriculture support programme, the Farm Input Subsidy Programme, advising that it is in 
need of reform and that policies on agricultural development should be informed by five 
critical transformations (sect. V). He then examines difficulties faced by specific groups in 
gaining access to adequate food, related to workers&#8217; access to a living wage; smallholders&#8217; 
access to land, security of tenure, and markets; the limited reach of social protection 
programmes, including school feeding programmes; specific impediments faced by 
women; and inadequate provision of food in prisons (sect. VI). With regard to the 
commitment of Malawi to make maximum use of available resources for the realization of 
the right to food, the Special Rapporteur highlights the need to address illicit financial 
outflows and revenue losses from tax concessions granted to large companies (sect. VII). 
Finally, the Special Rapporteur encourages the adoption of a national food and nutrition 
framework law (sect. VIII) and lists key recommendations for the Government (sect. IX).

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, conducted a visit 
to Malawi from 12 to 22 July 2013 at the invitation of the Government. During his visit, he 
met with senior government officials from the Office of the President and Cabinet; the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security; the National 
Food Reserve Agency; the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development; the 
Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs; the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal 
Security; the Malawi Prison Service; the Ministry of Industry and Trade; the Ministry of 
Labour and Vocational Training; the Ministry of Local Government and Rural 
Development; the Ministry of Gender, Children and Community Development; the 
Ministry of Economic Planning and Development; the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment 
Committee; the Ministry of Health; and the Ministry of Finance. The Special Rapporteur 
also met with members of the National Assembly, the Malawi Human Rights Commission 
and the United Nations country team, and with representatives of international donors and 
development cooperation agencies. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur convened five round-table discussions in Lilongwe and 
Zomba with representatives of non-governmental organizations, trade unions, farmers 
associations and academics. He visited the central and southern regions, meeting with local 
officials and communities in the districts of Dedza, Salima, Mulanje, Thyolo and Zomba, 
including tea estate workers in the village of Bwaila in Traditional Authority Mchilamwela, 
villagers facing displacement from land adjoining a sugar cane plantation in Mtakataka, 
tenant workers on a tobacco farm in Changoma, and staff of a nutrition rehabilitation unit 
developing a community garden project at the Mulanje Mission Hospital; and farmers 
involved in agroecological projects in Ekwendeni, Mzimba District, and in Lodi, Dedza 
District. The Special Rapporteur also visited Maula Prison in Lilongwe, where he met with 
prisoners and with representatives of the prison administration. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government for facilitating his visit and for 
the open and frank spirit in which dialogues were conducted. He expresses his thanks and 
appreciation to the wide range of people and local communities he was able to meet with, 
as well to the United Nations country team and the United Nations Resident Coordinator in 
Malawi for the excellent support provided.  
</p>
<p>4. The visit took place at a time when the country is making important choices for its 
near and long-term future. On 8 June 2013, President Joyce Banda announced at the 
&#8220;Nutrition for Growth&#8221; summit in London, that Malawi had joined the New Alliance for 
Food Security and Nutrition; the terms of its agreement are set out in a country cooperation 
framework that includes a series of policy commitments engaging the country for the years 
to come. The 2014 elections and the fiftieth anniversary of independence (&#8220;Malawi at 50&#8221;) 
also provide opportunities for a national dialogue on a renewed comprehensive vision for 
the country. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context  
</b>5. Malawi has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world (US$ 340 per capita in 
2011). With a population of 14.8 million (2012 official estimate), it is one of the world&#8217;s 
most densely populated countries (139 habitants per square kilometre) and it has one of the 
highest population growth rates in the region (2.6 per cent per year). It has been designated 
by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) as one of the 15 &#8220;population hotspots&#8221; 
across the globe: its population is expected to triple to over 40 million by 2040. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. In part as the result of strong demographic growth, the country&#8217;s natural resources are 
under enormous pressure. Land degradation (aggravated depletion of soil fertility) is the most 
worrying sign of the ecological crisis in Malawi. Forest cover is decreasing at the alarming 
rate of 2.8 per cent per year. Unsustainable natural resources management costs Malawi an 
estimated US$ 191 million annually, or 5.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).1  
</p><p>7. Malawi is prone to natural disasters, in particular floods, droughts and dry spells. 
Between 1991 and 2005, 10 out of 14 growing seasons were affected by large-scale 
climatic events each affecting more than 100,000 people, and as many as 5.1 million in 
2005. Droughts and floods push, on average, approximately 265,000 more people into 
poverty each year and cause an annual average loss of 1.7 per cent of GDP.2 
</p>
<p>8. The current Government is implementing a set of orthodox economic and financial 
policies aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability with the support of an International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) three-year Extended Credit Facility arrangement worth 
US$ 157 million, approved in July 2012. Key adjustment measures have included the May 
2012 devaluation of the kwacha that increased the price of foreign exchange by 
approximately 50 per cent; the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime; increases in the 
retail prices of petroleum products and further liberalization of those prices; and tightened 
monetary and fiscal policy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen from 4.3 per cent 
in 2011 to 1.9 per cent in 2012, reflecting contractions in agriculture and manufacturing.3 
</p>
<p><b> III. Food and nutrition insecurity  
</b></p>
<p>9. Malawi is among the poorest countries in the world, ranking 170th of 186 surveyed 
countries in the 2013 Human Development Index. The more than half of the population 
who live below the poverty line have seen little or no improvement in their situation over 
the past decade. Despite growth averaging 7 per cent in the period 2006&#8211;2010, overall 
poverty has only slightly declined (from 52.5 per cent in 2004/05 to 50.7 per cent in 
2010/11) and for the more than 80 per cent of the population living in rural areas, it has in 
fact worsened. One quarter of Malawians are considered &#8220;ultra poor&#8221;, with an income 
below the estimated cost of food providing the minimum daily recommended calorie 
intake.4 Inequality has also worsened, with the country&#8217;s Gini coefficient rising from 0.39 
in 2004 to 0.45 in 2010.5

<p>basis of a food poverty line (estimated cost of the minimum standard for daily recommended calorie 
intake) combined with the estimated cost for basic non-food needs. The third Integrated Household 
Survey identifies as &#8220;poor&#8221; and &#8220;ultra poor&#8221; the population that has a total consumption below, 
respectively, MK 37,002 and MK 22,956 per year (approximately US$ 250 and $150 at 2011 
exchange rates).

<p>10. Levels of malnutrition are alarmingly high. About half of all children under the age 
of 5 show signs of chronic malnutrition. An estimated 48 per cent are too short for their age 
(stunted), 30.6 per cent weigh too little for their age (underweight) and 11.4 per cent weigh 
too little for their height (wasted).6 
</p><p>11. One third of the population is food insecure, with disrupted eating patterns and 
reduced food intake. The incidence of food insecurity is markedly higher in rural areas 
(34 per cent) compared to urban areas (23 per cent), among female-headed households 
(38 per cent) compared to male-headed households (31 per cent) and in the southern region 
of the country (36 per cent) compared to the northern (29.9 per cent) and central 
(29.5 per cent) regions. The disparity in levels of food insecurity among districts is 
particularly pronounced. In the Shire Valley districts of Nsanje and Chikhwawa, 78 and 
75 per cent of the population, respectively, were considered food insecure, compared to 
14 per cent in Machinga district.7 
</p>
<p>12. Acute food insecurity is a recurrent phenomenon during the lean season. The annual 
forecast of the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee estimated that 1,461,940 
people (9.5 per cent of the population) would not be able to meet their annual food 
requirement during 2013/14.8 While this is an improvement compared to the previous year, 
the number of food insecure households is still more than double that in any of the five 
preceding years. Moreover, as 42 per cent of households spend more than 75 per cent of 
their income on food, even slight increases in the prices of food commodities compared to 
those used in the Committee&#8217;s projections would further worsen this situation. 
</p><p>13. The strategic grain reserve managed by the National Food Reserve Agency provides 
a key instrument for the Government to reduce price volatility and cushion the impacts of 
price spikes. However, as the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee announced that 
57,346 metric tons (maize equivalent) in humanitarian food support to vulnerable 
households would be needed during the 2013/14 consumption period, the national grain 
reserves had been depleted, raising concerns about their management and the lack of 
allocation of funds to the Agency to allow the reserves to be replenished. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. Article 30, paragraph 2, of the 1994 Constitution refers to access to food as part of 
the human right to development, and commits the State to &#8220;take all necessary measures for 
the realization of the right to development. Such measures shall include, amongst other 
things, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, education, health 
services, food, shelter, employment and infrastructure&#8221;. In chapter III (Fundamental 
Principles) of the Constitution, article 13 (b) stipulates that &#8220;The State shall actively 
promote the welfare and development of the people of Malawi by progressively adopting 
and implementing policies and legislation aimed at achieving [a number of goals, including 
to] achieve adequate nutrition for all in order to promote good health and self-sufficiency&#8221;. 
Moreover, as a State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, Malawi recognizes &#8220;the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for 
himself and his family, including adequate food&#8221; and &#8220;the fundamental right of everyone to 
be free from hunger&#8221; (art. 11).

<p>15. Consistent with the status of the right to food in domestic law and with the 
international obligations of the country, Malawian courts have recognized the justiciability 
of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to adequate food.9 The national 
Food Security Policy of 2006 also explicitly reaffirms the human right to adequate food in 
its section 1.2.2.4, stating that &#8220;cognisant of the provisions for the protection of human 
rights and freedoms as enshrined in the Constitution of Malawi, the right to adequate food 
is fully accepted as a human right. The right for everyone to have access to safe and 
nutritious food shall be observed in accordance with the fundamental right of everyone to 
be free from hunger.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. Various policy documents underline the commitment of Malawi to eradicate hunger 
and malnutrition. Malawi Vision 2020, launched in 1998, outlines the national long-term 
development perspective for Malawi. Its chapter 6 sets out the aspiration &#8220;for all members 
of all households to have access to adequate and safe food at all times of the year to meet 
their nutritional requirements&#8221;. Malawi Vision 2020 has guided the formulation of a series 
of medium-term development strategies, the latest of which is the Malawi Growth and 
Development Strategy (MGDS) II, 2011-2016. MGDS II focuses on food security as one of 
its nine key priority areas and provides a guiding framework for national efforts to achieve 
food and nutrition security.  
</p>
<p>17. A wide range of other national policies and strategies of relevance to the right to 
food have been formulated in recent years, such as the National Nutrition Policy (2005); the 
National Nutritional Policy and Strategic Plan (2009); the National Nutrition Education and 
Communication Strategy for Preventing Child Stunting in Malawi, 2012&#8211;2017; the 
National School Health and Nutrition Strategic Plan, 2009&#8211;2018; and the National School 
Health and Nutrition Strategic Policy.10 Moreover, the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach, 
adopted in 2010, is aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and improving nutrition at 
the household level, and is currently being complemented by a broader National 
Agricultural Policy, adopted in 2011.  
</p>
<p><b>  Collecting and analysing data 
</b></p>
<p>18. As a State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Government of Malawi has committed to take appropriate steps, to the 
maximum of its available resources, to ensure the realization of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, including adequate food. A fundamental requirement for identifying 
&#8220;appropriate steps&#8221; is to have a system in place to collect and analyse data on the actual 
status of realization of the right to food. Such data collection and analysis must be carried 
out periodically in order to continuously monitor progress made, or the lack thereof, with a 
view to adjusting ineffective policies and programmes. 
</p><p>19. In Malawi, two main means of monitoring progress in improving food security are the 
Integrated Household Survey, carried out every five years, and the Welfare Monitoring 
Survey, carried out annually. However, there were considerable discrepancies between the 
assessments of food and nutrition security in the 2009 Welfare Monitoring Survey and the 
2011 Integrated Household Survey (published in 2012). The former showed significant 
progress in reducing poverty and the number of people at risk of hunger. Overall levels of 
poverty were estimated to have decreased to 39 per cent, from 50 per cent in 2005, and 
poverty was being reduced both in rural and in urban areas. The Welfare Monitoring Survey

  The Policy was still being developed at the time the present report was submitted. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.1

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>figures were used in a range of policy documents and reports, including MGDS II, the 2010 
and 2011 reports on the Millennium Development Goals, and the core document submitted to 
the human rights treaty bodies in April 2012. For example, MGDS II stated that &#8220;Welfare 
Monitoring Survey reports indicate that the number of Malawians at risk of hunger has been 
decreasing over time due to [the Farm Input Subsidy Programme]&#8221;.11 Likewise, in the core 
document, the Government states that from this information it has been concluded that the 
Goal to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger is likely to be met (HRI/CORE/MWI/2012, 
para. 22). 
</p><p>20. These findings, however, were contradicted by the third Integrated Household 
Survey, which was published, with some delay, in August 2012. According to the Survey, 
the proportion of the population with below minimum food consumption (the ultra poor), 
had not decreased, but rather had increased from 22.3 per cent in 2005 to 24.5 per cent in 
2011, while overall poverty in rural areas had increased from 55.9 per cent to 56.6 per cent.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur notes that the new data call for a reassessment of current 
policies aimed at reducing poverty and food insecurity. Moreover, it would be important to 
identify the reasons for the significant discrepancies to ensure greater accuracy of such 
surveys, which are essential to monitoring the progressive realization of the right to food.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Food availability and agricultural production 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Investing in agriculture 
</b></p>
<p>22. The total area under cultivation in Malawi is between 2.2 million and 2.5 million 
hectares. More than 90 per cent is cultivated by small-scale farming households,12 which 
number from 2.3 million to 2.8 million.13 But the very small landholding sizes (the average 
cultivated area by household is estimated at 1.4 hectares, while 65 per cent of rural 
households cultivate up to 0.8 hectares),14 and agrometeorological conditions that make the 
cultivation of most high value food or cash crops difficult or impossible in many areas of 
the country, have serious consequences for the food security of the population. These 
factors and past agricultural policies have led farmers to gradually depend on a single 
annual staple crop for the bulk of their food: maize. The cultivation of maize year after year 
on the same land has led to the erosion of soil nutrients. In addition, the pressure on land 
has gradually limited livestock ownership, so that most farming households do not have 
access to sufficient animal manure to maintain the fertility of their soil.  
</p>
<p>23. Against this background, it is to be welcomed that Malawi has placed agriculture 
and food security at the top of its political agenda. It is one of the few countries in Africa to 
have reached the target of allocating 10 per cent of the national budget to agriculture, set at 
the Maputo summit of the African Union in 2003.

 The National Statistical Office has estimated the number of farming households at 2.3 million, 
</p>
<p>whereas the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development estimated that the number 
was closer to 2.8 million. See B. Chinsinga, &#8220;The future of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme

</p>
<p><b>  Farm Input Subsidy Programme 
</b></p>
<p>24. By far the largest agriculture support programme is the Farm Input Subsidy 
Programme (FISP), initiated during the 2005/06 growing season. FISP is administered 
through vouchers or coupons that enable eligible households to purchase fixed quantities of 
fertilizer, seeds and storage pesticides at significantly reduced prices. It targets 1.5 million 
beneficiaries, who each receive inputs sufficient for approximately 0.33 hectares of land at 
recommended input application rates. 
</p>
<p>25. The programme has had significant positive impacts on maize production. Since the 
2005/06 growing season, Malawi has been able to meet its national maize requirements, 
while in previous decades it depended upon foreign aid and commercial maize imports. 
FISP has been credited for contributing to low inflation, a higher degree of food self-
sufficiency among rural households and an increase in the number of meals taken in a day 
within these households.15 Still, massive rural food insecurity and poverty remain, and 
concerns are being raised as to whether FISP represents the best use of scarce resources to 
address hunger. 
</p>
<p>26. First, the targeting of the FISP programme is under scrutiny. FISP officially targets 
vulnerable resource-poor Malawians who own a piece of land and can make effective use 
of the subsidized inputs (the &#8220;productive poor&#8221;). However, assessments found that 
households headed by young females were less likely to receive complete input subsidy 
packets than households headed by older males; poor households were less likely than rich 
households to receive vouchers; and those with more education received more coupons than 
the recommended amount.16  
</p>
<p>27. Measures have been taken to improve targeting, including holding public village 
meetings to ensure greater transparency in the coupon allocation process; maintaining farm 
household registers to prevent &#8220;outsiders&#8221; from becoming beneficiaries; and 
communicating the targeting criteria through the FISP implementation guidelines, which 
stipulate that resource-poor vulnerable groups should be considered in the identification of 
beneficiaries, including households affected by HIV/AIDS, and child- or female-headed 
households. The impacts of these reforms remain to be assessed.  
</p>
<p>28. Second, the rising cost of fertilizer imports and its impact on the balance of 
payments of the country have cast doubt on the sustainability of the programme. The 
programme cost rose from MK 4,480 million (about US$ 36 million) in 2005/06 to 
MK 33,922 million (about US$ 234 million) in 2008/09, and decreased to 
MK 20,249 million (about US$ 140 million) in 2009/10.17 While FISP accounts for one 
tenth of the total value of imports, the programme does not have a mechanism to recuperate 
programme cost or replenish the foreign currency reserves that it consumes. The 
programme is highly vulnerable to fuel- and fertilizer-price volatility.  
</p>
<p>29. A third concern relates to the question of opportunity costs. In 2006/07 and 2007/08, 
more than 8 per cent of the national budget was dedicated to FISP. The figure increased to 
16.2 per cent in 2008/09 (representing 74 per cent of the budget for agriculture) due to 
skyrocketing fertilizer prices.18 The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security informed the 
Special Rapporteur that it had allocated 54.5 per cent of its 2012/13 budget to FISP

<p>(approximately MK 60 billion out of a total budget of MK 110 billion), and significant 
human resources of the Ministry are dedicated to the programme. The priority given to 
FISP has led to a decline in spending on agricultural research, extension services, training, 
rural roads and infrastructure, and a delay in the implementation of the Green Belt 
Initiative.  At the same time, a range of programmes may have higher development impacts 
than FISP, such as the Farm Income Diversification Programme, the Public Works 
Programme, the Agroforestry Food Security Programme, or the One Village One Product 
programme. 
</p>
<p>30. Fourth, inorganic fertilizers may be masking soil nutrient depletion, rather than 
correcting it. The continued loss of soil micronutrients puts into question the possibility of 
maintaining yield levels over the long term. Yields of both cereals and maize, which rose 
between 2005/06 and 2009, have reportedly levelled off since 2010. As a recent report 
points out, there is a need to systematically move towards developing organic exit strategies 
for FISP, as the increased use of inorganic fertilizer may have a negative impact on the 
soil&#8217;s physical characteristics and its vulnerability to erosion, and temporarily hide the 
effects of bad land management.19 
</p>
<p>31. Fifth, while FISP has improved food security among small-scale farmers, including 
the most vulnerable among them, it does not serve as an effective agricultural development 
strategy for such farmers, who contribute 70 per cent of the agricultural GDP,20 as it does 
not create any &#8220;development dynamic&#8221; allowing poor smallholders to move out of 
subsistence farming.  
</p>
<p>32. In the light of these concerns expressed about FISP, the Special Rapporteur advises 
the Government to review and reform the programme.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Five critical transformations 
</b></p>
<p>33. In reforming FISP and elaborating a vision for agricultural development, five critical 
transformations seem advisable.  
</p>
<p>34. First, agricultural diversification is required. Future efforts should recognize the 
links between agriculture, nutrition and health. Vision 2020 stated that in Malawi &#8220;diets are 
bulky and monotonous. Meals consist of <i>nsima</i> made from maize or cassava flour taken 
together with cooked vegetable dishes. The result is a high level of chronic under nutrition 
and micronutrient deficiencies&#8221; (para. 6.2.8.1). Despite some improvements since Vision 
2020 was formulated in 1998, levels of child malnutrition remain unacceptably high in 
Malawi. Ensuring access to more balanced diets is crucial to address this problem. 
However, there is a need to link the important nutritional education programmes launched 
by the Government (coordinated by the Ministry of Health and the Office of the President 
and Cabinet) with initiatives to promote a more diversified agricultural food production 
(coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security).  
35. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the initiatives started in 
nutrition rehabilitation units across the country, including at Ekwendeni Hospital in 
Mzimba District and at Mulanje Mission Hospital in Mulanje District, which have 
successfully combined treatment and nutrition education with programmes to assist 
communities to diversify the crops and legumes they grow in their gardens and plots of

</p>
<p>land. The Government could study how such initiatives could be scaled up, including by 
integrating nutritional education into strengthened extension services for local 
communities. There would be considerable gains from diversification aimed at producing 
the food Malawians need for adequate diets. For instance, FISP could enhance the quantity 
and diversity of subsidized legume seeds distributed across the country, as well as fruit tree 
seeds and seedlings. In addition to their contribution to family nutrition and income, 
legumes build soil fertility and improve the efficiency of inorganic fertilizer use. 
</p>
<p>36. Second, there is a need for a &#8220;brown revolution&#8221; in the form of a concerted national 
effort to support farmers in improving structural soil fertility. By improving soil fertility, 
organic matter and water-holding capacity, Malawi could gradually reduce its dependency 
on imported fertilizers and become more resilient to dry spells. In this regard, successful 
home-grown organic soil fertilization technologies and practices should be promoted and 
scaled up. Examples include the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities project in 
Ekwendeni region (&gt;8,000 farmers), the Malawi Farmer-to-Farmer Agroecology project in 
Dedza (&gt;2,000 farmers), the Africa RISING programme, Total LandCare projects and the 
World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) AgroForestry Food Security Programme in Malawi 
(&gt;180,000 farmers).  
</p><p>37. Third, a &#8220;blue revolution&#8221; is required to improve water conservation and scale up 
sustainable irrigation methods. Malawi plans to expand the area under irrigation through the 
Green Belt Initiative, from 90,000 hectares to 400,000 hectares.21 However, only 
36 per cent of the country&#8217;s agricultural area is potentially irrigable with river/lake water. 
Other options are necessary to improve irrigation for those living in other areas.22 Yet, very 
few efforts are under way, despite the fact that the establishment of rainwater harvesting 
systems is a focus action of MGDS II. Developing small farm ponds, tanks, contour ridges, 
check dams and stone bunds for harvesting and storing rainwater water, which could be 
included in public works programmes, would go a long way to increase infiltration and 
recharge groundwater levels.  
</p>
<p>38. Fourth, as anticipated in the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach, agricultural 
extension services should be significantly scaled up.23 Their staff has been drastically 
reduced since the late 1990s (from about 3,000 to about 1,000 extension staff), with 
negative consequences for vulnerable farmers. In joining the New Alliance for Food 
Security and Nutrition, the Government also committed itself to strengthening extension 
services to support export growth clusters. This is promising. However, to effectively 
promote the right to adequate food, it would be critical to ensure that extension services 
reach the most vulnerable farmers and support the transformations outlined above.  
</p>
<p>39. Malawi could consider supporting innovative bottom-up models of horizontal 
extension. Initiatives such as farmers&#8217; research teams and agriculture and nutrition 
discussion groups not only facilitated the dissemination of agroecological practices to over 
8,000 farmers in Ekwendeni, but also improved consideration of gender issues and &#8220;family 
cooperation&#8221; in agricultural change. Decentralized extension networks involving extension 
officers, farmers&#8217; organizations and scientists could be established and tasked to facilitate 
the identification, development and dissemination of the best agroecological practices, as 
well as the identification of obstacles and incentives. Such innovative modernization of 
extension services is vital, as the implementation of agroecological practices described in

</b></p>
<p>preceding sections requires ownership by local communities. Finally, the hiring and 
training of female extension workers (currently greatly underrepresented), as well as the 
integration of gender issues into extension activities, are vital. Any strategy that does not 
affirmatively reach out to women farmers will fail to achieve significant results (see 
A/HRC/22/50 and Corr.1, paras. 29&#8211;38).  
</p><p>40. Finally, there is a need to pace carefully the shift towards a greater diversification of 
the economy across sectors as well as the change within agriculture. Recent policy 
documents and discourse put an emphasis on agricultural diversification through large-scale 
commercial estates, in an export-led approach. However, such capital-intensive farming 
minimizes labour use. An expansion of this model therefore requires careful consideration, 
given the complex social and economic consequences, including for rural-urban migration. 
The scale, speed and timing of mechanization must be adapted to the scale, speed and 
timing of the creation of non-agricultural employment opportunities.24 A priority for 
Malawi in the years to come is the creation of more employment opportunities, which may 
require the promotion of labour-intensive technologies and practices. The adoption of 
labour-saving technologies, although part of any long-term development strategy, must be 
gradual so as to avoid social disruptions.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur found that there was a general consensus on the five 
transformations and challenges outlined above. The cost of implementing the changes 
suggested above could be partly covered by savings in fertilizer imports and associated 
foreign exchange requirements, with &#8220;brown revolution&#8221; techniques being gradually 
disseminated and improving soil fertility; as well as by the strengthening of accountability 
mechanisms and anti-corruption measures within FISP, including in procurement.  
</p>
<p>42. If Malawi succeeds in designing an agricultural development policy integrating 
these elements at the same time as FISP is reformed, it could achieve lasting successes in 
combating hunger and malnutrition, and become a model for other countries affected by 
hunger and climate change.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Food accessibility 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Economic access to food via waged employment 
</b></p>
<p>43. The right to food is the right to access the means to produce food or the means to an 
income that enables the purchase of adequate food. Food accessibility is understood both as 
physical accessibility and as economic accessibility, requiring that net food buyers can 
afford adequate food that they purchase on the market.  
</p>
<p>44. The minimum wage in Malawi is currently fixed at MK 317 per day (about 
US$ 0.80), based upon the Employment Act (No. 6 of 2000). This is one of the lowest 
national minimum wages worldwide,25 the consequence of several decades of policies 
designed to produce cheap labour for the emerging estate sector by depressing the price of 
labour, including the so-called maximum-wage policy enshrined in the 1971 Wage 
Restraint Policy. A well-informed expert compared Malawi to a &#8220;labour Utopia&#8221; for 
employers, with cheap labour and poor labour inspection, a situation witnessed by the 
Special Rapporteur, who met with female seasonal tea pickers earning MK 430 per day for 
eight hours of work, provided they collect 44 kilograms of tea leaves.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Government should take immediate steps to adjust the national minimum wage 
to a living wage, a wage that &#8220;provides an income allowing workers to support themselves 
and their families&#8221;, as required under articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.26 Such a living wage should be assured for all waged 
workers, including casual/seasonal workers. 
</p>
<p>46. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that there is a need to strengthen the labour 
inspectorate, which is currently weak and underresourced; ensure respect for the right to 
organize; and ensure that collective bargaining, which is respected in the sugar sector, is 
applied in other estate sectors, in particular tea cultivation. 
</p>
<p><b>Situation of tenant workers in the tobacco sector  
</b></p>
<p>47. An estimated 300,000 tobacco tenant families live in extremely precarious situations 
in Malawi, as witnessed by the Special Rapporteur. Their incomes depend on the quantity 
and quality of tobacco sold to their landlord in each harvest season. In some cases, they are 
left without any income once they reimburse loans covering their food requirements during 
the growing season. In many cases, their monthly allocation barely allows them to feed 
themselves. Another consequence of the low prices received for their product is the massive 
use of child labour: it is estimated that 78,000 child labourers are employed in picking 
tobacco leaves .27  
</p>
<p>48. A tenancy labour bill setting out basic rights of tobacco tenant workers was 
presented in 2010. The Special Rapporteur expresses the hope that this bill will be tabled in 
an upcoming sitting of Parliament.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Situation of smallholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>49. Land is a critical source of livelihood for a majority of the Malawian population 
living in rural areas as smallholders, cultivating small land plots often of less than one 
hectare. Land is also becoming an increasingly scarce resource as a consequence of rapid 
population growth and government policy to develop large-scale estates.  
</p>
<p>50. Against this backdrop, a new land bill, in the form of 11 pieces of legislation, is now 
pending approval. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the 
following areas where the land bill could strengthen protection of the right to food.  
</p>
<p>51. First, the reformed legal framework should provide for adequate protection against 
land grabbing in the context of agricultural investments, such as those foreseen under the 
Green Belt Initiative and the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. One of the 
commitments of the Government under the latter framework is to release 200,000 hectares 
of land to investors, &#8220;after conducting a survey to identify idle land and crop suitability 
under both customary and leasehold [tenure]&#8221;.28 The Special Rapporteur welcomes in this 
regard the commitment under the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition 
cooperation framework to comply with the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible

</p>

 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 18 (2005) on the right to 
</p>
<p>work, para. 7. The Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code refers to a living wage as one that is &#8220;enough 
to meet basic needs and to provide some discretionary income&#8221; (art. 5.1).

<p>Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food 
Security, endorsed in May 2012 by the Committee on World Food Security. He notes that 
the Guidelines refer to equitable access to land and recommend the adoption of ceiling 
laws, considering the positive impacts of equitable access to land on food security. This 
should guide the future allocation of the estimated 2.4 million hectares of underutilized land 
in the country. He recommends that the surveys to identify available land be done using 
participatory means. In order to ensure adequate security of tenure for rural communities, 
the new legislative framework should include safeguards against excessive powers of 
traditional chiefs to agree to land acquisitions against the will of their communities. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur concludes from his meetings with government officials and 
communities facing displacement from their land that the current safeguards are inadequate. 
In assessing whether or not displacement can be justified, legislation should ensure that the 
impacts on affected communities are adequately assessed, that all potentially affected 
persons are fully consulted and, where displacement cannot be avoided, provided with fair 
compensation. Persons who are resettled should be compensated with land commensurate 
in quality, size and value, or better. In no circumstance should families be deprived of their 
sources of livelihood without alternative sources being created that are at least as 
satisfactory. 
</p>
<p>53. The new legislation should also pay adequate attention to the situation of women 
and their vulnerability to being disadvantaged in their access to land, as also discussed in 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on women&#8217;s rights and the right to food (A/HRC/22/50 and 
Corr.1). 
</p><p>54. Finally, the customary land bill should guarantee security of tenure also to those 
who may not get their land registered, for example because they lack resources and access 
to information about procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Contract farming  
</b></p>
<p>55. Contract farming arrangements between small-scale farmers and agrifood companies 
are currently being tried in tobacco farming. Such arrangements could multiply as Malawi 
takes steps to promote large-scale commercial agricultural projects. The Country 
Cooperation Framework to Support the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition 
includes a policy commitment to fast track the Contract Farming Strategy initially prepared 
in 2009.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to develop a legal framework to 
regulate the development of contract farming. In order to ensure that it complies with the 
requirements of the right to adequate food, such a framework should build on the set of 
conditions outlined earlier by the Special Rapporteur, including support for small-scale 
farmers in negotiations to ensure greater balance in bargaining positions, clear and 
transparent pricing mechanisms and ways of resolving disputes (A/66/262, paras. 25&#8211;32). 
Beyond contract farming, which seldom encourages farmers to climb up the value chain 
and move into the packaging, processing or marketing of their produce, other and more 
inclusive business models could be explored, such as joint ventures, farmer-controlled 
enterprises, or direct-to-consumer food marketing.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Social protection: reaching the ultra poor 
</b></p>
<p>57. There is a range of social support/protection schemes in Malawi. With the exception 
of FISP, the programmes all have limited geographical coverage. Moreover, international 
donors provide the major part of programme budgets. The programmes include emergency 
response to communities affected by shocks, in the form of food aid (in-kind or through </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>cash or voucher transfers); public works programmes (food or cash for work) targeted at 
households experiencing periodic food insecurity; targeted transfers (cash/productive 
assets) to assist households that are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity (child-headed, 
ultra-poor and labour-constrained households). In addition, a separate Presidential Initiative 
on Poverty and Hunger Reduction was launched on 17 June 2012, focusing on livelihoods 
in the agricultural sector, with separate budgets for a range of interventions, including the 
handing out of seeds and livestock (known as the &#8220;one family one cow&#8221; initiative) to poor 
rural households. 
</p>
<p>58. Several government institutions are involved in the implementation of social 
protection programmes, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (food aid); 
the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (public works programmes); 
and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Community Development and the Office of the 
President and Cabinet (targeted transfers). Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Planning 
and Development coordinates the National Social Support Programme, which includes an 
interministerial social support steering committee and a social support technical committee.  
</p>
<p>59. The number of beneficiaries of the social protection programmes has been gradually 
increasing in recent years.29 Still, national coverage remains limited, and there are 
significant disparities among regions and districts.  
</p>
<p>60. In 2010, an average of 14.8 per cent of the population benefited from school feeding 
programmes, implemented by the World Food Programme and non-governmental 
organizations in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. 
Schools participating in such programmes have seen a significant reduction in dropout rates 
and improved child nutrition. In 9 of the country&#8217;s 28 districts, however, less than 
3 per cent of the school population was covered,30 whereas 40 per cent or more participated 
in such programmes in the districts of Chiradzulu, Mulanje and Nsanje and in the urban 
centres of Mzuzu and Blantyre. These differences do not seem to correspond with a 
deliberate targeting of districts with a particularly high level of child malnutrition and 
school dropout. For instance, in the district of Nkhotakota, where no child benefited from 
school feeding programmes, the rates of primary education dropout and of stunting of 
children below the age of 5 are well above the national average.31  
</p>
<p>61. With regard to public works programmes, available data suggest that they are not 
always reaching the intended target group. These programmes are designed to be self-
targeting, since they would only seem to be an attractive option to those in genuine need, 
who have run out of other options. Yet, data from the third Integrated Household Survey 
shows that significantly more people from the fourth highest consumption quintile 
(3.2 per cent) of the population had participated in a public works programme compared to 
those from the lowest consumption quintile (2 per cent). 
</p><p>62. In the village of Mzembera, Salima District, the Special Rapporteur met with 
beneficiaries of the country&#8217;s main programme of targeted cash transfers, the Social Cash 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>29
 According to the Government, the proportion of the disadvantaged receiving conditional and 
</p>
<p>unconditional cash transfer increased from 4 per cent in 2005 to 37 per cent in 2010. At the same time 
the Public Works Programme increased its coverage from 130,000 people in 2009 to 335,225 in 2010 
(MGDS II, p. 35). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 The lowest extension of such programmes was in the districts of Nkhata Bay, Northern Region and 
</p>
<p>Nkhotakota, Central Region (both 0.0 per cent) and Machinga, Southern Region (0.3 per cent). 
 
</p>
<p>31
 Malawi, <i>IHS 2010/2011</i>, pp. 38, 176 and 183. The primary education dropout rate in Nkhotakota 
</p>
<p>(2.9 per cent) is more than double the national average (1.3 per cent) and the rate of moderate stunting 
of children below the age of 5 years (62.6 per cent) is significantly above the national average 
(48.1 per cent). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Transfer programme. The programme targets households that are both ultra poor and labour 
constrained. Starting as a pilot programme in Mchinji in 2006 with the support of the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), and after evidence of positive impacts had 
been documented by an external evaluation,32 it was extended to 8 of the country&#8217;s 28 
districts, reaching an estimated 26,000 households and 103,000 individuals. Beneficiary 
households receive a monthly cash transfer which is calculated on the basis of the number 
of people in the household (ranging from MK 1,000/US$ 2.75 per month for a one-person 
household to MK 2,400/US$ 6.60 for a household of four or more). As the Special 
Rapporteur learned from his conversations with beneficiaries, the small amounts received 
had made a significant contribution to improving livelihoods, allowing households to 
purchase food, farm inputs, school uniforms and other necessities.  
</p>
<p>63. Currently, 10 per cent of the programme&#8217;s budget is provided by the Government 
and the rest by international donors. The Government intends to gradually scale up the 
scheme to cover the whole country. This will indeed be critical to reversing the trend of 
increasing rates of extreme poverty in rural areas. More broadly, moving towards the 
establishment of a comprehensive social protection system and a national social protection 
floor will be an important element of a national strategy to curb accelerated population 
growth, in a context where children currently constitute the main means of livelihood 
security for parents in their old age. Indeed, a comprehensive social protection system for 
the elderly, the chronically sick or those without another source of income is already 
urgently needed. As a recent study showed, children are increasingly failing to provide for 
the needs of the elderly owing to economic hardship and changing family ties. Moreover, 
HIV/AIDS has resulted in a high number of orphaned elderly, who lack the support of other 
family members, and of orphaned children being cared for by their grandparents or living in 
child-headed households.33  
</p>
<p>64. As also recognized in MGDS II, key challenges surround efforts to ensure access to 
basic social protection for those most vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity in Malawi. 
First, programmes are often ad hoc and uncoordinated, spread over multiple initiatives and 
government institutions, which calls for the establishment of &#8220;coherent and progressive 
social support synergies&#8221;.34 The 2012 National Social Support Policy seeks to address this 
problem and it will be important to ensure that the coordination mechanisms foreseen in 
this Policy become fully operational.  
</p>
<p>65. Second, current schemes are overly reliant on donor-funded, time-bound projects, 
which undermines their overall coherence and sustainability. One essential requirement to 
address this problem would be a greater contribution from the national budget towards the 
financing of social protection programmes. 
</p>
<p>66. Third, there is a need to better target social support programmes to ensure that they 
reach the intended beneficiaries/rights holders and to find innovative ways to minimize 
transaction costs and leakages. The system of decentralized targeting at the community 
level in which village heads play a major role, though cost-effective and relatively 
successful, could be improved by introducing further checks and balances to safeguard 
against favouritism and arbitrary exclusion.

redress mechanisms against mismanagement and arbitrary allocation of benefits; 
(c) introducing a system of community score cards to allow for the tracking of inputs (for 
example vouchers, farm inputs) and ensure that members of the community are aware of 
their rights and entitlements; and (d) strengthening the oversight role of local committees, 
made up of community members, possibly building upon existing systems of village 
development committees and civil protection committees.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Women&#8217;s right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>68. Among the ultra poor in Malawi, women face specific impediments to their 
enjoyment of the right to food. Given their traditional role in the family, women in most 
cases shoulder an unequal share of household responsibilities, such as taking care of the 
children, the elderly and the sick. They spend on average 1.2 hours a day on getting water 
and fetching firewood, adding to their time poverty.35 Moreover, it is estimated that women 
provide 70 per cent of the agricultural workforce, yet they are unequal with men in 
decision-making and control over production resources and land. The same general pattern 
is found in all regions, irrespective of whether customary land ownership was governed by 
a matrilineal or patrilineal system. 
</p>
<p>69. In order to strengthen the protection of women&#8217;s right to food, the Special 
Rapporteur underlines the importance of integrating a gender perspective into food security 
interventions and programmes:  
</p>
<p>(a) The specific constraints faced by women must be recognized. For example, 
women&#8217;s caretaking responsibilities and time constraints should be borne in mind in the 
design of agricultural extension services or public works programmes;  
</p>
<p>(b) Women must be relieved from some of the burdens they shoulder, for 
instance through the prioritization of measures which would reduce the time spent on 
fetching water and firewood (for example providing access to electricity or boring wells); 
</p>
<p>(c) To achieve a more equal distribution of tasks within households, a 
transformation of existing gender-role divisions should be promoted. &#8220;Recipe days&#8221; organized 
in some communities have served to get men involved in household cooking and to sensitize 
them about maternal and child nutrition: they should be generalized across the country.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Prisoners&#8217; right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur visited Maula Prison in Lilongwe to assess the situation of 
prisoners with regard to their right to adequate food in the light of a 2009 High Court ruling 
concerning problems of severe overcrowding and inadequate feeding in Malawian prisons. 
The ruling concerned a case brought by a prison inmate serving a 12-year sentence in 
Chichiri Prison on behalf all prisoners in Malawi against the Minister of Home Affairs and 
Internal Security and the Commissioner of Prisons. The complainant claimed that prison 
conditions amounted to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In particular, it 
was argued that feeding prisoners only one meal per day, consisting of maize meal (<i>nsima</i>) 
and peas or beans, was grossly inadequate. The High Court found that prison overcrowding 
amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. It also found that the &#8220;minimum standards 
set by the [1955] Prisons Act have outlived their time and ought to be amended to raise 
those minimum standards to meet nutritional needs of the prisoners to address new health

<p>challenges of inmates&#8221;.36 In 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Committee also 
expressed concern about &#8220;deplorable conditions of detention in [Malawian] prisons&#8221; 
(CCPR/C/MWI/CO/1, para. 13). The Special Rapporteur regrets in this regard the slow 
progress made in reforming the Prison Act.37 
</p>
<p>71. At Maula Prison, the Prison Service was only able to provide prisoners one daily 
meal consisting of maize meal (<i>nsima</i>) and beans or peas, due to budget constraints. At 
times, when food stocks and the budget ran out, the prison had to rely on a private provider 
to sell the prison maize meal on credit. According to the prisoners, there were days when 
they received no food at all, for example when there was no firewood available or 
provisions of maize flour had run out. Moreover, they explained that prisoners with 
HIV/AIDS and other chronic diseases did not receive any special treatment to meet their 
special dietary needs.  
</p>
<p>72. The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provides, in rule 20, 
paragraph 1, that &#8220;every prisoner shall be provided by the administration at the usual hours 
with food of nutritional value adequate for health and strength, of wholesome quality and 
well prepared and served&#8221;. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the budget constraints 
faced by the Prison Service, he calls attention to the fact that this cannot justify violations 
of the right to adequate food and to be free from hunger or, as the Human Rights 
Committee has underlined, non-compliance with the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners.38 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Making maximum use of available resources 
</b></p>
<p>73. Malawi has committed itself to taking steps to the maximum of its available 
resources to progressively achieve the full realization of the right to adequate food 
(International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 2). Beyond the 
adoption of the legislative and policy measures considered in the above sections, including 
optimizing the impact of policies and programmes by appropriate budget allocation, the 
Special Rapporteur considers the following two issues as vital to the realization of the right 
to adequate food in Malawi.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Illicit financial flows and the right to food  
</b></p>
<p>74. It is estimated that Malawi has lost over 10 per cent of GDP to illicit outflows over 
the period 1980&#8211;2009.39 This reduces its ability to realize the right to food. Recognizing 
that &#8220;illicit capital flight undermines the capacity of State Parties to implement the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and to attain the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, 
the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has recently called upon States 
parties to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights &#8220;to examine their national tax

</p>
<p>laws and policies towards preventing illicit capital flight in Africa&#8221;.40 This recommendation 
will be especially relevant to Malawi, due to the expected growth of the extractive industry. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Malawi to swiftly implement the concrete 
recommendations suggested by the African Development Bank and Global Financial 
Integrity, including joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and 
adopt legislation transforming EITI voluntary requirements into legal requirements, as has 
been done in Liberia and Nigeria.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Tax race to the bottom: the misguided quest for global competitiveness  
</b></p>
<p>75. Malawi offers a great range of tax incentives to domestic and foreign companies. 
Mining companies are exempt from customs and excise duties, as well as from value added 
tax (VAT) on mining machinery, plant and equipment. They can also sign special deals on 
the rate of royalties owed to the Government. Companies operating in export processing 
zones pay no corporate tax, no withholding tax on dividends, no VAT and no duty on 
equipment, machinery and raw materials.41 One study considering only two companies 
found that Malawi lost MK 86.4 billion (US$ 217 million) from tax incentives granted to 
those companies between 2008 and 2012, or an average of MK 17.28 billion 
(US$ 43 million) per year.42 While the accuracy of this estimate has been contested, the 
Special Rapporteur concluded from meetings held during his visit that revenue losses are 
indeed very significant. To put the sums into perspective, the loss in revenues from the 
incentives granted to those two companies alone represent over 60 per cent of the costs of 
four key safety net programmes in Malawi which together cost MK 27.5 billion in the 
2012/13 budget: the Intensive Public Works Programme, the School Feeding Programme 
(targeted towards 980,000 pupils in primary schools), the Schools Bursaries Programme 
(targeting 16,480 needy students) and the Social Cash Transfer programme (which is 
expected to reach over 30,000 households across the country).43 
</p><p>76. Despite increasing awareness of the negative consequences of the global race to the 
bottom in taxation regimes, Malawi has recently committed to &#8220;fast track the doing 
business reforms and review taxation regimes in order to maximise incentives to investment 
in the growth clusters under the National Export Strategy and to support agricultural 
mechanization&#8221;.44 It is unclear how this is reconciled with the Government&#8217;s commitment 
to &#8220;strengthen revenue administration and broaden the tax base&#8221; and to &#8220;improve revenue 
collection&#8221;.45 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur heard from government officials that they should be better 
supported in negotiating with foreign companies. He is convinced that, unless combined 
with comprehensive enhancement and optimization of tax revenue in Malawi, current 
macroeconomic reforms may not translate into positive impacts on the realization of the 
right to food.

<p><b> VIII. A national food and nutrition security framework law 
</b></p>
<p>78. Malawi has a wide range of well-formulated and well-intended policies and 
strategies to accelerate progress in the realization of the right to adequate food. What is 
missing, however, is a more solid framework to bring together and build synergies among 
the multiple policies, strategies and programmes. Such a framework could ideally be 
grounded in law, through a national food and nutrition security/right to food framework 
law. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the support expressed by interlocutors 
within the Government and civil society for such a framework law. Initial steps have 
already been taken through discussions on a draft food security bill prepared in consultation 
with civil society organizations involved in the National Right to Food Network. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to revive this proposal in consultation with 
relevant stakeholders, including parliamentary committees, the Malawi Law Commission, 
the Malawi Human Rights Commission, civil society organizations, farmers&#8217; associations 
and the private sector.  
</p>
<p>79. The framework law could build upon the various coordination mechanisms referred 
to in recent policies and strategies in the area of food security and nutrition, and help 
address the problems encountered in making these coordination mechanisms fully 
operational. The framework law would establish one robust institutional mechanism to 
promote coordination and synergies across different sectors. In this regard, it could draw 
inspiration from similar framework laws in other countries (see A/68/288). 
</p><p>80. Based on experience from other countries, a framework law presents the following 
benefits: (a) institutionalization of a coherent and integrated approach, through the creation 
of an independent council formed by relevant government ministries and institutions and 
members of civil society, associations of food producers and the private sector, which will 
provide advice to the Government in matters related to food and nutrition security; 
(b) grounding of national policies and programmes in a society-wide consensus, increasing 
their survival in the face of changes in Governments; (c) predictability and ring fencing of 
resources for food and nutrition programmes, possibly through the establishment of a 
national fund; (d) strengthened accountability and institutional oversight of food and 
nutrition security programmes, including on the way information is collected and 
programmes assessed, increasing transparency and safeguards against the use of political 
criteria in the targeting of programmes. In this regard, the Malawi Human Rights 
Commission could usefully be given a specific mandate to receive complaints regarding the 
right to food, including cases concerning the arbitrary exclusion from food and nutrition 
security programmes. 
</p>
<p>81. A national framework law could help the Government ensure that policies and 
programmes are effectively geared towards addressing the actual needs of 
beneficiaries/rights holders, in line with the rights-based approach adopted in recent 
strategy papers aimed at improving &#8220;accountability of service providers to rights holders&#8221;.46 
To achieve this, a transformation of mindsets will also be required, moving towards an 
understanding of food security and social support interventions in terms of human rights 
rather than handouts. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur suggests that consideration be given to establishing a trust 
fund, which could be overseen by a national food security council or a similar body which 
would be created under a national food security act. Such a fund could be gradually 
financed by revenues from investments made in the country and would finance policies

<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establish a framework law on the right to food, building on the draft 
food security bill, through a consultative process with relevant stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen the integration of a gender perspective into food and

</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Improve mechanisms and methodologies for the collection of adequately 
disaggregated data on poverty and food insecurity, with a view to improving the 
accuracy and reliability of different national surveys; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Review and reform current agricultural input support programmes, in 
particular the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP), aimed at supporting 
smallholder farmers and addressing food insecurity, bearing in mind the five 
transformations outlined in the present report concerning the need to:

<p><b>(i) Recognize the links between agriculture, nutrition and health, moving 
beyond the current &#8220;maize economy&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Initiate concerted national efforts to support farmers in improving soil 
fertility, to promote a &#8220;brown revolution&#8221; to improve soil fertility leading to an 
exit strategy from FISP, with significant multiplier effects in terms of 
productivity, nutrition and employment;

<p><b>(iii) Promote a &#8220;blue revolution&#8221; to support farmers in improving water 
management, and scale up sustainable irrigation methods; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Scale up agricultural extension services, ensuring that they reach the 
most vulnerable farmers, affirmatively reach out to women farmers and 
support the necessary transformations of agricultural production;
