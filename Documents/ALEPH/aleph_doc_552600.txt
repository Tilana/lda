SEPARATION AGREEMENT
This Separation Agreement (this “Agreement”) is dated as of June 25, 2014, by and between Nabors Industries Ltd., a
Bermuda exempted company (“Navy”) and Nabors Red Lion Limited, a Bermuda exempted company and currently a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Navy (“Red Lion”).  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Article VI.
RECITALS
1.             Navy is engaged, directly and indirectly, in the Red Lion Business;
2.             As a condition to the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof, among
Navy, Red Lion and C&J Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Penny”) (the “Merger Agreement”), Navy is
required to separate the Red Lion Business from the other businesses of Navy;
3.             The Board of Directors of Navy has determined that it would be in the best interests of Navy and its
shareholders to separate the Red Lion Business from the other businesses of Navy and enter into the Merger
Agreement;
4.             Navy currently owns all of the issued and outstanding common shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Red
Lion (the “Red Lion Common Shares”);
5.             Navy and Red Lion have each determined that it would be appropriate and desirable for Navy, Red Lion and
Red Lion’s Subsidiaries to undergo a restructuring (the “Red Lion Restructuring” which, for the avoidance of doubt,
does not include the incurrence of the Red Lion Financing or the entry into the Debt Financing Agreements, the Note
Repayment, the consummation of the Merger or any events occurring following the Effective Time), which will include
certain distributions that are intended to qualify as a series of distributions subject to Sections 332, 351, 355 and 368
of the Code or, in the case of restructuring Red Lion Assets located in Canada, a sale subject to Section 1001 of the
Code, as a result of which the Red Lion Group will, directly or indirectly, own solely Navy’s well services and
completion business in Canada (the “Canada Completion Business”) and well services and completion business in the
United States (the “U.S. Completion Business,” and together with the Canada Completion Business, the “Red Lion
Business”), and the distribution to Navy certain entities not engaged in the Red Lion Business, such that following the
Red Lion Restructuring, Red Lion’s remaining assets and liabilities will consist solely of the Red Lion Business, and
Navy will be issued additional Red Lion Common Shares;
6.             Navy and Red Lion contemplate that, concurrently with or immediately following the Red Lion Restructuring
as further described herein, USHC will incur indebtedness (as defined in the Merger Agreement, the “Red Lion
Financing”), and will enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto (the “Debt Financing Agreements”), to be
used to fund the repayment of certain intercompany notes (collectively, the “Notes”) with an aggregate face amount of
$829,820,225 to be issued to Nabors Industries Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Indigo”) and/or one or more other Navy
Subsidiaries, and $108,250,000 to be issued to Nabors Drilling Canada Limited, an Alberta Corporation (“Alberta”), (the
“Note Repayment,” and the
Red Lion Financing, and the entry into the Debt Financing Agreements, together with the Red Lion Share Issuance,
collectively, the “Recapitalization”);
7.             This Agreement is intended to be a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g) with respect to the Recapitalization;
8.             Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, a corporation to be organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware that will be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Red Lion (“Merger Sub”) will merge with and into
Penny (the “Merger”), with Penny surviving the Merger as a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Red Lion and each
common share, par value $0.01 per share, of Penny (“Penny Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive one Red Lion Common Share on the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement;
9.             Immediately after the Merger, Red Lion will transfer Penny to a limited liability company to be organized
under the laws of Luxembourg and wholly owned by Red Lion (“LuxCo”), thereafter LuxCo will transfer Penny to a
corporation to be organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of LuxCo
(“USHC”); and
10.          The Parties intend in this Agreement to set forth the principal arrangements between them regarding the Red
Lion Restructuring and the Recapitalization, and certain other agreements that will govern certain matters relating to
the Red Lion Restructuring and the Recapitalization and the relationship of Navy, Red Lion and their respective
Subsidiaries.
Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
THE RED LION RESTRUCTURING
Section 1.1            Transfer of Red Lion Assets; Assumption of Red Lion Liabilities.  Except as provided in
Section 1.7(b), effective as of the Separation Time, to the extent not previously effected by restructuring the Red Lion
Group to the structure set forth on Schedule 1.1 prior to the Separation Time (including the steps set forth on

(a)           Navy will assign, transfer, convey and deliver (“Convey”) (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary to Convey)
to Red Lion, or a Red Lion Entity, and Red Lion will accept from Navy (or the applicable Subsidiary of Navy) (or will
cause any applicable Red Lion Entity to accept) all of Navy’s and its applicable Subsidiaries’ respective direct or
indirect right, title and interest in and to all Red Lion Assets (other than any Red Lion Assets that are already held as
of the Separation Time by Red Lion or a Red Lion Entity, which Red Lion Asset will continue to be held by Red Lion or
such Red Lion Entity); and
(b)           Navy will Convey (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary to Convey) to Red Lion or a Red Lion Entity, and
Red Lion will assume, perform, discharge and fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply with (or will cause
any applicable Red
2
Lion Entity to assume, perform, discharge and fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply with) all of the
Red Lion Liabilities, in accordance with their respective terms (other than any Red Lion Liabilities that as of the
Separation Time is already a Liability of Red Lion or a Red Lion Entity, which Red Lion Liability will continue to be a
Liability of Red Lion or such Red Lion Entity).  As between members of the Navy Group, on the one hand, and
members of the Red Lion Group, on the other hand, following the Separation Time, the members of the Red Lion
Group will be solely responsible for all Red Lion Liabilities, on a joint and several basis.
Section 1.2            Transfer of Excluded Assets; Assumption of Excluded Liabilities.  Except as provided in
Section 1.7(b), prior to the Separation Time, to the extent not previously effected:
(a)           Navy will cause any applicable member or members of the Red Lion Group to Convey to Navy or a Subsidiary
of Navy, and Navy will accept from such applicable member or members of the Red Lion Group (or will cause any
applicable Subsidiary of Navy to accept) all of such member’s or members’ direct or indirect right, title and interest in
and to all Excluded Assets; and
(b)           Navy will cause any applicable member or members of the Red Lion Group to Convey to Navy or a Subsidiary
of Navy, and Navy will assume, perform, discharge and fulfill when due, and to the extent applicable, comply with (or
will cause the applicable Subsidiary of Navy to assume, perform, discharge and fulfill when due, and to the extent
applicable, comply with) all of the Excluded Liabilities, in accordance with their respective terms.  As between
members of the Navy Group, on the one hand, and members of the Red Lion Group, on the other hand, following the
Separation Time, the members of the Navy Group will be solely responsible for all Excluded Liabilities, on a joint and
several basis.
Section 1.3            Misallocated Transfers.  In the event that at any time or from time to time (whether prior to, at or
after the Separation Time), either Party (or any member of the Navy Group or the Red Lion Group, as applicable) is
the owner of, receives or otherwise comes to possess any Asset (including the receipt of payments made pursuant to
Contracts and proceeds from accounts receivable) or Liability that is allocated to any Person that is a member of the
other Group pursuant to this Agreement (except in the case of any acquisition of Assets from the other Party for value
subsequent to the Separation Time), such Party will promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such Asset or
Liability to the Person so entitled thereto.  Prior to any such transfer, such Asset or Liability will be held in accordance
with Section 1.7(c).
Section 1.4            Red Lion Assets; Excluded Assets.
(a)           For purposes of this Agreement, “Red Lion Assets” mean the following Assets:

(ix) and including those arising under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement against any Navy Group member;
(x)                                                                     all Intellectual Property owned by Navy that is primarily used or held for use in

(xi)                                                                  all motor vehicles and other transportation equipment, computers and other

tangible tools, prototypes, models, and other tangible personal property that are, in each case, used or held for use
primarily in the Red Lion Business, including those listed or described in Schedule 1.4(a)(xi);
(xii)                                                               all inventories of materials, parts, raw materials, packaging materials, stores,

expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as Assets that have been or that are to be
Conveyed to Red Lion or any other member of the Red Lion Group; and
(xv)                                                              any and all other Assets (other than Excluded Assets) owned that are used or
held for use primarily in, or related primarily to, the Red Lion Business.  The intention of this clause (xv) is only to
rectify any inadvertent omission of Conveyance of any Assets that, had the Parties given specific consideration to
such Asset as of the date of this Agreement, would have otherwise been classified as a Red Lion Asset.  No Asset
will be deemed a Red Lion Asset solely as a result of this clause (xv) unless a claim with respect thereto is made by
Red Lion on or prior to the one-year anniversary of the Separation Time.
A single Asset may fall within more than one of clauses (i) through (xv) in this Section 1.4(a); such fact does not
imply that (x) such Asset must be Conveyed more than once or (y) any duplication of such Asset is required.  The
fact that an Asset may be excluded under one clause does not imply that it is not intended to be included under
another.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), the Red Lion Assets will not in any event include any of
the following Assets (the “Excluded Assets”):
5
(i)                                                                         any cash or cash equivalents withdrawn from any Red Lion Accounts prior to
the Separation Time;
(ii)                                                                      except to the extent provided in Section 4.7, all insurance policies, binders and
claims and rights thereunder and all prepaid insurance premiums;
(iii)                                                                   all Red Lion Employee Benefit Plans (whether or not listed in Section 4.2(j)(i) of
the Navy Disclosure Letter to the Merger Agreement) or any other compensation or benefit plans, agreements or
arrangements of the Navy Group, all trusts, trust assets, trust accounts, reserves, insurance policies and other
assets held in connection therewith, and all data and records required to administer the benefits under any of the
foregoing;
(iv)                                                                  the Assets of any member of the Navy Group not included in any of the clauses
in Section 1.4(a) above;
(v)                                                                     all rights to causes of action, lawsuits, judgments, claims and demands to the
extent related to an Excluded Action or to any Divested Business;
(vi)                                                                  any Contracts not related primarily to the Red Lion Business (including such
contracts to which, prior to the closing, both members of the Navy Group and members of the Red Lion Group are a
party); and
(vii)                                                               the Assets listed or described on Schedule 1.4(b)(vii), and any and all other
Assets that are expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as Assets to be retained by
Navy or any other member of the Navy Group.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Red Lion nor any of its Subsidiaries will acquire or be permitted to
retain any direct or indirect right, title and interest in any Excluded Assets through the Conveyance of the Red Lion
Entity Interests, and that if any of the Red Lion Entities owns, leases or has the right to use any such Excluded
Assets, such Excluded Assets must be Conveyed to Navy as contemplated by Section 1.2(a).
Section 1.5                                    Red Lion Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities.
(a)                                 For the purposes of this Agreement, “Red Lion Liabilities” means (regardless of (1) whether the
facts on which such Liabilities are based occurred prior to, at or subsequent to the Separation Time, (2) whether or not
such Liabilities are asserted or determined prior to, at or subsequent to the Separation Time, (3) where or against
whom such Liabilities are asserted or determined, and (4) whether or not such Liabilities arise from or are alleged to
arise from negligence by any member of the Navy Group or the Red Lion Group (including any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, Subsidiaries or Affiliates)) the following Liabilities (unless such Liability is an
Excluded Liability, in which case it shall not be a Red Lion Liability):
(i)                                                                         any and all Liabilities that are (A) expressly contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement (or the Schedules hereto or thereto) to be assumed by any member of the Red Lion
Group, (B) expressly assumed by any member of the Red Lion
6
Group under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements, or (C) set forth on Schedule 1.5(a)(i);
(ii)                                                                      any Liabilities to the extent arising from any of the Contracts set forth in
Schedule 1.5(a)(ii);
(iii)                                                                   all Liabilities to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from any Red
Lion Assets;
(iv)                                                                  all trade and other accounts payable related primarily to the Red Lion Business;
(v)                                                                     all operating expenses and other current Liabilities (including Liabilities for
services and goods for which an invoice has not been received prior to the Separation Time) related primarily to the
Red Lion Business;
(vi)                                                                  subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.7, all Liabilities under the Red
Lion Contracts;
(vii)                                                               all Liabilities with respect to any return, rebate, discount, credit, recall warranty,
customer program, or similar Liabilities relating primarily to products of the Red Lion Business;
(viii)                                                            all Liabilities for death, personal injury, advertising injury, other injury to persons or
property damage relating to, resulting from, caused by or arising out of, directly or indirectly, use of or exposure to any
of the products (or any part or component) designed, manufactured, serviced or sold, or services performed, by, or on
behalf of, the Red Lion Business, including any such Liabilities for negligence, strict liability, design or manufacturing
defect, failure to warn, or breach of express or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose or use;
(ix)                                                                  all Liabilities under the Notes, the Red Lion Financing and Debt Financing
Agreements;
(x)                                                                     all Liabilities, other than Excluded Liabilities, to the extent arising out of or
resulting from:
(A)                               the operation of the Red Lion Business or the ownership or use of the Red Lion Assets at any time
before, at or after the Separation Time by any member of the Red Lion Group, Penny Group or any of their respective
predecessors or, prior to the Separation Time, any member of the Navy Group or any of their predecessors; or
(B)                               the operation of any other business conducted by any member of the Red Lion Group or the Penny
Group at any time after the Separation Time (including any Liability relating to, arising out of or resulting from any act
or failure to act by any director, officer, employee, agent or representative of any
7
member of the Red Lion Group (whether or not such act or failure to act is or was within such Person’s authority));
(xi)                                                                  all Liabilities, other than Excluded Liabilities, arising pursuant to Environmental
Law to the extent arising out of or resulting from the Red Lion Business;
(xii)                                                               all Liabilities that are expressly provided by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement as Liabilities to be assumed or retained by, or allocated to, any member of the Red Lion Group; and
(xiii)                                                            all Liabilities of any member of the Red Lion Group or Penny Group under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.
A single Liability may fall within more than one of clauses (i) through (xiii) in this Section 1.5(a); such fact does not
imply that (x) such Liability must be Conveyed more than once or (y) any duplication of such Liability is required.  The
fact that a Liability may be excluded under one clause does not imply that it is not intended to be included under
another.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), the Red Lion Liabilities will not in any event include any
of the following Liabilities (the “Excluded Liabilities”):
(i)                                                                         all Liabilities to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from any
Excluded Assets;
(ii)                                                                      the Liabilities listed on Schedule 1.5(b)(ii) and any and all other Liabilities that
are expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to be retained or assumed by Navy or any
other member of the Navy Group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Liabilities for pre-Closing Taxes to the
extent such Taxes are not accrued and reflected in the Working Capital adjustment pursuant to Section 2.7, except as
expressly contemplated by the Tax Matters Agreement), and all agreements and obligations of any member of the
Navy Group under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;
(iii)                                                                   all Liabilities arising out of any Action pending or asserted in writing as of the
Separation Time other than those Actions set forth on Schedule 1.5(a)(i) (the “Excluded Actions”);
(iv)                                                                  all Liabilities arising out of claims made by the respective directors, officers,
shareholders, stockholders, employees, agents, Subsidiaries or Affiliates of either Group against any member of
either Group to the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Non-Red Lion Business or the other
businesses, operations, activities or Liabilities referred to in clause (i) above;
(v)                                                                     any Liabilities relating to or arising out of any Divested Business (including all
Liabilities with respect to any Asset included in the sale of the Divested Business, any products designed,
manufactured, serviced or sold by, or services performed by, the Divested Business);
8
(vi)                                                                  all Liabilities arising out of any Action pending or asserted in writing as of the
Separation Time with respect to any Environmental Condition at any property owned or leased by Navy or any of its
Affiliates at or prior to the Separation Time (the “Excluded Environmental Liabilities”);
(vii)                                                               all Liabilities that would be classified as indebtedness under United States
generally accepted accounting principles other than the Notes, the Red Lion Financing and Debt Financing
Agreements; and
(viii)                                                            any and all Liabilities of any member of the Navy Group not included in any of the
clauses in Section 1.5(a).
The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Red Lion nor any other member of the Red Lion Group will be required
to assume or retain any Excluded Liabilities as a result of the Conveyance of the Red Lion Entity Interests, and that if
any of the Red Lion Entities is liable for any Excluded Liabilities, such Excluded Liabilities will be assumed by Navy
as contemplated by Section 1.2(b).
Section 1.6                                    Termination of Intercompany Agreements; Settlement of Intercompany Accounts.
(a)                                 Termination of Intercompany Agreements.  Except as set forth in Section 1.6(b) and
Section 1.6(c), Red Lion, on behalf of itself and each other member of the Red Lion Group, on the one hand, and
Navy, on behalf of itself and each other member of the Navy Group, on the other hand, will terminate, effective as of
the Separation Time, any and all Contracts between or among Red Lion or any member of the Red Lion Group, on the
one hand, and Navy or any member of the Navy Group, on the other hand.  No such Contract (including any provision
thereof which purports to survive termination) will be of any further force or effect after the Separation Time and all
parties will be released from all Liabilities thereunder.  Each Party will, at the reasonable request of any other Party,
take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be necessary to effect the foregoing.
(b)                                 Exceptions to Termination of Intercompany Agreements.  The provisions of Section 1.6(a) will not
apply to any of the following Contracts (or to any of the provisions thereof):
(i)                                                                         any Contracts listed or described on Schedule 1.6(b)(i);
(ii)                                                                      this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (and
each other Contract expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
be entered into by any of the Parties or any of the members of their respective Groups);
(iii)                                                                   the Notes;
(iv)                                                                  any Contracts to which any Person other than the Parties and their respective
Affiliates is a party (it being understood that to the extent that the rights and Liabilities of the Parties and the members
of their respective Groups under any such Contracts
9
constitute Red Lion Assets or Red Lion Liabilities, they will be Conveyed pursuant to Section 1.1(a) or Section 1.1(b),
or allocated pursuant to Section 1.7(c)); and
(v)                                                                     any Contracts to which any non-wholly owned Subsidiary of Navy or Red Lion,
as the case may be, is a party (it being understood that (x) directors’ qualifying shares or similar interests will be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether a Subsidiary is wholly owned and (y) to the extent that the rights and
Liabilities of the Parties and the members of their respective Groups under any such Contracts constitute Red Lion
Assets or Red Lion Liabilities, they will be Conveyed pursuant to Section 1.1(a) or Section 1.1(b), or allocated
pursuant to Section 1.7(c)).
(c)                                  Settlement of Intercompany Accounts.  Except as provided in Section 1.12, all of the
intercompany receivables, payables, loans and other accounts between Red Lion or any member of the Red Lion
Group, on the one hand, and Navy or any member of the Navy Group, on the other hand, in existence as of
immediately prior to the Separation Time (collectively, the “Intercompany Accounts”) will be settled at or prior to the
Separation Time.
Section 1.7                                    Governmental Approvals and Third-Party Consents.
(a)                                 Obtaining Consents.  To the extent that the consummation of the Red Lion Restructuring requires
any third-party Consents or Governmental Approvals, subject to the next two sentences, the Parties will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents or Governmental Approvals, as soon as
reasonably practicable, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.7(b).  However, unless required to do so in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, Navy will under no circumstance be required to
make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the
contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the securing or posting of any bonds, letters of
credit or similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any third party to obtain any Consent or
Governmental Approvals unless and to the extent that Red Lion or Penny agrees to reimburse and make whole Navy
to Navy’s reasonable satisfaction for any payment or other accommodation made by Navy at Red Lion’s request. 
Red Lion hereby agrees to reimburse and make whole Navy to Navy’s reasonable satisfaction any payment or other
accommodation made by Navy in respect of the third-party Consents or Governmental Approvals specifically
identified as a “Required Consent” on Schedule 1.7 in an aggregate amount not exceeding that amount set forth in
Schedule 1.7.  Red Lion agrees that in the event that any third party or Governmental Authority requests that Navy
make a payment or offer or grant an accommodation to obtain a third-party Consents or Governmental Approvals and
Red Lion does not agree to reimburse or make whole Navy in connection therewith, Red Lion shall not be entitled to
the benefits of the provision in, Navy will not be obligated to take any efforts under, Section 1.7(c) in respect of any
Red Lion Asset, Red Lion Liability, Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability which Conveyance is subject to such third-
party Consents or Governmental Approvals.  For the avoidance of doubt, the required efforts and responsibilities of
the Parties (i) to seek the Consents necessary to provide the Services (as defined in the Red Lion TSA) will be
governed by Article III of the Red Lion TSA and (ii) to seek the Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) and the Required Penny Vote (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be governed by the
Merger Agreement.  The obligations set forth in this
10
Section 1.7(a) will terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Separation Time (except for any such Consent or
Governmental Approvals as are in the process of being obtained on such date, as to which such obligations will
continue).
(b)                                 Transfer in Violation of Laws or Requiring Consent or Governmental Approval.  If and to the extent
that the valid, complete and perfected Conveyance to the Red Lion Group of any Red Lion Asset or Red Lion Liability,
or to the Navy Group of any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, would be a violation of applicable Laws or require
any Consent or Governmental Approval in connection with the Red Lion Restructuring or the Recapitalization, then
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Conveyance to the Red Lion Group of any such Red Lion Asset or Red
Lion Liability, or to the Navy Group of any such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, will automatically be deferred,
and no Conveyance will occur until all legal or contractual impediments are removed or such Consents or
Governmental Approvals have been obtained.  Any Asset or Liability which Conveyance has been so deferred will still
be considered a Red Lion Asset, a Red Lion Liability, an Excluded Asset, or an Excluded Liability, as applicable, and
will be subject to Section 1.7(c).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Navy or Red Lion may elect to require the immediate
Conveyance of any Red Lion Asset, Red Lion Liability, Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability notwithstanding any
requirement that an immaterial Consent or immaterial Governmental Approval be obtained; provided that (i) if Red Lion
so elects to require the immediate Conveyance of any such Asset or Liability, any Liabilities arising from such
Conveyance will be deemed to be Red Lion Liabilities, (ii) if Navy so elects to require the immediate Conveyance of
any such Asset or Liability, any Liabilities arising from such Conveyance will be deemed to be Excluded Liabilities,
and (iii) if Red Lion and Navy jointly agree to immediately Convey such Asset or Liability, any Liabilities arising from
such Conveyance will be shared evenly between Red Lion and Navy and, notwithstanding any provision in
Section 3.5(b) to the contrary, the defense of any Third-Party Claim relating thereto will be jointly managed by Red
Lion and Navy.  The Parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain any Consents or
Governmental Approvals as required by Section 1.7(a) and to take the actions required by Section 1.7(c) pending
removal of legal or contractual impediments or receipt of Consents or Governmental Approvals.  If and when the legal
or contractual impediments the presence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset or Liability pursuant to
this Section 1.7(b) are removed or any Consents and/or Governmental Approvals the absence of which caused the
deferral of transfer of any Asset or Liability pursuant to this Section 1.7(b) are obtained, the transfer of the applicable
Asset or Liability will be effected promptly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable
Ancillary Agreement(s).  The obligations set forth in this Section 1.7(b) will terminate on the one-year anniversary of
the Separation Time (except to the extent of any Conveyance for which impediments are being removed or Consents
or Governmental Approvals as are in the process of being obtained on such date, as to which such obligations will
continue).
(c)                                  Conveyances Not Consummated Prior To or At the Separation Time.  Subject to the third
sentence of Section 1.7(a), if the Conveyance of any Asset or Liability intended to be Conveyed is not consummated
prior to or at the Separation Time, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 1.7(b) or for any other reason
(including any misallocated transfers subject to Section 1.3), then, insofar as reasonably possible (taking into account
any applicable restrictions or considerations relating to the contemplated Tax treatment of the Transactions) and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Person retaining such Asset or Liability, as the
11
case may be, (i) will thereafter hold such Asset or Liability, as the case may be, in trust for the use and benefit and
burden of the Person entitled thereto (and at such Person’s sole expense) until the consummation of the Conveyance
thereof (or as otherwise determined by Navy and Red Lion, as applicable, in accordance with Section 1.7(b)), and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to
whom such Asset or Liability is to be Conveyed (at the expense of the Person holding such Asset or Liability, as the
case may be) in order to place such Person in substantially the same position as if such Asset or Liability had been
Conveyed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset or Liability, as the
case may be, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, any Tax liabilities in respect thereof and
dominion, control and command over such Asset or Liability, as the case may be, are to inure from and after the
Separation Time to the Person to whom such Asset or Liability is to be Conveyed.  Any Person retaining an Asset or
a Liability due to the deferral of the Conveyance of such Asset or Liability, as the case may be, will not be required, in
connection with the foregoing, to make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise,
regardless of any provision to the contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the securing or
posting of any bonds, letters of credit or similar instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any third party,
except to the extent that the Person entitled to the Asset or responsible for the Liability, as applicable, agrees to
reimburse and make whole the Person retaining an Asset or a Liability, to such Person’s reasonable satisfaction, for
any payment or other accommodation made by the Person retaining an Asset or a Liability at the request of the
Person entitled to the Asset or responsible for the Liability.  The obligations set forth in this Section 1.7(c) will
terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Separation Time (except of any such Conveyances as are in the process
of being consummated on such date, as to which such obligations will continue).
Section 1.8                                    No Representation or Warranty.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE PROVIDED
FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, RED LION (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND
MEMBERS OF THE RED LION GROUP) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NONE OF NAVY NOR ANY MEMBER OF THE
NAVY GROUP MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY HEREIN AS TO ANY
MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO:  (A) THE
CONDITION OR THE VALUE OF ANY RED LION ASSET OR THE AMOUNT OF ANY RED LION LIABILITY;
(B) THE FREEDOM FROM ANY SECURITY INTEREST OF ANY RED LION ASSET; (C) THE ABSENCE OF
DEFENSES OR FREEDOM FROM COUNTERCLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM TO BE CONVEYED TO
RED LION OR HELD BY A MEMBER OF THE RED LION GROUP; OR (D) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR TITLE.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, RED LION (ON
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND MEMBERS OF THE RED LION GROUP) FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL
OTHER WARRANTIES THAT NAVY OR ANY MEMBER OF THE NAVY GROUP GAVE OR MIGHT HAVE GIVEN,
OR WHICH MIGHT BE PROVIDED OR IMPLIED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR COMMERCIAL PRACTICE, ARE
HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR IN THE MERGER
12
AGREEMENT, ALL ASSETS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO RED LION (AND ALL OF THE RED LION ASSETS HELD
BY THE RED LION ENTITIES) WILL BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT ANY COVENANT, REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) AND ARE HELD “AS IS, WHERE IS” AND FROM AND AFTER
THE CLOSING RED LION WILL BEAR THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL RISK THAT ANY CONVEYANCE WILL
PROVE TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO VEST IN RED LION GOOD AND MARKETABLE TITLE, FREE AND CLEAR OF
ANY SECURITY INTEREST OR ANY NECESSARY CONSENTS OR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS THAT ARE
NOT OBTAINED OR THAT ANY REQUIREMENTS OF LAWS ARE NOT COMPLIED WITH.
Section 1.9                                    Waiver of Bulk-Sales Laws.  Each Party hereby waives compliance by each member of
their respective Group with the requirements and provisions of the “bulk-sale” or “bulk-transfer” Laws of any jurisdiction
that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the transfer or sale of any or all of the Assets to any member of the
Navy Group or Red Lion Group, as applicable.
Section 1.10                             Real Property Leases; Guarantees.
(a)                                 On or prior to the Separation Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, Red Lion will, at the
direction and expense of Navy, use its reasonable best efforts to have any member(s) of the Navy Group removed as
guarantor of or obligor for any Red Lion Liability to the extent that they relate to Red Lion Liabilities (with the
reasonable cooperation of the applicable member(s) of the Navy Group).
(b)                                 On or prior to the Separation Time, to the extent required to obtain a release from an agreement
(including any lease of a Real Property Interest) or a guarantee (each, a “Guarantee Release”) of any member of the
Navy Group, Red Lion will use its reasonable best efforts to execute a guarantee agreement in the form of the existing
agreement or guarantee or such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such agreement or guarantee.
(c)                                  If the Parties are unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required removal as set
forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 1.10, (i) Red Lion will, and will cause the other members of the Red Lion
Group (including after the Effective Time, the Penny Group) to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Navy
Indemnitees for any Liability arising from or relating to such agreement or guarantee and will, as agent or
subcontractor for the applicable Navy Group guarantor or obligor, pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or
other Liabilities of such guarantor or obligor thereunder when due, and (ii) Red Lion will not, and will cause the other
members of the Red Lion Group not to, agree to renew or extend the term of, increase any obligations under, or
transfer to a third Person, any loan, guarantee, lease, contract or other obligation for which a member of the Navy
Group is or may be liable unless all obligations of the members of the Navy Group with respect thereto are thereupon
terminated by documentation satisfactory in form and substance to Navy in its sole discretion.
(d)                                 On or prior to the Separation Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, Navy will, at its expense,
use its reasonable best efforts to have any member(s) of the Red Lion Group removed as guarantor of or obligor for
any Excluded Liability to the extent that they relate to
13
Excluded Liabilities (with the reasonable cooperation of the applicable member(s) of the Red Lion Group or Penny
Group).
(e)                                  On or prior to the Separation Time, to the extent required to obtain a Guarantee Release of any
member of the Red Lion Group, Navy will use its reasonable best efforts to execute a guarantee agreement in the
form of the existing agreement or guarantee or such other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such
agreement or guarantee.
(f)                                   If the Parties are unable to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any such required removal as set
forth in clauses (d) and (e) of this Section 1.10, (i) Navy will, and will cause the other members of the Navy Group to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Red Lion Indemnitees for any Liability arising from or relating to such
agreement or guarantee and will, as agent or subcontractor for the applicable Red Lion Group guarantor or obligor,
pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations or other Liabilities of such guarantor or obligor thereunder when
due, and (ii) Navy will not, and will cause the other members of the Navy Group not to, agree to renew or extend the
term of, increase any obligations under, or transfer to a third Person, any loan, guarantee, lease, contract or other
obligation for which a member of the Red Lion Group is or may be liable unless all obligations of the members of the
Red Lion Group with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation satisfactory in form and substance to
Red Lion in its sole discretion.
Section 1.11                             Exemption Certificates.  Navy will cause Red Lion or a Subsidiary of Red Lion, as
applicable, to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Navy on or before the Separation Date properly
executed resale exemption certificates and requisite tax registration numbers for the Red Lion Inventory (and, where
relevant in accordance with applicable local Law, for any tangible personal property and any other Red Lion Assets),
and such other certificates and documentation as may be required to reasonably evidence any exemption from
transfer Taxes.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, as applicable, are and remain responsible for all transfer
Taxes in accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement.
Section 1.12                             Note Repayment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Notes will survive
the Separation Time.  At the Closing, if the full proceeds of the Red Lion Financing are available to USHC, USHC will
make the Note Repayment to Indigo and Alberta, as applicable.
ARTICLE II
CLOSING OF THE RED LION RESTRUCTURING;
POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT
Section 2.1                                    Separation Time.  Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction and waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 2.2, the effective time and
date of each Conveyance and assumption of any Asset or Liability in accordance with Article I in connection with the
Red Lion Restructuring will be no later than 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the Business Day anticipated to precede the
Closing Date (such time, the “Separation Time,” and such date, the “Separation Date”).
14
Section 2.2                                    Conditions to the Red Lion Restructuring.  The obligations of Navy pursuant to this
Agreement to effect the Red Lion Restructuring are subject to the fulfillment (or waiver by Navy) at or prior to the
Separation Time of the condition that each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has irrevocably confirmed to each
other that each condition in Article VII of the Merger Agreement (other than Sections 7.1(f) and 7.2(f) thereto) to such
party’s respective obligations to effect the Merger (i) has been fulfilled, (ii) will be fulfilled at the Effective Time, or
(iii) is or has been waived by such party in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the case may be;
provided, however, that unless the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, any
such waiver shall be subject to the written consent of Penny.
Section 2.3                                    Recapitalization of Red Lion.  In connection with the Conveyance of Assets
contemplated by Section 1.1, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Red Lion will issue to Navy or one of its wholly
owned Subsidiaries a number of Red Lion Common Shares such that the total number of Red Lion Common Shares
owned by Navy and its Subsidiaries immediately thereafter (the “Red Lion Share Issuance”) will equal (a) the Penny
Base Share Number, divided by (b) .4975, multiplied by (c) .5025.  Subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.3,
the “Penny Base Share Number” shall equal 61,920,092, which, as calculated on Schedule 2.3, represents the sum
of:
(i)                                     the total number of shares of Penny Common Stock (including Restricted Penny Shares,
whether or not vested) outstanding as of the date hereof multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;
(ii)                                  the total number of shares of Penny Common Stock subject to issuance upon the exercise or
payment of any Penny Stock Options (whether vested or unvested) outstanding as of the date hereof multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio;
(iii)                               the total number of shares of Penny Common Stock that would be issued (including Restricted
Penny Shares, whether or not vested) or would be subject to issuance upon the exercise or payment of Penny Stock
Options (whether vested or unvested) if Penny issued all of the Penny Stock Options and/or Restricted Penny Shares
that it is permitted to issue pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii) of the Merger Agreement multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;
(iv)                              the total number of Red Lion Common Shares subject to issuance upon the exercise or payment of
options or other rights to acquire Red Lion Common Shares expected to be issued to employees of Penny or Red Lion
in connection with the Merger, whether before, at or after the Effective Time (other than Adjusted Options and Navy
Adjusted Options);
(v)                                 the total number of shares of Red Lion Common Shares that will be subject to issuance upon the
exercise or payment of any Navy Adjusted Options (whether vested or unvested) at the Effective Time if all of the
Navy Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof that are subject to conversion into Navy Adjusted Options at
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.4(a) of the Merger Agreement are so converted; and
15
(vi)                              the total number of Adjusted Navy Restricted Shares, whether vested or unvested, that will be
outstanding at the Effective Time if all of the Restricted Navy Shares outstanding as of the date hereof and subject to
conversion into Adjusted Navy Restricted Shares at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.4(b) of the Merger
Agreement are so converted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if the parties reasonably determine that the calculation set forth on Schedule 2.3 is
erroneous (whether because of a computational error, an error in counting the correct number of shares or other
instruments, or any other reason) such that Navy has not been issued shares equal the number of shares intended by
this Section 2.3, then the parties shall amend Schedule 2.3 to correct such error and the Penny Base Share Number
shall be modified accordingly, (y) if Penny issues any shares of Penny Common Stock (including Restricted Penny
Shares, whether or not vested), Penny Stock Options or other capital stock or securities, or Red Lion issues (with
Penny’s consent if occurring prior to the Effective Time) any options or other rights to acquire Red Lion Common
Shares to employees of Penny or Red Lion in connection with the Merger, in either case from and after the date
hereof (other than (A) in an issuance pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii) of the Merger Agreement that the Merger
Agreement expressly provides does not require the prior consent of Navy or (B) for shares already included in the
calculation pursuant to clause (iv) above), or (z) if Navy, with the consent of Penny, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, issues any Navy Stock Options or Restricted Navy Shares that are subject to conversion into
Navy Adjusted Options or Adjusted Navy Restricted Shares, respectively, at the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 2.4 of the Merger Agreement, then the Penny Base Share Number shall be increased by the number of such
shares issued or subject to issuance, as applicable, and if necessary additional Red Lion Common Shares will be
issued to Navy at or after the Effective Time, with effect retroactive to the Effective Time (including with respect to
distributions paid on such Red Lion Common Shares from and after the Effective Time), in each case so that Navy
has been issued shares equal to (a) the Penny Base Share Number as so revised, divided by (b) .4975, multiplied by
(c) .5025.
Section 2.4                                    Transfer of the Red Lion Business.

Ancillary Agreement, a counterpart of such Ancillary Agreement duly executed by the member of the Red Lion Group
party thereto; and
(ii)                                                                      all necessary Transfer Documents as described in Section 2.5 and Section 2.6.
Section 2.5                                    Transfer of Red Lion Assets and Assumption of Red Lion Liabilities.  In furtherance of
the Conveyance of Red Lion Assets and the assumption of Red Lion Liabilities as provided in Section 1.1:  (a) Navy
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries, to execute and deliver, such bills of sale, quitclaim deeds, stock powers,
certificates of title, assignments of contracts and other instruments of transfer, Conveyance and assignment, as and
to the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the Conveyance of all of Navy’s and its Subsidiaries’ (other than Red
Lion and its Subsidiaries) right, title and interest in and to the Red Lion Assets to Red Lion and its Subsidiaries and
(b) Red Lion will execute and deliver such assumptions of Contracts and other instruments of assumption as and to
the extent reasonably necessary to evidence the valid and effective assumption of the Red Lion Liabilities by Red
Lion.  All of the foregoing documents contemplated by this Section 2.5 will be referred to, collectively, herein as the
“Navy Transfer Documents.”  For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations with respect to the Conveyance of Red Lion
Assets and the assumption of Red Lion Liabilities provided in Section 1.1, and the execution and delivery of
documents provided in this Section 2.5, does not extend to the Conveyance of, or execution or delivery of documents
with respect to, any Red Lion Assets that are already held as of the Separation Time by Red Lion or a Red Lion Entity
(which Red Lion
17
Asset will continue to be held by Red Lion or such Red Lion Entity) or any Red Lion Liabilities that as of the
Separation Time is already a Liability of Red Lion or a Red Lion Entity (which Red Lion Liability will continue to be a
Liability of Red Lion or such Red Lion Entity).
Section 2.6                                    Transfer of Excluded Assets; Assumption of Excluded Liabilities.  In furtherance of the

such assumptions of Contracts and other instruments of assumption as and to the extent reasonably necessary to

Section 2.7                                    Working Capital Adjustment.
(a)                                 At least five days prior to the Separation Date, Red Lion will prepare and deliver to Navy a
statement setting forth a good-faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the “Estimated Closing
Adjustment Statement”).  On the Separation Date, (i) if the Estimated Adjustment Payment, if any, is positive, Red
Lion shall pay to Navy the Estimated Adjustment Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated by Navy and (ii) if the Estimated Adjustment Payment, if any, is negative, Navy shall pay to Red
Lion the absolute value of the Estimated Adjustment Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated by Red Lion.  The “Estimated Adjustment Payment” will be equal to the Adjustment Amount
set forth in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement.
(b)                                 Within 60 days following the Separation Date, Red Lion will prepare and deliver to Navy a
statement setting forth the Adjustment Amount (the “Closing Adjustment Statement”).  Upon the reasonable request of
Red Lion, Navy will provide (or will cause a member of the Navy Group to provide) to Red Lion and its accountants
access to the books and records, any other information, including working papers of its accountants, and to any
employees of Navy or any other member of the Navy Group necessary for Red Lion to prepare the Closing
Adjustment Statement, to respond to any Navy Objection and to prepare materials for presentation to the Accounting
Firm in connection with this Section 2.7 and Navy will otherwise cooperate with and assist Red Lion as may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 2.7.
(c)                                  For a period of 45 days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement, Red Lion will make
available to Navy all books, records, work papers, personnel (including their accountants and employees) and other
materials and sources used by Red Lion to prepare the Closing Adjustment Statement and not already in the
possession or under the control of Navy.  The Closing Adjustment Statement will be binding and conclusive upon, and
deemed accepted by, Navy unless Navy has notified Red Lion in writing within 45 days after delivery of the Closing
Adjustment Statement of any good faith objection thereto (the “Navy Objection”).  Any
18
Navy Objection will set forth a description of the basis of the Navy Objection and the adjustments to the line items
reflected on the Closing Adjustment Statement which Navy believes should be made.  Any items not disputed during
the foregoing 45-day period will be deemed to have been accepted by Navy.
(d)                                 If Navy and Red Lion are unable to resolve any of their disputes with respect to the Closing
Adjustment Statement within 30 days following Red Lion’s receipt of the Navy Objection to such Closing Adjustment
Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(c), they will refer their remaining differences to a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants as to which Navy and Red Lion mutually agree (the “Accounting Firm”) for a decision,
which decision will be final and binding on the Parties.  The Accounting Firm will act as an expert and not an arbitrator
and will address only those items in dispute, in accordance with any provisions or policies set forth herein and in the
Accounting Exhibit, and for each item may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either Party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party.  Any expenses relating to the
engagement of the Accounting Firm will be shared equally by Navy, on one hand, and Red Lion, on the other hand.
(e)                                  The Closing Adjustment Statement will become final and binding on the Parties upon the earliest
of (i) if no Navy Objection has been given, the expiration of the period within which Navy must make its objection
pursuant to Section 2.7(e), (ii) agreement in writing by Navy and Red Lion that the Closing Adjustment Statement,
together with any modifications thereto agreed by Navy and Red Lion, will be final and binding, and (iii) the date on
which the Accounting Firm issues its written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing
Adjustment Statement.  The Closing Adjustment Statement, as submitted by Red Lion if no timely Navy Objection
has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the Parties or as determined pursuant to the
decision of the Accounting Firm, when final and binding on all Parties and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction, is herein referred to as the “Final Closing Adjustment Statement.”
(f)                                                     Within five Business Days following issuance of the Final Closing Adjustment
Statement, the adjustment payment payable pursuant to this Section 2.7(f) (the “Adjustment Payment”) will be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Navy or Red Lion, as the case may be. 
The “Final Adjustment Payment” will be equal to the Adjustment Amount as reflected on the Final Adjustment
Statement.  The Adjustment Payment will be equal to the Final Adjustment Payment minus the Estimated Adjustment
Payment.  The Adjustment Payment, if any, will be payable by Red Lion to Navy, if positive, and if the Adjustment
Payment is negative, an amount equal to the absolute value of such Adjustment Payment will be payable by Navy to
Red Lion.  The Parties acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 2.7 are intended to implement the agreement
of the Parties that cash generated by the Red Lion Group through the Separation Time is for the benefit of Navy and
its shareholders.  The Parties further acknowledge that prior to the Separation Time they may cause cash of the Red
Lion Group to be transferred to Navy.

behalf of a member of the other Group;
20
(v)                                                                     any Liability that the Parties may have with respect to indemnification or
contribution pursuant to this Agreement, which Liability is governed by the provisions of this Article III, Section 4.2
and Section 4.3 and any applicable provisions of the Ancillary Agreements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Liability for pre-Closing Taxes governed by the Tax Matters Agreement) or the Merger Agreement; or
(vi)                                                                  any Liability the release of which would result in the release of any Person other
than a Person released pursuant to this Section 3.1.
(d)                                 No Actions as to Released Pre-Separation Time Claims.  Red Lion will not, and will cause its

claim of contribution or any indemnification, against Navy or any member of the Navy Group, or any other Person
released pursuant to Section 3.1(a), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 3.1(a).  Navy will not,
and will cause each other member of the Navy Group not to, make any claim or demand, or commence any Action

Party, each Party will cause each member of its respective Group to execute and deliver releases reflecting the
provisions hereof.
Section 3.2                                    Indemnification By the Red Lion Group.  Without limiting or otherwise affecting the
indemnity provisions of the Ancillary Agreements, from and after the Separation Time, Red Lion, and each member of
the Red Lion Group, will, on a joint and several basis, indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the defense costs
for) and hold harmless the Navy Indemnitees from and against, and will reimburse such Navy Indemnitees with
respect to, any and all Losses that result from, relate to or arise, whether prior to, at or following the Separation Time,
out of any of the following items (without duplication):
(a)                                 the Red Lion Liabilities and the Liabilities of the Red Lion Group, including the failure of Red Lion
or any other member of the Red Lion Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent
applicable, comply with, in due course and in full, any such Liabilities;
(b)                                 any guarantee, indemnification obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding for the benefit of any member of the Red Lion Group by Navy or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any member of the Red Lion Group) that survives following the Separation Time;
21
(c)                                  any breach by Red Lion or any other member of the Red Lion Group of any obligations to be
performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or the Employee Benefits Agreement subsequent to the
Separation Time; and
(d)                                 the enforcement by the Navy Indemnitees of their rights to be indemnified, defended and held
harmless under this Section 3.2.
Section 3.3                                    Indemnification By Navy.  Without limiting or otherwise affecting the indemnity
provisions of the Ancillary Agreements or the Merger Agreement, from and after the Separation Time, Navy, and each
member of the Navy Group, will, on a joint and several basis, indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the
defense costs for) and hold harmless the Red Lion Indemnitees from and against, and will reimburse such Red Lion
Indemnitee with respect to, any and all Losses that result from, relate to or arise, whether prior to or following the
Separation Time, out of any of the following items (without duplication):
(a)                                 the Excluded Liabilities and the Liabilities of the Navy Group, including the failure of Navy or any
other member of the Navy Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent applicable,
comply with, in due course and in full such Liabilities;
(b)                                 any guarantee, indemnification obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding for the benefit of any member of the Navy Group by Red Lion or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any member of the Navy Group) that survives following the Separation Time;
(c)                                  any breach by Navy or any other member of the Navy Group of any obligations to be performed
by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or the Employee Benefits Agreement subsequent to the Separation
Time;
(d)                                 the enforcement by the Red Lion Indemnitees of their rights to be indemnified, defended and held
harmless under this Section 3.3; and
(e)                                  the termination of, or failure to meet requirements under, the agreements set forth in Schedule
3.3(e).
Section 3.4                                    Payments; Reductions for Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries.
(a)                                 Payments.  Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification under this Article III will be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such
Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth
the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made
and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities.  The indemnity
agreements contained in this Article III will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee, (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Liabilities for which it
might be entitled to indemnification hereunder and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
22
(b)                                 Insurance Proceeds.  The amount that any Indemnifying Party is or may be required to provide
indemnification to or on behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 3.2 or Section 3.3, as applicable, will be reduced
(retroactively or prospectively) by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered from third parties
(including any captive insurance companies of the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates) by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee in respect of the related Loss (net of increased insurance premiums and charges related directly and
solely to the related indemnifiable Losses and costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with seeking to collect and collecting such amounts).  The existence of a
claim by an Indemnitee for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any indemnifiable Loss will
not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise
determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party.  Rather, the Indemnifying Party will make payment in full of
the amount determined to be due and owing by it against an assignment by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party
of the entire claim of the Indemnitee for Insurance Proceeds or against such third party.  Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any other third party will be (i) entitled
to a “windfall” or other benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification
provisions or otherwise have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any
claims for which it is obligated.
(c)                                  Tax Treatment of Payments.  In the absence of a Final Determination to the contrary, any amount
payable by Red Lion to Navy under this Agreement will be treated as occurring immediately prior to the Red Lion
Restructuring, as an inter-company distribution, and any amount payable by Navy to Red Lion under this Agreement
will be treated as occurring immediately prior to the Red Lion Restructuring, as a contribution to capital.
Section 3.5                                    Procedures for Defense, Settlement and Indemnification of Third-Party Claims.
(a)                                 Direct Claims.  Any claim on account of indemnifiable Losses that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim will be asserted by reasonably prompt written notice given by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party from
whom such indemnification is sought.  The failure by any Indemnitee so to give notice as provided in this
Section 3.5(a) will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article III, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.
(b)                                 Third-Party Claims.
(i)                                                                         Notice Of Claims.  If an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise learns of the
assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Navy Group or Red Lion
Group or any of their respective Affiliates of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action
with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification (collectively, a “Third-Party
Claim”), such Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice (a “Claims Notice”) thereof but in any
event within 15 calendar days after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim.  Any such notice will describe the
Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitee
23
relating to the Third-Party Claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee or other Person
to give notice as provided in this Section 3.5(b)(i) will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Article III, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such delay or failure to give
notice.
(ii)                                                                      Opportunity to Defend.  The Indemnifying Party has the right, exercisable by
written notice to the Indemnitee within 30 days after receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnitee of the
commencement or assertion of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this
Article III, to assume and conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this
Agreement with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; provided,
however, that the (A) defense of such Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not, in the reasonable judgment
of the Indemnitee, (1) if Navy is the Indemnifying Party, affect Penny or any of its Controlled Affiliates (including after
the Merger, any member of the Red Lion Group) in an adverse manner and (2) if Red Lion is the Indemnifying Party,
affect Navy or any of its Controlled Affiliates in an adverse manner; and (B) the Third-Party Claim solely seeks (and
continues to seek) monetary damages (the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) are, collectively, the “Litigation
Conditions”).  If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this
Section 3.5(b), the Indemnitee may continue to defend the Third-Party Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided in this Section 3.5(b), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that if (x) either of the Litigation Conditions ceases to be met or (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee may assume its own
defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection
with such defense.  The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee, as the case may be, has the right to participate in (but,
subject to the prior sentence, not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is
defending as provided in this Agreement.  The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party
Claim as provided in this Agreement, may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim that (I) does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnitee of a complete release from all
liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (II) provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the
Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or (III) in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, would otherwise adversely
affect the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates.  The Indemnitee may settle any Third-Party Claim, the defense of which
has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, only with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to
be unreasonably withheld.
Section 3.6                                    Additional Matters.
(a)                                 Cooperation in Defense and Settlement.  With respect to any Third-Party Claim for which Red
Lion, on the one hand, and Navy, on the other hand, may have Liability under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, the Parties agree to cooperate fully and maintain a joint defense (in a manner that will preserve the
attorney-client privilege, joint defense or other privilege with respect thereto) so as to minimize such Liabilities and
defense costs associated
24
therewith.  The Party that is not responsible for managing the defense of such Third-Party Claims will, upon
reasonable request, be consulted with respect to significant matters relating thereto and may retain counsel to monitor
or assist in the defense of such claims at its own cost.
(b)                                 Certain Actions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 3.5, Navy may elect
to have exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions pending
at the Separation Time which relate to or arise out of the Red Lion Business, the Red Lion Assets or the Red Lion
Liabilities if such Action also relates to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities and a member of the Navy
Group is also named as a target or defendant thereunder (but excluding any such Actions which solely relate to or
solely arise in connection with the Red Lion Business, the Red Lion Assets or the Red Lion Liabilities); provided that
(i) Navy will consult with Red Lion on a regular basis with respect to strategy and developments with respect to any
such Action, (ii) if Navy fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Action, Red Lion may
assume such defense, and Navy will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection with
such defense, (iii) Red Lion has the right to participate in (but, subject to clause (ii) above, not control) the defense of
such Action, and (iv) Navy must obtain the written consent of Red Lion, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, to settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to such Action if such
settlement, consent or judgment would (A) provide for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting Red Lion or any
of its Affiliates, or (B) in the reasonable opinion of Red Lion, would otherwise adversely affect Red Lion or any of its
Affiliates.  After any such compromise, settlement, consent to entry of judgment or entry of judgment, Navy and Red
Lion will agree upon a reasonable allocation to Red Lion and Red Lion will be responsible for or receive, as the case
may be, Red Lion’s proportionate share of any such compromise, settlement, consent or judgment attributable to the
Red Lion Business, the Red Lion Assets or the Red Lion Liabilities, including its proportionate share of the reasonable
costs and expenses associated with defending same.
(c)                                  Substitution.  In the event of an Action that involves solely matters that are indemnifiable and in
which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party so
requests, the Parties will endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant.  If such substitution
or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the rights and obligations of the Parties regarding
indemnification and the management of the defense of claims as set forth in this Article III will not be affected.
(d)                                 Subrogation.  In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of
any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand
in the place of such Indemnitee, in whole or in part based upon whether the Indemnifying Party has paid all or only
part of the Indemnitee’s Liability, as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have
any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-
Party Claim or against any other Person.  Such Indemnitee will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right,
defense or claim.
25
(e)                                  Not Applicable to Taxes.  Except for Section 3.4(c) and as otherwise specifically provided herein,
this Agreement will not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Matters Agreement).  In the case of any conflict
between this Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement in relation to any matters addressed by the Tax Matters
Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement will prevail.
(f)                                   Environmental Claims.  In the event of any claim pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to the
presence or release of any Hazardous Materials on any real property owned or operated by Penny, Red Lion or any
Affiliate thereof, (i) Navy has the right, exercisable by written notice to the Red Lion Indemnitee, to assume control of
and conduct any investigation or remedial action with respect thereto, (ii) Penny shall grant Navy reasonable access
to such real property to perform any such investigation or remedial action, (iii) such investigation or remedial action
shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the use of such real property, and (iv) if
Navy determines that remedial action is required pursuant to Environmental Law, Penny hereby consents to the use
of any engineered barriers or institutional controls that would not unreasonably interfere with Penny’s future use of
such real property; provided that (A) Navy will consult with the Red Lion Indemnitee on a regular basis with respect to
any material developments in such investigation or remedial action, (B) in the event that Navy receives a written
notice of violation from the applicable Governmental Authority alleging a material failure by Navy to perform any such
investigation or remedial action and Navy fails to cure such alleged violation within a reasonable period of time (which
in no event shall be less than 120 days after the receipt of such written notice), Red Lion has the right, exercisable by
reasonable written notice from the Red Lion Indemnitee to Navy, to assume control of such investigation or remedial
action to the extent related to such notice of violation, and Navy will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses
paid or incurred by Red Lion in connection with such investigation or remedial, (C) Red Lion has the right to participate
in (but, subject to clauses (i) through (iv) above, not control) any such investigation or remedial action at its cost and
(D) Navy must obtain the written consent of Red Lion, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, with
respect to the use of any engineered barriers or institutional controls in any such investigation or remedial action.
Section 3.7                                    Exclusive Remedy.  Each of Red Lion and Navy intends and hereby agrees that this
Article III sets forth the exclusive remedy of the Parties following the Separation Time for any Losses arising out of
any breach of the covenants or agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement, except that nothing contained
in this Section 3.7 will impair any right of any Person (a) to exercise all of their rights and seek all damages available
to them under Law in the event of claims or causes of action arising from fraud; (b) to specific performance under this
Agreement; and (c) to equitable relief as provided in Section 5.15 or in any Ancillary Agreement.  In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the Parties hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the other Party in connection herewith, arising under or based
upon any Law other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article III and the right to seek the relief
described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the preceding sentence.
Section 3.8                                    Survival of Indemnities.  The rights and obligations of each of Navy and Red Lion and
their respective Indemnitees under this Article III will survive the sale or other transfer by any Party of any Assets or
businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities.
26
ARTICLE IV
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
Section 4.1                                    Further Assurances.  Subject to the limitations of Section 1.7:
(a)                                 In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement, each of the Parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts, prior to, at and after the Separation Time, to take,
or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Law or Contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as reasonably practicable.
(b)                                 Without limiting the generality of Section 4.1(a), where the cooperation of third parties such as
insurers or trustees would be necessary in order for a Party to completely fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such third parties to provide
such cooperation.  If any Affiliate of Navy or Red Lion is not a party to this Agreement or, as applicable, any Ancillary
Agreement, and it becomes necessary or desirable for such Affiliate to be a party hereto or thereto to carry out the
purpose hereof or thereof, then Navy or Red Lion, as applicable, will cause such Affiliate to become a party hereto or
thereto or cause such Affiliate to undertake such actions as if such Affiliate were such a party.
(c)                                  Prior to the Separation Time, in the event that the Parties identify any tangible Asset (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, excludes any Assets that constitute Intellectual Property) that (i) is owned by a member of
the Navy Group, (ii) is not included in the Red Lion Assets or will otherwise be made available to the Red Lion
Business pursuant to the Red Lion TSA or any of the other Ancillary Agreements, (iii) is not used primarily in, or held
primarily for the benefit of, the Red Lion Business and (iv) is necessary to manufacture products of the Red Lion
Business in a manner consistent with the manner in which they have manufactured as of the date hereof, the Parties
will reasonably cooperate and negotiate in good faith to identify a mutually acceptable, commercially reasonable
arrangement pursuant to which such Asset will be made available to the Red Lion Business subsequent to the
Separation Time for a reasonable period of time.
Section 4.2                                    Agreement For Exchange of Information.
(a)                                 Generally.  Except as otherwise provided in the TSAs and except as provided in the last sentence
of this Section 4.2(a), each Party, on behalf of its respective Group, will provide, or cause to be provided, to the other
Party’s Group, at any time after the Separation Time and until the later of (x) the sixth anniversary of the Separation
Time and (y) the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations period, if applicable, as soon as reasonably
practicable after written request therefor, any Shared Information in its possession or under its control.  Each of
27
Navy and Red Lion agree to make their respective personnel available during regular business hours to discuss the
Information exchanged pursuant to this Section 4.2.  The obligations set forth in this Section 4.2(a) with respect to the
data required for worker’s compensation claim handling and filings will survive the sixth anniversary time period herein
and will instead survive indefinitely.
(b)                                 Financial Information for Navy.  Without limitation to Section 4.2(a), until the end of the first full
fiscal year occurring after the Closing Date (and for a reasonable period of time afterwards as required by Law for
Navy to prepare consolidated financial statements or complete a financial statement audit for any period during which
the financial results of the Red Lion Group were consolidated with those of Navy), Red Lion will use its reasonable
best efforts to enable Navy to meet its timetable for dissemination of its financial statements and to enable Navy’s
auditors to timely complete their annual audit and quarterly reviews of financial statements.  As part of such efforts, to
the extent reasonably necessary for the preparation of financial statements or completing an audit or review of
financial statements or an audit of internal control over financial reporting, (i) Red Lion will authorize and direct its
auditors to make available to Navy’s auditors, within a reasonable time prior to the date of Navy’s auditors’ opinion or
review report, both (x) the personnel who performed or will perform the annual audits and quarterly reviews of Red Lion
and (y) work papers related to such annual audits and quarterly reviews, to enable Navy’s auditors to perform any
procedures they consider reasonably necessary to take responsibility for the work of Red Lion’s auditors as it relates
to Navy’s auditors’ opinion or report and (ii) until all governmental audits are complete, Red Lion will provide
reasonable access during normal business hours for Navy’s internal auditors, counsel and other designated
representatives to (x) the premises of Red Lion and its Subsidiaries and all Information (and duplicating rights) within
the knowledge, possession or control of Red Lion and its Subsidiaries and (y) the officers and employees of Red Lion
and its Subsidiaries, so that Navy may conduct reasonable audits relating to the financial statements provided by Red
Lion and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such access will not be unreasonably disruptive to the business and
affairs of the Red Lion Group.
(c)                                  Financial Information for Red Lion.  Without limitation to Section 4.2(a), until the end of the
second full fiscal year occurring after the Closing Date (and for a reasonable period of time afterwards or as required
by Law), Navy will use its reasonable best efforts to enable Red Lion to meet its timetable for dissemination of its
financial statements and to enable Red Lion’s auditors to timely complete their annual audit and quarterly reviews of
financial statements.  As part of such efforts, to the extent reasonably necessary for the preparation of financial
statements or completing an audit or review of financial statements or an audit of internal control over financial
reporting, (i) Navy will authorize and direct its auditors to make available to Red Lion’s auditors, within a reasonable
time prior to the date of Red Lion’s auditors’ opinion or review report, both (x) the personnel who performed or will
perform the annual audits and quarterly reviews of Navy and (y) work papers related to such annual audits and
quarterly reviews, to enable Red Lion’s auditors to perform any procedures they consider reasonably necessary to
take responsibility for the work of Navy’s auditors as it relates to Red Lion’s auditors’ opinion or report and (ii) until all
governmental audits are complete, Navy will provide reasonable access during normal business hours for Red Lion’s
internal auditors, counsel and other designated representatives to (x) the premises of Navy and its Subsidiaries and
all Information (and duplicating rights) within the knowledge, possession or control of Navy and its
28
Subsidiaries and (y) the officers and employees of Navy and its Subsidiaries, so that Red Lion may conduct
reasonable audits relating to the financial statements provided by Navy and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
such access will not be unreasonably disruptive to the business and affairs of the Navy Group.
(d)                                 Certifications.  In order to enable the principal executive officer(s) and principal financial
officer(s) (as such terms are defined in the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) of
Navy to make any certifications required of them under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Red
Lion will, within a reasonable period of time following a request from Navy in anticipation of filing such reports, cause
its principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s) to provide Navy with certifications of such officers in
support of the certifications of Navy’s principal executive officer(s) and principal financial officer(s) required under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to Navy’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with respect to the fiscal quarter during which the Closing occurs (unless such quarter is the fourth fiscal quarter),
each subsequent fiscal quarter through the third fiscal quarter of the year in which the Closing occurs and Navy’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with respect to the fiscal year during which the Closing occurs.  Such certifications
will be provided in substantially the same form and manner as such Red Lion officers provided prior to the Closing
(reflecting any changes in certifications necessitated by the Red Lion Restructuring or the Recapitalization or and any
other transactions related thereto) or as otherwise agreed upon between Navy and Red Lion.
(e)                                  Limitations of Liability.  Neither Party will have any Liability to the other Party in the event that
any Information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Agreement that is an estimate or forecast, or that is based on
an estimate or forecast, is found to be inaccurate in the absence of willful misconduct by the providing Person.
(f)                                   Ownership of Information.  Any Information owned by a Party that is provided to the other Party
pursuant to this Section 4.2 remains the property of the Party that owned and provided such Information.  Each Party
will, and will cause members of their respective Groups to, remove and destroy any hard drives or other electronic
data storage devices from any computer or server that is reasonably likely to contain Information that is protected by
this Section 4.2 and that is transferred or sold to a third-party or otherwise disposed of in accordance with
Section 4.2(g), unless required by Law to retain such materials.
(g)                                  Record Retention.  Each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to retain all
Information that relates to the operations of the Red Lion Business in its respective possession or control at the
Separation Time in accordance with the policies of Navy as in effect on the Separation Time or such other policies as
may be adopted by Navy thereafter (provided, in the case of Red Lion, that Navy notify Red Lion of any such
change).  No Party will destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information which the other Party
may have the right to obtain pursuant to this Agreement prior to the end of the retention period set forth in Navy’s
retention policies without first using its commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of the proposed
destruction and giving the other Party the opportunity to take possession or make copies of such Information prior to
such destruction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 7.02 of the Tax Matters Agreement will govern the retention
of Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and all material records or other documents relating thereto.
29
(h)                                 Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information.  The rights and obligations granted
under this Section 4.2 are subject to any specific limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing,
exchange or confidential treatment of Information set forth in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement.
(i)                                     Costs of Providing Information.  Each Party will be responsible for paying the fees and expenses
incurred by it in connection with complying with the provisions of this Section 4.2.
(j)                                    Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation.
(i)                                                                         After the Separation Time, except in the case of any Action by one Party or
its Affiliates against another Party or its Affiliates, each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
available to each other Party, upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other
personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other
documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such person
(giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or
books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the requesting
Party may from time to time be involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect to which
indemnification may be sought hereunder.  The requesting Party agrees to reimburse the other Party for the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any, incurred in connection therewith.
(ii)                                                                      If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle
any Third-Party Claim, the other Party will make available to such Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the
former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of its respective
Group as witnesses and any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability
to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors,
officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in
connection with such defense, settlement or compromise, or the prosecution, evaluation or pursuit thereof, as the
case may be, and will otherwise cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution,
evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be.
(iii)                                                                   Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties will cooperate and consult to the
extent reasonably necessary with respect to Third-Party Claims.
(iv)                                                                  Without limiting any provision of this Section 4.2(j), each of the Parties will
cooperate, and will cause each member of its respective Group to cooperate, with each other in the defense of any
claim that the Red Lion Business infringes Intellectual Property of any third Person or that challenges the validity of
any Intellectual Property licensed to any Party pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and no Party
will claim to acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group to claim to acknowledge, the validity or
infringing use of any Intellectual Property of a third Person in a manner that would
30
hamper or undermine the defense of such infringement, validity or similar claim or challenge except as required by
Law.
(v)                                                                     The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
Section 4.2(j) is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate cooperation and will include the obligation to
provide as witnesses inventors and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of the witness
could assert a possible business conflict.
(vi)                                                                  In connection with any matter contemplated by this Section 4.2(j), the Parties
will enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement so as to maintain to the extent practicable any
applicable attorney-client privilege or work product immunity of any member of any Group.
(k)                                 Restrictions.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, no

Section 4.3                                    Privileged Matters.
(a)                                 The respective rights and obligations of the Parties to maintain, preserve, assert or waive any or
all privileges belonging to either Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Red Lion Business or the Non-Red Lion
Business, including the attorney-client and work product privileges (collectively, “Privileges”), will be governed by the
provisions of this Section 4.3.  With respect to Privileged Information of Navy, Navy will have sole authority in
perpetuity to determine whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and Red Lion will not take any action (or
permit any member of its Group to take action) without the prior written consent of Navy that could result in any
waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by Navy or any member of its Group under applicable Law and this
Agreement.  With respect to Privileged Information of Red Lion arising after the Separation Time, Red Lion will have
sole authority in perpetuity to determine whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and Navy will take no action
(nor permit any member of its Group to take action) without the prior written consent of Red Lion that could result in
any waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by Red Lion or any member of its Group under applicable Law and
this Agreement.  The rights and obligations created by this Section 4.3 will apply to all Information as to which a Party
or its respective Groups would be entitled to assert or have asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of
the Red Lion Restructuring or the Recapitalization (“Privileged Information”).
(b)                                 Privileged Information of Navy and its Group includes (i) any and all Information regarding the Non-
Red Lion Business and the Navy Group (other than Information relating to the Red Lion Business (“Red Lion
Information”)), whether or not such Information (other than Red Lion Information) is in the possession of Red Lion or
any Affiliate thereof, (ii) all communications subject to a Privilege between counsel for Navy (other than counsel for
the Red Lion Business) (including any person who, at the time of the communication, was an employee of Navy or its
Group in the capacity of in-house counsel, regardless of whether such employee is or becomes an employee of
Penny, Red Lion or any Affiliate thereof) and any person who, at the time of the communication, was an employee of
Navy, regardless of whether such employee is
31
or becomes an employee of Red Lion or any Affiliate thereof, and (iii) all Information generated, received or arising
after the Separation Time that refers or relates to and discloses Privileged Information of Navy or its Group generated,
received or arising prior to the Separation Time.
(c)                                  Privileged Information of Red Lion and its Group includes (i) any and all Red Lion Information,
whether or not it is in the possession of Navy or any member of its Group, (ii) all communications subject to a
Privilege between counsel for the Red Lion Business (including any person who, at the time of the communication,
was an employee of Navy or its Group in the capacity of in-house counsel, regardless of whether such employee is or
remains an employee of Navy or any Affiliate thereof) and any person who, at the time of the communication, was an
employee of Navy, Red Lion or any member of either Group or the Red Lion Business regardless of whether such
employee was, is or becomes an employee of Navy or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) all Information generated,
received or arising after the Separation Time that refers or relates to and discloses Privileged Information of Red Lion
or its Group generated, received or arising after the Separation Time.
(d)                                 Upon receipt by Navy or Red Lion, or any of their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, of any
subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Information of the other or if Navy or Red Lion, or any of their respective Affiliates, as the
case may be, obtains knowledge that any current or former employee of Navy or Red Lion, or any of their respective
Affiliates, as the case may be, receives any subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or
arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of the other, Navy or Red Lion, as the case
may be, will promptly notify the relevant other Party of the existence of the request and will provide such other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it may have under this Section 4.3 or
otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged Information.  Navy or Red Lion, as the case may be,
will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, produce or disclose to any third party any of the other Party’s
Privileged Information under this Section 4.3 unless (i) the other Party has provided its express written consent to
such production or disclosure or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction has entered an Order not subject to interlocutory
appeal or review finding that the Information is not entitled to protection from disclosure under any applicable privilege,
doctrine or rule.
(e)                                  Navy’s transfer of books and records pertaining to the Red Lion Business and other Information to
Red Lion, Navy’s agreement to permit Red Lion to obtain Information existing prior to the Red Lion Restructuring, Red
Lion’s transfer of books and records pertaining to Navy, if any, and other Information to Navy and Red Lion’s
agreement to permit Navy to obtain Information existing prior to the Red Lion Restructuring are made in reliance on
Navy’s and Red Lion’s respective agreements, as set forth in Section 4.2 and this Section 4.3, to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information and to take the steps provided herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may
belong to or be asserted by Navy or Red Lion, as the case may be.  The access to Information, witnesses and
individuals being granted pursuant to Section 4.2 and the disclosure to Red Lion and Navy of Privileged Information
relating to the Red Lion Business or the Non-Red Lion Business pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the
Red Lion Restructuring will not be asserted by Navy or Red Lion to constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of any
Privilege that has been or may be asserted under this Section 4.3 or otherwise.  Nothing in this Agreement will
operate to reduce, minimize or condition the rights
32
granted to Navy and Red Lion in, or the obligations imposed upon Navy and Red Lion by, this Section 4.3.
Section 4.4                                    Intellectual Property Assignment/Recordation.  Each Party will be responsible for, and
will pay all expenses (whether incurred before, at or after the Separation Time) involved in notarization, authentication,
legalization and/or consularization of the signatures of any representatives of its Group on any of the Transfer
Documents relating to the transfer of Intellectual Property.  Red Lion will be responsible for, and will pay, all expenses
(whether incurred before, at or after the Separation Time) incurred in connection with the transfer of licenses or
procurement of new licenses from third parties as may be necessary or advisable in connection with the Transfer
Documents relating to the transfer of Intellectual Property to Red Lion.  Red Lion will be responsible for, and will pay,
all expenses (whether incurred before, at or after the Separation Time) relating to, the recording of any such Transfer
Documents relating to the transfer of Intellectual Property to any member of the Red Lion Group with any
Governmental Authorities as may be necessary or appropriate.
Section 4.5                                    Use of Names of the Navy Group by Red Lion.  Except as allowed under the Alliance
Agreement, from and after the Separation Time, Red Lion will take all actions necessary to assure that no member of
the Red Lion Group operates the Red Lion Business utilizing, based on or taking advantage of the name, reputation,
Trademarks or goodwill of any member of the Navy Group; provided that Penny and members of the Red Lion Group
may refer to the Navy Group and Trademarks of the Navy Group in connection with describing the historical
relationship of the Red Lion Group to the Navy Group.  In addition, Red Lion and each member of the Red Lion Group
may use products, product labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and promotional materials, printed stationery,
brochures and literature bearing any of the corporate names, Trademarks or consumer information telephone numbers
of the Navy Group after the Separation Time; provided, that Red Lion will, and will cause each member of the Red
Lion Group to, cease use of products, product labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and promotional materials, printed
stationery, brochures and literature bearing any of the corporate names, Trademarks or consumer information
telephone numbers beginning on the first anniversary of the Separation Time; provided, further, that there will be no
time limit with respect to Red Lion’s sale of products bearing the corporate name, Trademarks or consumer
information telephone numbers or that use any packaging bearing that same included in the Red Lion Inventory.  The
Red Lion Group will use commercially reasonable efforts to cease the sale or use of such products, product labeling
or packaging as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Separation Time, consistent with their ordinary
course of business.  Red Lion will, and will cause each member of the Red Lion Group to, maintain quality standards
for products of the Red Lion Business not materially different from those maintained by the Red Lion Business prior to
the Separation Time for so long as any member of the Red Lion Group continues to sell or use any products, product
labeling, packaging, advertising, sales or promotional materials bearing the corporate names, Trademarks or
consumer information telephone numbers of any member of the Navy Group.
Section 4.6                                    Removal of Tangible Assets.
(a)                                 Except as may be otherwise provided in the TSA, or otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all
tangible Red Lion Assets that are located at any Non-Red Lion Facilities will be
33
moved as promptly as practicable after the Separation Time from such facilities, at Navy’s expense and in a manner
so as not to unreasonably interfere with the operations of any member of the Navy Group and to not cause damage to
such facility, and such member of the Navy Group will provide reasonable access to such facility to effectuate same. 
Red Lion will remove any Red Lion Assets that remain at any such facilities in connection with the performance of
services under the TSAs as promptly as practicable after the termination of such service pursuant to the same terms
and conditions stated in the immediately preceding sentence.
(b)                                 Except as may be otherwise provided in the TSAs or otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all
tangible Excluded Assets that are located at any of the Red Lion Facilities will be moved as promptly as practicable
after the Separation Time from such facilities, at Navy’s expense and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere
with the operations of any member of the Red Lion Group and to not cause damage to such Red Lion Facility, and
such member of the Red Lion Group will provide reasonable access to such Red Lion Facility to effectuate such
movement.  Navy will remove any Excluded Assets that remain at any such Red Lion Facilities in connection with the
performance of services under the TSAs as promptly as practicable after the termination of such service pursuant to
the same terms and conditions stated in the immediately preceding sentence.
Section 4.7                                    Insurance.
(a)                                 Rights Under Policies.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, from and after the
Separation Date, none of Red Lion nor any other member of the Red Lion Group will have any rights whatsoever with
respect to any Policies, except that (i) Navy will, if requested by Red Lion, use commercially reasonable efforts to
assert, on behalf of Red Lion, claims for any loss, liability or damage with respect solely to the Red Lion Assets or
Red Lion Liabilities under Policies with third-party insurers or SOL Insurance Ltd. which are “occurrence basis”
insurance policies (“Occurrence Basis Policies”) arising out of insured incidents occurring from the date coverage
thereunder first commenced until the Separation Date to the extent that the terms and conditions of any such
Occurrence Basis Policies and agreements relating thereto so allow, and (ii) Navy will, if requested by Red Lion, use
commercially reasonable efforts to continue to prosecute, on behalf of Red Lion, claims with respect solely to Red
Lion Assets or Red Lion Liabilities properly asserted with an insurer prior to the Separation Date under Policies with
third-party insurers which are insurance policies written on a “claims made” basis (“Claims Made Policies”) arising out
of insured incidents occurring from the date coverage thereunder first commenced until the Separation Date to the
extent that the terms and conditions of any such Claims Made Policies and agreements relating thereto so allow;
provided that in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii) above, (A) all of Navy’s and each member of the Navy Group’s
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing are promptly paid by Red Lion, (B) Navy and the Navy
Group may, at any time, without Liability or obligation to Red Lion or any member of the Red Lion Group (other than as
set forth in Section 4.7(c)), amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any
Occurrence Basis Policies or Claims Made Policies (and such claims will be subject to any such amendments,
commutations, terminations, buy-outs, extinguishments and modifications), (C) any such claim will be subject to all of
the terms and conditions of the applicable Policy and (D) Red Lion promptly pays to Navy any applicable deductible.
34
(b)                                 Assistance by Navy.  Until the one-year anniversary of the Separation Time and as requested by
Red Lion, Navy will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Red Lion in connection with any efforts by Red Lion
to acquire insurance coverage with respect to the Red Lion Business for incidents occurring prior to the Separation
Date, as described in Section 4.7(a); provided, that all of Navy’s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the foregoing are promptly paid by Red Lion.
(c)                                  Navy Actions.  In the event that after the Separation Date, Navy or any member of the Navy
Group proposes to amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any Policies
under which Red Lion has rights to assert claims pursuant to Section 4.7(a) in a manner that would adversely affect
any such rights of Red Lion (i) Navy will give Red Lion prior written notice thereof (it being understood that the
decision to take any such action will be in the sole discretion of Navy) and (ii) Navy will pay to Red Lion its equitable
share (which must be determined by Navy in good faith based on the amount of premiums paid or allocated to the Red
Lion Business in respect of the applicable Policy) of any net proceeds actually received by Navy from the insurer
under the applicable Policy as a result of such action by Navy (after deducting Navy’s reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such action).  The Tax treatment of any such payments to Red Lion by Navy
will be handled in accordance with Section 3.4(c).
(d)                                 Insurance Premiums.  Subject to clause (B) of the proviso to Section 4.7(a), from and after the
Separation Date, Navy will pay, if so directed by Red Lion, all premiums (retrospectively-rated or otherwise) as
required under the terms and conditions of the respective Policies in respect of periods prior to the Separation Date,
whereupon Red Lion will upon the request of Navy, promptly reimburse Navy for that portion of such premiums paid by
Navy as are reasonably determined by Navy (and reasonably approved by Red Lion) to be attributable to the Red Lion
Business.
(e)                                  Agreement for Waiver of Conflict and Shared Defense.  In the event that a Policy provides
coverage for both Navy and/or a member of the Navy Group, on the one hand, and Red Lion and/or a member of the
Red Lion Group, on the other hand, relating to the same occurrence or claim, Navy and Red Lion agree to defend
jointly and to waive any conflict of interest necessary to the conduct of that joint defense.
(f)                                   Termination.  The obligations of Navy and the Navy Group set forth in this Section 4.7 will
terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Separation Time, except with respect to any claims against Occurrence
Basis Policies.
(g)                                  No Limitation to Indemnity.  Nothing in this Section 4.7 will be construed to limit or otherwise alter
in any way the indemnity obligations of the parties to this Agreement, including those created by this Agreement.

relieve any Party of its indemnification obligations or obligations in the event of a breach of this Agreement.  Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, any attempted assignment or delegation will be void.
Section 5.10                             Construction.  When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or Section, such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.  The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.  The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
a substantive part
38
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including”
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”  The words “hereof,”
“hereby,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.  All terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless
otherwise defined therein.  The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.  Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes, including all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. 
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.  References to a date or time shall be
deemed to be such date or time in New York City, unless otherwise specified.  References to dollar amounts are to
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified.  Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement.  If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue
of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.  Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, or any Ancillary Agreement, any provision herein which contemplates the
agreement, approval or consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may give or withhold such
agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and absolute discretion, the Parties hereto hereby
expressly disclaim any implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept.
Section 5.11                             Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the
application of any provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or
void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement or such
Ancillary Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the parties hereto that this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and
enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another
provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.
Section 5.12                             Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (any one of
which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party), each of which will be deemed to be an original but all
of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement.  This Agreement, and any amendments hereto,
to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, will be treated in
all manner and respects as an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it
were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.  At the request of a Party, the other Party will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party.  No Party will raise the use of a facsimile machine or
other electronic means to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile
39
machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives
any such defense.
Section 5.13                             Survival of Covenants.  Except as expressly set forth in any Ancillary Agreement, the
covenants, representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement, and liability for
the breach of any obligations contained herein, will survive each of the Red Lion Restructuring and the
