<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/11. The role of good governance in the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard 
</p>
<p>of achievement of all peoples and all nations applying to every individual and every 
</p>
<p>organ of society, and also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which 
</p>
<p>affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/68 of 20 April 2005 
</p>
<p>and all previous relevant resolutions on the role of the good governance in the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights, as well as the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of a conducive environment, at both the national 
</p>
<p>and the international levels, for the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms and of the mutually reinforcing relationship between good governance and 
</p>
<p>human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory 
</p>
<p>government, responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, including women 
</p>
<p>and members of vulnerable and marginalized groups, is the foundation on which good 
</p>
<p>governance rests and that such a foundation is an indispensable condition for the full 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, including the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that democracies have embedded institutional advantages 
</p>
<p>incontestably favourable to sustainable development, and that when based on the 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights, they provide political incentives to Governments to respond 
</p>
<p>to the needs and demands of the people, allow for more informed and extensive policy 
</p>
<p>dialogue, are more adaptable, and create necessary checks and balances on 
</p>
<p>Government power, </p>

<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the leading role played by the United Nations in developing and 
</p>
<p>promoting democracy and human rights, and recognizing the role of other processes, 
</p>
<p>including the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the 
</p>
<p>Community of Democracies, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the importance of international and regional cooperation, 
</p>
<p>when required by the States in need, in order to facilitate the implementation of good 
</p>
<p>governance and anti-corruption practices at all levels,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that good governance at the national and international levels is 
</p>
<p>essential for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication 
</p>
<p>of poverty and hunger, as reflected in the 2005 World Summit Outcome,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting with satisfaction</i> the outcomes of the respective conferences of the 
</p>
<p>Community of Democracies, held in Warsaw in 2000, in Seoul in 2002, in Santiago in 
</p>
<p>2005 and in Bamako in 2007, at which the States committed themselves to build on 
</p>
<p>shared principles and goals to promote democracy in all regions of the world, to 
</p>
<p>support the integrity of democratic processes in societies on the democratic path and 
</p>
<p>to coordinate policies to enhance the effectiveness of democratic governance, 
</p>
<p><i> Realizing</i> that the fight against corruption at all levels plays an important role 
</p>
<p>in the promotion and protection of human rights and in the process of creating an 
</p>
<p>environment conducive to their full enjoyment,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing awareness in the international community of the 
</p>
<p>detrimental impact of widespread corruption on human rights, through both the 
</p>
<p>weakening of institutions and the erosion of public trust in government, as well as 
</p>
<p>through the impairment of the ability of Governments to fulfil their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, particularly the economic and social rights of the most vulnerable and 
</p>
<p>marginalized, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that effective anti-corruption measures and the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights are mutually reinforcing and that the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights is essential to the fulfilment of all aspects of an anti-corruption strategy, </p>

<p><i> Noting with attention</i> the outcome of the first and second sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Conference of the States parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
</p>
<p>held in Dead Sea, Jordan, in 2006, and in Bali, Indonesia, in 2008, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the note by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights transmitting the report on the United Nations Conference on anti-
</p>
<p>corruption, good governance and human rights, held in Warsaw, on 8 and 9 
</p>
<p>November 2006, by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and 
</p>
<p>noting the main themes discussed during the seminar: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The impact of corruption on human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Human rights and good governance in the fight against corruption; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The role of civil society, the private sector and the media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Fighting corruption while safeguarding human rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites</i> States to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption and to promote transparency, accountability, 
</p>
<p>prevention and enforcement as key principles of anti-corruption efforts; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the publication of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights entitled &#8220;Good Governance Practices for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Human Rights&#8221;, pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 
</p>
<p>2005/68, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a publication 
</p>
<p>on anti-corruption, good governance and human rights, drawing on the results of the 
</p>
<p>Warsaw conference; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of the question of the role of 
</p>
<p>good governance, including the issue of the fight against corruption in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights, at a future session.
