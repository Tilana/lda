Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015, and the related condensed
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 and the condensed consolidated changes
in shareholders’ equity and statement of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014. This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's
management.
We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
As discussed in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, during the third  quarter of 2014, the Company wrote off US$ 2,527 million of overpayments on the acquisition of
property plant and equipment incorrectly capitalized, according to testimony obtained from Brazilian criminal investigations.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position as of December 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows (not presented herein) and changes in shareholders’ equity for the
year then ended, and, in our report dated April 22, 2015, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying condensed accompanying consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2014 is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the accompanying
consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived.

(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
1.            The Company and its operations
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras is dedicated, directly or through its subsidiaries  (referred to jointly as “Petrobras” or “the Company”) to prospecting, drilling, refining, processing, trading
and transporting crude oil from producing onshore and offshore oil fields and from shale or other rocks, as well as oil products, natural gas and other liquid hydrocarbons. In addition, Petrobras

Company’s head office is located in Rio de Janeiro – RJ, Brazil.
2.            Basis of preparation
The consolidated interim financial information has been prepared and is being presented in accordance with IAS 34 – “Interim Financial Reporting” as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB). The information is presented in U.S. dollars.
This interim financial information presents the significant changes in the period, without repeating all information previously reported in notes to the Company’s financial statements. As a
result, this interim financial information should be read together with the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which include the full set of notes.
The Company has reclassified certain amounts from prior periods to provide a more appropriate presentation and to be consistent with the industry practice, as set out in notes 7 and 24. Net
income was not affected in any of the periods presented.
Petrobras has selected the U.S. Dollar as its presentation currency. The financial statements have been translated from the functional currency (Brazilian Real) into the presentation currency
(U.S. Dollar) in accordance with IAS 21 – “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the closing exchange rate at the date
of the financial statements; income and expenses, as well as cash flows are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Equity items are
translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. All exchange differences arising from the translation of the consolidated financial statements from the
functional currency into the presentation currency are recognized as cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated
statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.

The Company’s Board of Directors in a meeting held on August 6, 2015 authorized the consolidated interim financial information for issue.
2.1.            Accounting estimates
The preparation of interim financial information requires the use of estimates and assumptions for certain assets, liabilities and other transactions. These estimates include: write-off of
overpayments improperly capitalized, oil and gas reserves, pension and medical benefits liabilities, depreciation, depletion and amortization, decommissioning costs, impairment of assets,
hedge accounting, provisions for legal proceedings, fair value of financial instruments, present value adjustments of trade receivables and payables from relevant transactions, and income
taxes (income tax – IRPJ and social contribution on net income – CSLL). Although our management uses assumptions and judgments that are periodically reviewed, the actual results could
differ from these estimates.

3.            The “Lava Jato” (Car Wash) Operation and its effects on the Company
In the third quarter of 2014, the Company wrote off US$2,527 of capitalized costs representing amounts that Petrobras overpaid for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment in prior
years. For further information see note 3 to the Company’s December 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements.
In preparing its financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2015, the Company carefully considered all available information and does not believe that new developments in the
investigations related to the “Lava Jato” (Car Wash) Operation by the Brazilian authorities, by the independent law firms conducting an internal investigation, or by newly set up internal
commissions (or a review of the results of previous internal investigations) could materially impact or change the methodology adopted to recognize the write-off described above.
Notwithstanding this belief, the Company will continuously monitor the investigations for additional information and, as of June 30, 2015, has not identified any necessary adjustment based on
existing information.
On May 13, 2015, the Company received US$ 51 representing the first portion of amounts recovered from Pedro José Barusco Filho, a former executive manager of the Services area, who
had previously entered into a plea agreement with Brazilian authorities. This amount was recognized as other income (amounts recovered – “overpayments incorrectly capitalized”) in the
quarter ended June 30, 2015. To the extent that any of the proceedings resulting from the Lava Jato investigation involve leniency agreements with cartel members or plea agreements with
individuals pursuant to which they agree to return funds, Petrobras may be entitled to receive a portion of such funds.
See note 29 for information about the Company’s material legal proceedings, including those related to the “Lava Jato” investigation.
4.            Basis of consolidation
The consolidated interim financial information includes the interim information of Petrobras, its subsidiaries, joint operations and consolidated structured entities.
There were no significant changes in the consolidated entities in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015.
The main disposal of assets and legal mergers are set out in note 9.
5.            Summary of significant accounting policies
The same accounting policies and methods of computation were followed in these consolidated interim financial statements as those followed in the preparation of the annual financial
statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2014.

As of June 30, 2015, US$ 4,070 of the Company’s trade receivables from the isolated electricity system in the northern region of Brazil, related to the sale of fuel oil, natural gas and other
products to thermoelectric power plants (which are subsidiaries of Eletrobras), state-owned natural gas distribution companies and independent electricity producers (Produtores
Independentes de Energia – PIE) operating in that region, were classified as non-current assets. The balance of those receivables was US$ 4,903 as of June 30, 2015 (US$ 4,817 as of
December 31, 2014).
A portion of the costs related to the supply of fuel to thermoelectric power plants located in the northern region of Brazil is borne by funds from the Fuel Consumption Account (Conta de
Consumo de Combustível – CCC), which is managed by Eletrobras.
Recently, funds transferred from the CCC to the electricity companies in the northern region of Brazil have not been sufficient for them to meet their financial obligations, and, as a result,
some of these companies have experienced financial difficulties and have not been able to pay for the products supplied by Petrobras. The Company entered into a debt acknowledgement
agreement with subsidiaries of Eletrobras on December 31, 2014 with respect to the balance of its receivables as of November 30, 2014. Eletrobras acknowledged owing US$ 2,772 to the
Company. This amount is being updated monthly based on the Selic interest rate (Brazilian short-term interest rate). Under the agreement, the first of 120 monthly installments was paid in
February 2015 and, as of May 7, 2015, US$ 2,379 (US$ 1,961 as of December 31, 2014) had been guaranteed by collateral. The monthly installments have been timely paid to date.
As of December 31, 2014, the Company had recognized charges for allowances for impairment of trade receivables of US$ 1,948 (charged to selling expenses) to cover uncollateralized
receivables as of October 31, 2014, including the balances from previous debt acknowledgement agreements and from companies that were not part of the most recent debt acknowledgment
agreement with Eletrobras. On March 31, 2015 the Company recognized a reversal of allowance for impairment of trade receivables of US$ 452 (reduction in selling expenses), to reflect the
additional portion of the trade receivables that was collateralized - additional receivables the CCC has from the Brazilian Energy Development Account (Conta de Desenvolvimento Energético
– CDE)that were pledged as security on May 7, 2015.
In 2015, the Brazilian government implemented a new pricing policy for the electricity sector and has already implemented price increases in the first quarter of 2015. We expected that this
new policy would strengthen the financial situation of the companies in the electricity sector and, consequently reduce their insolvency on payables from fuel oil and other products supplied,
which has not occurred yet. Due to the time lag between starting to charge higher electricity prices from end customers and the improvement of the financial situation of the companies in the
electricity sector, the payments from end customer that will be transferred to the CCC and used to refund the electricity generation companies is taking longer than expected and the
companies have not been fully refunded.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
As a result, the Company is in negotiations to address the overdue receivables, including the potential collateralization of the receivables. The Company has not entered into additional debt
acknowledgement agreements yet, but it has established the necessary framework to collateralize the receivables, as set out in Interministerial Ordinance 372/2015, issued on August 5,
2015, authorizing a renegotiation of CDE’s debt with respect to overdue receivables between December 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015, with companies that are creditors of the CCC. This
authorization enables the Company to enter into contracts to pledge additional credits of the CDE as collateral. CDE’ budget for 2015, as set out in table 4 of Techinical Note 33/2015 issued
by the Superintendent of Electricity Prices and the Superintendent of Electricity Distribution Services of the Brazilian Electricity Agency (SGT-SRG/ANEEL) on February 26, 2015, reserves
sufficient funds for the renegotiations authorized in the Interministerial Ordinance. In addition, the regulators have been discussing alternatives that could reduce the mismatch between the
cash flows (from the CDE/CCC to Petrobras and Petrobras Distribuidora - BR).
Therefore, based on Management’s best judgment, the Company has recognized in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 an alllowance for impairment of trade receivables of US$ 125, with
respect to products supplied after November 1, 2014, which were overdue as of June 30, 2015 and uncollateralized.
In addition, the Company recognized a reversal of allowance for impairment of trade receivables of US$ 100, with respect to receivables from Cigás. This was the result of a preliminary
injunction from a Brazilian court that granted the Company access to restricted funds in a blocked bank account that was attached to a commercial contract with Cigás, and is the subject of a
legal dispute.

Inventories are presented net of a US$ 9 allowance reducing inventories to net realizable value (US$ 150 as of December 31, 2014), mainly due to the decrease in international prices of crude
oil and oil products. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 the Company recognized a US$ 19 allowance reducing inventories to net realizable value recognized as cost of sales (US$
211 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2014).
A portion of the crude oil and/or oil products inventories have been pledged as security for the Terms of Financial Commitment (TFC) signed by Petrobras and Petros in the amount of US$
2,098 (US$ 2,316 as of December 31, 2014), as set out in note 21.1.

The market value of these shares does not necessarily reflect the realizable value upon sale of a large block of shares.
Braskem S.A. - Investment in publicly traded associate:
Braskem’s shares are publicly traded on stock exchanges in Brazil and abroad. The quoted market value of the investment as of June 30, 2015, was US$ 1,007, based on the quoted values
of both Petrobras’ interest in Braskem’s common stock (47% of the outstanding shares), and preferred stock (22% of the outstanding shares). However, there is extremely limited trading of
the common shares, since non-signatories of the shareholders’ agreement hold only approximately 3% of the common shares.

Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
In addition, given the operational relationship between Petrobras and Braskem, on December 31, 2014, the recoverable amount of the investment, for impairment testing purposes, was
determined based on value in use, considering future cash flow projections and the manner in which the Company can derive value from this investment via dividends and other distributions
to arrive at its value in use. As the recoverable amount was higher than the carrying amount, no impairment losses were recognized for this investment.
The main assumptions on which cash flow projections were based to determine Braskem’s value in use are set out in note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2014.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
13.        Impairment
18
The Company’s assets are tested for impairment annually or when there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Based on the new 2015 to 2019 Business and Management Plan - BMP (Plano de Negócios e Gestão - PNG), indicating a decrease in its investment portfolio when compared to the previous
BMP.
The postponement of certain projects or removal from the BMP are indicators of possible impairment and, therefore, the respective assets were tested for impairment at June 30, 2015.
13.1.   Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
For impairment testing purposes, the Company prioritized the use of the value in use of the assets for which there was an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable
(individually or grouped into cash-generating units - CGUs). In measuring the value in use of an asset (or a CGU) the Company bases its cash flow projections on: (i) the estimated useful life
of the asset or assets grouped into the CGU; (ii) assumptions and financial budgets/forecasts approved by Management for the period corresponding to the expected life cycle of each
different business; and (iii) a pre-tax discount rate, which is derived from the Company’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The Company’s identified CGUs are set out in
note 5.2 to its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Projects postponed by the Company’s Management did not result in impairment losses for the respective assets or cash-generating units.
However, considering changes in future circumstances and projections, projects removed from the 2015-2019 BMP were also removed from their cash-generating units (set out in the
Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and when those assets had not suffered impairment losses) and were tested for impairment individually.
Impairment losses of US$ 419 were recognized in other expenses in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 as a result of the stand-alone basis impairment tests carried out for those assets, as set
out below:
Assets or CGU, by nature
Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant - UFN-V
RTM Assets
Producing properties: E&P activities in Brazil (several CGUs) and assets held for sale (*)
Signature bonuses (Intangible Assets) - Petrobras America (PAI)
 
(*) Includes impairment losses of US$ 8 in property, plant and equipment and US$ 7 in accounts receivable related to the disposal of Bijupirá and Salema
fields.

In the future, the Company will be determining possible uses for these assets, including: (i) using parts and equipment from those projects in other projects; (ii) divesting; (iii) looking for
partners for those projects; or (iv) writing off those assets.
13.2.   Investments in associates and joint ventures
The Company’s impairment tests of investments in associates and joint ventures resulted in impairment losses of US$ 54 in its biofuels segment, due to projects that were removed from the
Company’s 2015-2019 BMP. In addition, a US$ 41 impairment loss was recognized in Copacabana Drilling B.V., Grumari Drilling B.V., Ipanema Drilling B.V., Leblon Drilling B.V., Leme
Drilling B.V. and Marambaia Drilling B.V., which are associates of Petrobras Netherland B.V. (PNBV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petrobras) and are indirectly controlled by Sete Brasil.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
Those losses (US$ 95) were recognized in share of earnings in equity-accounted investments.
14.        Exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas reserves
Exploration and evaluation activities include the search for oil and gas beginning with the acquisition of legal rights to explore a specific area through to the declaration of the technical and
commercial viability of the reserves.
Changes in the balances of capitalized costs directly associated with exploratory wells pending determination of proved reserves and the balance of amounts paid for obtaining rights and
concessions for exploration of oil and natural gas (capitalized acquisition costs) are set out in the following table.

The Company obtains funding through debt financing for capital expenditures to develop crude oil and natural gas producing properties, construct vessels and pipelines, construct and expand
industrial plants, among other uses.
The Company has covenants in its loan agreements and notes issued in the capital markets requiring, among other obligations, the presentation of interim financial statements within 90 days
of the end of each quarter (not reviewed by independent auditors) and audited financial statements within 120 days of the end of each fiscal year. Non-compliance with these obligations do
not represent immediate events of default and the grace period in which the Company has to deliver these financial statements ranges from 30 to 60 days, depending on the agreement.
Delivering financial statements is an obligation included in most financing agreements and non-compliance with that obligation could trigger an event of default and a right to accelerate the
debt.
A roll-forward of non-current debt is set out below:

The fair value of the Company's finance debt is determined primarily by quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities (level 1), when applicable - US$ 51,425 as of June 30, 2015.
When a quoted price for an identical liability is not available, the fair value is determined based on the yield curve of the Company's most liquid bonds (level 2) - US$ 73,046 as of June 30,
2015.
The sensitivity analysis for financial instruments subject to foreign exchange variation is set out in note 31.2.
16.2.    Capitalization rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization
The capitalization rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings that were
outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. In the first half of 2015, the capitalization rate was 4.93% p.a. (4.38%
p.a. in the first half of 2014). This rate was applied to the balance of assets under construction as the basis for capitalizing borrowing costs, when eligible.

The financial institutions that have provided financing to the Company have not required Petrobras to provide collateral related to loans, except for certain specific funding instruments to
promote economic development, which are collateralized by tangible assets.
The loans obtained by structured entities are collateralized based on the projects’ assets, as well as liens on receivables of the structured entities. Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries issue
securities that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Petrobras (note 33).
The Company’s capital market financing relates primarily to unsecured global notes.

On July 16, 2015 Petrobras paid US$ 514 (US$ 385 in cash and US$ 129 in tax credits) related to a definitive ruling at the administrative stage with respect to a Tax Deficiency Notice issued
by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities. The notice is related to the tax on financial operations (Imposto sobre operações financeiras - IOF) applicable to intercompany loans made by
Petrobras to foreign subsidiaries in 2008.
In addition, Joint Ordinance 1,064 (Portaria Conjunta RFB/PGFN 1.064) issued on July 30, 2015 by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities and by the Brazilian Federal Tax Attorney General's
Office, and Normative Instruction 1,576/15 (Instrução Normativa RFB 1.576/15) issued by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities, both published on August 3, 2015, provide taxpayers that
participated in the 2014 tax amnesty program (pursuant to Law 12,996/14), an opportunity for relief in connection with additional existing federal tax debts. The Company has decided to pay
the Tax Deficiency Notices issued by the Brazilian Federal Tax Authorities related to the tax on financial operations (IOF) applicable to intercompany loans made by Petrobras to foreign
subsidiaries in 2007, 2009 and 2010 and to pay its debts related to the IOF applicable to similar intercompany loans made in other periods, for which a Tax Deficiency Notice had not been
issued (2011 and 2012), in the amount of US$ 909. The Company has also modified its procedures with respect to the payment of the IOF applicable to this kind of transaction.
As a result, the Company recognized other taxes expense of US$ 1,000 and finance expense of US$ 423 in the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
The Company is currently carrying out studies to evaluate the use of the relief provided by the tax amnesty program to pay additional contingent tax liabilities (related to Brazilian Federal
taxes).

21.2.   Profit sharing
Profit sharing benefits comply with Brazilian legal requirements and those of the Brazilian Department of Coordination and Governance of State‐Owned Enterprises (DEST), of the Ministry of
Planning, Budget and Management, and of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and are computed based on the consolidated net income attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras.
In March 2014, the Company and the labor unions reached an agreement regarding a new profit sharing regulation, following negotiations started in the context of the 2013/2015 Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Pursuant to the amended rules, profit sharing benefits will be computed based on the results of six corporate indicators, for which annual goals are defined by management (maximum
permissible levels of crude oil and oil products spill, lifting cost excluding production taxes in Brazil, crude oil and NGL production in Brazil, feedstock processed - excluding NGL - in Brazil,
vessel operating efficiency and percentage of compliance with natural gas delivery schedule).
The results of the six individual goals are factored into a consolidated result that will determine the percentage of the profit to be distributed as a profit sharing benefit to employees.
Pursuant to the amended rules, in the event the Company records a net loss for the period, profit sharing benefit will be one half of the benefit paid in the prior year in addition to half a
month’s salary for each employee.
Profit sharing benefits for the first half of 2015
Based on the consolidated result of the corporate indicators for the first half of 2015, a 6.1875% distribution was applied to the net income expressed in reais and the Company recognized a
profit sharing expense of US$ 126.
21.3.   Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan
In January 2014, the Company launched a Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (PIDV), which was developed within the context of its Productivity Optimization Plan (POP) to contribute to the
achievement of the goals set out in the Business and Management Plan.
On March 31, 2014 the Company recognized in other expenses in the statement of income a provision for the estimated charges. The amounts are subject to changes resulting from
employees who cancel their requests for voluntary separation, impacts of Collective Bargaining Agreements, which might increase salaries before separation, inflation-indexation of the floor
and the cap based on the Brazilian Consumer Price Index (IPCA), as well as variable additional incentives earned by employees.
As of June 30, 2015, 6,038 separations and 589 cancellations of requests were made for voluntary separation of employees who enrolled in the PIDV. Changes in the provision are set out
below:

As an outcome of the creation of the position of Chief Governance, Risk and Compliance Officer, which replaced the position of Chief International Officer, the Company has recently
approved the organizational structure adjustments in other business areas to allocate the international activities to other business segments. Considering the necessary steps to integrate the
management of those activities, the Company has maintained the presentation of the results of international activities as a separate component.

29.2.   Class actions and other related proceedings
Between December 8, 2014 and January 7, 2015, five putative securities class action complaints were filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (SDNY). These actions were consolidated on February 17, 2015 (the “Consolidated Securities Litigation”). The Court appointed a lead plaintiff, Universities Superannuation Scheme
Limited (“USS”), on March 4, 2015. USS filed a consolidated amended complaint on March 27, 2015 that purports to be on behalf of investors who: (i) purchased or otherwise acquired
Petrobras securities traded on the NYSE or pursuant to other transactions in the U.S. during the period January 22, 2010 and March 19, 2015, inclusive (the “Class Period”), and were
damaged thereby; (ii) purchased or otherwise acquired the 2012 Notes pursuant to the 2009 Registration Statement, or the 2013 Notes or 2014 Notes pursuant to the 2012 Registration
Statement during the Class Period, and were damaged thereby; and (iii) purchased or otherwise acquired Petrobras securities on the Brazilian stock exchange during the Class Period, who
also purchased or otherwise acquired Petrobras securities traded on the NYSE or pursuant to other transactions in the U.S. during the same period.
The consolidated amended complaint alleges, among other things, that in the Company’s press releases, filings with the SEC and other communications, the Company made materially false
and misleading statements and omissions regarding the value of its assets, the amounts of the Company’s expenses and net income, the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls
over financial reporting, and the Company’s anti-corruption policies, due to alleged corruption purportedly in connection with certain contracts, which allegedly artificially inflated the market
value of the Company’s securities.
On April 17, 2015, Petrobras, PGF and underwriters of notes issued by the Company filed a motion to dismiss.
On July 9, 2015, the judge presiding the class actions ruled on the Motion to Dismiss, partially granting the Company's motion. Among other decisions, the judge dismissed claims relating to
certain debt securities issued in 2012 under the Securities Act of 1933, as time barred by the statute of repose and ruled claims relating to securities purchased on the Brazilian stock
exchange must be arbitrated, as established in the Company’s Bylaws. The judge rejected other arguments presented in the Motion to Dismiss and, as a result, the class action will continue
with respect to other claims alleged by the lead plaintiff.
42
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
On July 20, 2015, the judge responsible for the class action issued an order that, among other things, provided for the trial in the class action to begin no later than August 1, 2016.
In addition, to date, eleven lawsuits have been filed by individual investors in the SDNY consisting of allegations similar to those in the consolidated amended complaint.
The plaintiffs have not specified an amount of alleged damages in the class action or the additional individual actions. Because these actions are in their early stages, the possible loss or
range of loss arising from the litigation cannot be estimated with reliability. The Company has engaged a U.S. firm as legal counsel and intends to defend these actions vigorously.
30.        Collateral for crude oil exploration concession agreements
The Company has granted collateral to the Brazilian Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis -ANP) in connection with
the performance of the Minimum Exploration Programs established in the concession agreements for petroleum exploration areas in the total amount of US$ 2,088 of which US$ 1,600 were
still in force at June 30, 2015, net of commitments that have been undertaken. The collateral comprises crude oil from previously identified producing fields, pledged as security, amounting to
US$ 1,309 and bank guarantees of US$ 291.
31.        Risk management
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks arising from its operations, including price risk (related to crude oil and oil products prices), foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, credit
risk and liquidity risk. It manages risks through a corporate policy established by its officers.
The objective of the overall risk management policy is to support the achievement of the Company’s strategic goals through an adequate resource allocation and an appropriate balance
between growth, return on investments and risk exposure level, which can arise from its normal activities or from the context within which the Company operates.
A summary of the positions held by the Company and recognized in other current assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2015, as well as the amounts recognized in the statement of income and
other comprehensive income and the guarantees given is set out following:

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
31.1.   Risk management of price risk (related to crude oil and oil products prices)
Petrobras does not usually use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to commodity price cycles related to products purchased and sold to fulfill operational needs. Derivatives are used
as hedging instruments to manage the price risk of certain short-term commercial transactions.
31.2.   Foreign exchange risk management
Petrobras seeks to identify and manage foreign exchange rate risks based on an integrated analysis of natural hedges, to benefit from the correlation between income and expenses. The
Company’s short-term risk management involves choosing the currency in which to hold cash, such as the Brazilian Real, U.S. dollar or other currency. The risk management strategy
involves the use of derivative instruments to hedge certain liabilities, minimizing foreign exchange rate risk exposure.
a)             Cash Flow Hedge involving the Company’s highly probable future exports
The Company designates hedging relationships to account for the effects of the existing natural hedge between a portion of its long-term debt obligations (denominated in U.S. dollars) and its
U.S. dollar denominated exports and to properly recognize that hedge in its financial statements.
Individual hedging relationships were designated in a one-to-one proportion, meaning that a portion of the total monthly exports will be the hedged transaction of an individual hedging
relationship, hedged by a portion of the company’s long-term debt (which has an average maturity of approximately 7.42 years).
The principal amounts, the fair value as of June 30, 2015, and a schedule of the expected reclassifications to statement of income of the balance of losses recognized in other
comprehensive income (shareholders’ equity) to be recycled to the statement of income based on a USD1.00 / R$ 3.1026 exchange rate, are set out below:

b)            Cash flow hedges involving swap contracts – Yen x Dollar
The Company has a cross currency swap to fix in U.S. dollars the payments related to bonds denominated in Japanese yen and does not intend to settle these contracts before the maturity.
The relationship between the derivative and the bonds was designated for cash flow hedge accounting.
c)             Sensitivity analysis for foreign exchange risk on financial instruments
A sensitivity analysis is set out below, showing the probable scenario for foreign exchange risk on financial instruments, computed based on external data along with stressed scenarios (a
25% and a 50% change in the foreign exchange rates), except for assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, when transacted in a currency equivalent to their respective functional
currencies.

(*) On June 30, 2015, the probable scenario was computed based on the following risks: Real x Dollar – a 2.49% depreciation of the Real / Yen x Dollar – a
2.35% depreciation of the Yen / Peso x Dollar: a 3.41% depreciation of the Peso/ Euro x Dollar: a 4.06% depreciation of the Euro / Pound Sterling x Dollar: a
3.35% depreciation of the Pound Sterling/ Real x Euro - a 1.67% appreciation of the Real / Real x Pound Sterling - 0.94% appreciation of the Real. The
probable scenario was determined based on the spot foreign exchange rates (PTAX selling rates) reported by Focus and Bloomberg.

31.3.   Interest rate risk management
The Company considers that interest rate risk does not create a significant exposure and therefore, preferably does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk,
except for specific situations encountered by certain subsidiaries of Petrobras.

Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras
Notes to the financial statements
(Expressed in millions of US Dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
31.4.   Credit risk
Credit risk management in Petrobras aims at minimizing risk of not collecting receivables, financial deposits or collateral from third parties or financial institutions through efficient credit
analysis, granting and management based on quantitative and qualitative parameters that are appropriate for each market segment in which the Company operates.
The commercial credit portfolio is very diversified and comprises clients from the domestic market and from foreign markets. Credit granted to financial institutions, related to collaterals
received, cash surplus invested and derivative financial instruments is spread among “investment grade” international banks rated by international rating agencies and highly-rated Brazilian
banks.
31.5.   Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is represented by the possibility of a shortage of cash or other financial assets in order to settle the Company’s obligations on the agreed dates and is managed by the Company
based on policies such as: centralized cash management, in order to optimize the level of cash and cash equivalents held and to reduce working capital; a minimum cash level to ensure that
cash needed for investments and short-term obligations is met even in adverse market conditions; increasing the number of investors in the domestic and international markets through
funding opportunities, developing a strong presence in the international capital markets and searching for new funding sources, including new markets and financial products.
This strategy is currently being achieved, for example, by seeking funding in the Asian banking market. The Company intends to use different funding sources (banking market, export credit
agencies - ECAs and capital markets) in 2015 to obtain the necessary funding to repay debt and fund its capital expenditures. In addition, the Company’s 2015/2016 divestment program of
US$ 15.1 billion will contribute to its funding needs.
A maturity schedule of the Company’s finance debt (undiscounted), including face value and interest payments is set out following:

32.        Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Fair values are determined based on market prices, when available, or, in the absence thereof, on the present value of expected future cash flows. The fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, short term debt and other non-current assets and liabilities are the same as or do not differ significantly from their carrying amounts.
The hierarchy of the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities, recorded on a recurring basis, is set out below:
-       Level 1 inputs: are the most reliable evidence of fair value, quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement
date.
-       Level 2 inputs: are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
-       Level 3 inputs: are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
