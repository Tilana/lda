<p><i>Stressing</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or 
humanitarian character, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of 
developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such 
countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their 
people,   
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income 
developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make 
their debt sustainable in the long term,   
</p>
<p><i>Noting with concern</i> that the total external debt of emerging and developing 
economies rose from 2,678.4 billion United States dollars in 2003 to 5,414.6 billion dollars 
in 2010 and is projected to rise to 6,446.3 billion dollars in 2012, and that debt service 
payments rose from 795.2 billion dollars in 2003 to 1,743.7 billion dollars in 2010, and 
were projected to rise to 2,010.8 billion and 2,265.5 billion in 2011 and 2012 respectively,<b>  
</b></p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the role, mandate and activities of other United Nations agencies, funds 
and programmes in dealing with the issues of foreign debt and international financial 
obligations,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced 
by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is 
unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-
centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing 
countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely 
constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide basic services<b> </b>to 
create the conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights,   
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing 
countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official 
development assistance,   
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing 
developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable 
human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the submission of the report of the Independent Expert on the 
effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights;1  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the work and contributions of the Independent Expert and 
endorses the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights, as annexed to his report; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages</i> all Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, as well as the private sector, to take into consideration the guiding principles 
when designing policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to develop a commentary to the guiding 
principles by inviting comments from States, international financial institutions, regional 
economic commissions, civil society organizations, the private sector and academia; 
</p>

<p>5. <i>Welcomes</i> the holding of the most recent expert meetings, in November 2011 
and February 2012, to review a new draft of the guiding principles prepared by the 
Independent Expert,<b> </b>and the active participation and contributions of several stakeholders, 
including States, international financial institutions, regional economic commissions, civil 
society organizations and academia;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recalls</i> that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the 
economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and 
responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to 
external specific prescriptions for economic policy;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recognizes</i> that structural adjustment reform programmes and policy 
conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give 
inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries 
manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that responses to the global financial and economic crises 
should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop 
debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human 
rights in affected countries;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that the level of implementation and the reduction of 
overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still 
low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-
term debt burden;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its conviction</i> that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve 
debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the 
above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in 
the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices 
for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt 
overhang;  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Regrets</i> the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the 
unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, 
and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current 
system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those 
of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an 
intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce 
substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those 
severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, 
and by armed conflicts;   
</p>
<p>12. <i>Affirms</i> that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive 
vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their 
human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights;   
</p>
<p>13. <i>Also affirms</i> that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the 
problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current 
system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those funds; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Acknowledges</i> that, in least developed countries and in several low- and 
middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a 
considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the 
Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be 
attained; </p>


<p>15. <i>Recognizes</i> that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that 
should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and 
development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, 
including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that 
debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, 
ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are 
accompanied by an increase in official development assistance;  
</p>
<p>16<i>.</i> <i>Recalls once again</i> the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the 
Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief without 
further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for 
their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction;   
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including the United Nations system, the 
Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions 
for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of major 
United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World 
Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable 
Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular 
those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in 
particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with 
economies in transition; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Recalls</i> the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General 
Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, 
equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-
servicing burdens of developing countries;   
</p>
<p>19. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign 
debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new 
loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative 
frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established 
to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or 
disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and 
programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their 
implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an 
equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development 
goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor 
countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the 
overall realization of human rights;   
</p>
<p>20. <i>Stresses</i> that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt 
should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national 
development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that 
ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights;   
</p>
<p>21.<b> </b><i>Also stresses</i> that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief 
and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not 
worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Calls upon</i> States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to 
continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without 
affecting ongoing programmes; </p>


<p>23. <i>Calls upon</i> creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and 
debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to 
development projects, loan agreements or poverty reduction strategy papers; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor 
countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy 
environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment 
policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt;   
</p>
<p>25. <i>Urges</i> States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take 
urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly 
affected by HIV/AIDS so that more financial resources may be released and used for health 
care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries;   
</p>
<p>26. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its view</i> that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem 
and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad 
political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial 
institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and 
responsibilities;   
</p>
<p>27. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its request</i> to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in 
particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures 
arising from foreign debt;   
</p>
<p>28. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with 
trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural 
adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted 
with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development with a 
view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign 
debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights;   
</p>
<p>29.<b> </b><i>Encourages</i> the Independent Expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance 
with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special 
rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Human 
Rights Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and 
cultural rights and the right to development in his work;  
</p>
<p>30. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to report to the General Assembly on the 
issue of the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of 
States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Independent Expert with all 
necessary assistance, in particular all the staff and resources required to carry out his 
functions;  
</p>
<p>32. <i>Urges</i> Governments, international organizations, international financial 
institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with 
the Independent Expert in the discharge of his mandate;  
</p>
<p>33. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to submit an analytical report on the 
implementation of the present resolution and on the process of developing the commentary 
to the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights to the Human Rights Council in 
2013, in accordance with its annual programme of work, and to submit a progress report 
thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session;  </p>


<p>34. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of this matter at its twenty-third session 
under the same agenda item.
