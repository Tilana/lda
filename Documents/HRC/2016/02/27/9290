<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The fourth mission to Cambodia of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
human rights in Cambodia, from 1 to 10 December 2007, centred on the theme of the rule of law, 
including access to justice. The framework of the rule of law gives valuable insights into the 
legal, judicial and political system of a country. It is an appropriate focus because the rule of law 
is a key concept in the Constitution of Cambodia itself. 
</p>
<p> The main issues analysed below relate to the criminal process, focusing on ending 
impunity, the rights of assembly and movement, and property rights, particularly those of 
indigenous peoples. This report discusses the prospects of the jurisprudence and practice of 
the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) (for trials of those most 
responsible for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime) having a positive impact on the 
Cambodian legal system. There is a section on the election system, a key component of 
democracy, where the rule of law is crucial, and a matter of some urgency as National Assembly 
elections are due in July 2008. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the third report by this Special Representative since his appointment by the 
Secretary-General on 1 November 2005, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 5/1. The Special Representative undertook his third mission to Cambodia from 29 
to 31 May and his fourth from 1 to 10 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. This report examines the extent to which the rule of law is observed in Cambodia. The 
framework of the rule of law enables one to gain valuable insights into the legal, judicial and 
political system of a country, exploring systematically the strengths and weaknesses of the legal 
and judicial system, and the impact of the analyses and recommendations of successive Special 
Representatives. The report examines how to maximize the impact of the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC)&#8217;s jurisprudence and practice on the Cambodian 
national legal system. 
</p>
<p>3. The report analyses the electoral system, considering what reforms may be appropriate for 
the National Assembly elections due in July 2008. 
</p>
<p>4. During his fourth mission, the Special Representative met with representatives of 
Cambodian civil society, the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BAKC), lawyers 
working with NGOs providing legal services, members of the diplomatic community, 
international agencies, development and international NGOs, journalists, prison officials and two 
detainees, judges, prosecutors, defenders and staff of ECCC. He regrets that requests to meet 
Prime Minister Hun Sen or any ministers or senior public servants were rejected, frustrating any 
dialogue. 
</p>
<p>5. He visited Rattanakiri province, and met with human rights associations, had a lengthy 
discussion with the Acting President of the provincial court, and visited the provincial prison. At 
the Kong Yu village he studied at first hand a land dispute between the indigenous villagers and 
a company, and had some unexpected experience of the sort of harassment that faces villagers 
and those showing an interest in their problems (see paragraph 70). The Deputy Provincial 
Governor was not in his office when the Special Representative went to keep an appointment 
with him. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Representative encountered communities who fear police aggression and 
arrest when he visited the Dey Krahom and Group 78 communities in Phnom Penh, where 
residents face illegal evictions. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Representative participated in ceremonies to mark International Human Rights 
Day, organized by civil society groups. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p>8. The importance of the rule of law and United Nations role in its promotion has been 
repeatedly emphasized. Visiting Cambodia in 2006, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Louise Arbour, described court reform as &#8220;the single most important area&#8221; requiring progress. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The 2005 World Summit held by the General Assembly identified the rule of law as a key area, 
emphasizing its indispensability for sustained growth, sustainable development and the 
eradication of poverty and hunger. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The rule of law and its importance 
</b></p>
<p>9. The rule of law means that the affairs of the State, and its relations with the people, are 
conducted strictly in accordance with its constitution and the law. This limits the powers of the 
State and protects citizens and communities against arbitrary acts of the State or others. Laws or 
policies inconsistent with the constitution are invalid. The law must be fair and respect 
fundamental human rights, and all citizens must receive equal treatment before the law. It is up 
to the courts to determine whether a law is invalid or to interpret the law. Laws must be 
accessible to all. They must be administered by an independent judiciary in a transparent way, 
and citizens&#8217; access to justice, including appropriate remedies, must be assured. Prosecutors and 
police must follow the law, not the dictates of the executive. 
</p>
<p>10. Legal institutions play a critical role in economic development, especially in the 
functioning of a market economy. The concepts of property, corporations and contracts, backed 
by an independent adjudicatory process, provide a foundation of predictability for economic 
activities. The rule-of-law framework is infinitely more sustainable for economic and social 
development than coercion and unlawful appropriations of property, relying on State power. 
</p>
<p>11. The establishment of the rule of law plays a critical role in the rehabilitation of a State and 
its officials after prolonged conflict, such as that in Cambodia, during which massive violations 
of the rule of law by the Khmer Rouge regime destroyed the very foundations of society. The 
rule of law is important for the legitimacy of the State in the eyes of the people. 
</p>
<p>12. The values and norms of the rule of law, incorporated in international instruments, is the 
responsibility of all States and the international community. The rule of law is most threatened 
by the Government, by corruption among public servants and by judges or prosecutors who are 
not independent and take orders from the Government. Lawyers must be free to protect their 
clients without intimidation by the Government or influential persons, or the bar association. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Rule of law in the Constitution of Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p>13. With these considerations in mind, the international community and the various 
Cambodian groups in the 1991 Paris Agreements emphasized human rights, democracy, and 
legal and judicial institutions, culminating in the Constitution, which was adopted by the freely 
elected Constituent Assembly. 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Cambodia represents a commitment of the Cambodian people to 
democracy, human rights and the rule of law. One aspiration of Cambodia is to be a country 
&#8220;abiding by the law&#8221; (Preamble). Various other provisions emphasize the supremacy of the 
Constitution and the law, including articles 49, 52 and 150. 
</p>
<p>15. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and human rights treaties are binding (art. 31). 
This was confirmed in a recent, very welcome ruling by the Constitutional Council. Foremost is 
the right of all citizens to equality before the law (art. 31, para. 2). No one may be prosecuted, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>arrested or detained except in accordance with the law; confessions obtained by physical or 
mental force are not admissible evidence; the accused are presumed innocent and have the right 
to defence (art. 38). The Constitution recognizes the fundamental freedoms of movement, 
assembly and association, and the right to participate actively in the political, economic, social 
and cultural life of the nation. Under article 44, all citizens have the right to own land, and 
property may only be confiscated in the public interest, as provided for by law, and after 
payment of fair and just compensation. 
</p><p>16. The independence of the judiciary (art. 128) and the separation of powers (art. 51) 
underpinning that independence are fundamental. Judges must adjudicate &#8220;with strict respect for 
the laws, wholeheartedly and conscientiously&#8221; (art. 129, para. 2). The King has personal 
responsibility for guaranteeing judicial independence, presiding over the independent Supreme 
Council of Magistracy (SCM) which advises him on the organization and independence of the 
judiciary and prosecution (art. 134). 
17. The Constitution guarantees a market economy, central to which is the rule of law. And 
because, especially in developing countries, the greatest threat to the market economy often 
comes from the misuse of power of the State, the Constitution precludes members of the 
Government from engaging in trade or industry or holding any position in the public service 
(art. 101). 
</p>
<p>18. After 1993, a dynamic civil society movement emerged for the first time, in the space 
created by the active involvement of the international community. However, post-conflict 
development, with which the international community has been closely associated, has led to the 
formation of a strong State, with all its elements, such as the bureaucracy, the police and the 
military. Its monopoly of force has endowed it with enormous capacity for coercion, balanced by 
neither legislature nor judiciary. The space for civil society is steadily shrinking. State officials, 
and powerful interests around them, are able to appropriate natural and economic resources, as 
well as the property of others, punish their opponents and suppress their rights, while civil 
society has limited impact. The norms, institutions and procedures of the rule of law can help to 
restore a measure of the balance within the State, between its three constitutive powers, and 
between it and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RECORD OF RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA 
</b></p>
<p>19. A respected Cambodian human rights organization begins a recent report:<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cambodian justice system has failed. Despite the UNTAC intervention and 15 years 
of aid to legal and judicial reform, in 2007, the primary functions of the courts continue to 
be: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To prosecute political opponents and other critics of the Government 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  &#8220;Human rights in Cambodia: The charade of justice&#8221;, published by the Ligue cambodgienne 
</p>
<p>des droits de l&#8217;homme (LICADHO), December 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To perpetuate impunity for State actors and their associates 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To promote the economic interests of the rich and powerful.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>After considerable documentary research (including reports of his predecessors) and discussions 
with many individuals and groups in Cambodia, poor and powerful alike, and after studying the 
reports of national and international organizations, the Special Representative agrees with this 
assessment. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal development 
</b></p>
<p>20. Of eight key laws which the Government promised to complete by the end of 2005, the 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) and the Penal Procedure Code (PPC) came into force, and the 
Civil Code and the Penal Code are expected to come into force, in 2008. These codes will lead to 
improvements in the legal process. However, initial analysis indicates some weaknesses that may 
aggravate violations of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>21. The previous law<b>2</b> permitted pretrial detention for up to four months, and two additional 
months by reasoned decision of the judge. The new PPC permits the four-month pretrial 
detention in misdemeanour cases to be extended, two months at a time (up to half the minimum 
sentence) (art. 209). The 6-month limit for felonies can now be extended up to 18 months, 
6 months at a time (art. 208). Given the unprincipled ways in which many prosecutors and courts 
use their powers, these extensions are retrograde. 
</p>
<p>22. Even acquitted persons are held in detention pending an appeal by the prosecutor (arts. 307 
and 398). Prosecutors routinely appeal against acquittal, regardless of the prospects of 
overturning the decision. This rule applies even to persons who have been detained for as long as 
the possible sentence. An appeal can take months and numerous persons can be held in detention 
for unconscionably long periods. 
</p>
<p>23. PPC permits police detention of 24 hours before a detainee can see a lawyer or other 
person for 30 minutes (art. 98). (By contrast, in France this 30-minute conversation with a 
lawyer occurs at the beginning of the detention and again after 20 hours). Perhaps unsurprisingly 
a local commentator has challenged the view that these laws represent real reforms.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>24. Previously, a confession could not be a basis for conviction unless corroborated by other 
evidence. This safeguard is removed, giving confessions the same weight as other evidence 
(art. 321), although PPC reiterates the prohibition on the use of coerced confessions. There is a 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  &#8220;Provisions relating to the judiciary and criminal law and procedure applicable in Cambodia 
</p>
<p>during the transitional period&#8221;, adopted by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia 
(UNTAC), 10 September 1992. 
<b>3
</b>  See note 1 above, p. 23. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>heavy reliance on confessions, many obtained through coercion or torture. The new rule could 
undermine the prohibition of evidence obtained by forced confessions by the Constitution and 
the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>25. Excessive delays mark the Cambodian court system, partly because of serious shortages 
of courts and judges, and the travel involved for people. The requirement of a three-judge bench 
for felonies will aggravate this problem as it now requires a three-judge bench for felony cases 
(art. 289). The Special Representative understands that the intention is to discourage corruption 
in the judiciary. However, empirical evidence elsewhere suggests that this is not necessarily a 
safeguard against corruption. 
</p>
<p>26. The Civil Procedure Code (CPC) introduces various court fees which place the civil courts 
out of reach of most ordinary Cambodians. Substantial deposits must be lodged with the courts, 
which may award costs against the losing party. These substantially increase the overheads of 
organizations providing essential legal assistance to the poor. Without State-funded legal aid, 
such rules always work to the disadvantage of the poor. 
</p>
<p>27. There has been less progress on other urgent laws. The Law on the Organization and 
Functioning of the Courts has been delayed by disagreement between the Ministry of Justice and 
SCM over who should administer the courts. Ministry control would be inconsistent with the 
separation of powers and independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>28. The constitutionally required law on the status of judges (art. 135) has made little progress. 
Without this, judges cannot, as stipulated in the Constitution, elect their members of SCM, who 
are meanwhile appointed on the instructions of the executive. Nor has progress been made on the 
amendment to the Law on the SCM, necessary to establish judicial independence and curb 
corruption. Likewise, slow progress has been made towards the adoption of the anti-corruption 
law. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Representative regrets particularly the continued lack of real progress on the 
development of a framework for the registration of land belonging to indigenous peoples. The 
Special Representative, and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, Miloon Kothari, in his 
report to the Council of 21 March 2006,<b>4</b> have previously urged the speedy enactment of a 
sub-decree on the registration of indigenous land. The Special Representative fears that due to 
this delay most indigenous communities may lose their lands, frequently in an arbitrary and 
abusive manner, before its enactment. Many persons told the Special Representative that the 
delay was deliberate, in order to promote Rattanakiri and Mondulkiri, two provinces where 
indigenous peoples form the majority of the population, as the &#8220;fourth development pole&#8221; 
by 2015. The Government has ignored his previous recommendation to suspend dealings in 
indigenous peoples&#8217; land until enactment of the sub-decree. 
</p>
<p>30. The need for reform and clarity in land legislation goes beyond the indigenous peoples&#8217; 
issue. Mr. Kothari, surveying all land laws as they affect the right to housing, concluded that 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  See E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>because of &#8220;the legislative vacuum and ineffective enforcement of existing laws, an increase in 
forced evictions, relocations and displacements of a large number of families can be expected in 
the near future&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>31. There has been little progress on the proposed Law on Peaceful Demonstrations. The 
urgency of the need for a new law is emphasized by the Constitutional Council&#8217;s decision that all 
laws must respect human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>32. A major problem is the failure to apply the law fairly and consistently. The law is applied 
or not applied, depending on the objectives of the Government or local authorities. This 
unprincipled approach to the law is the cause of numerous human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Prosecutorial independence 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Representative has previously observed that many prosecutors fail to meet 
national and international standards requiring impartiality and integrity, in the public interest 
rather than for partisan interests. Complaints filed by senior government officials, even when 
based on weak or unsubstantiated evidence, are prosecuted with vigour, while the vast majority 
of the populace have little hope or expectation of having their grievances taken up by public 
prosecutors.<b>6</b> Although some prosecutors try to perform their functions impartially, and at some 
personal risk, the overall situation has not improved. 
</p>
<p>34. Offences under the law for infringement of rights to land have not been used to protect 
communities whose rights have been violated by influential individuals, companies or 
government entities. Action has not been taken against those who have illegally sold or bought 
land occupied by others, or infringed their rights to land and forest resources. 
</p>
<p>35. Conversely, when legal proceedings are instituted against a well-placed person or company 
(or when communities resist evictions or the appropriation of their land), it is not unusual for the 
plaintiff (or community representatives) to be accused of some offence, for example &#8220;destruction 
of property&#8221; or &#8220;infringement of property&#8221;. The result of such accusation may be that the person 
is taken into custody and is unable to pursue his or her rights under the law. In Kong Yu 
(see paragraph 65), villagers were accused of criminal defamation after filing legal action against 
Keat Kolney and others, including local officials, to annul an allegedly fraudulent land deal. 
</p>
<p>36. Following the violent eviction of more than 100 families in Spean Ches, Sihanoukville, by 
armed police officers in April 2007, 13 villagers were arrested and charged with battery with 
injury and wrongful damage to property, or complicity. No action has been taken against police 
officers who used excessive force, destroying homes and assaulting residents. 
</p>
<p>37. At the Dey Krahom community in central Phnom Penh, 13 community representatives face 
criminal charges following attempts to prevent evictions. The legality of the evictions has not 
been examined by the courts. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3, para. 29. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See E/CN.4/2006/110. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. Criminal charges relating to ownership of land should be suspended until the preliminary 
question of ownership is determined in civil proceedings (art. 343). Yet charges of infringement 
of private property continue to be pursued against community members involved in land disputes 
over the ownership of unregistered land. 
</p>
<p>39. The actual use of the PPC provisions, and previous rules, in connection with detention of 
unconvicted persons gives rise to great concern. Though article 203 suggests that detention 
should be exceptional, in practice almost all accused persons, including most juveniles, are 
detained pending trial, even for minor offences, and often for periods greatly exceeding the 
statutory time limits. Many do not see a lawyer during their incarceration. 
</p>
<p>40. In May and June 2007, three community members from O&#8217;Vor Preng, Battambang 
province, were charged with infringement of private property in relation to a dispute over 
unregistered land with a well-connected businessman. Two were granted bail, and the trial judge 
suspended the charge against the third, awaiting resolution of the land ownership dispute; yet all 
remained in detention because the prosecutor appealed. The men were finally released in late 
September 2007, after community members called upon the Ministry of Justice to intervene with 
the prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>41. Chhea Nee was convicted of two charges in relation to a dispute over land involving the 
military and wealthy businessmen in Bavel district, Battambang province. Despite having served 
the sentences imposed, he remained in prison, as the prosecutor appealed. Chhea Nee was finally 
released on 6 December 2007, after the prosecutor exercised his discretion under article 398 of 
the PPC to release him pending the appeal. It is hoped that other prosecutors will exercise their 
discretion similarly. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Judicial independence 
</b></p>
<p>42. Human rights observers generally agree that &#8220;despite repeated public pledges by the Royal 
Cambodian Government of its commitment to judicial and legal reforms, and millions of dollars 
invested by foreign donors in reform programmes since 1992, there has been no progress 
whatsoever in the single most important issue affecting the courts: their lack of independence 
from political and financial influence&#8221; (see LICADHO report, 2007). There is a very deliberate 
manipulation of the judiciary to serve interests of particular ministers or their business friends. 
</p><p>43. The President of the Court of Appeal was removed on 9 August 2007 on the instructions of 
the executive, denying the judge due process guaranteed under the Constitution and international 
law. Her replacement was to be an ECCC judge (see paragraph 84). The appointment of four 
new members of SCM by another royal decree (NS/RKT/0807/340) appeared to have been made 
similarly on executive instructions, contrary to the law. 
</p>
<p>44. In his first report, the Special Representative expressed concern at the composition of 
SCM, which includes a government minister and a member of the ruling party&#8217;s Permanent 
Committee. But these recent royal decrees actually sideline the SCM, leaving it only a role in 
implementing, together with the Supreme Council for State Reform, a decision that it did not 
formally make. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Independence of the legal profession and the provision of legal services 
</b></p>
<p>45. The legal profession is regulated under the Law on the Bar, which proclaims the 
independence and autonomy of the profession and gives its members the monopoly of providing 
legal services (art. 1). The Law regulates qualifications for entry into the profession and the 
provision of legal services (some rules concern preserving the monopoly of the profession and 
some conflict of interests). 
</p>
<p>46. From 2004 to 2006, BAKC was paralysed by a dispute, with heavy political overtones, 
over its presidency. Since October 2006 it has regained some stability. However, it is perceived 
as being closely tied to the Government, and several lawyers and NGOs have told the Special 
Representative that BAKC is not independent of political pressures. 
</p>
<p>47. The Cambodian legal profession is very small but growing, and availability of services to 
the poor is thus limited. Research suggests that fewer than half of the accused in criminal cases 
in which having a lawyer is not mandatory, are represented; even in serious cases, where it is 
mandatory, about 30 per cent of the accused are unrepresented. 
</p>
<p>48. The Government has no legal aid scheme. BAKC, with little funding from government and 
foreign donors, can provide limited legal aid. However the principal source of legal advice and 
representation, especially in the rural areas, is NGOs. These have lawyers on their staff who 
represent the poor, and since the mid-1990s legal aid NGOs have done very valuable work. 
</p>
<p>49. These lawyers and NGOs face many obstacles, placed in their way by powerful members 
of the community, with assistance from the authorities, and, unfortunately, it seems, BAKC. 
There have been cases of rich or well-connected litigants trying to get the lawyers of their less 
powerful opponents investigated for criminal offences - such as &#8220;incitement&#8221; - simply for 
performing their professional responsibilities of acting for the poor. In the Kong Yu case 
(see paragraph 65) the villagers&#8217; lawyers have been accused of criminal incitement. Cases should 
be allowed to proceed, rather than being diverted and even derailed by harassment of the 
lawyers. 
</p>
<p>50. NGOs complain that in various ways their work has become more difficult. They 
experience greater difficulty in holding meetings with clients, including in getting access to 
prisoners. New court fees will make bringing cases harder (and commune officials demand 
bribes for a certificate of financial status by which the poor could obtain exemption from fees). 
Some NGOs report that their staff have experienced what feels like intimidation from the Bar 
and has led some lawyers to resign and move into private practice. 
</p>
<p>51. Preserving professional independence is undoubtedly important. But recent efforts of 
BAKC to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the activities of these legal aid NGOs can reasonably 
be viewed as having other motives. When concerns are raised by a body that shows some 
hostility to the NGO movement, it cannot appear even-handed, especially when the Bar itself is 
seen as being closely linked to the Government. BAKC has suggested that the Law on the Bar 
prohibits legal practice by NGO-employed lawyers. On the other hand it has asked NGOs to sign 
memorandums of understanding with it in order to carry out their legal aid work. It halted a legal 
internship programme (the USAID-funded Law Fellows Program) despite it having been </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>previously approved by the Bar. Any concerns about lawyers being employed should be raised 
with all employers, including Government and the private sector, and not just with NGOs. As 
NGOs have a central role in providing legal aid services for the poor, and thus essentially 
fulfilling a mandate of the Bar, any differences should be ironed out in a spirit of cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISREGARD OF THE RULE OF LAW 
</b>52. The above analysis shows that laws, institutions, procedures critical to the rule of law are 
very little respected in Cambodia - especially by the State. Numerous reports by the Special 
Representatives and national and international organizations have highlighted serious 
consequences of this. For the most part, the Government has made no serious attempt to deny, 
much less refute, these findings or to take serious action to address these issues.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Undermining of the Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>53. The most serious consequence is that many important provisions of the Constitution of 
Cambodia designed to protect the rights of the people and to promote good and fair governance 
are negated, and the status of the Constitution as the supreme law is undermined. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Impunity and victimization 
</b></p>
<p>54. Prosecutorial and judicial functions are subordinated to the executive in political cases or 
cases involving powerful interests, and judges&#8217; rulings are too often influenced by money. 
Governmental instructions to prosecutors or judges are duly carried out, regardless of the 
evidence or the law. Control of prosecutors means that members of the executive and their 
friends enjoy wide impunity from the penalties of the law, while others are prosecuted for and 
convicted of offences they have not committed. Courts become the central arena of violations of 
the law and the denial of justice. The very threat of legal action by the executive is often 
sufficient to force the targeted person to bow to pressure, go into hiding, or flee the country. 
</p>
<p>55. It is not uncommon for senior opposition politicians to be charged and convicted 
without evidence, and to be subsequently pardoned, as part of a political deal (or to soften 
up international donors before crucial pledging conferences) - disregarding the law that the 
power of pardon lies with the King, and not the Government.<b>7</b> Victims have included 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy, Prince Norodom Sirivuddh and Cheam Channy.  
</p>
<p>56. Politically motivated charges are also used to give impunity to government prot&#233;g&#233;s. 
Born Samnang and Sok Sam Ouen were convicted for the killing of independent trade union 
leader Chea Vichea in 2004,<b>8</b> largely on the basis of a retracted confession, despite 
overwhelming evidence demonstrating that neither could have taken part. On 12 April 2007, 
the Appeal Court upheld the convictions, ignoring crucial new evidence and Born Samnang&#8217;s 
complaint that his confession was coerced, and although the prosecutor said that there were 
&#8220;huge gaps in the police investigation&#8221; and called for a reinvestigation to find the &#8220;real killers&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  See pp. 2-6 of the LICADHO report, &#8220;The charade of justice&#8221; for examples. 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  See A/HRC/4/36, paras. 43 and 55. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. On 28 February 2007, another trade union leader, Hy Vuthy, was shot and killed by 
unidentified gunmen. The police investigation has stalled. The case of trade unionist 
Ros Sovannareth killed on 7 May 2004 has been related in previous reports. 
</p>
<p>58. In 1999, the then Special Representative, Thomas Hammarberg, wrote: &#8220;The phenomenon 
of impunity and its institutional expression constitutes the single most important obstacle to the 
effort to establish the rule of the law in Cambodia&#8221;.<b>9</b> This enables the persecution of human 
rights activists, vulnerable land- and house-owners, trade unionists and others. The 2007 
LICADHO report, cited above, discusses numerous cases of impunity, including more recent 
ones.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violations of the principles of the market 
</b></p>
<p>59. Although a market economy is guaranteed by the Constitution, some of the ways in which 
the Government manages the economy distort key principles of the market mechanism, resulting 
in the misallocation of resources. They prevent the growth of the entrepreneurial spirit, make a 
mockery of property rights and the binding nature of contracts, lead to weak trade unions often 
having to confront &#8220;strong&#8221; and brutal companies, often protected by local authorities, the police 
and the military, resulting in poor conditions for workers. This does not promote development of 
negotiating skills or familiarity with pricing policies. Dependence on foreign skills and 
management retards development of local capacity; and business relies for its profits on superior 
access to decision-makers, rather than fair competition. Consensual transactions, fundamental to 
the market, are largely missing, replaced by coercion or favours.  
</p>
<p>60. The negative impact on the market mechanism and the misuse of resources that follow 
from the absence of the rule of law are clearly demonstrated in the report of the international 
NGO, Global Witness, &#8220;Cambodia&#8217;s family trees: Illegal logging and the stripping of public 
assets by Cambodia&#8217;s elite&#8221;,<b>11</b> published in June 2007. It recounts the story of a syndicate 
involved in logging in Prey Long, whose owners or associates are connected to some of the most 
senior ministers and officials.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  E/CN.4/1999/101, para. 45. 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  Pp. 11 to 15. 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  See www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/546/en/cambodias_family_trees. 
</p>
<p>Global Witness was at one stage appointed as official monitor of logging activity, but when it 
uncovered information unfavourable to the Government, this mandate was revoked. When this 
report came out in June 2007, instead of dealing with these allegations, the Government 
banned it and confiscated all copies. The Special Representative met the representatives of 
Global Witness in 2007 to probe them in depth about the reliability of their information and was 
persuaded of the accuracy of the report. Since this report was prepared, the Government of the 
United States, at the urging of the Congress, has banned the top officials of the company 
(including ministers) from entering the country.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>61. Confirming a special report on economic concessions by the previous Special 
Representative, the Global Witness report adds: &#8220;In the mid-1990s, senior government ministers 
secretly awarded between 30 and 40 logging concessions to Cambodian and foreign-owned 
companies, giving away 39 per cent of Cambodia&#8217;s land area, on terms that greatly favoured the 
interests of the concessionaires over those of Cambodia. All these concessionaires proceeded to 
break the law or the terms of their contracts or both. By the end of the decade, they were 
responsible for most of the illegal logging in Cambodia&#8221; (p. 12). According to the report, the 
company and its associates have committed numerous breaches of the laws: illegal 
appropriations of public property; intimidation, detention and illegal confinement; attempts to 
kill; harvesting of forest products without a permit; destruction of property; illegal transport of 
timber; processing of timber in the forest; corruption of forestry officials; organized crime; 
extortion from employees of the Forest Administration; evading import duties and export taxes. 
The principal finding is that this industry is run by a network of alliances and companies that rely 
on the support of government institutions aided by some senior ministers. The company has 
committed massive violations of the law, including those concerning State and private property, 
taxation, and the penal code - with total impunity. Victims of this illicit economy, whether 
through the appropriation of their property, intimidation or illegal detentions, have no redress. 
The beneficiaries are a relatively small group of tycoons with political, business or familial ties 
to senior officials. There is widespread use of police and army. Brigade 70, often described as 
the personal army of Prime Minister Hun Sen, acts as a specialist provider of transport and 
protection to the most powerful timber barons (ibid., p. 72). The army itself is involved in illegal 
logging.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Land rights and conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>62. A study of land transactions shows the consequences of the failure to implement the law 
and market principles. The subordination of the prosecutors and courts to the will of the 
Government has resulted in much injustice in land transactions and appropriations (for details, 
see the 2006 report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, Miloon Kothari<b>12</b>). Forcible 
and illegal evictions continue unabated. The Special Rapporteur noted that, prior to or during 
forced evictions, threats, intimidations, and physical violence are used by local authorities and 
private developers, sometimes in the presence of military and police forces.  
</p>
<p>63. Land rights are regularly violated with impunity by influential individuals, companies and 
government entities. Owners are often compelled to accept paltry sums, despite evidence of 
legitimate tenure or land titles, or to move to alternative sites. These sites are usually devoid of 
alternative housing, sanitation facilities and medical services, and are usually far from where 
residents worked, adding much to their survival costs. In a few instances (such as in Koh Pich), 
and often after a long battle, those evicted were eventually afforded acceptable compensation. 
Other evictees have simply been dumped onto a wasteland and now live in makeshift camps (for 
example, in Andong).  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. Victims are rarely able to invoke remedies, including compensation, provided in the law. 
Mr. Kothari noted the courts&#8217; reluctance to assist in enforcing the law. According to testimonies 
he received, the investigative procedures adopted by courts to ensure the legitimacy and legality 
of ownership titles are insufficient. Court decisions allegedly favour those who have acquired 
titles illicitly, to the detriment of families who should benefit from the 2001 Land Law 
provisions concerning ownership rights resulting from extended land possession and occupation. 
Indigenous peoples have suffered greatly, as shown above, even as Cambodia voted for the 
recent United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was adopted by 
the General Assembly on 13 September 2007. 
</p>
<p>65. Kong Yu village is in O&#8217;Yadao District of Rattanakiri Province, and is inhabited by 
indigenous Jarai people. The villagers told the Special Representative, as they have others, that 
they had reluctantly agreed to part with 50 hectares of their traditional land for &#8220;disabled 
soldiers&#8221;. They were later asked for their thumbprints: firstly, when they were inebriated, on 
blank papers, and subsequently, in the presence of local chiefs, on documents in Khmer, which 
they do not understand. They received sums of money that they believed to be compensation for 
the 50 hectares conceded. Then land started to be cleared for a rubber plantation and the villagers 
were told they had sold 500 hectares to a company, in which a majority shareholder is 
Keat Kolney, sister of the Minister for Finance and the wife of a senior public servant. They 
complained to the commune chief, and the next day the district police and gendarmerie 
threatened villagers with prosecution and imprisonment. Villagers reported that they have lost 
access to vegetation they used to collect from the forest, have insufficient land for future use, and 
are unable to leave their cattle free to roam, in case they wander onto the rubber plantation and 
are confiscated. Children are kept home from school in order to take care of the cattle. 
</p>
<p>66. When contacted for her side of the story, Keat Kolney arranged for the Special 
Representative to meet her lawyer and a company manager with whom he had a lengthy 
discussion on the facts and legal issues. The company&#8217;s representatives insisted that the villagers 
had willingly and knowingly sold all the land and showed copies of the thumb-printed 
documents and photographs of persons allegedly thumb-printing the documents. 
</p>
<p>67. The matter is now before the courts, and the Special Representative takes no position on 
the facts. The significance of the case is that this is precisely the sort of community the Land 
Law was designed to protect, yet they are losing their land without having the benefit of 
procedures to protect them, and feel strongly that they have been cheated. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Civil society undermined 
</b></p>
<p>68. The failure to respect existing constitutional guarantees and legal human rights also 
restricts the exercise by civil society organizations of the fundamental freedoms that are essential 
to the realization by people of their economic, social and political rights.  
</p>
<p>69. Organizations assisting local communities to defend their rights to land have been 
subjected to arbitrary restrictions. In Rattanakiri and Mondulkiri, provincial authorities have 
been requesting such organizations to apply for permission to visit affected communities and 
villages, to hold meetings with villagers, to organize workshops on land rights and to protest 
peacefully against land grabbing. On 16 October 2007, 12 community members affected by a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dam upstream in Viet Nam were denied &#8220;permission&#8221; to travel to Phnom Penh to attend a 
community workshop, and the deputy provincial governor requested that provincial police stop 
them from leaving the province. NGOs have informed the Special Representative that local 
police prevented the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights and the affiliated Voice of Democracy 
from holding public forums in Kong Yu village in September and November 2007. NGOs 
operating in Rattanakiri are requested to seek permission to organize any event, a restriction that 
appears to have no legal basis. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Representative had a taste of this approach to those who show an interest in 
the villagers when he visited Kong Yu on 3 December 2007, with officials of OHCHR. As the 
meeting ended, a number of armed police and military arrived, led by the district governor who 
asked, somewhat aggressively, why the visitors had not asked for written permission. He 
explained that anyone, including United Nations officials, who came to the district, required 
permission from provincial authorities, although he could not specify the relevant legislation.  
</p>
<p>71. In the course of 2007, numerous instances of such restrictions brought the peaceful 
exercise of the rights to peaceful assembly, demonstration and expression to a virtual halt. 
Recent examples include 48 Khmer Krom monks, demonstrating peacefully in front of the 
Embassy of Viet Nam in December 2007, who were dispersed with excessive force by the 
police; two monks were seriously injured by electric shock batons, one falling unconscious. 
On 29 November 2007, a strike by female workers at the Fortune Garment Woollen Knitting 
Company in Kandal province, was brutally broken up by a large contingent of police and 
anti-riot police, using tear gas, batons and electric truncheons, resulting in several workers being 
injured.  
</p><p>72. The Phnom Penh Municipality initially banned a peaceful march in the centre of the capital 
to celebrate International Human Rights Day on 10 December 2007, citing unspecified security 
concerns. It was eventually authorized, after the intercession of the Ministry of Interior, but on a 
much smaller scale and along a shorter route.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  The overall picture 
</b></p>
<p>73. In summary, when there is no rule of law, what a powerful individual or group cannot 
obtain by legal means, they try to obtain by force. Numerous titles to property in Cambodia are 
tainted by illegality. The police and the military are often used to promote these illegal purposes 
and thus forced into the betrayal of their public duties. To secure titles to property which belong 
to others, to get licences and permits to achieve advantages over competitors, to avoid taxes, one 
has to bribe a large number of officials so that corruption becomes deeply embedded in State and 
society. In a State marked by the absence of the rule of law, it is all too easy to violate the rights 
of others, with total impunity, if one is powerful. Whether to obey the law ceases to be a moral 
question, but one driven by opportunism. Laws may be made under pressures from donors, but 
there is no intention to enforce laws inconvenient to the ruling group. As exploitation of 
resources and of people increases, there is greater resort to oppression by the State. Movement of 
those who struggle against oppression is controlled. The desire of people to assemble freely is 
seen as dangerous, and the freedom of expression has to be curtailed, while threats, harassment, 
intimidation, attacks, and even extrajudicial killings may be necessary to curb more determined 
opponents who cannot be bribed or cajoled. Above all, people have to be taught to fear the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rulers, by their caprice and unpredictability, and especially brute force. In the long run, the 
increasing inability of courts to settle disputes in a fair manner will produce problems of law and 
order, aggravate tensions and conflicts and the risk of violence and responses of public defiance 
that will be hard to manage.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EXTRAORDINARY CHAMBERS IN THE COURTS OF CAMBODIA 
</b></p>
<p>74. In 2007, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), set up to deal 
with the proceedings against senior Khmer Rouge leaders and those most responsible for crimes 
and serious violations of Cambodian and international law, really began their work. Five senior 
leaders of the Khmer Rouge are in the custody of the ECCC, being investigated for prosecution. 
It is expected that trials will commence in mid-2008.  
</p>
<p>75. The principal justifications for the trials include that they would: (a) provide accountability 
to the millions of Cambodians for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge; (b) have a deterrent effect by 
demonstrating that there can be no impunity for violations of human rights; (c) enhance people&#8217;s 
understanding of justice and the rule of law; and (d) the jurisprudence and practices of the ECCC 
would be absorbed by the rest of the Cambodian system of justice.  
</p><p>76. There are various positive developments. The internal rules were agreed upon, albeit 
through very protracted negotiations which nearly brought the process to a premature end. It is 
well known that the international and Cambodian judges and prosecutors of the ECCC have been 
at loggerheads, although the Special Representative was assured by them that the two sides have 
developed good working relations. The public has taken a keen interest in the trials. And the 
participation of the community and victims has been secured through the procedure of Civil 
Party Action, which allows victims to seek collective and moral reparations.  
</p>
<p>77. There is much that Cambodian lawyers and judges - and indeed, others - can learn from the 
ECCC. The Special Representative welcomes the care with which the co-investigating judges in 
the case of the application of Kaing Guek Eav (see paragraphs 87-89 below) examined the law 
and legal precedents as well as the facts of the case (something that Cambodian courts do not 
often do). He noted with great satisfaction the mode and presentation of legal arguments, through 
careful drafting of charges, the submission of written briefs by the lawyers, and careful and 
detailed decisions of the prosecutors and judges. All made full reference to international and 
regional jurisprudence on human rights, with well researched notes on the due process provisions 
of international treaties. This is particularly welcome in the wake of the ruling of the 
Constitutional Council that international human rights treaties entrenched in the constitution are 
binding on Cambodian courts. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Structure of decision-making within the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia  
</b></p>
<p>78. Being part of the Cambodian court system with a special status, the staff of the 
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) (including prosecutors and judges) 
are drawn from both Cambodia and the international community. All judges and prosecutors are 
appointed by SCM, the internationals from among nominees of the United Nations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General. Thus Cambodia can to a limited extent decide on the appointment of 
international judges, investigating judges and prosecutors, but the United Nations has no say in 
the appointment of Cambodian counterparts.  
</p>
<p>79. In the Pre-Trial and Trial Chambers there are three Cambodian judges and two 
international judges. In the Supreme Court Chamber, there are four Cambodians and three 
internationals. The Pre-Trial and Trial Chambers must decide by the affirmative votes of at least 
four judges and in the Supreme Court Chambers by the affirmative votes of at least five judges. 
It would therefore be possible for Cambodian judges to block a conviction even if all the 
international judges supported it. This is curious, since the international judges have, and were 
always expected to have, greater expertise in the law about war crimes and crimes against 
humanity, and longer judicial experience than their Cambodian counterparts.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Issues of independence and administration 
</b></p>
<p>80. When, in 1997, the Government requested the United Nations to assist with trials, the 
Secretary-General appointed an eminent Group of Experts to advise him.<b>13</b>  
</p>
<p>81. After a careful assessment of the Cambodian judiciary (including admissions from some 
&#8220;high officials&#8221;), the Group concluded that endemic corruption and political influence would 
make it impossible for Cambodian prosecutors, investigators and judges to be free from political 
pressure and that decisions on &#8220;whom to investigate and indict, and to convict and acquit would 
be based on political considerations rather than the evidence&#8221; (para. 134). It rejected a mixed 
court (with equal numbers of foreign and local judges and prosecutors) and particularly opposed 
the appointment of a Cambodian as prosecutor or deputy prosecutor (para. 163). 
</p>
<p>82. Whether this considered advice, which was overruled by political expediency, was justified 
or not remains to be seen. The United Nations-Cambodia Agreement stipulates that judges and 
prosecutors shall be of &#8220;high moral character, impartiality and integrity &#8230; be independent in the 
performance of their functions and shall not accept or seek instructions from any Government or 
any other source&#8221; (art. 9 (3)). However, the Cambodian judges include two who have presided 
over much criticized trials of prominent opposition figures, one who twice ruled against 
Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun (see paragraph 56 above) and who acquitted the 
Prime Minister&#8217;s nephew of manslaughter in 2004 in dubious circumstances, one who admitted 
having taken money from parties to litigation and one who had never been a judge before.<b>14</b> 
When these appointments were criticized, Reach Sambath, ECCC spokesperson, suggested that 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  The Group of Experts includes Sir Ninian Stephen, a distinguished Australian lawyer and a 
</p>
<p>former Governor-General of his country; Justice Rajsommer Lallah, former Chief Justice of 
Mauritius and a member of the Human Rights Committee; and Prof. Steven Ratner, a leading 
international lawyer from the United States of America. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  See LICADHO report, p. 25. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>service in the tribunal would enable the judges to &#8220;rebuild their reputations&#8221;<b>15</b> The Prime 
Minister described those who made the criticisms as &#8220;animals&#8221; who &#8220;want to seduce their own 
parents&#8221;.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>83. It is likely that these appointments were decided by the Government rather than the SCM, 
like the removal of the President of the Appeal Court and replacement by Judge You Bunleng of 
ECCC (as is clear from the relevant Royal Decree).<b>17</b> Under criticism from the Special 
Representative and the Special Rapporteur for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers and 
other quarters, the Government &#8220;clarified&#8221; that You Bunleng would for the time being remain 
with ECCC while simultaneously discharging his duties as President of the Court of Appeal.  
</p>
<p>84. The Expert Group observed that the objectives of the trials would not be achieved if the 
Cambodian people did not have confidence in the fairness of the process, but regarded it as a 
partisan political exercise. Furthermore, although the jurisdiction of ECCC was restricted to 
&#8220;senior leaders of the Democratic Kampuchea and those who were most responsible for the 
crimes committed&#8221;, if only the persons currently in the custody of ECCC are accused, the people 
may not feel that this is adequate. The real test will be if a suspect in or close to the Government 
is investigated and brought before the ECCC.<b>18</b>   
</p>
<p>85. The Cambodia/international division is replicated at the level of administration, at 
Government insistence. On the Cambodian side there have been numerous, serious, 
administrative irregularities. There have been widely publicized allegations that the Cambodian 
appointees of the ECCC had to share their entire first salary and 20 to 30 per cent of their 
subsequent salary with senior political figures.<b>19</b> A special UNDP audit found that many staff 
whose posts were not authorized or budgeted for were appointed; there were salary increases for 
some staff appointed by the Government of Cambodia, as much as &#8220;from 54 to 338 per cent&#8221;.

<p>  The Expert Group, which had envisaged about 20 accused, said that &#8220;to the extent that fair 
trials may reveal a different historical picture from that asserted by the Cambodian People&#8217;s 
Party, with the involvement of additional people, the Government may have concerns about a 
tribunal over which it does not exercise control&#8221; (para. 98, A/53/850; see also S/1999/231).

</p>
<p>The irregularities noted by the audit team were so numerous and of such magnitude that it 
recommended that, if its recommendations were not accepted, the United Nations should 
seriously consider withdrawing from the project.<b>20</b>  
86. The Cambodian Bar Association demanded, without any legal basis, that all foreign 
lawyers, whose participation is essential to ensure fair trials, and even if appearing pro bono, pay 
a fee of US$ 4,900. The international judges protested that this &#8220;would severely limit the right of 
accused and victims to select counsel of their choice&#8221;.<b>21</b> An embassy offered to compensate the 
bar for the fees, and, after discussions with the diplomatic community, the fee was reduced to 
$500. No foreign lawyer can appear without a Cambodian lawyer, who must speak first. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Decision on the detention of Kaing Guek Eav (Duch) 
</b>87. Of great interest is the decision by the Pre-Trial Chamber on the legality of the detention 
order issued by co-investigating judges against Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch. He was taken into 
ECCC custody on 30 July 2007, having already been in detention for over eight years, under the 
order of the Military Court, to face charges of genocide, amended to crimes against humanity, 
and again to detention under the 2004 legislation on the establishment of ECCC (before the 
physical existence of the Court). The defence&#8217;s arguments on the issue of bail were therefore tied 
to such issues as arbitrary detention and the right to be tried within a reasonable time frame. On 
3 December 2007 the Pre-Trial Chamber upheld the validity of the detention order on the ground 
that the conditions for detention, as stipulated in the Internal Rules, are met, and declined, 
unfortunately, to enter into a discussion into whether or not there was a violation of the right of 
the accused to be tried within a reasonable time. 
</p>
<p>88. ECCC should pay due regard to the provisions on human rights and freedoms of the 
Constitution of Cambodia, and the mechanisms to fulfil them. In this way progressive 
interpretations of the Constitution will become part of the fundamental law. 
</p>
<p>89. The impact of ECCC will remain marginal unless the Government takes steps to end 
impunity for gross serious human rights violations of the recent past (since, for instance, 1991). 
Cambodian judicial authorities seem unable, whether through lack of resources or for political 
reasons, to act to combat comprehensively such recent violations of human rights. It is 
particularly ironic that the international community should spend so much effort and money to 
end the impunity of old and broken persons for crimes committed 30 years ago while turning a 
blind eye to the present violations of rights.

<p>  Statement from the Review Committee of the ECCC, 16 March 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ELECTION LAWS AND PRACTICE 
</b></p>
<p>90. Cambodia has a record of regular National Assembly and commune elections. Most 
observers reported positively on the 2007 commune elections and noted a decline in violence. 
There is a good legislative framework for elections and considerable development of other legal 
and administrative institutions.  
</p>
<p>91. Serious obstacles remain to achieving the constitutional goal of political pluralism through 
elections. Some of these are general - deficiencies in democratic governance, human rights, 
media access and fairness, and in the role of civil society. Opposition political parties have 
complained of irregularities in the administration of the elections that favoured the ruling party.  
</p>
<p>92. The National Election Commission (NEC) is generally well thought of. It is relatively 
transparent and holds consultations with political parties and civil society. Two major constraints 
seem to affect its ability to ensure free and fair elections. First, it is not in reality fully 
independent and does not enjoy a constitutional status. Its members are appointed by the 
National Assembly on the nomination of the Ministry of Interior which is not obliged to consult 
political parties (it did do so in recent nominations). Nor is the Ministry of the Interior required 
to produce more nominations than vacancies, to give the National Assembly a real choice. 
Members have no fixed term of office and there are no safeguards against their arbitrary 
removal.   
</p>
<p>93. The second constraint is that many administrative functions essential for free and fair 
elections are not performed by NEC. Issuing of identity cards (crucial for registration as a voter) 
and preparation of the voter registry are done by State officials, mostly connected to the ruling 
party. In 2007 even the registration of candidates was not done by NEC. Due to the scale of these 
operations and the different levels at which they are carried out, NEC cannot ensure that they are 
properly, fairly and effectively carried out (especially as these other bodies are under 
considerable political pressure). The Special Representative heard several complaints that these 
functions were performed to favour the ruling party.  
</p>
<p>94. An adviser has identified various other problems: complainants being coerced into signing 
reconciliation agreements; complex regulations that are arbitrarily applied; insistence of electoral 
authorities on formal complaints; involvement by village chiefs; failure to sanction those who 
commit electoral violations, particularly &#8220;vote buying&#8221;; and lack of impartiality and 
professionalism in decision-making on complaints and appeals, particularly at the sub-NEC 
levels. He advises the creation of a separate body to assume the NEC function of considering 
appeals from lower levels, and phasing out the role of village chiefs. 
</p>
<p>95. NEC is required to ensure that all political parties have equal access to the media. 
International and other election observers have stated that the media, State-owned and most of 
the private, are &#8220;overwhelmingly favourable to the main governing party&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>96. The period for election campaign for the National Assembly is 30 days. Outside this period 
there can be no campaigning - defined very broadly to exclude legitimate political activity. One 
observer said that Cambodian authorities &#8220;have very limited tolerance for organized political 
parties or NGOs outside a campaign period&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>97. There is no mandatory reporting on campaign financing; no explicit limitations on 
non-monetary and in-kind assistance to electoral candidates; no ceiling on total expenditures; no 
limitation on individual or total contributions; and no obligations on party officials to certify 
accounts or sanctions for false accounting. 
</p>
<p>98. A number of recommendations on reforms to the electoral system prepared by the 
European Union and other groups of observers at previous elections and UNDP experts should 
be considered, and implemented for the 2008 elections.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Year after year, the Special Representative&#8217;s predecessors and others have addressed 
the problems of the legal and judicial system in Cambodia and made numerous 
recommendations, to no avail. The Government has no incentives for reform, as the 
international community continues to make large financial contributions regardless of 
widespread violations of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> A distinguished Cambodian legal scholar recently commented that &#8220;the Government 
is the least serious about the legal and judicial programme&#8221;.22 The World Bank shelved a 
project because of &#8220;a lack of senior-level commitment to the implementation of a concerted 
legal and judicial reform agenda within the Executive and Judicial branches of the 
Government&#8221;.23</b> <b>Another donor has said that numerous plans and councils on good 
governance are &#8220;little more than a studied attempt to tell donors what they want to hear&#8221;.24 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Government has primary responsibility for the rule of law. The Special 
Representative would stress the following recommendations, many of which were made 
previously: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must respect the independence of all prosecutors and judges, 
including those (and defenders and administrative staff) within ECCC. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must devote more resources to the justice sector. Efforts to train 
lawyers and to recruit prosecutors and judges should continue and the aim should 
be for everyone to be within easy reach of a court and for delays in proceedings to 
be minimized. 
</b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government should appoint a committee drawn from Government, the 
BAKC, human rights NGOs and local and foreign experts, to advise on the 
organization of legal aid. Its recommendations should be implemented speedily. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must promote respect for the rule of law within the State and 
society. It must set the example, as guardian of the Constitution and the law. Laws 
must be implemented fairly and fully and effective remedies for the violation of 
rights ensured, if people are to trust the notion of rule of law. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must urgently enact laws on demonstrations and anti-corruption, 
ensuring that they comply with the Constitution and human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must protect the rights of indigenous persons and others who, 
due to illiteracy, customary practices and expectations, communal forms of 
organizations etc., are not familiar with the law or its procedures, the rules for 
making of economic transactions or with the market economy. Steps must be taken 
to ensure that State authorities, including communes, are no longer involved in 
transactions of dubious morality or law that undermine the rights of these 
communities and individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must do all it can to stop forced evictions. It must never be 
complicit in unlawful evictions. Internationally accepted guidelines must be 
observed, including the principles that nobody should be made homeless as a result 
of development-based evictions, the full and informed consent of those targeted for 
eviction. Evictions should be carried out only in exceptional circumstances, and 
solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society. 
The use of force should be prohibited. No one should be imprisoned in relation to 
protecting their rights to land and housing and anyone detained in this context 
should be released. A moratorium on forced evictions should be declared, to allow 
the determination of the legality of land claims to be made in an objective and fair 
manner. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must establish an independent authority to receive complaints 
about maladministration by the State (including institutions of justice). A Human 
Rights Commission fully established on the Paris Principles could be given this 
task. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must respect the duty and right of civil society to promote and 
protect human rights and observe United Nations resolutions on the rights of 
human rights defenders. No restrictions should be placed on reasonable activities 
of local communities and non-governmental associations. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government must deal fairly with specific cases brought to its attention in 
recent reports of the Special Representatives and human rights organizations, 
including the circumstances in which the Venerable Tim Sakhorn disappeared.25 
These steps should include justice for the alleged killers of union leader Chea 
Vichea and bringing to justice his real killers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to civil society actors 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Special Representative stresses the important contribution of civil society 
(including non-governmental organizations, lawyers, universities, think tanks and other 
educational and research institutions) to the common effort to establish the rule of the law. 
He encourages them to pursue their efforts, with determination, patience and courage, in a 
spirit of openness, dialogue and cooperation with the government authorities. They should 
continue to provide people with information about human rights, institutions and remedies, 
and with a voice when the administration, lawmakers and the judiciary do not listen. 
Discussion with the people about the Special Representative&#8217;s reports and feedback should 
be encouraged. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Educational institutions and NGOs should engage the public, through seminars, 
media and publications, on the procedures and practices as well as the rulings and 
judgements of ECCC, to create awareness of the meaning and importance of the rule of 
law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the international community, 
including United Nations institutions 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>To be seriously considered and implemented by the Government, the 
recommendations of the successive Special Representatives need to be endorsed and 
supported by foreign Governments and international agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The international community should set up or facilitate the setting up of an 
independent expert commission to review the working of the legal and judicial 
system, to make recommendations, and to report annually to the international 
community and the Royal Government of Cambodia, one month ahead of the 
consultations between the Government and the donors and lenders. The 
commission should develop effective and realistic criteria to assess progress, 
paying particular attention to the enforcement of the law and the independence of 
the prosecution and judges. The report should form the basis of consultations.  
</b></p>
<p>

</b>  The chief monk of Phnom Denh pagoda in Takeo Province and an ethnic Khmer from 
</p>
<p>Southern Viet Nam was defrocked on the order of the Chief Patriarch on grounds that his 
activities in providing shelter to monks from the Khmer Krom minority in Viet Nam fleeing 
alleged religious persecution had undermined good relations between Cambodia and Viet Nam. 
He was then driven away by unidentified persons and his whereabouts were unknown until 
August when he appeared in custody in Viet Nam. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Foreign Governments or agencies providing assistance in drafting laws must 
ensure that the law they are proposing is consistent with human rights. This raises 
no difficulties in respect of Cambodia&#8217;s sovereignty. This is also an international 
obligation of each and every Member State of the United Nations, under the 
Charter and under the treaties they have ratified. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Foreign embassies, collectively or bilaterally, should engage the Government in 
dialogues on human rights and urge the Government to stop the most egregious 
violations. They should emphasize that respect for human rights is an essential 
basis of the partnership between them and the Cambodian State and people, and 
for the pursuance of a development process that places human beings and 
environment at its heart, rather than unlimited profit and greed, at its heart. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Since the Constitutional Council has stated that human rights treaties are binding, 
it is necessary that the decisions of the treaty bodies and of international and 
foreign courts and tribunals should be taken into account when applying the law. 
This approach would reinforce the impact that ECCC is expected to have on 
improvements in the Cambodian legal and judicial system. OHCHR should 
translate and disseminate major interpretations and conclusions of the treaty 
bodies.
