</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The report describes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities in 2007 and then looks at three 
main issues: the impact of states of emergency on the right to a fair trial, access to justice, and 
recent developments in international justice. 
 In line with the recommendations of the expert seminar held in Geneva in late 2007, the 
report contains a proposal for a study to systematize the norms and principles for the protection 
of human rights during states of emergency, with a view to drafting an instrument or <i>corpus juris</i> 
to guide States in ensuring the continued effective exercise of fundamental human rights in states 
of emergency. 
</p>
<p> The report sets out to analyse the two most important aspects of access to justice: access to 
justice as a fundamental right, and the conditions required for its effective implementation. 
Although strictly speaking access to justice means the right to effective judicial protection, the 
term is used with a broader meaning in this report, in order to permit analysis of the justice 
administration system and the factors that affect access to, and the operation of, justice. The 
report looks at the content and scope of the right of access to justice, and then in detail at the 
different economic, social, cultural and operational barriers to the exercise of this right. It 
examines how access to justice is affected by the type and characteristics of the various courts 
involved in dispensing justice and the conditions in which judicial actors carry out their work; it 
also looks at the impact of corruption and judicial delay. It focuses on interesting developments 
in the enforceability of economic, social and cultural rights and goes on to analyse the way in 
which certain vulnerable groups&#8217; right of access to justice is impaired. The report ends by 
indicating the main consequences of shortcomings in access to justice and recommends, in 
particular, that a database of best practice should be developed in order to help States bridge this 
serious gap. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the report indicates the main recent developments in the area of international 
justice, highlighting the importance of the start of the first trial in the International Criminal 
Court since its establishment in 2002. It warns of the serious consequences, for the relatives of 
Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 other staff members who lost their lives in the 19 August 2003 
attack on the United Nations office in Baghdad, of the execution of a witness who could have 
helped to shed light on the incident. For the Special Rapporteur this is a blatant violation of the 
right to the truth, one that considerably undermines the Organization&#8217;s authority and to which the 
Human Rights Council should pay particular attention. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since taking up his duties in August 2003, the Special Rapporteur has addressed one or 
more main topics in each annual report. This report, the fifth by the current Special Rapporteur 
and the fourteenth since the mandate was established in 1994, looks at the issue of due process in 
situations of de jure or de facto states of emergency, and also at the complex issue of access to 
justice. 
</p><p>2. In analysing the issue of access, the Special Rapporteur considers his own reports and 
country visits and the material produced by other special procedures. It takes as a reference the 
International Bill of Human Rights and the precedents set by supervisory bodies, in particular the 
Human Rights Committee. He also takes account of the texts and precedents established by 
regional bodies; the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic Principles 
on the Role of Lawyers and the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors; and other specific 
standards set in regional systems. 
</p>
<p>3. Given the United Nations word-count requirements, many examples and numerous legal 
references could not be included. Only the footnotes, grouped together in annex I, are retained. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES IN 2007 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International meetings 
</b></p>
<p>4. From 11 to 20 June 2007, in Geneva, the Special Rapporteur took part in the fourteenth 
annual meeting of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and the fifth session of 
the Council, where he presented his annual report, a report on exchanges with Governments 
concerning specific complaints, a report on his mission to the Maldives and a preliminary note 
on his mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In October he attended the sixty-second 
session of the General Assembly in New York, where he presented his report (A/62/207). 
</p>
<p>5. On 28 and 29 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur attended a meeting of the Supreme Courts 
of Justice of the Andean region organized by the Supreme Court of Ecuador, the body whose 
establishment and appointment he had pressed for in 2005 in the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States (OAS), after the Ecuadorian Supreme Court judges had been 
dismissed in breach of the Constitution, triggering a serious institutional crisis. 
</p>
<p>6. From 16 to 27 October he attended a training course in Washington D.C., on 
inter-American and universal systems for human rights protection, organized by the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Washington College of Law. 
</p>
<p>7. In November the Special Rapporteur spoke at the third meeting of the Ibero-American 
Legal Assistance Network, in Punta del Este, Uruguay, giving a presentation on his mandate and 
on international cooperation in the field of justice. 
</p><p>8. In December he chaired the expert seminar referred to in section B below. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>9. At the invitation of the Government of the Republic of Maldives, the Special Rapporteur 
visited that country from 25 February to 1 March. His report (A/HRC/4/25/Add.2) was presented 
to the Human Rights Council at its fifth session. Again at the invitation of the Government, he 
visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 15 to 21 April, and his report 
(A/HRC/4/25/Add.3) will be presented to the Council at its eighth session. He wishes to thank 
both Governments for having allowed him to make these visits. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is planning a mission to the Russian Federation in May 2008 and 
thanks the Government for its kind invitation. He also hopes to visit Angola, Cambodia, Fiji, 
Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Nigeria and the Philippines. He looks forward 
to receiving replies from those countries that have not yet authorized a visit; he is grateful to 
those Governments that have already confirmed their invitation and hopes that a suitable time for 
these visits will be arranged shortly.  
</p>
<p>11. In Fiji, the 2006 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat caused a severe political and institutional crisis. Worrying 
allegations of human rights violations affecting the independence of the judiciary prompted the 
Special Rapporteur to ask to visit the country as soon as possible, first by letter on 18 June, 
followed by reminders on 14 November 2007 and 7 February 2008, then in the General 
Assembly and lastly in an approach to the country&#8217;s diplomatic representatives. He has not yet 
received a positive reply. It is also regrettable that leading jurists&#8217; organizations, such as the 
International Bar Association (IBA) have not been allowed to visit the country. This mandate is a 
Human Rights Council special procedure, tasked with defending the independence of the 
judiciary; the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit will not affect any ongoing judicial proceedings, as the 
Government claims, and he therefore hopes to receive a positive reply. During visits to countries 
in similar situations, interviews were carried out with the highest national authorities, all sectors 
working in the area of justice and NGOs, and had a verifiable positive impact. In some cases, 
such as that of the Supreme Court of Ecuador, interviews of this kind have been adopted by the 
United Nations as &#8220;best practice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Routine activities 
</b></p>
<p>12. These included consideration of a large number of communications concerning situations 
relevant to the mandate. This involved ongoing contact not only with the Secretariat and other 
special rapporteurs but also with many Governments, and the preparation of numerous urgent 
appeals, letters of allegation and press releases. This work is described in annex I of this report. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  STATES OF EMERGENCY AND THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL 
</b></p>
<p>13. A seminar on &#8220;The protection of human rights under states of emergency, particularly the 
right to a fair trial&#8221; was held on 3 and 4 December 2007 in Geneva. Convened at the initiative of 
the Special Rapporteur, who was also in the chair, the seminar was organized by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in cooperation with the 
International Commission of Jurists and brought together some 15 international and regional 
specialists. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. Some of the most significant findings and recommendations of the meeting - details of 
which will be included in the next report to the General Assembly - show that the use of states of 
emergency is growing, spanning all continents, and continues to be a source of serious human 
rights violations. Of particular concern are situations where the independence of the judiciary is 
affected, and where emergency powers are granted to military or special courts or commissions 
to try civilians, thus violating the guarantees of the right to a fair trial. In addition, some States, 
which have not declared a state of emergency, have tightened national security or anti-terrorist 
laws and provisions, placing similar - or even more severe - restrictions on human rights than 
those authorized during a declared emergency. These abuses occur despite the safeguards 
provided for by international law and the abundant case law in this area; hence the importance of 
bringing together in one instrument all the norms and principles governing the protection of 
human rights under states of emergency, with the aim of setting international standards 
applicable to all States. This should be preceded by a study, to be conducted by OHCHR, 
compiling important developments over the last 10 years in legislation, case law and doctrine. In 
addition the Council is requested to pay particular attention to this issue. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACCESS TO JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>15. States have an obligation to guarantee the exercise of the rights required under domestic 
law and in international treaties to which they are parties. This means that they must 
unreservedly respect the rights established therein and set up institutional mechanisms to prevent 
or remedy acts that violate those rights. All States governed by the rule of law have a positive 
obligation to eliminate obstacles that impair or restrict access to justice. 
16. In successive reports, the Special Rapporteur has noted the adverse effects of some 
structural factors on the effective enjoyment of human rights, and in particular factors directly or 
indirectly preventing, hindering or impeding access to justice. In the present report, he proposes 
to consider this issue by looking at its two most important aspects: (a) as a fundamental human 
right, and (b) the conditions required for its effective realization. The first concerns the complex 
fabric of rights related to access to justice. The second concerns the institutional and material 
conditions in which the justice administration system operates, and the factors affecting that 
operation and access to justice, and follows the direction taken in European case law<b>1</b> and the 
modern tendency to broaden the definition of access to justice to mean &#8220;the effective availability 
of institutional channels for the protection of rights and the resolution of various types of conflict 
in a timely manner and in accordance with the legal order&#8221;.<b>2</b> By referring to both institutional

</p>
<p>and judicial channels, this definition also covers alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, 
which are increasingly important in certain contexts, and in regard to certain rights and specific 
social groups. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Content and scope of the right of access to justice 
</b>17. The legal complexity and richness of the concept of access to justice lies in the fact that it 
is both a right in itself and the means of restoring the exercise of rights that have been 
disregarded or violated. As an indispensable component of specific rights such as the right to 
liberty and to personal safety, it is closely linked to the right to effective judicial protection (fair 
trial or due process), the right to an effective remedy<b>3</b> and the right to equality.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>18. This right is recognized in article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and treaties of the various 
regional systems for human rights protection,<b>5</b> and implies access to a predetermined, 
independent and impartial court, the decisions of which are based on law, following proceedings 
that observe procedural guarantees. As the Human Rights Committee states in its general 
comment No. 32, article 14 is of a particularly complex nature, combining various guarantees 
with different scopes of application: (a) equality before the courts; (b) right to a fair and public 
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law; (c) procedural 
guarantees; (d) right to compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice in criminal cases; and (e) 
right not to be tried or punished again for an offence that has already been tried (<i>ne bis in idem). 
</i>In the context of access to justice the first three guarantees are of particular relevance. 
<b>2. Right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>19. This right strengthens the conditions of access to justice insofar as it includes effective 
procedural guarantees such as amparo or habeas corpus in the demands and requirements of a 
fair trial or the right to protection of the courts. Judicial protection applies in disputes in respect 
of any rights, whereas effective remedy protects certain specific rights acknowledged as 
fundamental and identified as such in the Constitution, the law or international treaties. For 
example, article 2, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Art&#237;culo 2.3 del PIDCP. 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  &#8220;En la medida en que la legitimidad del Estado de Derecho se apoya en una implementaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>efectiva del principio de igualdad ante la ley, las desigualdades para acceder a la justicia 
comprometen esa legitimidad que el Estado democr&#225;tico tiene la necesidad de preservar y nutrir 
constantemente. La falta de igualdad de posibilidades de los ciudadanos en la defensa de sus 
derechos socava la legitimidad del Estado y las instituciones democr&#225;ticas&#8221; : A.M. Garro, 
&#8220;El acceso a la justicia y el &#8216;derecho de inter&#233;s p&#250;blico&#8217;&#8221;, <i>Justicia y Sociedad</i>, vol. 2, 1999, p. 52. 
<b>5
</b>  Art&#237;culo 8 de la Convenci&#243;n Americana sobre Derechos Humanos y el art&#237;culo 6 de la 
</p>
<p>Convenci&#243;n Europea de Derechos Humanos. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recognizes the right to an effective remedy, but only with respect to the rights enshrined in the 
Covenant. Article 25 of the American Convention on Human Rights provides for the &#8220;right to 
simple and prompt recourse&#8221; in the event of violation of rights &#8220;recognized by the constitution or 
laws of the state concerned or by this Convention&#8221;. Thus there is always a reference to explicit 
recognition. However, case law has in practice interpreted the two rights as complementary, 
establishing that the proceedings in an effective remedy must observe the general guarantees of 
due process and that the available remedy must be simple and prompt. The monitoring bodies, 
when considering the admissibility of communications and deciding whether domestic remedies 
have been exhausted or not, have determined that a remedy must be real, not merely theoretical; 
be available to the person concerned; be capable of restoring the enjoyment of the impaired right; 
and ensure the effectiveness of the judgement. In the inter-American system there is considerable 
case law relating to the protection of procedural guarantees in respect of non-derogable rights 
during states of emergency. Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has extended 
non-derogability to cover the guarantees of due process set out in article 14 of the Covenant. 
Thus the requirement of competence, independence and impartiality of a tribunal is an absolute 
right that is not subject to any exception. 
<b>3. Right to equality before the courts 
</b></p>
<p>20. This right is enshrined in generic terms in article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. Access 
should be guaranteed to all individuals, regardless of nationality or administrative status, in order 
to ensure their right to claim justice. This guarantee also prohibits any distinctions regarding 
access to courts and tribunals that are not based on law and cannot be justified on objective and 
reasonable grounds, thus excluding any restriction on the grounds of race, sex, language, 
religion, opinion, national or social origin, economic situation, birth or other condition, such as 
civil status.<b>6</b> Access to justice should be unrestricted and effective. The first of these criteria 
refers to the prohibition of discrimination and coercion, and to conditions that favour 
admissibility of the action. Being effective means that the procedural channels should be such 
that the necessary legal assistance is provided and the remedies available are genuinely capable 
of meeting the desired objective. It is not just a matter of guaranteeing entry to the judicial 
process: equality of access must determine the entire conduct of that process. The Human Rights 
Committee has established that a situation in which an individual&#8217;s attempts to access the 
competent courts or tribunals are systematically frustrated de jure or de facto runs counter to the 
guarantee of article 14, paragraph 1, first sentence.<b>7</b>

<p><b>4. Equality of arms8 
</b></p>
<p>21. Equality also extends to the procedural rights and instruments available to parties 
throughout the proceedings, unless distinctions are based on law and can be justified on objective 
and reasonable grounds<b>, </b>not entailing actual disadvantage or other unfairness to the defendant.<b>9</b> 
This right is abundantly confirmed in international case law. In the Committee&#8217;s view, there is no 
equality of arms if only the prosecutor, but not the defendant, is allowed to appeal a certain 
decision.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>22. This is a fundamental component of access to justice. In the Committee&#8217;s view<b>11</b> legal 
assistance must meet a number of requirements: among other things, it must be prompt; it should 
be obtained privately; it should be confidential; and it should be free of charge when the person 
does not have sufficient means to pay for it. Other financial aspects have been repeatedly raised 
by the Committee,<b>12</b> such as the imposition of litigation costs and how this can impair the 
effective exercise of this right.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b>6. Positive obligations of the State 
</b></p>
<p>23. The State should refrain from any action that hinders access to justice or makes it 
impossible for those working in the judicial system - judges, lawyers and prosecutors - to carry

considered in relation to socio-economic factors and others such as age, sexual orientation, and 
people&#8217;s physical and psychological condition, which have a major bearing on effective access to 
justice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Barriers to access to justice 
1. Financial barriers 
</b></p>
<p>24. Financial factors usually have a huge impact on access to justice. In structural terms, they 
are reflected in scarcity of funds allocated to ministries of justice; lack of training for those 
working in the justice system; buildings in poor repair; delays in proceedings; outdated 
equipment for expert appraisals and technical analyses; inadequacy of funds to ensure free legal 
aid; and so forth. These are issues that directly or indirectly affect access to justice, and the 
Special Rapporteur makes a point of raising them in his country visits. 
</p>
<p>25. At the individual level, court proceedings can represent a heavy financial burden. Costs 
include initiating and pursuing the proceedings, and possible delays. In addition there are 
lawyers&#8217; fees and other costs such as travel and loss of working time as a result of a court case. 
Various studies show that costs can be as high as 30, 50 or even 60 per cent of the value of 
property disputes where the amounts claimed are low.<b>18</b> They have a proportionally greater effect 
on low-income social sectors, and the impossibility of paying for legal aid or meeting the costs 
associated with a case has come to be seen in case law and doctrine as constituting real

</p>
<p>discrimination,<b>19</b> if a person&#8217;s financial situation places them in a position of inequality before 
the law. International instruments and case law reflect this reality and establish a number of 
requirements directly related to access to justice. Thus, in addition to free legal aid for criminal 
proceedings, the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers require Governments to ensure the 
provision of sufficient funding and other resources (for example legal services) to the poor and 
other disadvantaged persons.<b>20</b> Article 14, paragraph 3 (d), of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights guarantees that anyone charged with a criminal offence shall be entitled to 
have legal assistance assigned to them, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and 
without payment if they do not have sufficient means to pay for it. The Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights has found that proceedings must recognize and resolve factors of real inequality 
in respect of anyone brought before the courts. Furthermore, the presence of real disadvantages 
necessitates countervailing measures that help to reduce or eliminate the obstacles and 
deficiencies that impair or diminish an effective defence of one&#8217;s interests.<b>21</b> In addition, the 
Court has found that any person whose economic status means that they cannot afford either the 
necessary legal counsel or the costs of the proceedings &#8220;is being discriminated against by reason 
of ... economic status and, hence, is not receiving equal protection before the law&#8221;.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>26. Financial factors take on even more importance when they compound other social, cultural 
or employment factors and lead to marginalization and social exclusion. At this point the issue of 
access to justice is global in nature, since it extends to the effective exercise of human rights as a 
whole. In reality, nothing mirrors the indivisibility and interdependence of human rights better 
than extreme poverty, since anyone living in extreme poverty is adversely affected in every 
aspect of life,<b>23</b> including appalling living conditions, unhealthy housing, homelessness, failure

<p>to appear on civil registers, unemployment, ill-health, inadequate education and marginalization. 
Each one of these deprivations exacerbates the others to form a vicious circle of abject poverty, 
which is compounded by a strong tendency for poverty to perpetuate itself, thus forming an 
infernal mill that prevents people from exercising any of their human rights. The Special 
Rapporteur considered this issue in his former capacity as Special Rapporteur for the 
Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13). The most serious obstacles barring access to justice for the very poor 
include: (a) their indigent condition; (b) illiteracy or lack of education and information; (c) the 
complexity of procedures; (d) mistrust, not to say fear, stemming from their experience of the 
justice system, either because they frequently find themselves in the position of accused, or 
because their own complaints are turned against them; (e) the slow pace of justice, despite the 
fact that their petitions often relate to very sensitive aspects of life (such as return of children) 
which need to be dealt with rapidly; and (f) in many countries, the fact that they are not allowed 
to be accompanied or represented by support organizations which could also bring criminal 
indemnification proceedings. It should be stressed that, while this issue and its implications for 
human rights have been addressed essentially in relation to guarantees protecting the right to a 
defence (designation of a court-appointed lawyer or officially appointed defence counsel, free 
legal advice and representation) and safeguarding the principle of equality before the law, they 
are in fact much more complex, as has been pointed out by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination. We need only add to the long list of human rights affected by the total 
impunity with which they can be violated, as illustrated by the unpunished killings of street 
children and vagrants by death squads. When the authorities attempt to identify them, they say 
that many are not listed on official registers; in other words, legally, they do not exist. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Barriers relating to information 
</b></p>
<p>27. Access to justice can also be hampered by clients&#8217; ignorance of their rights and all matters 
relating to their case. As a minimum, they need to know all the details of the charges and of the 
case: evidence, time periods and other parties involved. The right to be informed of the nature 
and cause of the charges made should be realized in a detailed, prompt and comprehensible 
manner. The Human Rights Committee has found that the right to be informed of the charge 
promptly requires that information be given as soon as the person is formally charged with a 
criminal offence under domestic. law,<b>24</b> or the individual is publicly named as such. The 
principle of equality of arms requires that each party should have the information concerning the 
case and adequate facilities to participate in the proceedings, which means access to documents 
and other evidence, including materials<b>25</b> that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the 
accused or that are exculpatory.

</p>
<p>28. In addition, both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and regional 
instruments provide that everyone has the right to a public hearing. This guarantee is related to 
access to justice, and contributes to transparency and to the independence and impartiality of 
tribunals. In this regard, the Committee has stated that courts must make information regarding 
the time and venue of the hearings available to the public and provide for adequate facilities for 
the attendance of interested members of the public, within reasonable limits considering, 
inter alia, the potential interest in the case. Access by the media and media accounts of the 
progress of the trial can help strengthen commitment to the proper conduct of proceedings and to 
protection of the rights of the participants. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Cultural barriers 
</b></p>
<p>29. Language difficulties can lead to a lack of understanding of what is at stake, the rights of 
participants, the institutional channels for claiming those rights, and the course of the 
proceedings. For this reason international instruments establish the right to have the free 
assistance of an interpreter if the accused cannot understand the language used in court.<b>26</b> This 
has to do with the principles of fairness and<b> </b>equality of arms in criminal proceedings.<b>27</b> Cases 
involving immigrants, asylum-seekers and ethnic minorities are revelatory, since cultural and 
language barriers compound the already precarious situation in which they find themselves in 
regard to the effective exercise of their rights before the courts. In addition, it usually transpires 
that the worse the situation, the more serious the consequences of lack of access to justice, as 
demonstrated by cases involving illegal workers, or foreign women who are sexually exploited.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>30. The administration of justice is not automatic, and may be influenced by the differences 
between the cultural and economic backgrounds of those involved. This is particularly relevant 
when a case involves ethnic and racial minorities, who may be at a disadvantage because they do 
not belong to the culture of the judicial official.<b>29</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Physical barriers 
</b></p>
<p>31. The physical distance between client and court restricts the effective exercise of access to 
justice. This problem is common in island or archipelago States and in very large countries, 
where the concentration of legal services in urban areas works against the rural or island 
population far from the city. Some initiatives are trying to solve this problem by means of mobile 
courts<b>30</b> as the Special Rapporteur found.<b>31</b> The problem does not only affect developing 
countries: the European Court of Human Rights has found that, if the strict application of a 
procedural rule deprives a party of the right of access to a court, in requiring them to travel at 
short notice to a city where they do not live in order to lodge an appeal within the prescribed 
time, such a requirement is unreasonable and violates the right of access to justice.<b>32</b>  
32. The effective exercise of the right of access to justice can also be violated where the 
architectural layout of judicial buildings ignores the special needs of particular groups such as 
people with disabilities<b>33</b> and older people.<b>34</b> Some States have adopted measures to mitigate this 
problem, but restricted access to public buildings such as courts remains a serious problem 
worldwide. 
</p>
<p><b>D. How the structure and functioning of the judicial system  
affect access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>33. Access to justice depends not only on the existence of a judicial structure but on how that 
structure operates and is organized.

</p>
<p>condition for preserving their independence and impartiality is that they should not be subjected 
to external influence or pressure, and this calls for institutional machinery to ensure that both 
these requirements are met.<b>36</b> Recalling the provisions of the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary,<b>37</b> the Committee states that a situation where the functions and 
competences of the judiciary and the executive are not clearly differentiated, or where the 
executive is able to control or direct the judiciary, is incompatible with the notion of an 
independent tribunal.<b>38</b> The work of the Special Rapporteur since the mandate was established 
has shown that a perceived lack of independence and impartiality does indeed have a negative 
effect on the exercise of the right of access to justice. Apart from generating distrust, and even 
fear, it encourages people not to have recourse to justice. This situation can lead to structural 
obstacles, which are even greater in countries with high rates of corruption. 
</p>
<p>35. <b><i>Mediation or arbitration bodies</i></b>  - Certain forms of alternative dispute resolution, 
administered by bodies other than conventional courts of law, can facilitate access to justice, 
saving those involved time and money. Mediation and arbitration, for example, are judicial 
channels that are more flexible as to the procedures and rules to apply, since officials do not have 
to limit themselves to the law. However, the use of alternative mechanisms should not lead to 
substandard justice or obstruct the right to obtain a court ruling. It is therefore necessary to 
regulate these new channels and define their powers, since they cannot always be a substitute for 
the administration of justice by a court and, in any case, the fundamental elements of due process 
must be observed and the independence and impartiality of those who disperse justice preserved. 
36. <b><i>Special courts</i></b>  - Special courts composed of anonymous judges have been established in 
various countries as part of efforts to combat terrorism. These courts curtail the right to a fair 
trial in fundamental ways. For example, the public nature of the trial is often very limited or 
non-existent, to the point where, in many cases, no one even knows that a trial is being held. 
Furthermore, such courts usually exclude from the courtroom the accused and their lawyer,<b>39</b> and 
indeed the court&#8217;s own records, supposedly intended to clarify the case.<b>40</b> Information between

<p>the parties is also restricted, and accused persons are usually denied the right to communicate 
with their lawyers, especially when held incommunicado.<b>41</b> In addition, there are severe 
restrictions on the right to call and examine witnesses, or to have witnesses examined.<b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>37. <b><i>Administrative boards with the status of military or emergency courts</i></b>  - Previous 
reports have condemned the grave violations of human rights - in particular of the right to a fair 
trial - that have taken place in recent years as a result of the establishment of such courts as part 
of efforts to combat terrorism or in application of national security legislation, or during states of 
emergency. An example of the first of these is contained in a report on the situation of detainees 
at Guantanamo Bay.<b>43</b> The requirement of competence, independence and impartiality of a 
tribunal in the sense of article 14, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights is an absolute right that is not subject to any exception, and any trial that fails to 
meet these requirements violates the right of access to justice. 
38. <b><i>Religious and customary courts</i></b>  - In many countries, the culture and/or the religion have 
led to the formal justice system existing side by side with customary and/or religious courts. This 
makes for a broader range of judicial services and, in the case of customary courts, 
&#8220;neighbourhood&#8221; justice. Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that the Human Rights 
Committee has indicated that such courts cannot hand down binding judgements recognized by 
the State unless the proceedings are limited to minor matters, they meet the basic requirements of 
fair trial and other procedural guarantees, and their judgements are validated by State courts and 
can be challenged by the parties concerned in a procedure meeting the requirements of article 14 
of the Covenant; judgements that do not conform to international human rights standards are not 
acceptable. Nevertheless, complaints received by the Special Rapporteur show that such 
conditions are frequently not met, especially with regard to the existence of an independent 
system of legal defence and an appellate body to which convicted persons may apply.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Conditions of professional judicial practice  
</b>39. <b><i>Judges</i></b>  - In terms of guaranteeing the complete independence of the judiciary, the Human 
Rights Committee refers to the procedure and qualifications for the appointment of judges, other 
guarantees relating to their security of tenure<b>44</b> and conditions governing promotion, transfer,

<p>suspension and the cessation of their functions. Among the factors that may affect not only the 
judicial function but also the exercise of the right of access to justice are a shortage of judges or 
the inaccessibility of judges by reason of distance, as already mentioned, the material 
circumstances in which members of the judiciary work, the training received by judges and the 
mechanisms and laws instituted to preserve their independence and impartiality. By way of 
example, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the report on his mission to Kazakhstan 
(E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.2).  
</p>
<p>40. <b><i>Lawyers</i></b>  - Although not part of the judicial structure, lawyers play an essential role in the 
right to justice, in access to justice and, especially, in the right to a defence. In order to fulfil their 
role, they need a legal and institutional framework that allows them to exercise their profession 
freely and a judicial culture that allows them to meet their clients in private and to communicate 
with the accused in conditions that fully respect the confidentiality of their communications. Yet 
the experience of this mandate shows how often lawyers are subjected to pressure, intimidation 
and constraints, leading up in many cases to arrest, assault and disappearance, for example. In 
many countries their work is hampered by complex regulatory regimes that govern the issuance 
and renewal of licences to practise law, and in extreme cases it may, for example, be the public 
prosecutor who takes the decision or advises the executive branch on the matter. Directly and 
indirectly, all these circumstances seriously affect access to justice. On the other hand, many 
means have been devised to provide legal assistance to those without the necessary financial 
resources.<b>45</b> In some cases, the State arranges with private lawyers or bar associations to provide 
services that are later reimbursed by the State.<b>46</b> In other cases, lawyers operate as if they were 
civil servants paid by the State to provide free legal assistance;<b>47</b> these are the court-appointed 
defence counsels. The public defender&#8217;s office can be established as a State institution in several 
ways, either as part of the judiciary or the ministry of justice, or as a functionally and financially 
autonomous entity, an option that is spreading in Latin America. Provision is usually also made 
for the hiring of outside lawyers. In some countries, NGOs and universities have taken 
initiatives, setting up legal clinics, for example, and other means of providing this service. In 
some particularly sensitive cases or cases affecting a large number of people (environment, 
consumer protection, public health or anti-impunity cases), victims are represented by NGOs or 
by lawyers defending wider social interests. The aim is to overcome the barriers to access to 
justice encountered by certain groups, including lack of information, fear, high litigation costs or

<p>the fact that, taken individually, the violations are of minor importance. Group claims keep the 
length and cost of proceedings down and also facilitate the administration of justice. In addition, 
such actions may be seen as a healthy means of influencing the political and social agenda and 
redeeming the weaknesses of certain democratic institutions and regimes.  
</p>
<p>41. <b><i>Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office</i></b>  - The proper functioning of this institution is a factor in the 
exercise of the right of access to justice. The Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors provide 
guidance to Governments in ensuring it performs not only its primary function of exercising the 
right of public action but also the tasks of guaranteeing legality, protecting human rights and 
carrying out investigations, where such functions are also assigned to it. Despite this, the Special 
Rapporteur has been obliged to intervene on numerous occasions in which prosecutors&#8217; work 
was subjected to interference or their results led to a violation of their rights. Recent 
developments have led to prosecutors taking on more responsibilities and pushing back the 
bounds of their functional independence, with more scope for action to promote access to justice.  
42. <b><i>Public defenders</i></b>  - Until the State began to bear the costs of legal assistance for people 
without the means to pay for it, it was universities and bar associations that provided such 
assistance - the universities through community legal centres, and the bar associations using a 
roster or shift system - in the conviction that there was a moral obligation.<b>48</b> Now, however, 
States have accepted their international obligation to guarantee access to justice and the right to a 
defence, which requires them to adopt public policies and, where necessary, provide social 
services. Also as a result of recent developments, some countries have endowed public defenders 
with real judges&#8217; powers. In Latin America, the percentage of criminal cases in which defendants 
are represented by public defenders is generally more than 80 per cent of the total in the system. 
In Argentina, 60 per cent of those involved in oral proceedings are defended by officially 
appointed defence counsels.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. The impact of corruption and judicial delay 
</b>43. Transparency and promptness are essential components of an efficient system of justice 
administration. The Special Rapporteur has had occasion to refer to these issues in depth in his 
previous reports and he therefore confines himself here to reiterating that the problems of 
corruption and judicial delay are two of the factors that have the greatest negative impact on the 
judicial system as a whole.

<p>of legislation and legal precedent. This disparity is essentially due to the limitations on their legal 
enforceability, which is why access to justice for this category of rights is of such crucial 
importance today. In this regard, the development that has taken place in doctrine and case law 
over the past 20 years is encouraging. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
notes, for example, in its general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties&#8217; 
obligations, that the rights recognized in the Covenant entail immediate obligations not subject to 
the availability of resources or to progressive realization.<b>50</b> In its general comment No. 9 (1998) 
on the domestic application of the Covenant it stresses that the means used by States to enforce 
those rights are ineffective if they are not reinforced or complemented by judicial remedies; and 
that, although the right to an effective remedy should not necessarily be interpreted as an 
absolute or exclusive requirement for a judicial remedy, it is appropriate to establish an ultimate 
right of judicial appeal before the courts.<b>51</b> 
45. As to the matter of enforceability, the draft optional protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights<b>52</b> constitutes a decisive step in that it will make it 
possible to submit to the Committee individual complaints alleging violations of economic, 
cultural and social rights.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>46. A key issue in relation to this category of rights is the low level of enforcement of court 
decisions, which affects access to justice, when the means to enforce decisions are lacking. It is 
at this juncture between access to justice and the right to an effective remedy that economic, 
social and cultural rights require enforceability.<b>54</b> The judiciary performs an important role in

<p>this context for judicial officials can not only through their judgements, stimulate public policies 
favouring the groups concerned but also provide the means to guarantee the implementation of 
those policies.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The inter-American system<b>56</b> has established the following standards and principles that 
should guide the judicial protection of economic, social and cultural rights: 
 (a) States&#8217; obligations to remove economic and financial obstacles in order to guarantee 
access to the courts. The criteria for granting free legal aid include the resources available to 
those affected, the complexity of the case (for example, constitutional challenges) and the 
importance of the rights affected; 
</p>
<p> (b) The applicability of the rules of due process to administrative proceedings relating to 
these rights. Judicial remedies to review administrative decisions must be not only prompt and 
effective but also inexpensive or affordable. Components of due process in this area include the 
principle of equality of arms, in view of the glaring inequality usually found between the parties 
in this type of litigation (workers and employers; beneficiaries and providing State), as well as 
other guarantees in addition to those prescribed in international instruments, in order to correct or 
compensate for any real disadvantages with regard to a fair trial, the principle of equality before 
the law or the prohibition of discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (c) The right to a reasoned decision on the merits of the matter, within a reasonable time, 
and the criteria for determining what is reasonable, i.e., the complexity of the matter, the judicial 
activity of the interested party, the behaviour of the judicial authorities, the purpose of the 
proceeding and the nature of the rights at issue. Moreover, the time should be counted from the 
start of the administrative proceedings and not when the case reaches the judicial stage, and 
should include judgement enforcement proceedings; 
 (d) The components of the right to effective judicial protection for this category of 
rights, in both their individual and their collective dimension. Without prejudice to a more 
prolonged analysis of the merits of a case, provision should be made for procedural measures 
that allow for immediate - and even precautionary or preventive - protection of social rights. 
These measures should consist of remedies that are simple, urgent, informal, accessible, with low 
evidentiary requirements and which are processed by independent bodies as individual or 
collective actions (which implies a broad, active legitimacy); 
</p>
<p> (e) The right to effective judicial protection. This requires compliance with court 
decisions, whether precautionary or final, since execution of such decisions is an integral part of 
this right. This is particularly important given that it is generally State entities that are 
responsible for enforcing judgements, and they usually enjoy procedural privileges, such as

budgetary nature in order to avoid or defer compliance, particularly in the area of social security. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Difficulties experienced by specific groups  
</b></p>
<p>48. Under the umbrella of the principle of equality, the law must try to treat all citizens as 
equal before the law while also taking account of the differences between them. In order to 
attend to this diversity, guaranteeing everyone the right to equal access to independent courts 
means making special provision for certain population groups and offering them differentiated 
protection.<b>57</b> The lack of public policies to eliminate obstacles to access to justice for all has a 
greater impact on groups in a vulnerable situation or living in extreme poverty,<b>58</b> or who are 
culturally, economically or socially disadvantaged.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>49. The areas where indigenous peoples are most vulnerable are labour and land, where there 
are no judicial mechanisms to ensure protection of their rights. In the course of some country 
visits, the Special Rapporteur observed not only a lack of adequate procedural mechanisms, but 
also that the judicial workers who devote themselves to these issues are subjected to threats 
and attacks.<b>60</b> These problems go hand in hand - notwithstanding certain interesting 
developments<b>61</b> - with the marginalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; customary approaches to

<p>conflict resolution and the administration of justice. In this regard, particular mention should be 
made of General Recommendation No. 31 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, on the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning 
of the criminal justice system, which, in keeping with the Bangalore Principles of Judicial 
Conduct,<b>62</b> calls upon States to &#8220;guarantee the right of every person ... to an effective remedy 
against ... acts of racial discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;ensure respect for, and recognition of the traditional 
systems of justice of indigenous peoples, in conformity with international human rights law&#8221;. 
50. In one of his reports (E/CN.4/2004/80), the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people spoke about the relationship between 
discrimination against indigenous peoples and the justice system, noting the physical isolation 
and poor communications in indigenous areas, and the absence of an effective judiciary designed 
for the needs of indigenous communities. In addition, lack of access to justice may indicate that 
the official legal culture in a country is not adapted to deal with cultural pluralism and that the 
dominant values in a national society tend to ignore, neglect or reject indigenous cultures. Within 
the justice system, particularly in the area of criminal justice, women, young people and children 
are particularly disadvantaged. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Women 
</b></p>
<p>51. In many countries, the integration of women into the bodies established for the 
administration of justice has been extremely limited. By way of example, the Special Rapporteur 
draws attention to the reports on his missions to the Republic of Maldives<b>63</b> and Kyrgyzstan.<b>64</b> At 
the international level, there is a positive requirement for equal representation of men and 
women among the members of the International Criminal Court.<b>65</b> A similar positive requirement 
at the national level is the establishment of ombudspersons for women - an institution now to be 
found in several countries, particularly in Latin America;<b>66</b> however, in many cases they may 
intervene only in response to violations of rights by the State or may only issue comments, or

<p>else they are subject to political authority.<b>67</b> Moreover, women often have difficulty even gaining 
access to justice, whereas this is not the case for men. Similarly, impunity for certain kinds of 
crime, particularly sex-related crimes, is a source of obvious discrimination and an obstruction 
with regard to the exercise of the right of access to justice. Where the law itself does not grant 
men powers or rights that it denies women, in similar conditions, discrimination arises out of the 
events themselves, which are violations of the law. In certain countries, cultural factors and 
prejudices are at the root of the most serious, routine violations of the principle of equality before 
the law and the courts. Sometimes discriminatory treatment is institutionalized, for example 
where, women must have the backing of some male member of their family in order to access 
justice. Where gender inequality goes hand in hand with poverty, women&#8217;s access to justice is 
doubly tenuous.<b>68</b> Yet legal services designed to meet the particular needs of women are still 
hard to find,<b>69</b> even more so for those living in poverty. In the area of free legal aid, for example, 
women are in competition with men for resource allocations, and those resources are in any case 
provided for a single type of service, regardless of the fact that needs may differ.<b>70</b> At best, when 
there is some kind of differentiated provision, such services are linked to the problems of 
domestic violence, abuse and family law.<b>71</b> The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
has identified a widespread pattern of human rights violations that are suffered by women in 
particular. This is compounded by cultural obstacles to women reporting such violations and 
authorities&#8217; failure to act on those complaints that are brought.<b>72</b> The Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences emphasized the need to provide domestic 
mechanisms of access to justice and to ensure women&#8217;s access to international mechanisms 
for the protection of human rights.<b>73</b> However, in the course of his country visits, the

<p>Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers found that judicial personnel 
received little or no training on issues such as violence against women<b>74</b> and that there was 
widespread ineffectiveness and lack of interest in pressing charges and prosecuting in cases of 
violence against women.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Stateless persons, refugees, migrants and victims of racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>52. It is commonplace for such persons to be deprived of access to the courts, owing to their 
administrative situation. This vulnerability is particularly distressing for asylum-seekers, for 
whom access to justice is crucial if they are to avoid irreversible prejudice such as a violation of 
the principle of non-refoulement. It is reasonable and mandatory to provide not only free legal 
aid, but also interpretation, and at times forensic psychological or medical, services. However, 
according to recent research, access to justice free of charge is made subject to conditions that 
make it unattainable in practice. Two reports by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance have addressed this issue. In 
the Dominican Republic the Special Rapporteur noted the factors that led to an absence of 
judicial complaints of racism or racial discrimination: a lack of confidence that the judicial 
system will provide remedies or reparation in a context where high-level officials deny the 
existence of racism in that country; the refusal or reluctance of victims to file complaints for fear 
of retaliation or unlawful or discriminatory backlash; and the absence of any independent 
national human rights institution to complain to (A/HRC/7/19/Add.5). In the Russian Federation 
too, he referred to the small number of convictions for discrimination, for reasons including the 
refusal or reluctance of victims, in particular those from ethnic minorities, to file a complaint for 
fear of reprisals and discriminatory backlash by the police, and judges&#8217; failure - deliberate or 
through ignorance - to enforce the provisions of the Criminal Code. The Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants also raised this issue in the reports on his missions to the Republic 
of Korea and Indonesia (A/HRC/4/24/Add.2 and Add.3, respectively). 
</p>
<p><b>4. Minors 
</b></p>
<p>53. Notwithstanding the array of international treaties, rules and directives that exist to protect 
minors&#8217; rights, States&#8217; treatment of children leaves a great deal to be desired as far as justice is 
concerned, in particular access to justice. There are, however, examples of good practices, 
mostly resulting from a conscientious application of international standards.<b>76</b> In respect of

<p>access it should be recalled that minors, while enjoying the same guarantees as adults, require 
special protection, as their best interests are paramount.<b>77</b> Also, it is advisable for access to 
justice to be provided through alternatives to court procedures, for example through mediation, 
family interviews, psychological guidance and support services, community services or 
education programmes.<b>78</b> The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly drawn attention to the situation 
of child and adolescent victims of sexual exploitation and the impunity of &#8220;death squads&#8221;.<b>79</b> He 
has underscored the need to set up special courts to deal with such crimes, and children&#8217;s units in 
public defenders&#8217; offices.<b>80</b> During missions to central Asian countries, he has proposed creating 
special juvenile justice systems and developing national codes of children&#8217;s rights.<b>81</b> In some 
cases, even when there are specific guarantees for minors,<b>82</b> the fact that imprisonment is the sole 
penalty often means that children are incarcerated, in particular street children.<b>83</b> Elsewhere, 
while there may be a juvenile justice system, it is based on punishment and coercion, and 
provides no rehabilitation options or programmes.<b>84</b>

<p><b>5. Brasilia Rules 
</b></p>
<p>54. Faced with the difficulties in ensuring access to justice in the region, at the fourteenth 
meeting of the Latin-American Judicial Summit,<b>85</b> the presidents of the supreme courts and 
councils of the judiciary of the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America adopted the Brasilia 
Rules on access to justice for persons in vulnerable situations. The Rules list recommended 
measures for guaranteeing access to justice for persons who are more vulnerable for reasons of 
age, disability, membership of indigenous or minority communities, victimization, migration or 
internal displacement, poverty, gender or deprivation of liberty. The significance of these Rules

one way or another. The justice system itself can thus make a substantial contribution to fighting 
inequality and fostering social cohesion.

<p><b>IV.  MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b><i>Democratic Republic of the Congo</i></b>  - In a noteworthy and promising development, the trial 
of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the founder and leader of the <i>Union des patriotes congolais </i>(Union 
of Congolese Patriots) began on 31 March 2008. He is the first person to be tried by the 
International Criminal Court since its establishment in 2002. In February 2008, 
Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, the former head of the <i>Front des nationalistes et int&#233;grationnistes</i> 
(Nationalist and Integrationist Front - FNI) and the <i>Force de r&#233;sistance patriotique d&#8217;Ituri</i> (Ituri 
Patriotic Resistance Force - FRPI), appeared for the first time before the Pre-Trial Chamber, 
while Germain Katanga, the former head of FRPI in the north-east of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, appeared in October 2007. For this case, the confirmation of charges hearing 
initially scheduled for 28 February 2008 has been rescheduled. 
</p>
<p>56. <b><i>Darfur</i></b>  - In December 2007 the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court 
presented his sixth report to the United Nations Security Council pursuant to Security Council 
resolution 1593 (2005). He criticized the lack of cooperation on the part of the Government of 
the Sudan, requesting a unanimous message to be sent asking the Sudan to comply with 
resolution 1593 (2005) and proceed with the arrests. In April 2007 the Pre-Trial Chamber issued 
arrest warrants for Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity. On 16 June and 17 October 2007 the Court requested the Government to 
execute the warrants, and the Registry of the Court requested an update as to &#8220;the activities 
undertaken by the Sudan in the execution of the warrants and as to any potential difficulty, which 
may have arisen in this process&#8221;, by 15 November. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the 
time of writing, the Court has received no response, and urges the Government to follow up 
promptly on the Court&#8217;s request. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Supreme Criminal Tribunal of Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>57. Despite repeated requests from the Special Rapporteur and from United Nations bodies, 
death sentences are still being handed down in Iraq following trials that are in breach of 
international principles and standards of human rights. For example, on 14 March 2007 Iraq&#8217;s 
Supreme Criminal Tribunal confirmed the death sentence for Taha Yassin Ramadan. He was 
executed on 20 March, in violation of international human rights principles and standards, in 
particular the right to be judged by an independent and impartial court and the right to an 
effective defence. Awraz Abdel-Aziz Mahmoud Sa&#8217;id was likewise executed on 3 July 2007. He 
had confessed to involvement in the attack on the United Nations office in Baghdad on 
19 August 2003, and was the only surviving alleged perpetrator of the attack, which took the 
lives of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 others (see document A/62/207). On 19 June the Special 
Rapporteur issued an urgent appeal to the Iraqi Government in a press release, with the aim of 
forestalling the imminent execution. By issuing the call in public, he also sought to mobilize the 
international community, in particular the Governments of the Western countries that considered 
themselves the institutional architects of the new Iraq, and including senior officials who had </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>expressed their esteem and admiration for Sergio Vieira de Mello. The terrorist&#8217;s execution made 
it impossible to obtain any testimony that might shed light on the attack. The gravity of this act, 
its enormous significance for the victims&#8217; families, and for the credibility of the United Nations, 
and the flagrant violation of the right to the truth, merit the special attention of the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>As a fundamental human right, access to justice is the individual&#8217;s gateway to the 
various institutional channels provided by States to resolve disputes. Thus, in addition to 
refraining from violating that right, States are also bound by a positive obligation to 
remove obstacles that block or limit the individual&#8217;s access to justice. As a means of 
claiming the enjoyment or restoration of other rights (civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural), access to justice is not limited to ensuring admission to a court but applies to the 
entire process, which must be conducted in conformity with the principles of the rule of law 
(fair trial, procedural guarantees, etc.), right through to execution of the sentence. Thus the 
principle of equality and the conditions of accessibility and effectiveness that must 
characterize any mechanism established to deal with disputes must be observed not only at 
the start of settlement proceedings, but throughout. The absence of suitable means of 
access to justice ultimately deprives persons of the &#8220;right to a right&#8221; by denying them the 
actual means of exercising their rights in practice. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The report shows the enormous impact that access to justice has on people&#8217;s living 
conditions, in particular those in vulnerable situations, and on all human rights. This 
underscores the continuing relevance of the subject, the vital importance of access to 
justice for the work of the Human Rights Council and the urgent need to implement the 
recommendations presented below. 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the United Nations should develop a 
database of best practice in access to justice, covering all civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights. It should assemble the most positive national experiences and those 
gathered by the special procedures and the various international institutions and 
specialized agencies carrying out cooperation activities in the field of justice. This reference 
material would be of great assistance to States, especially States in transition, and would be 
a very important resource for those working in the judicial system. 
</b>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the adoption of the draft optional 
protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This 
instrument will represent a decisive step towards greater enforceability for this category of 
rights. The violation of these rights affects society&#8217;s most disadvantaged groups in 
particular, but in the medium and long term affects society as a whole. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Those States that have not already done so should adopt legislation that will 
pave the way for justice systems that are accessible, transparent, expeditious and 
non-discriminatory. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63. <b>In comparison with the executive and legislative branches and other public services 
such as education and health, investment in the justice system is routinely much lower. As a 
result, highly dedicated judges, prosecutors and lawyers are liable to find themselves 
working in very difficult conditions, both materially and in terms of personal safety. 
Facilitating access to justice requires giving budget priority to the administration of justice, 
and in such a way as to ensure full autonomy in the management of the resources allocated. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>In light of the impact on access to justice of proper training for those working in the 
justice system, States should invest still more in training, concentrating particularly on 
international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>States should pay special attention to free legal aid programmes. This is generally the 
only legal assistance accessible to large portions of the population, and the absence or poor 
design of such programmes excludes the most disadvantaged groups from the judicial 
system. The experiences of certain Latin American countries with public defenders&#8217; offices 
deserve to be publicized with a view to possible replication elsewhere. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Regardless of the system adopted, it is also crucial to respect and support the work of 
NGOs and bar associations, and their initiatives to bring justice to traditionally neglected 
regions and social groups. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the United Nations should publish the 
Brasilia Rules on access to justice for persons in vulnerable situations. 
</b>68. <b>Because of its decisive impact on access to justice and on all human rights, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that all United Nations bodies should step up efforts to 
eradicate poverty and extreme poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Human Rights Council to ask the Iraqi authorities 
to stop applying the death penalty in trials that do not meet international standards. In 
addition, in the absence of firm information on the perpetrators and circumstances of the 
attack that took the life of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21 others and the absolute impunity 
still surrounding this tragic event, it would be appropriate to create new channels of 
investigation to establish the facts. Given the very high value the United Nations places on 
combating impunity and defending the right to the truth, which has so far been consistently 
violated, and the legitimate interests of the Organization, whose authority has been 
undermined, it would be appropriate to set up a commission of eminent experts to begin, at 
last, to establish the facts. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur also proposes to look more closely at the impact of states of 
emergency on human rights, and asks the Council to give the subject the special attention it 
deserves.
