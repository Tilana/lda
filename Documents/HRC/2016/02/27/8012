<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with 
Council resolution 13/4, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food discusses the threats to 
women's right to food, identifying the areas that demand the most urgent attention. The 
report examines successively the obstacles women face in access to employment, social 
protection and the productive resources needed for food production, food processing and 
value chain development. It ends with a recommendation to States to effectively respond to 
women and girls&#8223; needs and priorities in their food security strategies and to relieve 
women&#8223;s unpaid work burden in the household, while at the same time address the specific 
constraints women face and transforming the existing gendered division of roles.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Women's rights are protected through a range of human rights instruments. The 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides for the right to an 
adequate standard of living, including the right to food, to be guaranteed without 
discrimination (art. 2, para. 1). A non-discrimination requirement is also imposed under the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both in the enjoyment of the rights 
listed in the Covenant (art. 2, para. 1) and in other spheres of life (art. 26). Moreover, both 
Covenants, in their respective article 3, oblige States Parties to ensure the equal right of 
men and women to the enjoyment of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
rights. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women guarantees equality of treatment between women and men in a range of 
areas; it has a specific provision on women in rural areas, guaranteeing the rights of women 
to equal treatment, in particular, in land and agrarian reform as well as in land resettlement 
schemes (art. 14). The Convention also guarantees adequate nutrition for women during 
pregnancy and lactation (art. 12). The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which sets out 
rights that should be guaranteed without discrimination (art. 2, para. 1), also refers to the 
duty of States to protect the right to health of the child, inter alia, by the promotion of 
breastfeeding (art. 24, para. 2 (e)). 
</p>
<p>2. Despite these requirements, discrimination against women remains pervasive in all 
spheres of life. It may result from laws that are themselves discriminatory. More often 
however, the discrimination women face is the result of social norms or customs, linked to 
certain stereotypes about gender roles; unequal access to productive resources such as land 
and to economic opportunities, such as decent wage employment; unequal bargaining 
position within the household; gendered division of labor within households, that result 
both in time poverty for women and in lower levels of education; and women&#8223;s 
marginalization from decision-making spheres at all levels. Only by addressing these 
different levels, including by challenging the existing distribution of family responsibilities 
between women and men, shall the root causes of discrimination women face be effectively 
addressed. 
</p>
<p>3. The various forms of discrimination discussed in this report are interrelated. 
Disempowerment of women results in women facing discrimination as economic agents. 
This in turn means women are less economically independent, are exposed to violence and 
have a weaker bargaining position within the household and the community. As a result, 
they continue to assume a highly unequal share of tasks and family responsibilities within 
the household &#8211; taking care of the children and the elderly or the sick, fetching wood and 
water, buying and preparing the food. This &quot;care economy&quot; for which they remain chiefly 
responsible results in time poverty for women. Women work more hours than men, 
although much of the work they perform remains informal, essentially performed within the 
family, and unremunerated, and thus is neither valued nor even recognized.1 This leads to 
lower levels of education for women, and in an inability to seek better employment 
opportunities outside the home. They may also be discouraged from improving their 
qualifications because of the lack of such opportunities, due to the discrimination they are 
confronted with in the labour market. This may further feed into negative prejudices about 
</p>
<p>  
 1  In middle-income countries, unpaid care work would represent the equivalent of 15 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>GDP if it were to be valued in monetary terms; the figure is 35 per cent for low-income countries. If 
this unpaid care work were to be financed by the public purse, it would represent 94 per cent of the 
total tax revenue of South Korea, and 182 per cent of the total tax revenue of India (D. Budlender, ed., 
<i>Time Use Studies and Unpaid Care Work</i>, London, Routledge, 2010).   </p>


<p>their ability to perform as well as men. The lack of recognition of reproductive rights is part 
of this cycle: marrying early means having children early, and having to take care of them, 
even though this may interrupt the education of the mother, or make it impossible or 
difficult for her to seek employment. It is this cycle of discrimination that must be broken.

<p>4. These various forms of discrimination against women and girls are human rights 
violations that States have a duty to combat. They affect directly the right to food of women 
and girls. They also have impacts on the right to food of others through three pathways. 
First, discrimination against pregnant women and women of child-bearing age has 
intergenerational consequences. Maternal and child undernutrition affect the learning 
performance of children, and their incomes as adults thus depend on the quality of their 
nutrition as young infants, during the 1,000-day window during pregnancy and until the 
second birthday. The disadvantage of poor nutrition during pregnancy or early childhood is 
also carried over from one generation to the next: a woman who has been poorly fed as an 
infant will have children with a lower birthweight.2  
</p>
<p>5. Second, socially constructed gender roles and the weak bargaining position of 
women within households result in a situation in which they may not be able to decide to 
which priorities the household budget should go. Yet, because men are currently 
insufficiently sensitized to the importance of caring for children and for their nutrition 
needs in particular, the nutrition, health and education of children significantly improve 
when women are enabled to make such decisions. Research shows that a child&#8223;s chances of

Improving the education of women and, thus, their economic opportunities, not only can 
make a substantial contribution to a country's economic growth,4 it is also the single most 
important determinant of food insecurity. A cross-country study of developing countries 
covering the period 1970-1995 found that 43 per cent of the reduction of hunger was 
attributable to the progress of women's education, almost as much as increased food 
availability (26 per cent) and improvements to the health environment (19 per cent) during 
that period combined. An additional 12 per cent of the reduction of hunger were attributable 
to increased life expectancy of women, so that we owe in total 55 per cent of the gains 
against hunger during those 25 years to an improvement of women's situation within 
societies.5  
</p>
<p>6. Third, discrimination against women as food producers is not only a violation of 
their rights, it also has society-wide consequences, because of the considerable productivity 
losses entailed. Access to productive resources such as land, inputs, technology and 
services are decisive in explaining the difference in yields between male and female 
smallholders; the greater ability for men to command labor, both from (unremunerated) 
family members and from other members of the community, also plays a role. Evidence 
suggests that countries where women lack land ownership rights or access to credit have on 
average 60 per cent and 85 per cent more malnourished children, respectively.6 Moreover, 
according to a recent review, 79 per cent of existing studies on fertilizer, seed varieties, 
tools, and pesticide use concluded that men have higher access to these inputs.7 One study 
in Burkina Faso found productivity on female-managed plots in Burkina Faso to be 30 per 
cent lower than on male-managed plots within the same household because labour and 
fertilizer were more intensively applied on men&#8223;s plots.8 Yet, the literature also shows that 
with equal access to inputs, yields for men and women are very similar.9 In 2010, the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) concluded that &quot;if women had 
the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase yields on their farms 
by 20&#8211;30 percent. This could raise total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5&#8211;
4 percent, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12&#8211;17 
percent&quot;.10  
</p>
<p>7. Access to food can be secured (i) by obtaining incomes from employment or self-
employment; (ii) by social transfers; or (iii) by own production, for individuals who have 
access to land and other productive inputs. This report examines how, at each of these

<p>levels, women face discrimination and marginalization, with negative impacts both for 
them and for society as a whole. Rural women in particular deserve greater attention in 
food security strategies:11 they fare worse than rural men and urban women and men on all 
development indicators.12 Chapter II considers women's access to incomes through 
employment, both on- and off-farm; chapter III considers women's access to social 
protection; chapter IV examines the role of women as food producers; and chapter V 
outlines a strategy to eliminate discrimination against women and girls based on human 
rights, that seeks to take into account the complexities described in the preceding parts. 
Chapter VI contains a single recommendation to each State, to design and implement, 
without delay, a strategy as outlined in chapter V. The Special Rapporteur concludes that 
the empowerment of women should be at the centre of food security strategies, both in 
order to guarantee the right to food of women, and because it is the most cost-effective 
measure to reduce hunger and malnutrition for all. Resource constraints cannot justify 
further delays in doing so. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Women's access to employment 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Women as waged agricultural workers 
</b></p>
<p>8. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur has explained the obstacles that 
farmworkers face in enjoying their right to adequate food (see A/HRC/13/33, paras. 10-27). 
But women farmworkers, who represent 20 to 30 per cent of the approximately 450 million 
people employed worldwide as waged agricultural workers (the proportion is higher, at 
around 40 per cent, in Latin America and the Caribbean),13 face specific difficulties.  
</p>
<p>9. Women are disproportionately represented in the &quot;periphery&quot; part of the workforce 
that coexists with the &quot;core&quot; segment of permanently employed farmworkers. This 
&quot;periphery&quot; segment of the workforce is made of unskilled workers, often without a formal 
contract of employment, and their work is often seasonal or temporary (or classified as such 
even when it is in fact continuous). The main reason why women are disproportionately 
represented in this segment is because they have fewer alternative options and are thus 
&#8222;easier&#8223; to exploit.  
</p>
<p>10. In addition, it is not unusual for the remuneration in this &quot;periphery&quot; segment to be 
calculated on a piece-rate basis, based on how much of the task has been accomplished. 
This mode of calculation of the wage is advantageous to the employer; it generally means 
that the employer does not provide benefits or social security in addition to the wage 
earned, and it is a method of calculating wages that is self-enforcing and requires much less 
supervision. Yet, though the most efficient women sometimes benefit, this mode of 
calculation of wages may be unfavourable to women in the heavier tasks, where the pay is 
calculated on the basis of male productivity standards. In addition, it encourages workers, 
</p>
<p>  
 11  In recognition of this, and based on art. 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered the adoption of a policy for 
Nepalese rural women in a verdict of 11 June 2010 (Case 064-wo-186, <i>Advocate Jyoti Lamsal Poudel 
vs. Government of Nepal</i>). This is a welcome development that other courts could emulate.

Fact sheet (2012); see also Decision 50/VI, General statement of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women on rural women, adopted 19 October 2011 (A/67/38, part II, annex II). 
The Committee is currently considering a general recommendation on rural women.

agriculture and rural development</i> (Geneva, 2007), p. 32. </p>


<p>especially women, to have their children work with them as &quot;helpers&quot;, in order to perform 
the task faster. The result is that about 70 per cent of child labour in the world is in 
agriculture, representing approximately 132 million girls and boys aged 5&#8211;14 
(A/HRC/13/33, para. 10). 
</p>
<p>11. Women also are subject to other forms of discrimination, including refusal by 
employers to hire women who are pregnant, leading seasonal pregnant workers to 
sometimes hide their pregnancy in order to maintain their access to income. They are 
particularly exposed to violence and harassment because of their impossibility to move 
away from the plantation.14  
</p>
<p>12. Finally, women may face specific difficulties in reconciling their responsibilities in 
the care economy, particularly as regards the minding and educating of children of pre-
school age, and their work on farms. The lack of access to child-care services in rural areas, 
combined with poor transportation services, sometimes leads women to bring the children 
with them on the plantation, as has been documented in the horticultural sector in Punjab, 
Pakistan,15 or in the informal settlements established near the plantations during the 
working season, as in  South Africa.16  
</p>
<p>13. A number of the issues that in practice are of particular concern to women could be 
addressed in principle through effective policies and laws, and collective bargaining. These 
include equality of opportunity policies, equal pay for work of equal value, maternity leave 
and benefits, child care issues, reproductive health services. However, apart from the 
general problems related to unionization on farms, male-dominated unions do not always 
pay sufficient attention to issues that matter especially to women. Male union 
representatives may fail to consider the gender implications of apparently neutral issues for 
collective bargaining, including how wages are determined, leave, overtime, or bonus 
systems since these often in reality impact on women and men differently.17 To address this 
problem, the International Union of Food and Agricultural Workers (IUF) has for example 
produced a gender-equality guide and aims at a 40 per cent representation of women on all 
its committees.18 
</p>
<p><b> B. Women's access to off-farm employment 
</b></p>
<p>14. Women's access to employment in the industry or the services sectors of the 
economy requires improved access to education for girls; and infrastructural and services 
investments that relieve women from part of the burden of the household chores that 
women shoulder disproportionately. Millennium Development Goal 1, on the eradication of 
extreme poverty and hunger, includes a target (1.B) to &quot;achieve full and productive 
employment and decent work for all, including women and young people,&quot; an implicit 
recognition that women, due to discrimination and lack of educational opportunities, are 
generally disadvantaged in access to employment. In September 2010, Heads of State and

<p>Government at the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals 
pledged to invest in &quot;infrastructure and labour-saving technologies, especially in rural 
areas, benefiting women and girls by reducing their burden of domestic activities, affording 
the opportunity for girls to attend school and women to engage in self-employment or 
participate in the labour market,&quot; as well as to remove &quot;barriers and expanding support for 
girls&#8223; education through measures such as providing free primary education, a safe 
environment for schooling and financial assistance such as scholarships and cash transfer 
programmes&quot;.19  
</p>
<p>15. Improving access to education for girls requires that the incentives structures for 
families be changed, and that social and cultural norms that lead parents to interrupt the 
schooling of girls earlier than that of boys be challenged.  Many poor households are unable 
to send girls to school because of the costs, both direct and indirect (school fees or other 
costs related to attending school, such as uniforms and books), of doing so; because of 
opportunity costs (girls who go to school are not available to work within the household);  
because of the commute involved, when the family lives at a far distance from the nearest 
school, and associated security concerns. The absence of separate sanitation facilities for 
girls in schools can also be a major obstacle. 
</p>
<p>16. Various programmes have proven to be effective in removing some of these 
obstacles. Bangladesh launched the Female Secondary School Assistance Project (FSSAP) 
in 1993; ten years later, as it entered its second phase, the project covered one quarter of 
rural Bangladesh and now benefits almost one million girls across the country in more than 
6,000 schools.20 FSSAP provides a stipend to girls who agree to delay marriage until they 
complete secondary education, for a total cost to the programme of about  US$121 per year 
per person; and it has improved sanitation facilities in schools. It has spectacularly 
succeeded in improving girls' school attendance rates.  
</p>
<p>17. Another successful example is the female school stipend programme introduced by 
the Government of Punjab, Pakistan, in 2004, as part of the broader Punjab Education 
Sector Reform Programme (PESRP), inaugurated in 2003. In targeted districts defined by 
their low literacy rate, the female school stipend programme provides girls a stipend (an 
amount slightly higher than the average cost of schooling), conditional on class attendance. 
An early study of the impacts of this stipend found a modest but statistically significant 
impact on girls' attendance of schools.21  
</p>
<p>18. School-feeding programmes can also make a significant contribution to improving 
access to education for girls, with impacts ranging from 19 to 38 per cent in increased 
female school attendance, according to certain cross-country studies.22 The provision of 
take-home rations to pupils can be particularly effective in this respect, especially where 
markets are unreliable or prices of essential food commodities highly volatile, or where the 
capacity of the schools to provide meals is limited. In Pakistan, the provision of take-home 
rations to girls attending school for at least 20 days a month made overall enrolment grow

<p>by 135 percent from 1998-99 to 2003-04.23 In Afghanistan, school enrolment has increased 
significantly since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, though &#8211; due to cultural norms, 
lack of sanitation facilities and the security situation &#8211; the enrolment of girls in schools as 
compared to boys remains very low (at 0.35 in 2008).24 WFP seeks to bridge this gap by 
distributing a monthly ration of 3.7 litres of vegetable oil to girls, conditional upon a 
minimum school attendance of 22 days per month. In Malawi, the introduction into the 
school-feeding programme of take-home rations of 12.5 kg of maize per month for girls and 
double orphans attending at least 80 per cent of school days led to a 37.7 per cent increase 
in girls' enrolment. In Lao People&#8223;s Democratic Republic, where girls&#8223; enrolment can be 
very low, particularly in rural areas and within some ethnic groups, pupils receive a take-
home family ration of canned fish, rice and iodized salt as an incentive for parents to send 
them to school. From 2002 to 2008, enrolment rates in primary schools benefiting from the 
programme increased from 60 percent to 88 percent for boys and from 53 percent to 84 
percent for girls.25  
</p>
<p>19. School-feeding programmes can also have important multiplier effects on the local 
economy. The above-mentioned study of the mid-day meals programme in India was found 
to create employment opportunities for poor women: in the sampled schools, more than two 
thirds of the cooks were women, often from underprivileged backgrounds. Ideally, under 
these programmes, priority should be given to disadvantaged persons when hiring, and 
living wages should be paid to the women employed through them. The local procurement 
of foods, and local processing, provides market opportunities for local food producers and 
service providers. In this regard, the Right to Food Guidelines recommends that States 
&quot;consider the benefits of local procurement for food assistance that could integrate the 
nutritional needs of those affected by food insecurity and the commercial interests of local 
producers&quot;26. In Brazil, Act No. 11,947 of 16 June 2009 requires that the national school 
feeding programme (PNAE), benefiting 49 million children, source 30 per cent of its food 
from family farms. Linkages with public works programmes could also be encouraged, in 
which poor, unemployed women could be paid to cook meals in schools.   
</p>
<p>20. In addition to expanding their economic opportunities in later life, higher enrolment 
rates for girls delay marriage and can thus lower the number of children a woman has, 
therefore enabling more women to seek employment with higher incomes. Low levels of 
education and early marriage create a vicious cycle in which women have many children 
and thus reduced opportunities for improving their education and seeking employment 
outside the home. Higher levels of education means women can take control over their 
fertility and be able to make informed decisions in terms of their sexual health and family 
planning, resulting in fewer children and improved economic opportunities.27 
</p>
<p>21. While improved access to education is essential to creating such economic 
opportunities for women, such efforts will only be effective in combination with other 
measures. These include active labour policies that gradually improve the representation of 
women in all sectors and break down the vertical and horizontal segmentation of the labour

<p>market where it exists, through positive action;28 measures aimed at reconciling family and 
professional life, and access to employment for workers with family responsibilities, as 
stipulated in ILO Convention No. 156 (1981) on Workers with family responsibilities. Both 
of these measures should be combined with efforts to break down gender stereotypes, not 
only as regards the type of employment performed by women, but also as regard the 
allocation of responsibilities between women and men in the discharging of family 
responsibilities. Indeed, although more women than ever are gainfully employed, their 
share of family responsibilities has not diminished. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Women's access to social protection 
</b></p>
<p>22. The right to social security, as guaranteed under the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, includes access to health care; benefits and services 
to persons without work-related income due to sickness, disability, maternity, employment 
injury, unemployment, old age or death of a family member, including contributory or non-
contributory pensions for all older persons; family and child support sufficient to cover 
food, clothing, housing, water and sanitation; survivor and orphan benefits.29 The Special 
Rapporteur observes that, in many cases, the specific situation of women is not considered 
in the design and implementation of programmes. Three examples may serve to illustrate 
this.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Social transfer programmes30 
</b></p>
<p>23. Most social transfer programmes are in the form of cash transfer programmes which 
can be conditional or unconditional. Unconditional cash transfer programmes correspond 
better to the idea that social protection is a human right that should benefit all those in need 
of income support. They reduce the risks of under-inclusion and may be easier to 
administer where the administrative capacity is weak. A comparison across three Latin 
American countries concluded that verifying compliance with conditionalities represented 
18 per cent of the administrative costs of the programme, and 2 per cent of the total costs.31 
</p>
<p>24. However, partly because of concerns with the fiscal sustainability of unconditional 
cash transfer programs, and partly in order to encourage poor families to invest more in 
their children and thus reduce the inter-generational transmission of poverty, conditional 
cash transfers (CCTs) have been expanding in recent years. Such CCTs generally target 
certain poor regions and, within those regions, poor households. They generally provide 
cash or sometimes nutritional supplements, usually to the mother or primary caregiver, 
provided certain conditions are met. These conditions relate most often to children&#8223;s school 
enrolment and attendance level, and attendance at pre- and postnatal health-care 
appointments to ensure that children receive appropriate vaccinations and to check their 
growth. In previous mission reports, the Special Rapporteur discussed the well-known 
CCTs that have been launched in Mexico (<i>Progresa</i>/<i>Oportunidades</i>) and in Brazil (<i>Bolsa

<p><i>Familia</i>) (A/HRC/13/33/Add.6 and A/HRC/19/59/Add.2). An early example is 
Bangladesh&#8223;s Female Secondary School Assistance Project (FSSAP) launched in 1993 (see 
para. 16 above), which was complemented, in July 2002, by the Primary Education Stipend 
Project (PESP). The PESP aimed to increase the educational participation (enrolment, 
continued attendance and educational performance) of primary school children from poor 
families throughout Bangladesh (initially estimated at more than 5 million pupils) by 
providing cash payments to targeted households. Despite significant targeting problems 
during its initial phase, the programme is credited for improving educational attainments.  
</p>
<p>25. Insofar as conditionalities can improve the educational attainments of girls, they 
should be welcomed. CCT benefits are usually given to women, as the &#8220;caregivers&#8221; of 
households &#8211; in Brazil, 94 per cent of the recipients of the <i>Bolsa Familia</i> transfers are 
women.32 This is expected to strengthen their negotiating role within the family, although 
such an outcome is far from automatic.33 The Right to Food Guidelines recommend that 
States &quot;give priority to channelling food assistance via women as a means of enhancing 
their decision-making role and ensuring that the food is used to meet the household&#8223;s food 
requirements.&quot; (guideline 13.4). Beyond these aspects however, too little attention has been 
paid to the gender impacts of CCTs, when such programmes are put in place. Three 
concerns have emerged: </p>
<p> (a) The approach adopted by CCT programmes may reinforce gender 
stereotyped roles as women are prioritized as &quot;mothers&quot; and &#8220;caregivers&#8221;, rather than 
empowered as equal to men. Women are relied upon to ensure that the household invests in 
children, leading some authors to claim that child-centered policies such as those illustrated 
by CCT programmes tend to sideline &quot;the equality claims of adult women and attention to 
their needs [...] in favor of those of children, including girls.&quot;34  
</p>
<p> (b) Conditionalities are sometimes designed in ways that do not sufficiently take 
into account the time constraints that women face, in that it is usually the women who are 
expected to ensure that the conditionalities are met, especially as regards regular visits to 
health-care centres.  
</p>
<p> (c) Where compliance with the conditionalities requires women to leave the 
household, it may present an opportunity for them to obtain information about their rights 
and about practices that can improve nutritional outcomes within their household, and 
enable them to broaden their social network. But the cultural norms that reduce the mobility 
of women and their time poverty could make their participation in such programmes 
impossible.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Public works programmes 
</b></p>
<p>26. Public works programmes are designed to provide employment to families who have 
no other source of income; remuneration is usually in the form of cash (cash-for-work) or 
food (food-for-work), or a combination of both. Because the work is demanding and the

Agenda: Progresa/Oportunidades, Mexico's Conditional Transfer Programme&quot;,<i> Social Politics and 
Administration</i>, vol. 40, No. 4 (2006), pp. 429-40). This result is consistent with studies that 
document the widespread character of the appropriation of women's wages by men. 
</p>

Politics</i>, vol. 16, No. 4 (2009), pp. 446-483. </p>


<p>wages are low (or payment is made in the form of food items), only those in genuine need, 
who have run out of other options, may seek to enter these programmes, which are 
therefore self-targeting. Public works programmes may serve to create physical 
infrastructure (such as irrigation schemes, wells or rural roads) or to deliver environmental 
services (for instance hillside terracing or other landscape arrangements to facilitate the 
capture of rain water or the planting of trees) that contribute to long-term development 
aims.  
</p>
<p>27. Many public works schemes set aside a quota for women. India&#8223;s Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), introduced in 2005 and which 
benefited 52.5 million households in 2009-2010, provides for one third of the employment 
to be allocated to women.35 The Rural Maintenance Programme in Bangladesh goes even 
further; it is an all-women programme, successfully employing over 50,000 rural women to 
maintain 60,000 miles of earthen roads.36 While access to employment in such programmes 
can favour the empowerment of women, paying greater attention to the gender impacts 
could significantly increase their benefits to women: 
</p>
<p> (a)  Women may choose not to participate in such programmes because of the 
heavy demands it would impose on them and the difficulties they may have in reconciling 
the work with their responsibilities in the &quot;care&quot; economy. A system of quotas may be 
ineffective to address this. The difficulties women may face to participate in public works 
programmes should therefore be taken into account: their responsibilities in the &quot;care&quot; 
economy should be recognized and accommodation measures should be adopted. 
Furthermore, work schedules should take into account the specific time constraints faced by 
women, and institutionalized child care should be implemented to attract more women. 
Where child care at the work site is under the responsibility of women who are labour-
constrained, because of age or disability, this can further increase the opportunities the 
programme offers to women. Thus, the MGNREGA includes a provision that &quot;in the event 
that there are at least five children under the age of six at the worksite, one of the female 
workers shall be deputed to look after them and paid the same wage as other NREGA 
workers.&quot; However, the implementation of this clause remains highly uneven as most 
women joining the programme are discouraged from bringing their children to work, and a 
social audit of the implementation of MGNREGA revealed that 70 per cent of the women 
interviewed had no access to child-care facilities on the worksite, while 65 per cent were 
not aware of this provision in the Act.37  
</p>
<p> (b)  Similar self-exclusion may occur where the work proposed under the public 
works programmes is considered too demanding physically (more suitable for men) or 
violates certain cultural norms as to which tasks are suitable for women. The challenge in 
this case would be to ensure that the division of tasks on the programme takes into account 
the specific constraints faced by women, without reinforcing gender stereotypes. This may 
be done by adopting a phased approach. During a first phase, some work may be designated 
as &quot;light&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; with priority for women, and some work as &quot;heavy&quot; and assigned 
to men; and certain tasks that are traditionally performed by women could be included in 
public works programmes, for instance preparing food in community kitchens or 
maintaining community vegetable gardens. At the same time, it should be ensured that

<p>women are paid the same wages as men. During a second phase, in order to reduce the risk 
that such an approach might reinforce gender stereotypes, women could gradually be 
encouraged to learn how to perform tasks traditionally assigned to men, so that in time 
&quot;role-shifting&quot; will occur.38 
</p>
<p> (c)  The assets created by the programme could serve to ease the situation of rural 
women in the areas concerned, consistent with the aim of reducing the burden that they 
shoulder.39 For instance, digging boreholes or planting trees can reduce the time women 
spend fetching water or fuelwood in the community where such work is performed. As 
illustrated by Ethiopia's cash-for-work Productive Safety Net Programme, public works 
programmes could serve to support agricultural work on the private land of female-headed 
households which generally suffer from chronic labour shortage. Public works could serve 
to improve physical infrastructure in rural areas and establish food-processing technologies, 
in order to reduce the drudgery of cooking and laundry.40 Public works programmes also 
could include health extension work, adult literacy or HIV/AIDS prevention, all of which 
could be immediately attractive for women.  
</p>
<p> (d)  Women should be involved in the design and evaluation of public works 
programmes. This could ensure that the right balance is struck between the need for a 
gender-sensitive approach and the risk of reinforcement of gender stereotyping. It could 
also help determine the modes of payment, in particular whether payment should be in the 
form of food or cash. While cash payments leave the beneficiaries greater choice, it may 
also facilitate the appropriation by men of women's wages, especially if the payment is not 
deposited electronically into a bank account in the woman&#8223;s name. Also, cash payment may 
not be the preferred solution if purchasing food is time-consuming or if markets are 
unreliable due, for instance, to the lack of stability of supply of certain staple foods41 or the 
high volatility of prices in the market. Indeed, women may express a preference for 
payment in the form of food rations or  payment on a daily basis, rather than on a monthly 
basis, especially if their priority concern is the daily subsistence of their families. Such 
issues can only be addressed through effective participation of women in the shaping of 
programmes intended to benefit them. Participation is thus both an end in itself &#8211; a source 
of empowerment &#8211; and a means &#8211; as it can significantly increase the effectiveness of the 
programmes and their ability to make a difference to women.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Asset transfer schemes 
</b></p>
<p>28. Under asset transfer schemes, productive assets, such as small livestock, are 
provided to poor households to support their income generation activities. Bangladesh's 
Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction - Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR) 
programme, launched in 2002 by the non-governmental organization Building Resources 
Across Communities (BRAC), demonstrates the benefits of adopting a gender-sensitive 
approach. For instance, it takes into account the fact that female-headed households are 
often more labour-constrained (both due to &quot;care&quot; responsibilities of women and the lower 
ratio of income earners to dependents in those households) and provides assets, such as

<p>poultry, which require less labour to maintain and become a source of income.42 BRAC also 
seeks to strengthen the beneficiary&#8223;s capacity to use the assets productively, and encourages 
the political empowerment of the poor. The programme provides for the establishment of 
seven-member Village Poverty Reduction Committees, comprising representatives of 
BRAC, beneficiaries of CFPR, as well as respected individuals drawn from the landed and 
wealthy elites of the local community. Instead of aiming to reduce the power of the local 
elites as part of the priorities of poverty-reduction interventions, the programme seeks the 
active involvement of local notables in order to enlist their support. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Women's access to productive resources 
</b></p>
<p>29. Due to prevalent societal norms and gender roles, their higher average levels of 
education, and the fact that they are less constrained, men are often better placed to seize 
opportunities arising from employment creation in the industry and services sectors. The 
result is that, with some exceptions (e.g. women migration for household work), men tend 
to migrate first from rural areas, for longer periods and to further destinations. Women stay 
behind in the village &#8211; especially relatively older women, beyond 35 years of age, who are 
poorly educated and less independent &#8211; to take care of the children and the elderly, and 
increasingly, also to tend the family plot of land. Data in this area are often imprecise and 
difficult to interpret, partly because of the lack of gender-disaggregated data, as much of 
women&#8223;s contribution to &quot;subsistence&quot; agriculture goes unreported in official statistics, and 
because the share of women's employment in agriculture varies from crop to crop and from 
activity to activity &#8211; ploughing, for instance, remains predominantly a task performed by 
men. Nonetheless, overall, this feminization of agriculture is well documented.43   
</p>
<p>30. Concerns have been expressed about the impact that the feminization of agriculture 
may have on local food security, given the obstacles women face which negatively affect 
their productivity. Indeed, women often have little legal protection or rights to property 
ownership, and they face cultural and social norms that hinder their ability to improve 
productivity. How can these challenges be met? In the longer term, improving education for 
women and expanding opportunities for them in off-farm employment are key. But for the 
large number of women who depend on agriculture, including, increasingly, urban and peri-
urban agriculture (see A/HRC/19/59, para. 44), it is equally important &#8211; and urgent &#8211; to 
improve women&#8223;s opportunities to thrive as producers. Gender-sensitive agricultural 
policies are required,44 consistent with guideline 8.6 of the Right to Food Guidelines 
concerning women&#8223;s full and equal participation in the economy and the right of women to 
</p>
<p>inherit and possess land and other property, and access to productive resources, including 
credit, land, water and appropriate technologies.  
</p>
<p>31. <b><i>Access to land</i></b>  is key in this regard. In an earlier report (A/65/281), the Special 
Rapporteur discussed the vital role of access to land for small-scale agricultural producers, 
and the importance of addressing the discrimination women face in that regard. The right of 
women to have equal access to land is explicitly addressed by the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and in numerous Human

<p>Rights Council and General Assembly resolutions on the right to food. At the 2010 High-
level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, 
Heads of State and Government also committed to promoting and protecting women's equal 
access to property and to land, as well as to productive resources.45 Indeed, land is more 
than an economic asset that women should be allowed to use productively. It is also a 
means of empowerment, as the greater economic independence that results from land 
ownership enhances the woman's role in decision-making and allows her to garner more 
social, family and community support.  
</p>
<p>32. Women face multiple forms of discrimination in accessing land. As regards land that 
is inherited, laws in many countries still discriminate against women, and even when the 
discriminatory elements are removed, the laws are often circumvented under the pressure of 
social and cultural norms. For instance, where a sister could inherit land on an equal basis 
with her brothers, she may accept a lump-sum payment in lieu of her portion of the land in 
order to maintain good relations with her brothers.46 As regards land that is acquired during 
marriage, in a number of regions, particularly in South Asia, a separation of property 
regime is applied, according to which assets brought into the marriage or acquired during 
marriage remain the individual property of the spouse who acquired said assets from his or 
her personal funds. But this leads to deeply inequitable outcomes, as it does not recognize 
the important non-monetary contribution that women make to the household by looking 
after the house, child-rearing, caring for the elderly, or various other chores.47  
</p>
<p>33. Women also face discrimination in accessing<b> <i>extension services</i></b> .48 First, women are 
underrepresented among extension services agents. Yet, in some contexts, social or cultural 
rules may prohibit contacts between a woman farmer and a male agricultural agent, 
especially when the woman is single, widowed or abandoned. Moreover, male agents may 
have less understanding for the specific constraints faced by women. Second, extension 
services tend to presume that any knowledge transmitted to the men will automatically 
trickle down to the women and so that they benefit equally, and meetings may be organized 
without taking into account the specific time and mobility constraints of women. This 
reinforces the pre-existing imbalances in decision-making within the household and 
neglects the fact that the needs of women may be different from those of men. 
</p>
<p>34. The third area is <b><i>finance</i></b> . Microcredit schemes often target rural women specifically, 
who, even more than men, face obstacles in accessing credit. However, far more could be 
done. First, improved access to loans for rural women does not necessarily imply that 
women will control the use of the loans. Some microfinance programmes directed at 
women have been assessed to be successful in increasing the participation of women in 
decision-making within the household, particularly as regards family planning and the 
children&#8223;s education, and other members of the household have sometimes assumed a 
greater share of the housework since women who benefit from a microcredit programme 
tend to spend more time on their businesses and contribute more to the household income.

<p>in the early 1990s is one example.49 But, overall evidence is mixed. Because the 
creditworthiness of women (as measured by loan repayment rates) is higher than that of 
men, women in practice may be used as convenient &quot;middlemen&quot; by the lending 
institutions&#8223; field workers and by the male members of households. This runs the risk of 
creating increased tensions within the household when the husband or other male relative 
does not give the woman the money to allow her to repay the loan on time or when the 
woman cannot access the loans she has obtained.50 Women benefiting from microcredit in 
rural Bangladesh, for instance through the Grameen Bank, only seldom use the loans to run 
their own businesses, Instead of becoming entrepreneurs themselves, they often use the 
loans to support the capital of existing businesses that are usually managed by male 
members in the household or to support their husbands in launching micro-enterprises.51 
Similar results were found in Andra Pradesh, India.52 
</p>
<p>35. Second, there is an inherent tension between the hope that microfinance programmes 
can function as a financially self-sustaining means of addressing rural poverty, and the 
objective of supporting the poorest women and single women with a low capacity to 
improve their productivity levels &#8211; because they may be poorly qualified or illiterate, or 
cannot move beyond home-based activities due to their household responsibilities. The 
result is that while microfinance programmes increasingly target rural women, they mainly 
benefit the women who already have most assets or who have male relatives to work with 
them, and often do not reach the poorest, who operate in a &quot;mini-economy&quot; of very small 
transactions, so small in fact that the transaction costs of dealing with them are too high 
even for microcredit institutions.53 
</p>
<p>36. Finally, in order to make a stronger contribution to poverty alleviation and to 
women's empowerment, <b><i>agricultural research and development</i></b>  could take into account 
the specific constraints faced by women and their preferences. For instance, women may 
prefer crop varieties that can be more easily prepared for the family or that are easier to 
cultivate, for instance, those that are less threatened by weeds or can be easily husked. 
Because of the obstacles women face in accessing credit, they may prefer to grow crops 
following agro-ecological, low-external-input techniques, which also avoid the need to 
transport bags of fertilizers, which could be difficult in the absence of adequate means of 
transportation.54 Rural women possess traditional farming knowledge and skills that, in 
many cases, represent a huge, largely untapped potential.

<p>37. The recognition that women may have different priorities to those of men leads to 
fundamental questions about the type of support they should be provided. For instance, 
titling schemes as a means to increase security of tenure may be considered with scepticism 
if the schemes are captured by men or elites or if it implies encouraging the development of 
a market for land rights, when land is more than an economic asset for many rural 
households, particularly women who depend on land for a non-cash type of production to 
feed their families. Similarly, if microcredit schemes crowd out other forms of support 
provided to small-scale food producers, it may result in forcing beneficiaries, women in 
particular, to move towards production for the market, rather than for self-consumption, 
something which may not correspond to the priorities of women in specific contexts. 
Developing agricultural research in ways that are more responsive to women's needs may 
result in greater attention being paid to the preservation of the resource base on which they 
rely, not only for agricultural production but also for domestic needs (medicinal plants, 
fuelwood, wild fruit). It may also result in more attention being paid to the more nutritious 
food crops, rather than to only staple crops, particularly cereals; and in choices in 
agricultural research that focus more on the post-harvesting phase &#8211; not simply on the 
prospects of selling the produce in high-value markets, but also on the possibility of 
preserving food from losses, the nutritional value of the food that is produced for 
consumption within the household, or the impact a particular variety may have on the time 
constraints of women. 
</p>
<p>38. Involving women in the design, implementation and assessment of all these policies, 
could therefore have deeply transformative effects on how we conceive of the role of small-
scale farming itself. This is why participation matters: it is to ensure that women have real 
choices. The strengthening of women's cooperatives or encouraging group farming by 
women's collectives are also important for that reason. Not only should women be able to 
overcome the obstacles that obstruct their ability to be as productive as men, they should 
also be able to redefine the priorities of the small-scale farming system, of which they are 
becoming the main actors.  
</p>
<p><b> V. A human rights response 
</b></p>
<p>39. A human rights-based strategy to address gender discrimination against women 
includes four complementary requirements. It must relieve women of the burdens of 
household chores; it must be empowering and challenge the existing division of roles; it 
must systematically aim at taking into account gender in existing food security strategies; 
and, as regards governance, it must be part of a multisectoral and multi-year effort, 
including independent monitoring of progress towards certain targets.    
</p>
<p><b>  Relieving women of the burdens of the &quot;care&quot; economy 
</b></p>
<p>40. A first requirement is breaking the cycle of discrimination against women. This does 
not mean simply removing discriminatory provisions in the law, particularly as regards 
access to land or other productive resources, but it also requires that the structural causes of 
de facto discrimination be addressed. In particular, measures should be taken to relieve 
women of the burden imposed on them by the duties they assume in the &quot;care&quot; economy, 
and to improve their economic opportunities by better access to education and employment.  
Older women are particularly at risk of food insecurity as the cumulative effect of 
discrimination in accessing employment tends to leave older women with </p>


<p>disproportionately lower (or no) incomes and pensions in later life; yet older women are 
expected to take care of other, more dependent members of the household.55 
</p>
<p>41. Certain investments can significantly reduce the burden that household chores 
impose on women. In rural areas, such measures include the provision of water services and 
afforestation projects to reduce the time spent fetching water and fuelwood. In both rural 
and urban areas, measures would include the establishment or strengthening of child-care 
services and care for the elderly or persons with illness/disability. By reducing the time 
poverty of women, their economic opportunities would expand, since it would be easier for 
them to seek employment outside the household; access incomes and increase their 
economic independece, which, in turn, would strengthen their bargaining position within 
the household. In order for such opportunities to be seized, access to education for girls and 
life-long training must be improved and societal perceptions of gender roles which 
discriminate against women must be changed. Improved education and employment 
prospects are mutually reinforcing, as the demand for education (investment in human 
capital) will increase in proportion to increase in the demand for a qualified female 
workforce.  
</p>
<p><b>  Empowering women and subverting the gendered division of roles 
</b></p>
<p>42. A second requirement is achieving the right combination of measures that recognize 
the specific obstacles women face (particularly time poverty and restricted mobility 
resulting from their role in the &quot;care&quot; economy), and measures that seek to transform the 
existing gender division of roles by redistributing tasks both within the household and in 
other spheres.  As long as we simply recognize the role of women in the &quot;care&quot; economy by 
accommodating their specific needs, the existing division of roles within the household and 
associated gender stereotypes will remain in place, and could even be reinforced. 
Redistributing roles and challenging the associated gender stereotypes require a 
transformative approach, whereby the support provided to women not only recognizes their 
specific needs, but seen provides the opportunity to question existing social and cultural 
norms. 
</p>
<p>43. Such transformative approach is clearly required under human rights law. The 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women affirms that 
&quot;a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the 
family is needed to achieve full equality between men and women&quot; (preamble, 14th para). 
Accordingly, States Parties shall seek, inter alia, to &quot;modify the social and cultural patterns 
of conduct of men and women&quot;, and to promote the &quot;recognition of the common 
responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children&quot; (art. 
5 (a). In reference to this provision, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women has urged States to combat patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes regarding 
the roles and responsibilities of women and men within the family and society at large 
(women being considered as having the primary responsibility for child-rearing and 
domestic tasks, and men being considered the main breadwinners) and to reject the concept 
that assigns the role of  &#8220;head of the household&#8221; to men.56 
</p>
<p>44. The transformative approach implies that as policies seek to accommodate the 
specific needs of women, they should also seek to subvert traditional gendered divisions of 
roles. The two objectives are not necessarily easy to reconcile, but they should be

</p>

<p>prioritized in the design and implementation of programmes and given careful, context-
sensitive consideration. In public works programmes for instance, where a gender-blind 
approach may lead to the de facto exclusion of women, the specific contributions and needs 
of women should be acknowledged, such as access to nurseries or adapted schedules, in 
order to enable them to effectively benefit from the programmes.  
</p>
<p>45. For this reason also, interventions aimed at improving the situation of women should 
be empowering. Social protection programmes should define the beneficiaries as rights-
holders who can make claims against the administrations in charge of delivery, and 
beneficiaries should be informed of their rights and access to claims mechanisms should eb 
ensured. In addition to ensuring decentralized monitoring of the implementation of social 
programmes and providing a safeguard against corruption or discrimination, this will 
contribute to empowering beneficiaries, in particular women, who are generally treated as 
passive recipients of programmes that are intended to help them without including them as 
active participants.  
</p>
<p>46. Social audits can also be an effective means of empowering women within the local 
communities, if their views are sought expressly and if the community audit exercise is 
only considered valid if women are adequately represented. Social audits can take different 
forms: a public report to the village assembly by government officials on the use of funds 
allocated to certain programmes and on the allocations to the beneficiaries (whether they 
are individuals employed in cash-for-work schemes or schools supported in school-feeding 
schemes); publication of revenues and disbursements on the Internet, which would enable 
non-governmental organizations to track instances of misuse or diversion of funds; citizens' 
report cards, as in India or the Philippines; community score cards, as in Kenya and the 
Gambia; or budgetary audits as those conducted by Javanese farmers in Indonesia.57  
</p>
<p><b>  Mainstreaming gender sensitivity 
</b></p>
<p>47. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur emphasized the added value of a gender 
impact analysis of trade and investment agreements and contract farming schemes 
(A/HRC/19/59/Add.5, principle 5, and A/66/262, para. 21). All public policies that address 
food security &#8211; whether social programmes, agricultural policies or rural development 
policies &#8211; should ensure that greater attention is paid to women. This should not be simply 
in order to reach them more effectively, but also to ensure that their views are 
systematically sought in the design, implementation and evaluation of programmes. One 
way in which this could be encouraged is by incentivizing public administrations to set 
targets related to gender equality, and rewarding, through a system of premiums, public 
officials who reach the targets. Chile's Program for Improved Public Management (PIPM) 
provides an example:58 since 2002, almost every ministry is required to establish specific 
goals incorporating the gender dimension into their public policies. The Women&#8223;s Service 
assesses the efforts made and the tools used, and the Ministry of Finance establishes the 
corresponding monetary bonuses. In addition, the programme is complemented by 
the incorporation of  gender advisors in each ministry, as well as a Women&#180;s Agenda and a 
long-term Plan for Equal Opportunities.    
</p>
<p><b>  A multisectoral and rights-based strategy 
</b></p>
<p>48. A successful strategy for strengthening the rights of women in support of the 
realization of the right to food requires a whole-of-government approach, coordinated

<p>across various ministries, including those responsible for health, education, employment, 
social affairs and agriculture. For instance, for the multiplier effects of school-feeding 
programmes to be maximized, coordinated action between departments responsible for 
agriculture, education and employment isrequired. Such a strategy should include targets, 
defined through a participatory process, and independent monitoring of their achievement 
within specified time frames. The outcomes to be achieved should be defined through 
indicators based on the normative components of the right to food, and disaggregated by 
ethnicity, age and gender in order to ensure that a gender-sensitive approach will be 
adopted in all sectors, and that multiple forms of discrimination, such as that experienced 
by older women and indigenous women, is tracked and addressed effectively. The 
systematic collection of gender-disaggregated data is key to this objective. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>International human rights law requires States to guarantee gender equality 
and the empowerment of women. While essential to the </b>women&#8217;s <b>right to food, this 
</b></p>
<p><b>would also contribute to the realization of the right to food for other members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. The advancement of women's rights translates into improved physical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mental development of children, whose ability to learn and to lead healthy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>productive lives will gain; it translates into better health and nutritional outcomes for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the household, as the decision-making power within the family is rebalanced in favour 
</b></p>
<p><b>of women; and it results in higher productivity for women as small-scale food 
</b></p>
<p><b>producers.  
</b></p>
<p>50. States&#8217;<b> obligation to remove all discriminatory provisions in the law, and to 
combat discrimination that has its source in social and cultural norms, is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediate obligation that must be complied with without delay. This should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>combined with the use of temporary special measures to accelerate the achievement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender equality, and with effective remedies for women who are victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination. In addition, as detailed in chapter V of this report, States should (a) 
</b></p>
<p><b>make the investments required to relieve women of the burden of the household 
</b></p>
<p><b>chores they currently shoulder; (b) recognize the need to accommodate the specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>time and mobility constraints on women as a result of their role in the &quot;care&quot; 
</b></p>
<p><b>economy, while at the same time redistributing the gender roles by a transformative 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to employment and social protection; (c) mainstream concern for gender in 
</b></p>
<p><b>all laws, policies and programmes, where appropriate, by developing incentives that 
</b></p>
<p><b>reward public administrations which make progress in setting and reaching targets in 
</b></p>
<p><b>this regard; (d) adopt multisector and multi-year strategies that move towards full 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality for women, under the supervision of an independent body to monitor 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress, relying on gender-disaggregated data in all areas relating to the achievement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of food security.
