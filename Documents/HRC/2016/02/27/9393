 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report is submitted in accordance with resolution 6/12 of the Human Rights Council 
and summarizes the main activities that the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people has undertaken since submitting his second 
report to the Human Rights Council. During that period the Special Rapporteur continued to 
transmit information to Governments regarding alleged violations of the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples (see annex 1). The Special Rapporteur also 
undertook an official mission to Bolivia. A preliminary note on the visit is annexed to this report 
(see annex 2). Lastly, the Special Rapporteur lays before the Council some general 
considerations on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples 
in Asia, a region to which he has given special attention this year (see annex 3). 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic analysis in his third periodic report to the Council 
focuses on the implications of the human rights-based approach to development. Indigenous 
peoples are identified, according to this approach, as human rights holders and the realization of 
their rights is posited as the main objective of development. The recently adopted United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides a clear normative framework for 
development policies and actions on behalf of indigenous peoples based on self-determination; 
free, prior and informed consent; effective participation, autonomy and self-management; 
territorial control and non-discrimination. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people was established by Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2001/57. The Human Rights Council renewed the mandate in its resolution 6/12, 
which invites the Special Rapporteur to &#8220;examine ways and means of overcoming existing 
obstacles to the full and effective protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, in conformity with his/her mandate, and to identify, exchange and promote 
best practices&#8221; (para. 1 (a)) and to &#8220;submit a report on the implementation of his/her mandate to 
the Council in accordance with its annual programme of work&#8221; (para. 1 (j)). 
</p><p>2. In 2007 the Special Rapporteur submitted his second report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/4/32). He undertook an official mission to Bolivia from 25 November to 
6 December 2007, on which a preliminary note is annexed to this report (annex 2). As in 
previous years, he continued to receive allegations of violations of the rights of indigenous 
peoples, which were transmitted in some cases to Governments and other relevant bodies in the 
form of urgent appeals or letters of allegation. A summary of these communications and of the 
replies received is annexed to the present report (annex 1). 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur continued to compile information on the human rights situation of 
indigenous peoples in different parts of the world, kept track of relevant developments in the 
United Nations system, and participated in national and international expert seminars, technical 
advisory missions and other activities having a direct bearing on his mandate. Special mention 
should be made of activities in Asian countries (Cambodia, Nepal, the Philippines) organized by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and by diverse 
indigenous civil-society organizations. These activities, together with numerous communications 
received in recent years, served as the basis for some general considerations on the situation of 
human rights of indigenous peoples in Asia, which are presented as an annex to this report 
(annex 3). 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur submitted his fourth report to the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session in October 2007 (see A/62/286). He also attended the sixth session of the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (New York, May 2007) and takes note of the Forum&#8217;s 
recommendations to him for the planning of his future activities. The Special Rapporteur also 
attended the sixth session of the Human Rights Council (Geneva, September 2007), taking part 
in the discussion concerning the renewal of the mandate pertaining to the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, which was extended for a period of three 
years (resolution 6/12). 
</p>
<p>5. In response to a civil society invitation, he undertook a joint visit in September 2007 with 
the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard 
of living, Mr. Miloon Kothari, to the communities directly affected by the construction of the 
La Parota hydroelectric project in the State of Guerrero (Mexico). The observations of the 
Special Rapporteurs on this situation and their recommendations aimed at safeguarding the rights 
of the communities concerned were set out in a communication addressed subsequently to the 
Government of Mexico. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur hereby submits his third report to the Council, which analyses the 
implications of human rights-based development, an issue of special importance in the light of 
the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples on 13 September 2007. The Declaration already forms part of the 
international normative framework that is required to assess the human rights situation of 
indigenous peoples.<b>1</b> The Council itself, in extending the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, directs 
him to &#8220;promote the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and 
international instruments relevant to the advancement of the rights of indigenous peoples&#8221; 
(A/HRC/6/L.26, para. 1 (g)). The adoption of the Declaration has provided States, international 
agencies and donors, and civil-society organizations with a clear-cut frame of reference for the 
formulation and implementation of development policies on behalf of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>7. In preparing this report, the Special Rapporteur took into account, inter alia, replies 
received to the questionnaire distributed in August 2007 from the Governments of Argentina, 
Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Guyana, Honduras, Iraq, 
Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. He also received 
replies from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
(UNIFEM), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the Secretariat of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Pan American 
Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) 
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and from a total of 35 indigenous 
organizations and NGOs. The Special Rapporteur wishes to extend sincere thanks for the support 
he received for the preparation of his report. 
</p>
<p><b>I. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND DEVELOPMENT: THE OTHER 
IMPLEMENTATION GAP 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur noted in several previous reports that the protection deficit 
suffered by indigenous peoples covers the whole range of both individual and collective civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights. Redress for many violations may be obtained 
through the traditional protection machinery provided by judicial systems or extrajudicial bodies 
such as national human rights institutions. This applies in particular to civil and political rights, 
although many shortcomings in this area have also been reported in addition to the persistence of 
various forms of discrimination and racism, of which indigenous women are usually the prime 
victims.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  For example, in October 2007 the Supreme Court of Belize cited the Declaration as an 
</p>
<p>authority in a judgement in favour of the Mayan indigenous communities in Toledo. See 
Supreme Court of Belize, <i>Claims No. 171 and 172 (Consolidated)</i> (19 October 2007). 
<b>2
</b>  See, for example, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the administration of justice 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2004/80). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. Goal-oriented public policies are also required to guarantee the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights. The Special Rapporteur has observed in recent years that it is primarily 
in the area of economic, social and cultural rights that a large gap exists between the declared 
aims of Governments and the everyday experience of indigenous peoples, a gap that has been 
widening instead of disappearing. The &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; affecting indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights is not just a legal gap reflected in the failure of case law to keep abreast of legislative 
advances in individual countries.<b>3</b> There is also an &#8220;implementation gap&#8221; between national and 
international recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and State policies and programmes 
affecting indigenous peoples, which frequently fail to take account of or contravene indigenous 
rights. 
</p>
<p>10. To address the historical marginalization and discrimination experienced by indigenous 
peoples, a number of strategies have been implemented to promote their progress and 
development. These strategies may be summarized in terms of the following categories: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Modernization and integration</i>: When the predominant view in States was that 
indigenous communities were &#8220; backward&#8221; or &#8220;primitive&#8221;, the most common strategy advocated 
by the authorities consisted in introducing &#8220;modern&#8221; technology and production methods in 
order to bring about socio-economic change which would resolve what was long referred to as 
the &#8220;indigenous problem&#8221;. Relying on public and missionary schools, religious conversion and 
the imposition of a national language and a uniform school curriculum, many States promoted 
the cultural assimilation of indigenous children in the expectation that after one or two 
generations there would no longer be an indigenous population in their countries. This approach 
has generally had an adverse impact on indigenous peoples, resulting in higher poverty ratios, 
but it continues to be applied in many countries; 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>Economic growth</i>: For the past half century the notion of economic growth has won 
unqualified support on the basis of the theory that if the global economy grows, national 
economies will follow suit and sooner or later indigenous communities (just like other sections 
of the population classified as &#8220;poor&#8221;) will reap the desired benefits. This model is frequently 
associated with giant infrastructural, mining, agro-industrial, tourism and other projects in 
indigenous territories, which have largely - barring some exceptions - proved disastrous for the 
peoples concerned. While they may offer opportunities for advancement to some individuals or 
enterprises (which may, in turn, be indigenous), they have generally had a detrimental impact on 
the well-being of the affected indigenous peoples and have contributed to an increase in poverty 
and social inequality. The economic growth strategy has recently been coupled with the idea of 
sustainable development, primarily to meet environmental concerns, with indigenous peoples 
being excluded from this concept inasmuch as they are baselessly held responsible for the 
destruction of the environment in which they live. The most striking examples of this 
phenomenon, of which the Special Rapporteur has informed the Human Rights Council,<b>4</b> are 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  See the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on the implementation of legislation and case law 
</p>
<p>pertaining to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights (E/CN.4/2006/78). 
<b>4
</b>  A/HRC/4/32, paras. 25 to 41. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>programmes to establish parks or nature reserves, especially in the tropical and semi-tropical 
regions of the world (where a large proportion of the indigenous population is concentrated). In 
some cases the general growth strategy involves an integrated local development approach based 
on the participation of indigenous peoples and communities as development units. It is here that 
the changes have had their most pronounced impact. A term that has more recently come into use 
is development with identity. 
</p>
<p>11. Yet despite the progress achieved and the abundant resources invested in these 
development programmes for decades, the tangible results have been relatively modest. 
Indigenous peoples have had little opportunity to become involved in their own development, 
since they are treated as the object of policies designed by others. Invoking the notion of human 
rights-based development, many indigenous peoples are now demanding autonomy and 
self-determination as an essential basis for promoting and managing their own development 
(a concept defined in terms of their own cultural values rather than one invented by the industrial 
economy). Without autonomy, they say, there can be no genuine human and social development, 
as opposed to economic growth measured in quantitative terms. The United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples specifically recognizes self-determination and autonomy as 
human rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>12. The international consensus on the interdependence between development and human 
rights was forged in the context of the World Summit for Social Development held in 
Copenhagen in 1996, the Millennium Summit of the United Nations and the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2005. Since its adoption as a United Nations 
principle, human rights-based development has begun to gain acceptance internationally and in 
some countries domestically as a frame of reference for public social and economic policies. The 
United Nations specialized agencies, international technical cooperation agencies, some local 
and regional national development strategies and many civil-society organizations are now 
adopting this model. 
</p>
<p>13. The basic principle underlying this approach is that the realization of human rights should 
be the end goal of development, and that development should therefore be perceived as a 
relationship between rights holders and the corresponding duty bearers. All programmes 
designed in accordance with this approach incorporate human rights indicators for the purpose of 
monitoring and assessing the impact of development projects and programmes. The key to this 
approach lies in its explicit link to human rights norms and principles, which are used to identify 
the start-up situation and goals and to assess the development impact. 
</p>
<p>14. The rights-based approach attaches importance both to results and to the development 
process itself, which should take into account basic principles such as the indivisibility and 
universality of human rights; non-discrimination, especially in the case of vulnerable or 
marginalized groups; participation and empowerment; and accountability. It follows that human 
rights-based development requires changes not only in priorities and in the development 
discourse but also political and institutional changes, with a shift of emphasis from microprojects 
to public policies as a whole. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>15. Recognition of indigenous peoples as subjects of rights implies that the communities 
should be assigned a prominent role in determining development priorities and strategies, 
especially with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In north-east 
Cameroon, for example, ILO found that national poverty reduction strategies did not necessarily 
match the priorities of the Mbororo pastoral people, for whom the key to poverty reduction lies 
in the recognition and protection of their collective rights to land and natural resources; security 
of persons and property; and improved access to pastureland. If these three conditions are met, 
the situation of the Mbororo communities in terms of the rights to education, health and food will 
improve. 
</p>
<p>16. To date neither Governments nor international cooperation agencies have applied a 
rights-based approach systematically in development policies and programmes on behalf of 
indigenous peoples. In some cases, mere references to indigenous rights in development 
discourse are not necessarily indicative of the existence of a rights-based approach and may 
coexist in practice with the application of old-fashioned development models that are not 
conducive to the effective promotion of indigenous rights. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES IN INDIGENOUS DEVELOPMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Indigenous peoples as subjects of rights 
</b>17. The human rights-based approach stems from a concept of development that identifies 
subjects of rights and not merely a population that is the object of public policies. Indigenous 
peoples must thus be identified as subjects of collective rights that complement the rights of their 
individual members. These rights are recognized in various international instruments, 
particularly the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The principles 
set out in the Declaration complement and expand those contained in other international 
instruments such as ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries, 1989, and the general comments of the United Nations treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>18. These principles underpin the content of development and its procedures in the context of 
indigenous peoples, which should be: 
</p>
<p> (a) Endogenous: it should originate with the indigenous peoples and communities 
themselves as a means of fulfilling their collective needs; 
</p>
<p> (b) Participatory: it should be based on the free and informed consent of the indigenous 
peoples and communities, who should be involved in all stages of development. No project 
should be imposed from outside; 
</p>
<p> (c) Socially responsible: it should respond to needs identified by the indigenous peoples 
and communities themselves and bolster their own development initiatives. At the same time, it 
should promote the empowerment of indigenous peoples, especially indigenous women; 
</p>
<p> (d) Equitable: it should benefit all members equally, without discrimination, and help to 
reduce inequality and alleviate poverty; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (e) Self-sustaining: it should lay the foundations for a gradual long-term improvement in 
living standards for all members of the community; 
</p>
<p> (f) Sustainable and protective of environmental balance; 
</p>
<p> (g) Culturally appropriate in order to facilitate the human and cultural development of 
the persons involved; 
</p>
<p> (h) Self-managed: resources (economic, technical, institutional, political) should be 
managed by those concerned, using their own tried and tested forms of organization and 
participation; 
</p>
<p> (i) Democratic: it should be supported by a democratic State that is committed to its 
population&#8217;s well-being, respects multiculturality and has the political will to protect and 
promote the human rights of all its citizens, especially those of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p> (j) Accountable: the actors responsible for development must be able to render a clear 
account of their performance to the community and society in general. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Duty bearers:  States, multilateral agencies and other actors 
</b></p>
<p>19. A logical corollary to the rights-based approach to indigenous development is that the State 
has an obligation to implement a minimum set of public policies aimed at respecting, protecting, 
guaranteeing and promoting the rights of indigenous peoples, beginning with steps to improve 
their living conditions. This not only requires a change in the development discourse but also a 
transformation of public institutions and international cooperation. Alongside States, bilateral 
and multilateral donors, international agencies and in some circumstances private enterprises are 
also key players in human rights-based development and hence also duty bearers in respect of 
policies and programmes on behalf of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>20. The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has promoted the rights-based approach to 
indigenous peoples&#8217; development adopted in UNDP activities and applied by ILO in the light of 
Convention No. 169 and by UNICEF in implementing article 45 of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. 
</p>
<p>21. An analysis of 27 development cooperation agencies undertaken by the Forest Peoples 
Programme in 2003 concluded that only eight agencies had a specific policy of collaborating 
with indigenous peoples. Since then some of these policies have been updated, including the 
revision of the Strategy for Danish Support to Indigenous People of the Danish International 
Development Agency (DANIDA), the recent launching by the German Federal Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) of the Development Cooperation with 
Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean strategy and the adoption by Spain of 
the Spanish Strategy for Cooperation with Indigenous Peoples in conjunction with its ratification 
of ILO Convention No. 169 as a framework for cooperation activities with indigenous peoples. 
These policies include recognition of basic rights of indigenous peoples set out in the 
Declaration, such as self-identification, recognition of the relationship between indigenous 
peoples and their lands and territories, the right to establish and implement their own models of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>self-development, and free, prior and informed consent, including the right not to accept 
activities that are incompatible with those rights. The World Bank adopted revised Operational 
Policy 4.10 concerning its activities affecting indigenous peoples. Other agencies, such as the 
Japan Bank for International Cooperation, include specific provisions governing indigenous 
peoples in which the fundamental role of respect for their rights is recognized. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>22. One of the basic articles in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples stipulates that States &#8220;shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous 
peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior 
and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures 
that may affect them&#8221; (art. 19). Application of this principle in development programmes and 
projects on behalf of indigenous communities and peoples is a basic prerequisite for ensuring 
respect for the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>23. According to the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the principle of free, prior and 
informed consent comprises the following elements:<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p> (a) There should be no coercion, intimidation or manipulation; 
</p>
<p> (b) Consent should be sought sufficiently in advance of any authorization or 
commencement of activities and that respect is shown for time requirements of indigenous 
consultation/consensus processes; 
</p>
<p> (c) Information should be provided that covers (at least) the following aspects: the 
nature, size, pace, reversibility and scope of any proposed project or activity; the reason(s) for or 
purpose(s) of the project and/or activity; its duration and the locality of areas that will be 
affected; a preliminary assessment of the likely economic, social, cultural and environmental 
impact, including potential risks and fair and equitable benefit-sharing in a context that respects 
the precautionary principle; 
</p>
<p> (d) Indigenous peoples should specify which representative institutions are entitled to 
express consent on behalf of the affected peoples or communities, ensuring gender balance and 
taking into account the views of children and youth, as relevant; 
</p>
<p> (e) Information should be accurate and in a form that is accessible and understandable, 
including in a language that the indigenous peoples will fully understand;  
</p>
<p> (f) Consultation should be undertaken in good faith. The parties should establish a 
dialogue allowing them to find appropriate solutions in an atmosphere of mutual respect in good 
faith, and full and equitable participation. Consultation requires time and an effective system for 
communicating among interest-holders. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  E/C.19/2005/3, paras. 46-48. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. Among the positive experiences in this regard was that of the Tagbanua Calamian people 
of the Coron Island, in Palawan (Philippines), whose rights to their ancestral lands were 
recognized through the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA). This Act recognizes the right of 
indigenous communities to free, prior and informed consent in relation to any development 
programme or project undertaken for their benefit, mainly through a council of elders 
(<i>mame&#8217;pet</i>) which represents the entire territory. This process has enabled indigenous 
communities to better manage their ancestral lands and helped them to generate income by 
giving them control of local tourism activities. 
</p>
<p>25.  In Canada, the Inuit and Haida peoples have also had some positive experiences relating 
to free, prior and informed consent. A good example is the agreement reached among the 
Voisey Bay Nickel Company, the Innu Nation and the Labrador Inuit Association. The 
agreement recognizes that local indigenous communities have constitutional rights to their 
ancestral land, and that mining activities on that land can only be conducted with their consent. 
The agreement has enabled the involvement of indigenous peoples in project design, 
employment, environmental protection, social security and cultural protection measures. 
</p>
<p>26.  Although this principle is well-established in the legislation and policies of many 
countries, the Special Rapporteur continues to receive reports from indigenous organizations on 
the lack of its implementation. In the case of the Russian Federation, for example, in their replies 
to a questionnaire sent by the Special Rapporteur referring to the Federal Act of 2000 on the 
indigenous peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation, which 
incorporates the principles of consultation and consent, indigenous organizations have reported 
that the Act is not being implemented effectively in all cases where natural resources are being 
exploited. Likewise, in Colombia, there are continued complaints from indigenous organizations 
about flaws in the consultation mechanism established by decree No. 1320 of 1998.  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Participation and empowerment  
</b></p>
<p>27.  Participation and empowerment, two basic and interrelated principles of the human 
rights-based approach to development, are particularly important for indigenous peoples, who 
have been systematically excluded and marginalized from decision-making on matters affecting 
them. Thus, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes their 
right to &#8220;participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights, through 
representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures&#8221; (art. 18), as an 
essential part of their right to self-determination. More specifically, article 23 of the Declaration 
states that: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Indigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies 
for exercising their right to development. In particular, indigenous peoples have the right to 
be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic 
and social programmes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such 
programmes through their own institutions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>28.  There are many positive examples in which the participation of indigenous peoples has 
contributed effectively to achieving development goals and at the same time helped reinforce the 
institutional capacity of rights holders. In Argentina, the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs 
(INAI) established the Council on Indigenous Participation (CPI), the aim of which is to promote </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>intercultural dialogue. CPI has played a key role in monitoring the issue of the land of 
indigenous peoples in the country, including through the adoption of an emergency land 
ownership act for indigenous communities (Act No. 26.160). In Bolivia, the participation of 
indigenous peoples has been key in drawing up new legislation which has recently been adopted 
in the country. 
</p>
<p>29.  Africa has seen an increasing number of laws and projects involving the participation of 
indigenous communities, including the forestry codes of Cameroon (1994), Gabon (2001) and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2002). In the Forest and Environment Development 
Programme of Cameroon, developed with support from the World Bank, indigenous 
communities participate in the local management of forestry resources, through the legalization 
of property rights and the use of their lands and natural resources. In Kenya, the Government has 
included indigenous peoples in a planning, process - the Indigenous Peoples Planning 
Framework - as part of the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Sustainable Land Management 
Project, although this has not yet been implemented. It should be noted that the principle of 
participation extends beyond the planning, implementation and evaluation of projects, also 
enabling indigenous peoples to share in the benefits derived from development. Thus, in Nigeria, 
an agreement is being negotiated for the Ogoni communities to share in profits from oil 
production in the Niger Delta. 
</p>
<p>30. Within the United Nations system the Human Rights Strengthening Programme 
(HURIST), implemented jointly by UNDP and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, has a strong indigenous focus. Through this programme, 
funded by the Catalan Agency for Development Cooperation, arrangements have been made to 
involve indigenous peoples in planning the work of the United Nations country teams in 
Ecuador, Bolivia and Kenya. UNDP has also established the Regional Initiative on Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and Development in the Asia Pacific (RIPP), which has been endorsed by the 
Governments of Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Indonesia, 
this programme has made it possible to conduct an analytical review of legislation, bringing 
together the Government, the National Human Rights Commission and indigenous peoples to 
discuss how better to align laws and policies with the aspirations of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>31. The development of indigenous peoples can only come about by strengthening the capacity 
of indigenous organizations, communities and peoples, to enable their members to exercise their 
rights. This explains why an increasing number of programmes are combining the objectives of 
participation, training and institutional strengthening. Thus, in 2006, the German Agency for 
Technical Cooperation (GTZ) launched a programme to strengthen indigenous organizations in 
Latin America, and the cooperation agencies of other countries, such as Spain and Denmark, 
have also set strengthening the capacity of indigenous peoples as a priority objective. 
</p><p>32. A model experience at the local level is that of the Centre for Rural Development and 
Social Development (CESDER), in the northern mountain range of Puebla, Mexico, which 
combines educational objectives with the sound and sustainable use of resources and efforts to 
improve access to the market for community products. This project has led to the creation of 
five new institutional entities: an agriculture and livestock office; a support programme for rural 
women; a rural business promotion service; rural vocational training schools and a school for the 
vocational and technical training of agricultural workers. These schools have adopted a bilingual 
and multicultural teaching method, and the diplomas that they confer are officially recognized by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Public Education. The project now includes a university programme for 
indigenous rural populations, based on the model developed by the Inuit people in 
Nunavut (Canada), and draws on the financial and human resources of the communities 
themselves, with added assistance from State, federal and international agency funds. 
</p>
<p>33. Best practices for the participation and empowerment of indigenous peoples as 
components of the human rights-based approach demonstrate that the time has come to move 
beyond the old participative model for development and to include processes for their autonomy 
and self-management. One innovative example in this context is the project to empower the 
indigenous peoples of Antioquia, to enable them to exercise their rights and autonomy in the 
context of the armed conflict in Colombia. This project receives support from the European 
Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, with the participation of the Indigenous 
Organization of Antioquia and the Mugarik Gabe and Alm&#225;ciga NGOs. The project promotes the 
empowerment of authorities and women&#8217;s organizations in Antioquia in three ways: by 
strengthening the autonomy enjoyed by indigenous peoples, especially through the political 
participation of indigenous organizations within their own communities; through dialogue with 
State officials and non-indigenous entities; and through &#8220;indigenous diplomacy&#8221; with 
international and cooperation agencies. 
</p>
<p>34. Empowering rights holders and duty bearers reinforces institutional dialogue, thus 
rendering the exercise of rights more effective. This was the key to a UNDP project with the 
Philippine NGO Centre for Community Journalism and Development (CCJD), which aims to 
enhance knowledge and foster public discussion about human rights. This project involved 
community organizations and public authorities alike, including the Commission on Human 
Rights of the Philippines and the Philippine National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. 
Through this project, indigenous communities in the Iloilo province of the Western Visayas 
region of the Philippines were able to organize themselves in protest against the building of a 
dam. A community newspaper, TVE, went with local organizations on fact-finding missions and 
disseminated the results of those missions in order to raise awareness among the general public 
about the impact of that dam on indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>35. By involving and empowering rights holders and duty bearers, it is possible to find 
solutions to individual cases that take into account their specific cultural characteristics. In the 
context of educating nomadic communities in Karamoja (Uganda), the NGO Save the Children 
promoted an initiative to foster understanding between the local authorities and the Karamojong 
community, which follows traditional herding practices, in order to tackle the issue of illiteracy 
affecting 90 per cent of the population. An alternative education system was designed as part of 
this initiative, providing lessons at the beginning and end of the day for children involved in 
traditional herding activities, and also accommodating those parents who want to learn. This 
alternative education system, managed jointly by local communities and district authorities, 
provides students an opportunity to enter the formal school system, and has thus enabled 
Karamojong children to receive a formal education. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Autonomy and self-management 
</b></p>
<p>36.  Of particular importance to the development of indigenous peoples is their right &#8220;to 
autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, as well as 
ways and means for financing their autonomous functions&#8221; (article 4 of the United Nations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples). This right builds on the principle of the 
participation of indigenous peoples in development projects and programmes managed by 
non-indigenous entities, affirming the additional principle that indigenous peoples themselves 
must play a role in their own development. 
</p>
<p>37.  In Latin America, for example, the State reform and decentralization processes have led to 
the emergence of indigenous policymakers, who have started to participate in State 
decision-making structures, especially at the local level. In Ecuador, indigenous leaders have 
been elected to such positions as mayor of Cotacachi in 1996 and governor of the Cotopaxi 
province in 2000, subsequent to the mobilization of indigenous organizations. This has also 
given local authorities the chance to make changes to territorial government institutions, creating 
new opportunities among indigenous communities for access to and the distribution, control and 
use of resources for development. A similar case is that of the Tir&#250;a, in southern Chile, where, 
in 1996, an indigenous person was elected as mayor, the first such appointment in the country&#8217;s 
democratic history. Since then, the Mapuche-Lafkenche communities have benefited from access 
to local government on three levels: first, by channelling more resources to indigenous 
communities, to improve infrastructure and basic services in particular; second, by devising 
innovative ways to promote their participation in community development planning; and third, 
by creating new networks which include a variety of national and international development 
agencies, and in which the municipality plays the role of facilitator and adviser. 
</p>
<p>38. Other significant experiences of autonomy and self-management for the development of 
indigenous peoples include moves by indigenous peoples and communities to take direct 
responsibility for the management of State policies. For example, the union of municipal 
authorities of Zoogocho sector in the Sierra Norte region of Oaxaca (Mexico), established in 
1991, brings together 21 Zapotec communities; this intercommunity organization, based on 
customary law, conducts activities to promote cultural values, to improve infrastructure and 
education and health services, and to boost agricultural and livestock production. Most of the 
costs arising from those activities are covered by the respective sectoral authorities or, in the case 
of major projects, from State and federal funds. 
</p><p>39.  In the area of education, one positive self-management experience is the programme for 
the training of bilingual teachers in Peruvian Amazonia (FORMABIAP), an initiative carried out 
jointly with the Interethnic Association of Peruvian Amazonia (AIDESEP), and the Ministry of 
Education of Peru. The aim of this programme is to introduce bilingual and intercultural 
education in indigenous communities by developing teaching materials and school curricula, and 
training bilingual indigenous teachers. Since its creation in 1988, the programme has 
successfully trained more than 800 teachers from 15 different indigenous groups. The Ticuna 
education project in the Alto Solim&#245;es region of Brazil, launched in 1998, is similar; it has 
served as a model for the Ministry of Education&#8217;s initiative on national curricular references for 
indigenous education (RCNEI). While these projects have generated positive results, they have 
been difficult to incorporate into the public education system, added to which they are highly 
reliant on funds from international aid agencies. 
</p>
<p>40.  The Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) in Madhya Pradesh, India, launched in 1997, 
which aims to achieve the goal of universal primary education for indigenous communities and 
other marginalized groups from this State, is based on a three-tiered structure of cooperation 
among the Government of Madhya Pradesh, the local government body (Panchayat) and local </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>communities. The State Government allocates funds for the training and remuneration of 
teachers; the Panchayat manages the programme funds, and the relevant community is 
responsible for the implementation and evaluation of the system as a whole. To achieve the goal 
of universal primary education, the communities have the right to demand that a school be set up 
(for 25 children, in the case of indigenous communities). Among the positive lessons learned 
from this experience is the high level of participation of the communities themselves, and the 
recognition of the role of civil society as a catalyst for change in public policy. Both factors, and 
a favourable political context, were key to ensuring the justiciability of the right to education, as 
well as the self-sustainability of the process, since the authorities do not depend on donor funds.  
</p>
<p>41. In the area of health, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) helped 
set up the Jambi Huasi health clinic, which has acquired great importance for Quechua 
communities in Ecuador. A central aspect of this programme was the emphasis on transforming 
public services into community services, thus taking better account of the needs and priorities of 
indigenous communities. This process has made it possible to incorporate indigenous knowledge 
into health services, and to provide traditional medicine alongside modern medicine, including 
by making a pharmacopeia of medicinal plants available to traditional healers. 
</p>
<p>42. This type of approach has also been adopted in national poverty reduction plans. For 
example, the Western Uplands Poverty Alleviation Project (WUPAP) in Nepal was one of the 
first projects to apply a human rights-based approach to matters relating to indigenous 
communities and Dalits. The project, a joint initiative of IFAD and the Government of Nepal, 
promotes food security through the establishment of grassroots organizations, for example, 
which later take a key role in mobilizing resources and fostering the accountability of 
government entities. While the sectors in which these organizations operate are marginal, the 
project has made significant progress in the development of infrastructure and public services 
and of alternative productive activities. In its first two years, this project has reached more 
than 20,000 persons in 4,000 households. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Territorial control 
</b></p>
<p>43. One of the basic principles of a human rights-based approach to development is the 
indivisibility and interdependence of human rights. Indigenous peoples have constantly and 
consistently drawn attention to the importance of their &#8220;spiritual relationship with their 
traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories ... and other resources and 
to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this regard&#8221;, as reflected in the text of the 
Declaration (art. 25). Respect for the rights of indigenous peoples to ownership of, control over 
and access to their traditional lands and natural resources is a precondition for the enjoyment of 
other rights such as the rights to food, health, adequate housing, culture and free exercise of 
religion. The increasing urban drift of many of their members or their migration to other 
countries do not contradict, but rather reinforce the need to ensure the territorial control of 
indigenous communities as a part of development, to which migration, in many cases, is merely 
a desperate alternative. 
</p>
<p>44. A well-established principle in international instruments and jurisprudence is that the right 
of indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and territories is a corollary of States&#8217; duty to 
give effect to those rights by demarcating and registering the territories, with due respect to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>customs, traditions and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples concerned (Declaration, 
art. 26, para. 3). The participation and empowerment of the affected communities and the 
strengthening of public legal and administrative mechanisms are essential components of these 
experiences. 
</p>
<p>45. A pioneering initiative in this regard was the multilateral Indigenous Lands Project in 
Brazil. From 1996 to 2006, the Indigenous Lands Project supported the National Indian 
Foundation (FUNAI) in the demarcation, approval and registration of indigenous lands in the 
Amazon basin. It also supported indigenous initiatives aimed at the preservation and sustainable 
use of their territories. Designed as an open project, it was successful in securing 70 per cent of 
indigenous lands, although to date only 50 per cent of the illegal occupants of those lands have 
been relocated. In 2007, the German cooperation agency launched a project to monitor the 
protection and conservation of the demarcated territories. Similar initiatives have been 
implemented by the Danish cooperation agency, such as support for the registration of 
community lands surrounding the two major areas of protection in Nicaragua, namely the 
Bosawas and Indio Ma&#237;z reserves. 
</p>
<p>46. As of 2006, the process of granting title to indigenous land in Bolivia has been stepped up. 
Under the Community Renewal Act No. 3545, title to 3.7 million hectares was granted in full 
compliance with the human rights-based approach, with significant implications for the 
development of indigenous native peoples. Likewise, the supreme decrees on consultation and 
participation and on monitoring hydrocarbon-related activities in indigenous territories and rural 
communities recognize the right of those peoples to be consulted and to participate, in 
accordance with their customs and traditions, in decisions relating to their lands and territories 
in conformity with the provisions of ILO Convention No. 169. In Bolivia, there are 
over 80 initiatives relating to community tourism. Government policy aims at establishing links 
between such tourism structures in indigenous areas and indigenous and native peoples so that 
they themselves manage tourism. 
</p>
<p>47. Another important example of this type of initiative is the Orissa Tribal Development 
Project (OTDP) in India, implemented between 1987 and 1998. Designed as a comprehensive 
development project, one of its components was the registration and regularization of indigenous 
lands in the State of Orissa, which included the formal recognition of agricultural and forest 
lands traditionally used by indigenous peoples. This measure both facilitated the recognition of 
the property rights of the communities involved and helped restore the ecological balance and 
enhance the productivity of these lands. 
</p>
<p>48. Good practices were also achieved with regard to protected areas, where the aim of 
environmental protection was linked to institutional reform processes and the empowerment of 
indigenous peoples. Since 1998, the Ereto project, a bilateral cooperation initiative between the 
United Republic of Tanzania and DANIDA has involved local pastoral communities in 
conservation efforts in the Ngorongoro district. The cornerstone of this project has been the 
association of respect for traditional grazing practices with conservation as mutually reinforcing 
objectives, rather than incompatible elements, as is the case in policies pursued in other 
countries. Such factors as the empowerment of local communities and the support for livestock 
initiatives launched by the communities themselves were identified as key to the success of the 
project. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. In more recent cases, the joint management model has been applied to new types of 
protected areas. Such is the case for the designated indigenous conservation areas in Bolivia, 
where indigenous people retain the control and administration of the protected areas on the basis 
of full recognition of their land rights, thus yoking together the objectives of conservation, 
development and land control. In 1990, the Isiboro S&#233;cure National Park, which was originally 
set up as a protected area in 1965, was given dual status as national park and indigenous territory 
following representations by the indigenous peoples. In Neuqu&#233;n, Argentina, the National Parks 
Administration (APN) and the Neuqu&#233;n Mapuche Confederation agreed on the establishment of 
a management system that involves indigenous communities in decision-making relating to 
issues such as livestock breeding, tourism and the harvesting of forest products in protected 
areas. This system was also used for other new protected areas, which are now administered by a 
national advisory board for native peoples composed of representatives of indigenous 
communities that live within or around these areas. 
</p>
<p>50. A similar experience is that of the Cordillera del Condor (Condor range) in Ecuador, where 
plans for the creation of a national park, which was promoted by environmental organizations, 
met with opposition from local indigenous communities and raised concerns about existing 
environmental legislation. Following negotiations between the communities and the Ministry of 
the Environment, there is now a plan for the creation of a &#8220;Shuar protected area&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. The Toro people of Indonesia, who traditionally inhabited the area in Sulawesi now known 
as the Lore Lindu National Park, implemented a special plan between 1993 and 2000 which 
included the documentation of the customary law of the communities concerned and the 
participative mapping of their territories. This plan served as a basis for the negotiation of a 
formal agreement with the authorities in charge of the Lore Lindu National Park, which led to 
the recognition of the Toro indigenous territory alongside the system of national parks. The 
benefits of this project include the prevention of illegal logging, which used to be widespread in 
the Park, and the strengthening of the system of traditional authorities (<i>desa</i>) and the customary 
system of national resource use and protection (<i>adapt</i>). 
</p>
<p>52. The Squiala First Nation in British Columbia has informed the Special Rapporteur that, 
following the conclusion of the Squiala First Nation Individual Agreement with the Department 
of Indian Affairs, it has obtained control over its traditional lands. On the basis of this agreement, 
the communities have developed their own land code, which provides the legal framework for 
identifying lands that should be protected for conservation or spiritual purposes, as well as those 
areas required for economic development. The benefits derived from such development, which 
are retained by the community itself, are administered in accordance with specific guidelines on 
governance and financial accountability. 
</p>
<p>53. The previous examples show how, acting by themselves and on their own initiative, 
indigenous peoples determine their own development, which is recognized by the State 
through formal agreements that facilitate cooperation in the sustainable management of their 
traditional territories. A crucial factor in the success of such human rights-based experiences is 
capacity-building for the indigenous communities concerned, which facilitates their 
administrative participation, and institutional reform at the local level. The various strategies 
used to gain territorial control in these cases have enabled the indigenous peoples and 
communities to enjoy a greater degree of self-determination. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>54. The human rights-based approach to development highlights the importance of the 
principle of equality and non-discrimination, and the need to give priority attention to 
marginalized and socially excluded groups. The United Nations Declaration also emphasizes the 
need for States to take &#8220;effective measures and, where appropriate, special measures to ensure 
continuing improvement of their economic and social conditions. Particular attention shall be 
paid to the rights and special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons 
with disabilities&#8221; (art. 21, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>55. As repeatedly pointed out by the Special Rapporteur, indigenous women suffer 
discrimination at various levels.<b>6</b> Many studies have shown that women are often excluded from 
participative processes and decision-making on development projects and programmes in 
indigenous communities. Although women play a critical role in the social and economic life of 
their communities, this means that their priorities are often not reflected in development policies 
and measures which, in turn, further deepens their marginalization. As a result, the best practices 
for indigenous development place special emphasis on the role of women in their own cultural 
context. 
</p>
<p>56. The activities of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) carried out 
in cooperation with the Maasai communities of the United Republic of Tanzania have shown the 
importance of taking account of the role and responsibility of women within their communities. 
These activities have revealed the essential role of Maasai women in caring for livestock, with 
which they are in daily contact through milking and the sale of milk, and women have become 
key players in programmes aimed at promoting nomadic herding. In this connection, the 
availability of gender disaggregated data has proved particularly important, and these data have 
also helped reassess the extent to which traditional knowledge is transmitted through women. 
A similar experience was gained in the Philippines by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), 
which provided technical support to the Subanen communities in documenting and securing the 
legal protection of their traditional ethno-botanical knowledge and biodiversity resources. The 
project showed that the women have knowledge about a wide range of biogenetic resources, 
including rice varieties, that are crucial to the nutrition and health of their communities. 
</p>
<p>57. Organizational strengthening and empowerment are of key importance in ensuring that 
indigenous women are involved in the development process: accordingly, some integrated 
projects now include specific components to strengthen the position of rights holders. In Panama, 
the Sustainable Agricultural Development and Environmental Protection Project for the Dari&#233;n 
(PRODARIEN) includes a component on the legal recognition and training of indigenous 
women&#8217;s organizations in the management of their own initiatives and projects, which 
encourages closer cooperation between women from various indigenous groups and ethnic 
communities. Similarly, the Programme of Reconstruction and Development for the Quiche and 
Proderqui Departments (PRODERQUI) in Guatemala sets as one of its main targets the 
involvement of indigenous women in the restoration of community systems following the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See A/HRC/4/32, paras. 67-72. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>civil war. PRODERQUI has also set itself the goal of easing the workload of women in their 
day-to-day activities, so as to enable them to participate in political and decision-making 
processes, and of strengthening indigenous women&#8217;s organizations and micro-enterprises. 
</p>
<p>58. Institutional strengthening processes have made it possible for indigenous women&#8217;s 
organizations to become more closely involved in programme management. Thus, the Ng&#246;be 
Women&#8217;s Association (ASMUNG) has played a fundamental role in promoting health care and 
reproductive health services in more than 30 Ng&#246;be communities in Panama. The association&#8217;s 
high standing has played an important role in reaching women and girls from the communities 
involved, as well as their husbands and fathers. 
</p>
<p>59. Institutional strengthening of indigenous women&#8217;s organizations has also been a key 
factor in promoting respect for human rights and combating problems which particularly 
concern women, such as gender-based violence. In that context, UNIFEM has promoted 
capacity-building and institutional strengthening for women&#8217;s organizations in such countries as 
Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, encouraging efforts to expose acts of violence 
against women and girls and to identify mechanisms to combat such violence, both through the 
official justice system and through traditional indigenous justice. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>60. Although over the past 50 years extensive efforts and resources have been devoted to 
overcoming the poverty and marginalization from which most indigenous communities suffer, 
the economic, social and human development levels of these communities generally remain very 
low. Key to understanding the limited impact of development policies is that they have not 
attacked the structural causes underlying the marginalization of indigenous peoples, causes that 
are directly linked to the failure to recognize, protect and guarantee observance of their 
individual and collective human rights.  
</p>
<p>61. A rights-based approach identifies indigenous people as full holders of human rights and 
sets the realization of their rights as the primary objective of development. As documented in 
many best practices followed in different parts of the world, an endogenous and sustained 
development is possible when it is based on respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and 
undertakes to ensure their observance. 
</p>
<p>62. Attested best practices in development based on the rights of indigenous peoples are to be 
found in social and political processes initiated by indigenous communities and organizations in 
exercising and defending their rights. These are empowerment processes which are predicated on 
the assumption by indigenous peoples of ownership of their rights and on strengthening the 
ability of these peoples to organize and demand the observance and exercise of their rights, and 
also their political participation. 
</p>
<p>63. The rights-based approach brings with it a system of principles which may be used in 
formulating, applying and evaluating constructive policies and agreements between 
Governments and indigenous peoples. With the recent adoption of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, development stakeholders now have at their 
disposal a clearly formulated regulatory framework for development policies and actions 
targeted at them. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. The rights and principles enshrined in the Declaration mesh with the general principles of 
the rights-based approach. Under the Declaration, the rights-based approach entails respect for 
the principles of self-determination of indigenous peoples in the context of development: 
namely, their free, prior and informed consent; participation and empowerment; autonomy and 
self-management; the strengthened control of their lands; and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>In the light of the above considerations, the Special Rapporteur submits the following 
recommendations to Governments and, in particular, agencies responsible for social policy 
and development; United Nations agencies and international organizations; international 
financial institutions and aid agencies; domestic and international non-governmental 
organizations; and indigenous organizations and the indigenous peoples themselves. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The development and implementation of public policies must be guided by the rights 
enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, ILO 
Convention No. 169 and other international instruments and by the jurisprudence of the 
human rights bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The objectives of social and development policies and programmes designed for 
indigenous peoples must be to promote respect for and guarantee compliance with the 
human rights, individual and collective, of these peoples. Accordingly, these programmes 
and policies must be formulated and evaluated in terms of their contribution to meeting 
that goal. This necessitates the development, in cooperation with indigenous peoples, of 
operational criteria which draw together the activities of the various stakeholders involved, 
and of indicators to measure the impact of those activities. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>On no account should development activities be allowed to run counter to the general 
principles of the human rights of indigenous peoples. Accordingly, there must be a 
requirement for the conduct of social, cultural and environmental impact studies for 
projects to be carried out in the lands and areas occupied by indigenous peoples. 
</b>69. <b>Social and development policies and programmes relating to indigenous peoples must 
be based on the free, prior and informed consent of the communities concerned. These 
communities must be effectively involved in identifying priorities and in designing, 
implementing and evaluating the development activities intended to help strengthen their 
capacities and those of their organizations. Priority must be given to development 
initiatives identified and defined by the indigenous peoples themselves. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The design of social and development policies and programmes intended for 
indigenous peoples must take due account of the individual and collective rights situation of 
these communities involved, with a view to uncovering the underlying causes of 
discrimination, exclusion and marginalization. In this process, efforts must be made to 
identify the holders of these rights, with special attention to the vulnerable and 
marginalized groups within the indigenous communities, and also the relevant duty 
bearers. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>71. <b>Provision must be made in the regular budgets of States for social and development 
policies and programmes targeted at indigenous peoples. A rights-based budget approach 
must be followed, whereby decisions at all stages of the budget process are taken in keeping 
with the principles of transparency, accountability, non-discrimination and participation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations to donors and international agencies 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Those engaged in cooperation work should refrain from supporting programmes and 
projects which, either directly or indirectly, are or could be conducive to the violation of 
the rights of indigenous peoples in the countries receiving development aid. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Cooperation partners should work directly with indigenous communities and 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Development cooperation partners should ensure that their activities help strengthen 
dialogue and cooperative relations between indigenous peoples and the Governments of the 
countries in which those peoples live, identifying priority areas and the necessary resources 
to ensure the effective exercise of the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Development cooperation partners should give particular attention to strengthening 
the capacities of government and civil-society bodies to ensure the effective exercise of the 
rights of indigenous peoples, including by supporting the reforms necessary for the 
incorporation of these rights in legislation and in public policies. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>At the same time, steps should be taken to strengthen the mechanisms for political 
participation and accountability which support efforts by indigenous peoples to identify 
their priorities and exercise their rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. Recommendation to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner  
  for Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The principles underlying the human rights-based approach to indigenous 
development must be applied in such a way that they can be drawn on by those responsible 
for implementing public policy and cooperation, as well as by the indigenous peoples 
themselves, in the development, preparation, implementation and evaluation of policies, 
programmes and projects for the benefit of these peoples. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Office of the High Commissioner and UNDP, as key players in the 
process of promoting a rights-based approach to development, conduct studies of good 
practices and prepare a manual on the use of this approach in development activities
