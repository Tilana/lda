<p><b> Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/9.</b>  <b>Promotion on the right of peoples to peace 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions on this issue adopted by the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>and the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> General Assembly resolution 39/11 of 12 November 1984, entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaration of the Right of Peoples to Peace&#8221;, and the United Nations Millennium 
</p>
<p>Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i>Determined </i>to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, 
</p>
<p>cultural or humanitarian character, and to promote and encourage respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language 
</p>
<p>or religion, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i>, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, its full and active support for the United Nations and for the enhancement 
</p>
<p>of its role and effectiveness in strengthening international peace, security and 
</p>
<p>justice and in promoting the solution of international problems, as well as the 
</p>
<p>development of friendly relations and cooperation among States, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the obligation of all States to settle their international disputes by 
</p>
<p>peaceful means in such a manner that international peace, security and justice are </p>

<p>not endangered, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>its objective of promoting better relations among all States and 
</p>
<p>contributing to setting up conditions in which their people can live in true and lasting 
</p>
<p>peace, free from any threat to or attempt against their security, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the obligation of all States to refrain, in their international relations, 
</p>
<p>from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence 
</p>
<p>of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also </i>its commitment to peace, security and justice and the continuing 
</p>
<p>development of friendly relations and cooperation among States, 
</p>
<p><i>Rejecting </i>the use of violence in pursuit of political aims and stressing that only 
</p>
<p>peaceful political solutions can assure a stable and democratic future for all peoples 
</p>
<p>around the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of ensuring respect for the principles of sovereignty, 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity and political independence of States and non-intervention in matters 
</p>
<p>which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the Charter and international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also </i>that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue of 
</p>
<p>which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further </i>the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 
</p>
<p>Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that peace and development are mutually reinforcing, including in the 
</p>
<p>prevention of armed conflict, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that human rights include social, economic and cultural rights and the </p>

<p>right to peace, a healthy environment and development, and that development is, in 
</p>
<p>fact, the realization of these rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining </i>that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, 
</p>
<p>domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental rights, is 
</p>
<p>contrary to the Charter and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace 
</p>
<p>and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which 
</p>
<p>the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can 
</p>
<p>be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced </i>of the aim of creating conditions of stability and well-being, which 
</p>
<p>are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for 
</p>
<p>the principle of the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced also </i>that life without war is the primary international prerequisite 
</p>
<p>for the material well-being, development and progress of countries and for the full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights and fundamental human freedoms proclaimed by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced further </i>that international cooperation in the field of human rights 
</p>
<p>contributes to creating an international environment of peace and stability, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the peoples of our planet have a sacred right to peace; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>that the preservation of the right of peoples to peace and 
</p>
<p>the promotion of its implementation constitute a fundamental obligation of each State; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Stresses </i>that peace is a vital requirement for the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of all human rights for all; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also stresses </i>that the deep fault line that divides human society, between 
</p>
<p>the rich and the poor, and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and 
</p>
<p>developing worlds pose a major threat to global prosperity, peace, security and </p>

<p>stability; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Emphasizes </i>that ensuring the exercise of the right of peoples to peace and 
</p>
<p>its promotion demand that the policies of States be directed towards the elimination of 
</p>
<p>the threat of war, particularly nuclear war, the renunciation of the use or threat of use 
</p>
<p>of force in international relations and the settlement of international disputes by 
</p>
<p>peaceful means on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Affirms </i>that all States should promote the establishment, maintenance and 
</p>
<p>strengthening of international peace and security and an international system based on 
</p>
<p>respect of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development and the right of peoples to self-determination; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges </i>all States to respect and to put into practice the principles and 
</p>
<p>purposes of the Charter in their relations with all other States, irrespective of their 
</p>
<p>political, economic or social systems, or of their size, geographical location or level of 
</p>
<p>economic development; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms </i>the duty of all States, in accordance with the principles of the 
</p>
<p>Charter, to use peaceful means to settle any dispute to which they are parties and the 
</p>
<p>continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and 
</p>
<p>security, and encourages States to settle their disputes as early as possible, as a vital 
</p>
<p>requirement for the promotion and protection of all human rights of everyone and all 
</p>
<p>peoples; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Underlines </i>the vital importance of education for peace as a tool to foster 
</p>
<p>the realization of the right of peoples to peace, and encourages States, United Nations 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to 
</p>
<p>contribute actively to this endeavour; 
</p>
