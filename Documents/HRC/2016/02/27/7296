<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants conducted an official visit 
</p>
<p>to Sri Lanka from 19 to 26 May 2014, where he visited Colombo, Kurunegala, Kandy, 
</p>

</p>
<p>country team, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, diplomats, recruitment agents, 
</p>
<p>trade union representatives, civil society organizations and migrants. 
</p>
<p>The focus of the visit was labour migration from Sri Lanka and related recruitment 
</p>
<p>practices, and their impact on the human rights of migrants. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Sri Lankan authorities to regulate labour migration

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, 
</p>
<p>conducted an official visit to Sri Lanka from 19 to 26 May 2014 at the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>Government. The main focus of the visit was on labour migration from Sri Lanka and 
</p>
<p>recruitment practices, but the Special Rapporteur also looked into the situation of migrants 
</p>
<p>in Sri Lanka, particularly those in detention. 
</p>
<p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met government representatives 
</p>
<p>including representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations, the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice, Department of Immigration and Emigration, and the Sri Lanka Bureau of 
</p>
<p>Foreign Employment (SLBFE); members of the United Nations country team, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the diplomatic community, civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>and recruitment agencies; and trade union representatives, academics, families of migrants 
</p>
<p>and returned migrants. He also visited Mirihana detention centre, Boossa prison, the Sahana 
</p>
<p>Piyasa welfare centre in Katunayake, SLBFE provincial centres and training centres in 
</p>
<p>Kurunegala and Kandy, and the migrant resource centre in Tangalle. 
</p>
<p>3. Owing to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s focus on recruitment, at his initiative, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare organized a workshop during the 
</p>
<p>visit to discuss recruitment practices. The workshop was attended by, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Government, recruitment agencies, the United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>and civil society. Issues discussed included the idea of a &#8220;clearing house&#8221; for destination 
</p>
<p>countries, a multi-State and stakeholder approach to be promoted through bilateral and 
</p>
<p>multilateral agreements, an awareness-raising programme for all relevant stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>the need for global insurance coverage for all migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the cooperation extended to 
</p>
<p>him by the Government prior to, throughout and after the visit. He also thanks the United 
</p>
<p>Nations country team for their valuable support and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: migration in Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Middle East has been the main market for Sri Lankan labour migration since the 
</p>
<p>late 1970s. The main destination States include Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates. The level of migration from Sri Lanka is increasing and is playing a 
</p>
<p>key role in the economic development of the country. Remittances form 33 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>foreign exchange in Sri Lanka, the 1.8 million foreign workers form 24 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>labour force and remittances form 8.3 per cent of gross domestic product. In 2010, almost 
</p>
<p>60 per cent of remittances came from the Middle East, 18 per cent from the European 
</p>
<p>Union and 6 per cent from the Far East. Remittance inflows have increased steadily over 
</p>
<p>the past 30 years. Around 6.5 per cent of households in Sri Lanka receive remittances from 
</p>
<p>overseas. Migrant households have higher spending on household expenditure such as food, 
</p>
<p>education, health care and housing.1 
</p>
<p>6. More than 293,000 Sri Lankans migrated for work in 2013. Remittances have 
</p>
<p>become the key source of foreign exchange earnings in Sri Lanka, as well as a source of 
</p>
<p>economic dependency for nearly one third of the population. Over the years, a large 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 SLBFE statistical report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>recruitment industry has developed in Sri Lanka and labour migration has had an impact on 
</p>
<p>economic activities such as recruitment, airline services, banking and insurance.2  
</p>
<p>7. There is a large mismatch between the international demand for jobs and the supply 
</p>
<p>capabilities of Sri Lanka, as demand is mainly for skilled labour, while Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>migration is concentrated on housemaids and low-skilled workers, thus creating problems 
</p>
<p>relating to their protection and low remuneration. The Government of Sri Lanka has placed 
</p>
<p>particular emphasis on increasing the migration of skilled workers, including through better 
</p>
<p>vocational training. Low-skilled workers are more likely to face human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including harassment and abuse in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>8. Root causes of migration from Sri Lanka include unemployment or 
</p>
<p>underemployment, especially for women, youth and minorities. Migration has acted as a 
</p>
<p>safety valve for unemployment in the country. Sri Lanka has made significant investments 
</p>
<p>in health and education and social development policies, but a large number of Sri Lankans 
</p>
<p>still see migration as the best solution for their own circumstances.  
</p>
<p>9. The female unemployment rate in Sri Lanka is almost double that of the male 
</p>
<p>unemployment rate,3 forcing many women to migrate to find work. The majority of migrant 
</p>
<p>women belong to disadvantaged communities where traditional livelihoods are not viable, 
</p>
<p>so they migrate owing to lack of access to regular and substantial income and the inability 
</p>
<p>to bear the rising cost of living. While the main reason to migrate is economic hardship, 
</p>
<p>other frequent reasons include ambitions to build a house, or to educate their children. 
</p>
<p>Other push factors include debt, domestic violence and alcoholic husbands. Women have 
</p>
<p>dominated the foreign employment market for Sri Lankans, mainly owing to high demand 
</p>
<p>for domestic workers in the Middle East. However, recent statistics show that this has 
</p>
<p>changed and over 50 per cent of Sri Lankan migrants are now men.4 
</p>
<p>10. During the period of conflict in Sri Lanka, a considerable number of Tamils 
</p>
<p>migrated from the country. Lack of economic opportunities and livelihood continues to be a 
</p>
<p>determining factor which pushes Tamils and other minorities to seek opportunities outside 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>11. The Government offers services for Sri Lankan migrants, such as insurance 
</p>
<p>andpension schemes, and education scholarships for their children. However, the large 
</p>
<p>number of migrants has great social consequences for the families left behind. Lack of 
</p>
<p>reliable, accessible information about migration also frequently leads to abuse and 
</p>
<p>exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection 
of the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Sri Lanka is a party to all the core human rights treaties except the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol; the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; the Second

<p>Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Optional

<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the

</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. 
</p>
<p>13. Sri Lanka has ratified all eight International Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental 
</p>
<p>conventions. However, it has not ratified ILO Conventions No. 97 concerning Migration for 
</p>
<p>Employment (Revised 1949), No. 143 (1975) concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions 
</p>
<p>and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers, No. 181 
</p>
<p>(1997) concerning Private Employment Agencies, or No. 189 (2011) concerning decent 
</p>
<p>work for domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>14. Sri Lanka has not ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 
</p>
<p>in Persons, Especially Women and Children, or the Protocol against the Smuggling of 
</p>
<p>Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, both supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime. Neither has it ratified the Convention relating to the Status 
</p>
<p>of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, or the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional consultative processes 
</b></p>
<p>15. In 2014&#8211;2015, Sri Lanka is chairing the Colombo Process, which comprises 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. The Colombo Process is a regional consultative process on 
</p>
<p>the management of overseas employment and contractual labour for countries of origin in 
</p>
<p>Asia. Sri Lanka is also a member of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, which comprises all the 
</p>
<p>Colombo Process members and Bahrain, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, 
</p>
<p>Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. 
</p>
<p>16. As Chair of the Colombo Process, Sri Lanka is working towards establishing more 
</p>
<p>links with destination States and the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, and is focusing its chairmanship 
</p>
<p>on, inter alia, ethical recruitment and the reduction of recruitment fees. Sri Lanka has made 
</p>
<p>efforts for countries of origin to agree on a common standardized work contract, and will 
</p>
<p>use it to negotiate with destination States that are members of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative and notes the potential to enhance cooperation 
</p>
<p>with other Asian countries of origin for a common platform on labour migration &#8212; 
</p>
<p>including a standard contract, agreed labour conditions, social protection, insurance 
</p>
<p>provisions, etc. &#8212; which could serve as a basis for negotiations with countries of 
</p>
<p>destination , including those in the Abu Dhabi Dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National laws 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Constitution of Sri Lanka was adopted in 1978. Chapter III is dedicated to 
</p>
<p>fundamental rights. According to article 12 (1), all persons are equal before the law and are 
</p>
<p>entitled to the equal protection of the law. Article 12 (2) provides that no citizen shall be 
</p>
<p>discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political 
</p>
<p>opinion, place of birth or any such grounds; and article 12 (3) provides that no person shall, 
</p>
<p>on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex or any one of such grounds, be subject 
</p>
<p>to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to shops, public 
</p>
<p>restaurants, hotels, places of public entertainment and places of public worship of his own 
</p>
<p>religion. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>18. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act 21 of 1985 (amended in 1994 
</p>
<p>and 2009) is the primary piece of legislation that applies to Sri Lankan workers migrating 
</p>
<p>for overseas employment. Its objectives, as set out in section 15, include promoting and 
</p>
<p>developing employment opportunities for Sri Lankans outside Sri Lanka; assisting and 
</p>
<p>supporting foreign employment agencies in their growth and development; regulating the 
</p>
<p>business of foreign employment agencies which recruit Sri Lankans for employment 
</p>
<p>outside Sri Lanka; issuing licences to foreign employment agencies; setting standards for 
</p>
<p>and negotiating employment contracts; entering into agreements with foreign authorities, 
</p>
<p>employers and employment agencies; formulating and implementing a model employment 
</p>
<p>contract which ensures fair wages and employment standards; undertaking the welfare and 
</p>
<p>protection of Sri Lankans employed abroad; training and orientation of Sri Lankans going 
</p>
<p>abroad for work; and providing assistance to Sri Lankans going abroad for employment. 
</p>
<p>The act does not cover migration to Sri Lanka and it does not have a strong human rights 
</p>
<p>basis. The Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of a comprehensive law to protect the rights 
</p>
<p>of migrants.  
</p>
<p>19. The Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare has prepared a new 
</p>
<p>piece of legislation entitled &#8220;Sri Lanka Employment Migration Authority Act&#8221; to set up an 
</p>
<p>authority on migration to replace SLBFE, which would provide a more overarching role for 
</p>
<p>the Ministry in various components of the industry, including with regard to migration to 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka. The Act provides for the establishment of a national advisory council on 
</p>
<p>employment migration, a Sri Lanka employment authority, a Sri Lanka employment 
</p>
<p>migrants foundation (Rata Viruwo), an overseas Sri Lankan foundation, and a national 
</p>
<p>chamber of licensed foreign employment agencies. It also provides for the establishment of 
</p>
<p>a workers&#8217; welfare fund and a foreign employment promotion fund. 
</p>
<p>20. Part VIII of the draft Act, &#8220;Regulation of outward migration&#8221;, sets strict regulations 
</p>
<p>for migration from Sri Lanka. Its article 73 (1) provides that all Sri Lankans leaving for 
</p>
<p>work outside Sri Lanka shall register with the Authority, pay a fee and obtain departure 
</p>
<p>approval by the Authority. Article 73 (4) provides that no Sri Lankan shall leave for work 
</p>
<p>outside Sri Lanka unless such person is in possession of a valid Certificate of Departure 
</p>
<p>Registration issued by the Authority and a passport duly stamped by the Authority. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur notes that according to article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, ratified by Sri Lanka, everyone shall be free to leave any country, 
</p>
<p>including his own. The draft Act also provides, in article 73 (7), that no person shall change 
</p>
<p>employer during a contract period unless for a compelling valid reason, and any person who 
</p>
<p>contravenes that provision shall be guilty of an offence punishable under the Act. Article 74 
</p>
<p>provides that every Sri Lankan, of a category prescribed by the Authority, who leaves Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka for work shall inform the Divisional Secretary regarding every child below 6 years 
</p>
<p>that the said person will leave behind in Sri Lanka, and they must register a guardian for 
</p>
<p>such child before being permitted to leave Sri Lanka. Persons who fail to provide correct 
</p>
<p>information on their children, as required, shall be guilty of an offence punishable under the 
</p>
<p>Act. Furthermore, article 79 (1) provides that Sri Lankans who overstay in the destination 
</p>
<p>country shall be guilty of an offence. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress the fact 
</p>
<p>that migrants often change employers due to abuse or non-payment of salaries, and overstay 
</p>
<p>because their employers do not pay their return ticket, or because their passport is 
</p>
<p>confiscated or they do not obtain the required exit permit. Those provisions are therefore 
</p>
<p>very worrying. At the time of the visit, the new Act was being reviewed and was expected 
</p>
<p>to come into force before the end of 2014. The Special Rapporteur urges the Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>authorities to revise the draft Act to ensure a human rights-based approach to migration.  
</p>
<p>21. The Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 2006 strengthened the provisions on 
</p>
<p>trafficking, in order to bring the definition into line with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
</p>
<p>and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (the Palermo Protocol) 
</p>
<p>and criminalize debt bondage, forced or compulsory labour and slavery.  
</p>
<p>22. The Immigrants and Emigrants Act, 1949 regulated the detention and deportation of 
</p>
<p>non-citizens, as well as the departure of persons from Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National institutions and policies 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, set up in 2007, is the 
</p>
<p>lead ministry responsible for labour migration. The creation of the Ministry is stated to be 
</p>
<p>an indication of the priority given to labour migration in Sri Lanka. The Ministry is 
</p>
<p>responsible for policy formulation, planning, monitoring and financing the setting up of a 
</p>
<p>sound mechanism for promoting foreign employment. 
</p>
<p>24. SLBFE., established in 1985, within the purview of the Ministry of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Employment Promotion and Welfare (before 2007 the Ministry of Labour), is a public 
</p>
<p>corporation tasked with regulating the foreign employment industry in Sri Lanka and 
</p>
<p>enforcing the provisions of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau Act. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has received reports that the Bureau&#8217;s main functions, namely regulation, 
</p>
<p>employment promotion and worker welfare, are not delineated properly. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>although it is supposed to regulate them, recruitment agents are overly represented on the 
</p>
<p>Bureau&#8217;s Board of Management, which contains no migrant worker representation. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur hopes the new Employment Migration Authority Act will ensure proper 
</p>
<p>delineation of the new Authority&#8217;s functions, with balanced representation on the Board, 
</p>
<p>including for migrant workers. The draft Act provides that the Board will have 11 
</p>
<p>members, all appointed by the Minister. 
</p>
<p>25. The Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Agency was established in 1996. It is a 
</p>
<p>subsidiary of SLBFE, and is a government-owned licensed recruitment agency, headed by a 
</p>
<p>chairman appointed by the SLBFE Board of Management. It functions in association with 
</p>
<p>local and foreign employment agencies to secure employment opportunities for Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>youth, with full State intervention. 
</p>
<p>26. The Department of Immigration and Emigration, under the Ministry of Defence, 
</p>
<p>facilitates Sri Lankan workers&#8217; going abroad by issuing travel documents on the basis of 
</p>
<p>birth certificates and identity cards. It has an important role to play to prevent travel 
</p>
<p>documents being issued on the basis of forged documents. This sometimes happens, 
</p>
<p>making it possible for children under the age of 18 to migrate for work. The Department is 
</p>
<p>also responsible for detaining and removing from Sri Lanka undesirable persons who are 
</p>
<p>not citizens of Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>27. The Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations also has a role to play in migration 
</p>
<p>from Sri Lanka. It has officers posted in labour sections (labour welfare units) in Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankan diplomatic missions in destination countries, along with SLBFE officers, to manage 
</p>
<p>matters relating to migrant workers overseas. 
</p>
<p>28. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka was established by Act No. 21 of 
</p>
<p>1996. The Act provides that the Commissioners shall be appointed by the President, on the 
</p>
<p>recommendation of the Constitutional Council. The Commission has been accredited with 
</p>
<p>B status, not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles relating to the status of national 
</p>
<p>institutions: there are plans to make it compliant. It has undertaken work in relation to the 
</p>
<p>human rights of migrants, notably concerning migrants detained in Sri Lanka and Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankans migrating abroad for work, and it established a new focal point on migrant issues 
</p>
<p>in 2012. The Special Rapporteur urges the Commission to continue to expand its work on 
</p>
<p>the human rights of migrants. He also urges the Government to fully take into account the 
</p>
<p>Commission&#8217;s recommendations and to consult the commission in its work on migrants. </p>

</p>
<p>29. The National Advisory Committee on Labour Migration was established in 2010 
</p>
<p>with the objective of dealing with migration issues in a systematic manner. It is chaired by 
</p>
<p>the Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, and comprises policy makers, 
</p>
<p>scholars and practitioners, including two non-governmental organizations and a trade union 
</p>
<p>appointed by the Government. It meets twice a month. In addition to the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee, an interministerial committee was set up with all the ministries and government 
</p>
<p>departments concerned in order to ensure coordination amongst them. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur urges the Government to enhance its collaboration with a plurality of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, rather than simply selecting two of them to participate in the 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>30. The Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare developed the 
</p>
<p>National Labour Migration Policy of Sri Lanka in 2008, with technical assistance from 
</p>
<p>ILO. Its implementation is monitored by the National Advisory Committee on Labour 
</p>
<p>Migration. The Policy is aimed at developing a long-term vision for the role of labour 
</p>
<p>migration in the economy; enhancing its benefits for the economy, society, migrants and 
</p>
<p>their families and minimizing its negative impacts; and protecting the human and labour 
</p>
<p>rights of migrants. It highlights the importance of regulating the recruitment industry in 
</p>
<p>order to enhance its governance and the protection and empowerment of migrants.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur welcomes positive developments, such as the 2008 National 
</p>
<p>Labour Migration Policy, the 2013 Code of Ethical Conduct for Licensed Foreign 
</p>
<p>Employment Agencies and the 2014 Operational Manual for Labour Sections of Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>Diplomatic Missions in Destination Countries. However, he notes the need to fully 
</p>
<p>implement those initiatives, involving all relevant stakeholders, including civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>32. Other relevant policies include the Migration Health Policy, the National Strategy on 
</p>
<p>Technical and Vocational Education for Vulnerable People in Sri Lanka, the National 
</p>
<p>Human Resources and Employment Policy (2012), the National Decent Work Policy and 
</p>
<p>the Development Framework (2006&#8211;2016) and the National Action Plan for the Promotion 
</p>
<p>and Protection of Human Rights 2011&#8211;2016, which includes a section on the rights of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recruitment process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>33. The recruitment of Sri Lankans wishing to migrate for work takes place through 
</p>
<p>private recruitment agencies (62 per cent), the government recruitment agency (Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>Foreign Employment Agency) (1.5 per cent), or informal networks or personal contacts (36 
</p>
<p>per cent). The majority of potential migrants rely on informal networks for information on 
</p>
<p>job placements. The risks involved include bogus recruitment agencies and moneylenders 
</p>
<p>who give loans to migrants at higher interest rates.5  
</p>
<p>34. When a licensed agency receives a job order from a company abroad, authenticated 
</p>
<p>by the Sri Lankan mission in that country, it is approved by SLBFE in order to be 
</p>
<p>advertised. SLBFE can reject the job order if the terms and conditions of employment are 
</p>
<p>not satisfactory, if the workers are exposed to serious risks or if the employment is not 
</p>
<p>regulated by the law of the host country. However, the last point does not apply to domestic 
</p>
<p>workers, whose work in many countries is not covered by labour laws. When the agency 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See <i>Migration Profile: Sri Lanka</i>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>selects a domestic, low- and semi-skilled worker, that person is referred for pre-departure 
</p>
<p>training. The contract is explained in the worker&#8217;s language, and signed at an SLBFE office 
</p>
<p>in the presence of an SLBFE officer and the agent. The registration fee is paid, and final 
</p>
<p>approval is received from SLBFE. For persons migrating on their own, the process includes 
</p>
<p>authentication of documents by the Sri Lankan mission in the destination country, pre-
</p>
<p>departure training, documentation and screening, delivery of visas and contracts, and 
</p>
<p>payment of the registration fee. While those are good initiatives aimed at preventing the 
</p>
<p>exploitation of Sri Lankan workers, the Special Rapporteur heard numerous allegations of 
</p>
<p>corrupt officials bypassing those procedures, as well as of economic incentives being 
</p>
<p>offered in order to lure people into accepting false promises. He also heard reports that the 
</p>
<p>contract is not always translated into a language that the migrant understands. He urges the 
</p>
<p>Sri Lankan authorities to ensure that is not the case, and that migrants are given a copy of 
</p>
<p>the contract in their own language and receive information on how to complain if the 
</p>
<p>contract is not respected. 
</p>
<p>35. Migrants often suffer abuse and exploitation in Sri Lanka during the recruitment 
</p>
<p>process. Some lack information about their jobs and salaries before they leave, others report 
</p>
<p>having signed a contract in Sri Lanka which was replaced by a different contract upon 
</p>
<p>arrival in the destination State, with a lower salary and a different job description. As 
</p>
<p>migrants often cannot change jobs without the agreement of their employer, they become 
</p>
<p>highly vulnerable to abuse and less likely to report violations. In many cases, this will 
</p>
<p>amount to trafficking as defined in the Palermo Protocol, since migrants are recruited by 
</p>
<p>means of deception to achieve the consent of a person who has control over another person 
</p>
<p>for the purpose of labour exploitation and forced labour. In this respect, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes the anti-trafficking task force chaired by the Ministry of Justice and 
</p>
<p>urges the authorities to prosecute and punish cases of trafficking effectively, including 
</p>
<p>cases of trafficking for labour exploitation and forced labour. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Role and regulation of recruitment agencies and sub-agents/brokers 
</b></p>
<p>36. Many of the problems migrants face in the destination country relate to the 
</p>
<p>recruitment process in Sri Lanka. Recruitment agencies are involved in many steps of the 
</p>
<p>recruitment process, such as the signing of contracts, pre-departure training, grievance 
</p>
<p>handling, conciliation and repatriation.6 Around 60 per cent of licensed recruitment 
</p>
<p>agencies are located in the Colombo district. This leads to disparities between the regions 
</p>
<p>and could be one reason why so many prospective migrants rely on informal networks 
</p>
<p>when looking for jobs abroad. Many also find the recruitment process cumbersome and 
</p>
<p>time-consuming. Better regulation of recruitment agencies in Sri Lanka would be an 
</p>
<p>important tool in combating the exploitation of migrants in destination States. 
</p>
<p>37. As noted in the National Labour Migration Policy, malpractices by private 
</p>
<p>recruitment agencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for sub-agents lead to 
</p>
<p>exploitative and abusive situations for migrant workers. The lack of a proper monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanism for licensed agencies is also noted in the Policy. The Special Rapporteur heard 
</p>
<p>many allegations in that respect from returned migrants and family members of migrants. 
</p>
<p>Agents and sub-agents deceive prospective migrants about the nature and conditions of 
</p>
<p>work they will perform, including wages. The role of private recruitment agencies and sub-
</p>
<p>agents needs to be better regulated and monitored. The Special Rapporteur therefore 
</p>
<p>welcomes the rating system for licensed recruitment agencies introduced by SLBFE in 
</p>
<p>2009 in order to identify and promote the better agencies and attempt to minimize the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 See ILO, <i>Recruitment Practices of Employment Agencies Recruiting Migrant Workers</i>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>negative impact of exploitative agencies. A system of awarding a maximum of five stars 
</p>
<p>was initiated in 2013. He also notes that licences need to be renewed every year and that the 
</p>
<p>criteria for renewal are based on the number of complaints against the agency.  
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare has introduced a 
</p>
<p>blacklisting system for recruitment agencies.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur was informed that when a complaint is lodged against a 
</p>
<p>recruitment agency, a mobile phone text message is sent to the licensed agent, who is 
</p>
<p>required to reply within 48 hours. If no reply is received, or the agency cannot prove it has 
</p>
<p>not done anything wrong, the licence will be suspended and an inquiry will be initiated. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes information from the Government that it is attempting to 
</p>
<p>introduce an annual training programme for agents, which they will need to undertake when 
</p>
<p>they come for the annual renewal of their licence. The Special Rapporteur hopes those 
</p>
<p>initiatives will contribute to better recruitment agencies and fewer human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>39. The Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (ALFEA) was 
</p>
<p>established under the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act No. 21 of 1985. Its 
</p>
<p>objective is to ensure and enforce best ethical practices for the foreign employment trade by 
</p>
<p>strict disciplinary control of all stakeholders. Only about 300 of the 1,000 estimated 
</p>
<p>licensed recruitment agents in Sri Lanka are members of ALFEA, owing to a clause in the 
</p>
<p>2009 amendment to the Act which changed the mandatory requirement for all licensed 
</p>
<p>recruitment agents to join the Association. The draft Employment Migration Authority Act 
</p>
<p>provides that all licensed agents must become members of a new association which will 
</p>
<p>replace ALFEA, the National Chamber of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies. The 
</p>
<p>Chamber will inter alia ensure the strict observance by its members of the Code of Ethical 
</p>
<p>Conduct for Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies.  
</p>
<p>40. Brokers, or sub-agents, who are not licensed or accountable to the Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>authorities often engage in irregular recruitment practices. In 2013, the Government made 
</p>
<p>an attempt to regulate them by requesting them to register with SLBFE. Over 5,000 sub-
</p>
<p>agents registered. The Special Rapporteur notes the need to ensure stricter regulation of 
</p>
<p>brokers/sub-agents. The draft Employment Migration Authority Act allows for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of branches of the recruitment agencies, and it is believed that that will 
</p>
<p>reduce the use of sub-agents.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work of SLBFE on conciliation and dispute 
</p>
<p>settlement, including the electronic registration of complaints, which are accessible in the 
</p>
<p>diplomatic missions and SLBFE regional offices. He was informed that all of the more than 
</p>
<p>3,500 pre-departure complaints from 2013 had been settled; being cheated of money was 
</p>
<p>the most frequent violation reported. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, about 
</p>
<p>reports of the ineffective handling of complaints received from migrants, inter alia due to 
</p>
<p>inadequate staffing at SLBFE. Persons in rural areas, in particular, find it hard to follow up 
</p>
<p>on their complaints. While in the past it was necessary to travel to Colombo to submit a 
</p>
<p>complaint, it is now possible to submit complaints in district centres. However, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur heard many complaints that the officers in the SLBFE Conciliation Division 
</p>
<p>were not equipped with the necessary skills in complaint management, that it was difficult 
</p>
<p>to complain or attend conciliation procedures in the regional offices, and that it was 
</p>
<p>difficult for many to travel to Colombo.  
</p>
<p>42. Some migrants reported that they were not taken seriously by SLBFE, particularly 
</p>
<p>poor and less articulate migrants. Those who were assisted by non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations reported having more success in having their complaints registered. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is also concerned about reports that persons who do not register with 
</p>
<p>SLBFE when they migrate feel they are denied any assistance from the Bureau.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was informed that returned migrants are often discouraged 
</p>
<p>from complaining, either by husbands, family members or by other returnees whose 
</p>
<p>complaints were fruitless. Some are forced by employers to sign documents in the 
</p>
<p>destination State, most often in a foreign language, stating that they were well treated, in 
</p>
<p>order to be allowed to return to Sri Lanka, and therefore SLBFE refuses to accept their 
</p>
<p>complaints. The Special Rapporteur also heard reports of an insufficient time limit for 
</p>
<p>returned migrants to obtain medical reports to claim insurance for accidents, and of many 
</p>
<p>limitations in terms of benefits, including very low compensation for serious injuries as a 
</p>
<p>result of ill-treatment by employers. The migrants are only insured for accidents and death, 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur notes the need to expand the insurance coverage for migrant 
</p>
<p>workers to global coverage, including proper medical insurance and adequate compensation 
</p>
<p>for accidents. He also notes the need to make the SLBFE Welfare Fund more transparent, 
</p>
<p>sharing information on the amount of money available in the Fund, and how it is spent.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Recruitment fees 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act, as amended in 2009, provides 
</p>
<p>that no fee shall be charged by agencies other than an amount of Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000, 
</p>
<p>depending on the salary of the migrant worker. However, many migrants pay much higher 
</p>
<p>fees to agents than those stipulated in the Act. Thirty per cent of the fee goes to the Workers 
</p>
<p>Welfare Fund, which provides insurance for the workers in case of death, disability and 
</p>
<p>illness, while 70 per cent goes to the agents as payment for having found the job.  
</p>
<p>45. Agents and sub-agents/brokers frequently overcharge prospective migrants, causing 
</p>
<p>them to incur significant debt. Some prospective migrants rely on informal channels 
</p>
<p>because of the high fees charged by private recruitment agencies. Many mortgage their 
</p>
<p>lands to cover migration costs, take out loans or pawn jewellery,7 owing to the difficulty 
</p>
<p>many face in obtaining a bank loan to pay recruitment fees. 
</p>
<p>46. Pre-departure loans are provided to cover recruitment fees, except for domestic 
</p>
<p>workers, who receive financial incentives to migrate.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur encourages Sri Lanka to ban recruitment fees for migrants, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with ILO Convention No. 181, as the recruitment-related costs should be 
</p>
<p>covered by the prospective employer.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Pre-departure training and information 
</b></p>
<p>48. Pre-departure training and information are provided to prospective migrants who are 
</p>
<p>low- or semi-skilled and who migrate through official channels. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes the provision of training, which can be an important tool to empower migrants 
</p>
<p>and prevent abuse. However, some migrants note that the training is insufficient. For 
</p>
<p>instance, training for domestic workers focuses on cooking and cleaning, with little 
</p>
<p>language training and insufficient information on what to expect in the destination State, on 
</p>
<p>their rights and on how to address violations of those rights. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>heard reports that some migrants do not even undergo the required training, as sometimes 
</p>
<p>bribes are paid to get the training certificate. He urges the Sri Lankan authorities to prevent 
</p>
<p>that from happening. Training and information sessions should be enhanced in order to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 <i>Migration Profile: Sri Lanka</i>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>ensure that migration decisions are well informed, and that migrants have the necessary 
</p>
<p>information on working conditions in the destination country, have the necessary skills,  
</p>
<p>know their rights and how to seek help or lodge a complaint, and have the language skills to 
</p>
<p>do so. In that respect, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 24/7 hotline and the safe labour 
</p>
<p>migration guide. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur visited the new migrant resource centre in Tangalle, which 
</p>
<p>focuses on skills development and provides intensive English courses. This is the first such 
</p>
<p>purpose-built centre in Sri Lanka; several more are to be developed in other regions. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur hopes this will lead to better training and enhanced levels of skills for 
</p>
<p>prospective migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Consular assistance 
</b></p>
<p>50. Many Sri Lankan migrants report being deprived of the right to leave their place of 
</p>
<p>work, non-payment of salaries, or having their passports confiscated. Other common 
</p>
<p>violations reported are harassment, violence, threats, inadequate living conditions and 
</p>
<p>difficult access to health care. Effective consular assistance is crucial to those migrants. 
</p>
<p>51. In Sri Lankan diplomatic missions in destination States, Ministry of External Affairs 
</p>
<p>officials take care of consular issues, such as the issuing of passports, while SLBFE and 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Labour officials deal with the welfare of Sri Lankan workers. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes the appointment of welfare officers to serve in Sri Lankan missions 
</p>
<p>abroad. However, although Sri Lankan diplomatic missions, especially those in the Middle 
</p>
<p>East, are actively involved in the welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers, there are still 
</p>
<p>important gaps to be addressed. The Special Rapporteur met with returned migrants who 
</p>
<p>had been detained for several months, with no visits from consular authorities. He has 
</p>
<p>received numerous complaints about the lack of support from Sri Lankan diplomatic 
</p>
<p>missions and considers that welfare services and consular assistance provided to Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>migrants in the destination State should be strengthened, particularly in countries with large 
</p>
<p>numbers of Sri Lankan workers, by ensuring the presence of an adequate number of well-
</p>
<p>trained officers in the labour welfare sections. The Special Rapporteur heard complaints 
</p>
<p>from some agents that the staff in the diplomatic missions do not handle complaints and 
</p>
<p>welfare issues as they should, but rather ask the agent to solve problems instead of dealing 
</p>
<p>with them themselves. Diplomatic missions need to enhance their role in the protection of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers, including in cases of abuse, contract substitution, withholding of 
</p>
<p>passports and wages, or repatriation. Additionally, the missions should have female officers 
</p>
<p>to deal with cases of sexual abuse; provide a local 24/7 hotline free of charge; establish a 
</p>
<p>roster of competent local lawyers; and conduct frequent visits to migrant detention centres.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomes information received that the Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>authorities provide migrants with a SIM card so they can make phone calls. However, as 
</p>
<p>mobile phones are frequently confiscated by employers, this is of no use for many migrants. 
</p>
<p>53. The second edition of the <i>Operational Manual for Labour Sections of Sri Lankan 
</i></p>
<p><i>Diplomatic Missions in Labour Receiving Countries</i>, published in 2014, elaborated with 
</p>
<p>assistance from ILO, provides guidance on, inter alia, handling complaints from migrant 
</p>
<p>workers, repatriation of workers and ensuring a safe recruitment process. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur encourages its full implementation, which would go a long way to assist Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankan migrants in need. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> G. Return and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the increased focus on the effective reintegration 
</p>
<p>of returned migrants, in accordance with the National Labour Migration Policy. Distressed 
</p>
<p>or sick returnees can stay at the Sahana Piyasa welfare centre close to the Colombo and 
</p>
<p>Mattala airports before they return home and the Special Rapporteur received information 
</p>
<p>about reintegration programmes, including self-generating income projects. However, he 
</p>
<p>notes that some returnees report that there are insufficient reintegration services, most 
</p>
<p>importantly for those who may have experienced abuse abroad. The National Labour 
</p>
<p>Migration Policy provides that the State shall ensure that the return and reintegration 
</p>
<p>process takes place with full protection of rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>55. Some migrants return with little or no savings, or even indebted, unsuccessful in 
</p>
<p>their migration project. Account must be taken of the economic, social and psychological 
</p>
<p>dimensions of reintegration, especially for those who feel that their migration was a failure. 
</p>
<p>Many have not acquired any skills, or have acquired non-marketable skills, despite having 
</p>
<p>worked abroad for years, even decades. As their skills are not recognized in Sri Lanka, this 
</p>
<p>often leads to re-migration. Most Sri Lankan migrants go overseas initially for a two-year 
</p>
<p>contract period, but the Special Rapporteur met with returned migrants who had been away 
</p>
<p>for as long as 30 years, with little to show for it in terms of savings, improved housing, 
</p>
<p>skills, etc. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Government that 300 dead bodies 
</p>
<p>come back to Sri Lanka every year. He heard many reports that migrants who die abroad 
</p>
<p>are sometimes returned mutilated, some of them with missing organs. No autopsy is 
</p>
<p>performed in Sri Lanka and the family is often not allowed to see the body. He urges the Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankan authorities to systematically undertake independent autopsies and inform the 
</p>
<p>families of the results. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Relationship with destination States 
</b></p>
<p>57. Although Sri Lanka and other countries of origin have a role in preventing abuse of 
</p>
<p>their own nationals who migrate for work, the destination States are responsible for human 
</p>
<p>rights violations committed against migrants on their territory. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>heard many reports of abuses in destination States, including horrible stories of ill-
</p>
<p>treatment, such as migrants being set on fire and killed by their employer, or being forced 
</p>
<p>to drink chemicals. Low-skilled migrants in particular are subject to high levels of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations in many countries, including harassment, abuse and labour rights 
</p>
<p>violations. Returned migrants also report that the Sri Lankan authorities are often not able 
</p>
<p>to protect them in the destination States. The Special Rapporteur therefore notes the need to 
</p>
<p>enhance cooperation with destination States to ensure that the rights of Sri Lankans are 
</p>
<p>respected during the whole migration process. 
</p>
<p>58. Sri Lanka has entered into memorandums of understanding with Bahrain, Italy, 
</p>
<p>Jordan, Libya and the United Arab Emirates, and a bilateral agreement with Qatar, and has 
</p>
<p>recently signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia concerning domestic workers. Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>has also signed a government to government agreement via the Employment Permit 
</p>
<p>Scheme with the Republic of Korea. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, although 
</p>
<p>the memorandums of understanding/agreements provide for annual meetings, such 
</p>
<p>meetings do not take place regularly with all the destination States.  
</p>
<p>59. The bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia on domestic workers is a positive 
</p>
<p>development. It requires both parties to adopt a standard employment contract, to use only 
</p>
<p>licensed recruitment companies which follow ethical recruitment practices and use </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>regulated recruitment costs, and to allow the right to recourse. It provides that Saudi Arabia 
</p>
<p>shall facilitate the opening of a bank account by the employer for the deposit of the 
</p>
<p>domestic worker&#8217;s salary and facilitate the issuance of exit visas. The standard employment 
</p>
<p>contract states the monthly salary, and that the employer shall deposit the salary to the said 
</p>
<p>account every month. It also provides that domestic workers shall have at least eight hours 
</p>
<p>rest per day and one rest day per week, suitable and sanitary living quarters, adequate food 
</p>
<p>or a monetary allowance for food, paid sick leave and medical expenses, and no deductions 
</p>
<p>from the salary. Furthermore, the employer shall pay for the residence permit and exit visa, 
</p>
<p>the passport and work permit shall remain in the worker&#8217;s possession, and workers shall 
</p>
<p>have free communication with their family and Sri Lankan diplomatic missions.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur urges Sri Lanka to pursue the conclusion of similar 
</p>
<p>agreements with other destination States, and ensure their strict implementation. The 
</p>
<p>agreements should include a uniform model contract for all workers, including domestic 
</p>
<p>workers, which should ensure respect for and protection of their human rights. Labour 
</p>
<p>contracts based on such a model should specify the job description, wages and labour 
</p>
<p>conditions. The Special Rapporteur notes the importance of bilateral agreements and 
</p>
<p>memorandums of understanding being formulated in a transparent manner with all key 
</p>
<p>stakeholders involved, and of ensuring that they are accessible to the public. 
</p>
<p>61. In the meantime, the Sri Lankan authorities should cooperate closely with the 
</p>
<p>destination States, ensuring that the contract which is signed in Sri Lanka, in the SLBFE 
</p>
<p>offices, is shared with the destination State for quick electronic registration, in order to 
</p>
<p>prevent contract substitution.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Women migrants and domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>62. Sri Lankan women frequently suffer from a lack of equal access to employment 
</p>
<p>opportunities owing to discriminatory social practices. While migration has opened up 
</p>
<p>employment opportunities for many women, the majority migrate to work as domestic 
</p>
<p>workers, although their proportion is decreasing. Domestic workers are particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, owing to their worksite being a private household and 
</p>
<p>to the informal nature of the work. The majority of women domestic workers have faced 
</p>
<p>harassment in the workplace. Other complaints include absence of days off, absence of rest 
</p>
<p>and sleep, non-payment of wages, verbal abuse, restricted communication and food 
</p>
<p>deprivation.8 Because of the financial incentives provided, women are sometimes sent 
</p>
<p>abroad by their husbands or family members, who expect the women to send their salaries 
</p>
<p>back home. Contracts for domestic workers cannot be terminated early, as the employer 
</p>
<p>pays all the migration-related costs. 
</p>
<p>63. Domestic work is excluded from most of the labour laws in many countries, 
</p>
<p>including Sri Lanka. The Special Rapporteur believes Sri Lanka would find it easier to 
</p>
<p>negotiate the legal protection of Sri Lankan domestic workers abroad if it could show that 
</p>
<p>that was not the case in Sri Lanka. Such protection should include a law on domestic 
</p>
<p>workers and ratification of ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) on decent work for domestic 
</p>
<p>workers. 
</p>
<p>64. Specific age limits are applied to women who wish to migrate from Sri Lanka as 
</p>
<p>domestic workers, depending on the destination State. For Saudi Arabia, the minimum age 
</p>
<p>is 25, for other countries in the Middle East 23 and for the rest of the world 21 years.

</p>
<p>Additionally, a circular of January 2014 provides for a &#8220;family background report&#8221; to be 
</p>
<p>prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Employment Protection and Welfare for women 
</p>
<p>migrants seeking employment in the domestic domain. The report is prepared by ministry 
</p>
<p>officials deployed at the divisional secretariat level. Women with children under 5 will not 
</p>
<p>be &#8220;recommended&#8221; for migration, while mothers with children above 5 will only be 
</p>
<p>recommended for migration if alternative care arrangements made are satisfactory for 
</p>
<p>ensuring their protection. The Special Rapporteur was informed during his visit that so far 
</p>
<p>in 2014, 756 women had not been recommended for migration. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur regrets the discrimination faced by Sri Lankan women in 
</p>
<p>relation to the right to migrate. The fact that they have small children, or that many 
</p>
<p>domestic workers suffer abuse and exploitation, including the tragic execution of Rizana 
</p>
<p>Nafeek, cannot be used as a reason to deny them the right to leave their country as  
</p>
<p>provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which has been 
</p>
<p>ratified by Sri Lanka. What the Government refers to as &#8220;traditional Sri Lankan values&#8221; do 
</p>
<p>not trump human rights obligations that it has committed itself to upholding. Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights organizations in Sri Lanka are protesting against the above-mentioned circular, which 
</p>
<p>reportedly is leading to irregular migration.  
</p>
<p>66. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that there was a demand from 
</p>
<p>society to regulate the migration of women with children in order to ensure the protection 
</p>
<p>of those children. However, that was not reflected in any observation by members of civil 
</p>
<p>society the Special Rapporteur met with, who were all against the circular. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has also been informed that, owing to access to forged documents and corrupt 
</p>
<p>officials, the age limits and other recommendations in the circular are not properly 
</p>
<p>implemented anyway. While the intentions of the Government of Sri Lanka that lie behind 
</p>
<p>those restrictions seem to be good, aiming to protect those women and their children, 
</p>
<p>restrictions on women&#8217;s right to leave their country are not the right way to achieve such 
</p>
<p>objectives. In fact, the Special Rapporteur was told that many women migrate in order to 
</p>
<p>escape from family issues, including domestic violence. Sri Lankan men are also frequently 
</p>
<p>victims of abuse and exploitation in destination States, and the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recommends that Sri Lanka come up with a holistic approach to deal with exploitation of 
</p>
<p>Sri Lankan migrants abroad, both men and women. He also urges the Government to focus 
</p>
<p>on other means, such as creating more income-generating opportunities for women in Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka, including in rural areas, diversifying child-care support measures and enhancing 
</p>
<p>gender equality and men&#8217;s participation in their children&#8217;s upbringing.  
</p>
<p>67. The draft Employment Migration Authority Act provides in article 74 a gender-
</p>
<p>neutral requirement for Sri Lankans migrating for work to inform the Divisional Secretary 
</p>
<p>about any child under 6 years that they will be leaving behind in Sri Lanka, and to register a 
</p>
<p>guardian for such a child. The Special Rapporteur hopes that will end the discriminatory 
</p>
<p>measures directed at women only, and urges the Sri Lankan authorities to consider fathers 
</p>
<p>as per guardians of their own children.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also urges the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure better 
</p>
<p>protection of female domestic workers abroad. If properly implemented, the bilateral 
</p>
<p>agreement with Saudi Arabia referred to above, which includes a standard contract that 
</p>
<p>guarantees some rights for domestic workers, is a positive development in that respect. 
</p>
<p>Similar agreements with other destination States should be negotiated and effectively 
</p>
<p>implemented. Pre-departure training for domestic workers became compulsory in 1996, and 
</p>
<p>a training certificate is mandatory in order to register with SLBFE. However, as domestic 
</p>
<p>workers continue to be abused and exploited in destination States, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes the need for enhanced training, particularly in order to empower women to leave such 
</p>
<p>exploitative situations. </p>

</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Families and children left behind 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Rata Viruwo programme, implemented by SLBFE, is aimed at ensuring 
</p>
<p>sustainable development practices in favour of migrant workers and their family members. 
</p>
<p>There is a housing programme whereby loans are given to construct houses, and there are 
</p>
<p>also scholarships provided to children of migrant workers, as well as singing, dancing and 
</p>
<p>arts competitions. However, while some studies show that migration of parents has a 
</p>
<p>positive impact on children&#8217;s education due to the increased ability to pay education costs, 
</p>
<p>migration can also have negative consequences for those left behind, particularly children. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur heard reports of how the absence of their parents can lead to 
</p>
<p>disruption of children&#8217;s education, neglect, abuse and exploitation, including sexual abuse 
</p>
<p>of girls. Sometimes the oldest daughter in the family will be tasked with responsibility for 
</p>
<p>the household, and will stop going to school. Some children also face alcohol abuse, child 
</p>
<p>labour and early marriage. The Special Rapporteur urges the Sri Lankan authorities to 
</p>
<p>enhance the attention given to the protection of families and children left behind, 
</p>
<p>particularly in order to prevent child abuse and to ensure children&#8217;s access to education. 
</p>
<p>Denying mothers the right to migrate is not the solution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Irregular migration from Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>70. Attempting to leave Sri Lanka irregularly is a criminal offence, and Sri Lankans who 
</p>
<p>try to migrate irregularly by boat, mainly to Australia, are often intercepted by the Sri 
</p>
<p>Lankan authorities. Sri Lanka has entered into a readmission agreement with Australia, and 
</p>
<p>the navy and coastguards are working to deter irregular migration by boat. Irregular 
</p>
<p>migration from Sri Lanka is punishable by no less than one year of imprisonment, 
</p>
<p>according to the Immigrants and Emigrants Act. The Sri Lankan authorities assured the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur that no penalty is imposed on those persons, as they are seen as victims 
</p>
<p>of smugglers, and the only criminal action taken is against the smugglers. However, that 
</p>
<p>contradicts reports provided to the Special Rapporteur, as well as statements by Sri Lankan 
</p>
<p>officials to the media, such as that those returned would be charged with leaving the 
</p>
<p>country illegally and those found guilty would face &#8220;rigorous imprisonment&#8221;.9 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to decriminalize irregular migration, as it should 
</p>
<p>only be considered an administrative offence, and persons attempting to migrate irregularly 
</p>
<p>should not be imprisoned. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Migration to Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>71. While the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was mainly focused on migration from Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka, he also looked into migration to Sri Lanka and, particularly, the detention of 
</p>
<p>migrants in an irregular situation. He visited Mirihana detention centre for migrants, with 
</p>
<p>68 detainees (58 men, 5 women, 5 children) and Boosa prison, with 11 migrant detainees, 
</p>
<p>who were separated from the other detainees, held under anti-terrorism legislation. Ninety 
</p>
<p>per cent of the migrant detainees were awaiting deportation, while the rest were waiting for 
</p>
<p>their immigration rule violations to be resolved. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the 
</p>
<p>policy of mandatory administrative detention of irregular migrants, with no individual 
</p>
<p>assessment, no maximum time limit, no alternatives to detention, and the detention of 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>families with children. The Special Rapporteur was informed that irregular migrants are 
</p>
<p>kept in detention until they leave the country, and they have to come up with the money to 
</p>
<p>buy aeroplane tickets themselves. In the Mirihana detention centre, he met five children 
</p>
<p>who had stayed there with their families for as long as two years, with no access to 
</p>
<p>education, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the principle 
</p>
<p>of the best interests of the child. The detainees at Boosa prison were kept under maximum 
</p>
<p>security restrictions, with no access to mobile phones or the Internet. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also deeply regrets that the Constitution of Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>guarantees certain rights, including protection against discrimination and the right of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom to form and join a trade union, to 
</p>
<p>citizens only, in violation of key international human rights law guarantees. He also regrets 
</p>
<p>that there is no law protecting migrants in Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation with civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur heard reports of a shrinking democratic space for civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations in Sri Lanka. He regrets the lack of trust between the Government and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and urges the Government to reach out to such organizations and 
</p>
<p>fully include them in its migration-related work, including the development of the new 
</p>
<p>Employment Migration Authority Act and the conclusion of new bilateral agreements with 
</p>
<p>destination States. Civil society organizations expressed to the Special Rapporteur a wish to 
</p>
<p>be included in strategic discussions with the Government, rather than only in those on 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation. The Special Rapporteur also heard concerns that the creation of the 
</p>
<p>Rata Viruwo Foundation might lead to the exclusion of civil society organizations in 
</p>
<p>migration-related discussions. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Sri Lankan 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities to regulate labour migration and protect the rights of its citizens migrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>abroad, but notes the need to fully implement a human rights approach in that 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>While migration plays a key role in the economic development of Sri Lanka, 
</b></p>
<p><b>many Sri Lankan migrants experience abuse and exploitation, which often begins 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the recruitment process. The Special Rapporteur understands the importance 
</b></p>
<p><b>of remittances to the Sri Lankan economy, but he insists that this should not trump 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of migrants. It is therefore important to make sure attention is paid to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of migrants, not just the promotion of migration. More focus could be 
</b></p>
<p><b>placed on creating jobs in Sri Lanka, rather than focusing mainly on promoting 
</b></p>
<p><b>labour migration, thus training people to leave the country. The creation of income-
</b></p>
<p><b>generating opportunities in Sri Lanka, especially for women, youth and minorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in rural areas, would contribute to ensuring that migration is a choice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>rather than a necessity. At the same time, Sri Lankans who wish to migrate have the 
</b></p>
<p>right to do so; leaving any country including one&#8217;s own is a human right. This right 
</p>
<p><b>applies equally to men and women. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that there are some good policies in place, which, 
</b></p>
<p><b>if they are implemented effectively, could potentially prevent some of the abuse that 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants currently experience during the migration process. There is also a need for 
</b></p>
<p><b>strong rights-based legislation and enforceable agreements with all destination States. </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the Government of Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In light of the information received and the concerns expressed, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur wishes to propose the following recommendations to the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sri Lanka. He urges the Government to consider these recommendations seriously 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to implement them in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations country team and civil society organizations. Technical cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the implementation of recommendations could be sought from ILO, which has 
</b></p>
<p>indicated its willingness to provide assistance to implement the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify ILO Conventions No. 97 concerning Migration for Employment

<p><b>(Revised 1949), No. 143 (1975) concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers, No. 181 
</b></p>
<p><b>(1997) concerning Private Employment Agencies, and No. 189 (2011) concerning 
</b></p>
<p><b>decent work for domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that Sri Lankan legislation, including the draft Employment 
</b></p>
<p><b>Migration Authority Act, is fully in line with international human rights standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>Workers and Members of Their Families;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Fully implement the concluding observations adopted in 2009 by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Their Families, and make the declarations provided for in articles 76 and 77 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention recognizing the competence of the Committee to receive communications 
</b></p>
<p><b>from States parties and individuals; and accept the jurisdiction of all treaty bodies to 
</b></p>
<p><b>hear individual complaints about the implementation of the human rights treaties to 
</b></p>
<p><b>which Sri Lanka is a party;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Promote bilateral, regional and international cooperation in the field of

<p><b>Colombo Process to enhance cooperation among countries of origin; and continue 
</b></p>
<p><b>working with the Abu Dhabi Dialogue and its member States, pushing for a binding,

<p><b>unified work contract based on international human rights and labour standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that the new Employment Migration Authority Act provides a

</b></p>
<p><b>representation on the Board of Management of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

<p><b>Employment, including of workers, that it does not impose undue restrictions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to leave Sri Lanka and that it includes strong human rights protection for all

</b></p>
<p><b>of money available and how it is spent; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Abolish the payment of a motivational fee prior to leaving Sri Lanka, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which may lead to debt bondage, making it difficult or impossible for a Sri Lankan 
</b></p>
<p><b>worker to leave an abusive employer;

<p><b>(o) Abolish recruitment fees for migrants and, in the meantime, reduce costs 
</b></p>
<p><b>for migrants, including illegally high fees charged by some recruitment agencies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sub-agents/brokers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) Enhance and improve pre-departure training and information in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to promote informed decision-making and enhance the skill levels of prospective 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, including language skills and general education levels. Migrants should be

<p><b>empowered to know their rights and how to claim them, including by providing them 
</b></p>
<p><b>with information on the local culture and lifestyle in the destination country and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>important legislation there, which may be very different from those in Sri Lanka; 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>and, in particular, ensure that employment contracts signed by migrants are always 
</b></p>
<p><b>written in a language that they can read and understand; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(r) Refrain from sending migrants from Sri Lanka to countries where the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal and institutional framework necessary to guarantee the protection of their rights

</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(s) Make the protection of migrants a priority concern for Sri Lankan 
</b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic missions in destination States; and strengthen the welfare services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consular assistance provided to Sri Lankan migrants in destination States, ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>that diplomatic missions are adequately staffed and that staff are properly trained to 
</b></p>
<p><b>deal with all issues faced by migrant workers. Diplomatic missions in destination 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should play a more proactive role in protecting their own nationals against 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse and be properly equipped to provide assistance to Sri Lankans in need. 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers able to help Sri Lankan migrants with legal issues, and conduct frequent visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>to migrant detention centres; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(t) Facilitate the repatriation of migrants in need, including those who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>escaped from abusive employers or have ended up in an irregular situation, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention or elsewhere; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(u) Establish a sustainable reintegration policy and enhance the services 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided for the reintegration of returned migrants, including psychosocial services 
</b></p>
<p><b>and livelihood opportunities, particularly for those who have experienced abuse 
</b></p>
<p><b>during their migration process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Conduct independent autopsies on the bodies of all Sri Lankans who die 
</b></p>
<p><b>abroad, and give family members quick access to the results; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(w) Enhance cooperation with destination States to prevent violations such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as contract substitution, the confiscation of passports, the non-payment of wages, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse and exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Negotiate with all destination States binding bilateral agreements

<p><b>Colombo Process. Such a model contract, to be included in bilateral agreements with 
</b></p>
<p><b>all destination States, should ensure respect for and the protection of the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of migrants, including labour rights, with terms and conditions clearly stated. Labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>contracts based on such a model should set out the job description, the agreed salary,

</b></p>
<p><b>implementation;  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Women migrants and domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p><b>(z) Establish a standard contract for domestic workers, to be included in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>bilateral agreements, which should include provisions on, inter alia, wages, working 
</b></p>
<p><b>hours, working conditions, overtime pay, annual leave and effective remedies, as set 
</b></p>
<p><b>out in ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning decent work for domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(aa) Abolish the financial incentives given to prospective domestic workers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which may be used to coerce them to migrate; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(bb) Establish a reference wage for domestic workers, reflective of skills and 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience, which should apply to all workers in all destination States and be included

</p>
<p><b>(cc) Withdraw the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare 
</b></p>
<p><b>circular issued in January 2014, to respect </b>women&#8217;s <b>freedom of movement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(dd) Enhance pre-departure training for domestic workers, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>focusing on language skills and information on their rights and how to claim those 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights; continue and expand training programmes for women wishing to migrate to 
</b></p>
<p><b>work as service providers, with the aim of reducing the number of Sri Lankan women 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrating as domestic workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ee) Conduct a thorough study of the root causes of migration and its social 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences, including for families and children left behind, and enhance efforts to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect the children of migrants from abuse and exploitation, ensure their access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and prevent early marriages; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ff) Decriminalize irregular departures from Sri Lanka, as irregular 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration should only be seen as an administrative offence; and refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>detaining returned Sri Lankans who have migrated irregularly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(gg) Detain migrants in an irregular situation in Sri Lanka only as a measure 
</b></p>
<p><b>of last resort, for as short a period as possible, and systematically apply alternatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention, particularly for families and children, who should never be detained; in 
</b></p>
<p><b>that respect, consider the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his 
</b></p>
<p><b>report on the detention of migrants in an irregular situation and alternatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention (A/HRC/20/24); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(hh) Ensure that all persons, regardless of citizenship or migration status, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoy the rights provided for in the Constitution of Sri Lanka without any 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, in accordance with international human rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Enhance cooperation with civil society organizations working on 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration-related issues, and include them in all relevant discussions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to destination States 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that destination States:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Regulate and monitor all recruitment agencies operating in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory in order to guarantee ethical recruitment in compliance with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and labour standards, and impose sanctions on those who violate such 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that contracts are respected, and undertake all the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts to prevent contract substitution, in cooperation with the Sri Lankan 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c)  Investigate and prosecute effectively all cases of exploitation and abuse 
</b></p>
<p><b>of migrants; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ban recruitment fees for migrants and the confiscation of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>passports, and sanction violations effectively; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Abolish sponsorship systems which tie migrants to their employer, thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>rendering them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Detain migrants in an irregular situation only as a measure of last resort, 
</b></p>
<p><b>for as short a period as possible, systematically apply alternatives to detention, refrain </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>

<p><b>from detaining children and families, and give particular attention to supporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants who have escaped from abusive employers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure the availability of complaint and redress mechanisms, legal aid 
</b></p>
<p><b>and interpreters for migrants;

<p><b>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and
