PENGROWTH ENERGY TRUST CONFIRMS CASH DISTRIBUTION FOR NOVEMBER 15,
2005
AND PROVIDES CONFIRMATION OF S&P/TSX INDEX INCLUSION AND
SCHEDULE FOR THE RELEASE OF 2005 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
(Calgary, October 21, 2005) /CCNMatthews/ — Pengrowth Corporation (“Pengrowth”),
administrator of Pengrowth Energy Trust (“Trust”), today confirmed its November 15, 2005 cash
distribution will be Cdn $0.23 per trust unit. The distribution is net of amounts withheld to finance
capital expenditures. The ex-distribution date is October 28, 2005. The distribution will be
payable to all unitholders who hold Class A or Class B trust units on the record date of
November 1, 2005.
The distribution of Cdn $0.23 per trust unit is equivalent to approximately U.S. $0.19 per trust unit
using a U.S./Canadian dollar exchange ratio of 1.188. The actual U.S. dollar equivalent
distribution will be based upon the actual U.S./Canadian exchange rate applied on the payment
date, net of applicable Canadian withholding taxes. This distribution relates to the production
month of September, 2005. Cash distributions paid over the past 12 months now total Cdn $2.76
per trust unit or approximately U.S. $2.26 per trust unit.
Pengrowth is pleased to confirm it has received notification that it has been selected for inclusion
in the S&P/TSX Composite Index, Canada’s premier equity index. The inclusion of income trusts
will be implemented in orderly stages with full implementation expected on March 17, 2006
following the close of markets. Pengrowth views the addition of income trusts to the index as
positive and expects the move to result in a broader investing audience for the trust sector,
leading to increased liquidity and a more efficient market.
Pengrowth also wishes to confirm that its third quarter financial and operational results are
scheduled for release following the close of markets Thursday, November 3, 2005. Pengrowth
will hold a conference call beginning at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time (9:00 A.M. Mountain Time) on
Friday, November 4, 2005 during which Management will review Pengrowth’s results and
respond to inquiries from the investment community. To participate callers may dial (866) 898-
9626 or Toronto local (416) 340-2216. To ensure timely participation in the teleconference callers
are encouraged to dial in 10 to 15 minutes prior to commencement of the call to register. A live
audio webcast will be accessible through the Webcast and Multimedia Centre section of
Pengrowth’s website at www.pengrowth.com.
