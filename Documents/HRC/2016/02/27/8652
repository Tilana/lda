<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report presents the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Mr. James Anaya, on the situation 
of indigenous peoples in Colombia, as part of the follow-up to the recommendations made 
in 2004 by the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen. These findings are 
the result of an exchange of information with the Government of Colombia and other 
interested parties and of the mission carried out by Mr. Anaya between 22 and 27 July 
2009. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the readiness of the Government of Colombia to 
recognize the rights of indigenous peoples. It is evident that Colombia is engaged in 
addressing matters concerning indigenous people and in developing plans and proposals in 
response to the recommendations of the previous Special Rapporteur. Nevertheless, the 
Special Rapporteur expresses concern over the multiple indications that the grave situation 
of indigenous peoples in Colombia has not been addressed with the level of urgency it 
deserves. In general, the laws, programmes and policies of the Government do not ensure

<p>effective protection of the human rights of indigenous peoples in Colombia. 
</p>
<p> Also, it is clear that the situation of indigenous people is aggravated by the internal 
armed conflict currently gripping Colombia. According to most indicators, that armed 
conflict is having a disproportionate effect on the indigenous peoples. The Special 
Rapporteur received reports of an increasingly worrying situation of violence and other 
crimes against indigenous peoples, and also cases of forced displacement and confinement, 
which threaten the physical and cultural survival of Colombia&#8217;s indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p> There is clearly a high level of engagement in indigenous affairs on the part of the 
State of Colombia, demonstrated by the development of plans and proposals in response to 
the recommendations of the previous Special Rapporteur. However, there are still major 
challenges that the Government must meet if it is to comply with its obligation to protect 
and effectively promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, 
including rights to land, natural resources and prior consultation with them on decisions 
that affect them. Also, there are significant differences generally as regards the enjoyment 
of economic, social and cultural rights between the indigenous peoples and the population 
of Colombia as a whole. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur presents a series of recommendations aimed at addressing 
those challenges and making real progress in the recognition and protection of the human 
rights of Colombia&#8217;s indigenous peoples, in accordance with the State&#8217;s obligations and 
commitments in this matter.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. This report presents the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Mr. James Anaya, on the situation 
of indigenous peoples in Colombia, as part of the follow-up to the recommendations made 
by the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen, in his 2004 report on his 
mission to Colombia.1 These findings are the result of an exchange of information with the 
Government of Colombia and other interested parties and of the mission to Colombia 
carried out by the current Special Rapporteur between 22 and 27 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>2. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the 
Government of the Republic of Colombia, including the President, Mr. &#193;lvaro Uribe; the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jaime Berm&#250;dez Merizalde, and other representatives of 
his Ministry; and representatives of the Ministry of the Interior and Justice, the Ministry of 
Defence, the Ministry of Social Protection, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, the Presidential Agency for Social Action and International Cooperation 
(<i>Acci&#243;n Social</i>) the National Department of Planning, the Colombian Family Welfare 
Institute and the Presidential Advisory Council on Equality for Women. He also had 
meetings with indigenous members of the Congress of the Republic; Constitutional Court 
judges; representatives of the Office of the Attorney-General, the Office of the Procurator-
General and the Office of the Ombudsman; and the Governor and other representatives of 
the government of the department of Cauca. In addition, he met representatives of 
indigenous communities and organizations and civil society activists in Bogot&#225; and the 
departments of Nari&#241;o and Cauca and had discussions with representatives of United 
Nations agencies and the international community. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Colombia for its 
invitation and the assistance it provided before and during the mission. He considers the 
welcome that he received a mark of the Government&#8217;s good will and openness. Also, 
special thanks are due to the indigenous communities and organizations for the substantial 
amount of information that they provided and for their cooperation in the organization of 
large parts of the mission. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the United 
Nations agencies in Colombia, particularly the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, for their indispensible assistance at all stages in the planning and conduct of 
the mission. 
</p>
<p>4. The findings contained in this document are not intended as an exhaustive 
evaluation of the situation of Colombia&#8217;s indigenous peoples or of the implementation of 
the recommendations of the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Stavenhagen, but rather as a 
discussion of the main issues relating to those recommendations that arose during the 
mission of the current Special Rapporteur. The recommendations made by Mr. Stavenhagen 
touched on various subjects, including the armed conflict in indigenous areas; violence and 
drug trafficking; the environment, land and human rights; access to justice and indigenous 
jurisdiction; the situation of indigenous women; sustainable development and the 
recognition of indigenous identity; and the extension of essential social services. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for compiling and providing 
detailed information on the measures taken in response to the recommendations.

 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
</p>
<p>indigenous people, Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen, Addendum: Mission to Colombia 
(E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.2). </p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13669 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consideration given by the Government of 
Colombia to the recommendations of the previous Special Rapporteur and the steps it has 
taken in response to them, while recognizing the challenges still to be confronted, and he 
hopes to continue constructive dialogue in the light of the progress made and the challenges 
ahead. As part of that constructive dialogue, this report includes a series of 
recommendations for measures that could help to improve the situation of indigenous 
peoples in Colombia, within the framework of the relevant international norms. These 
recommendations also represent an updating of the previous Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations in the light of the current situation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Findings of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>6. In the report on his mission to Colombia in 2004, the previous Special Rapporteur, 
Mr. Stavenhagen, stated that: &#8220;Colombia&#8217;s indigenous peoples find themselves in a serious, 
critical and profoundly worrying human rights situation&#8221;.2 The situation as observed by the 
current Special Rapporteur confirms that this description is still valid. Despite some 
progress on indigenous issues, in general the laws, programmes and policies of the 
Government do not result in effective protection of the human rights of the indigenous 
peoples in Colombia. Also, it is clear that the situation of indigenous people is aggravated 
by the internal armed conflict currently gripping the country. As was pointed out by the 
previous Special Rapporteur, &#8220;The precarious human rights situation of Colombia&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples reflects the gap between progressive domestic legislation and the 
ineffectiveness of the institutions responsible for protecting these peoples, against a 
background of internal armed conflict involving numerous warring parties whose actions 
directly affect indigenous communities&#8217; chances of survival.&#8221;3 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal and political framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Colombian Constitution recognizes indigenous peoples and their collective and 
individual rights. Rulings of the Constitutional Court have built on this institutional 
framework, creating a world-class model of jurisprudence. In addition, Colombia has 
ratified Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the 
Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries,4 and 
recently declared its support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and for its spirit and guiding principles.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur was informed about programmes and activities relating to 
indigenous peoples carried out by, inter alia, the Ministry of the Interior and Justice, <i>Acci&#243;n 
Social</i>, the Presidential Programme for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, 
and the Ministry of Education. In particular, the Special Rapporteur was informed about 
programmes aimed at, among other things, addressing the needs of internally displaced 
persons, training members of the Security Forces in matters relating to human rights and 
international humanitarian law, promoting the education and health care of the indigenous 
peoples, responding to complaints regarding land and territories, and promoting 
consultations with the indigenous peoples on economic projects and laws. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the readiness to pursue general courses of action based on public policy

<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13669 
</p>
<p>agreed with the indigenous peoples and various plans in that connection, and also the 
support for highly vulnerable indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>9. The organs of the Department of Public Prosecution, particularly the Office of the 
Procurator-General and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, have important powers as regards 
protection of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur especially notes the 
preventive functions entrusted to the Early Warning System of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, 
which is an important mechanism for identifying and preventing human rights violations 
and breaches of international humanitarian law directed against indigenous peoples. Within 
the framework of the Early Warning System, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office collects, verifies 
and analyses information relating to situations where the civilian population is vulnerable 
and at risk as a consequence of the armed conflict and warns the authorities responsible for 
providing protection so that timely and comprehensive coordinated assistance is provided to 
the communities affected. 
</p>
<p>10. However, recommendations have not always received proper consideration and 
response on the part of the organs entrusted with taking protective measures. For example, 
in February 2009, eight members of the Awa indigenous community were murdered on the 
Tortuga&#241;a-Telemb&#237; reserve (in the department of Nari&#241;o), which resulted in the 
displacement of some 400 members of the community. That happened despite repeated 
warnings given by the leaders of the Awa people, and the issuing of a risk report by the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (No. 53 of 5 June 2008), which warned about the dangers to the Awa 
people in that department. Ultimately, the Government drew up a plan and programme of 
protection for the Awa people under an agreement concluded with Awa representatives on 
9 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about the fact that, despite the plan 
and programme of protection, shortly after the completion of his mission, in August 2009, 
there was a further massacre of members of the Awa community. On 26 August, a group of 
hooded persons entered a dwelling located on the Gran Rosario indigenous reserve (in the 
municipality of Tumaco, department of Nari&#241;o), where they cruelly murdered 12 persons, 
including seven Awa children. The Special Rapporteur notes the declaration of the Minister 
of the Interior and Justice condemning the murder of the 12 members of the Awa 
community and stating that results are expected from the investigations being carried out 
with the assistance of the international community and that the Government will intensify 
its efforts to protect indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>12. The fact of the matter is that, despite the formulation of public policy measures to 
promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples, several of those measures have not 
been implemented or have been inadequately implemented. In that regard, the Special 
Rapporteur notes the Constitutional Court&#8217;s comment that the response of the State 
authorities to the critical situation has been chiefly to draw up guidelines, policies and 
formal documents which, despite their value, have had only a very limited practical 
impact.5 Furthermore, many initiatives do not take adequate account of the living 
conditions, culture, customs, organizational structures and aspirations of the indigenous 
communities and peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Internal armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>13. The rights of the indigenous peoples are continuing to be threatened and violated, 
and there can be no doubt that the internal armed conflict and its effects are contributing to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 Constitutional Court, Decision 004 of 2009, p. 23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13669 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>this serious situation. In its Decision 004 of 2009, the Constitutional Court stated that the 
indigenous peoples were suffering from forced displacement on an alarming scale, 
homicide, food shortages and other serious problems due to the internal armed conflict and 
various underlying factors.6 Pointing out that those problems were affecting all the 
indigenous peoples of Colombia, the Constitutional Court concluded that 34 of the 
indigenous peoples were under threat of &#8220;cultural or physical extermination&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>14. According to almost all indicators, the internal armed conflict is having a 
disproportionate effect on Colombia&#8217;s indigenous peoples. They are particularly vulnerable 
because their territories are located in areas strategically important for those engaged in the 
internal armed conflict and in drug trafficking. In 2007, Early Warning System statistics 
from the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office showed that 45 per cent of the 38 risk reports issued related 
to indigenous peoples. In 2008, 14 reports warned of risks affecting the indigenous 
population,8 and 13 risk reports relating to indigenous persons were issued between January 
and August 2009.9 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the impact of the internal 
armed conflict on indigenous women and children. The number of cases of sexual violence 
against indigenous women is increasing because of the conflict.10 The occupation of 
indigenous land and territories by groups involved in the conflict limits the possibilities for 
overall development in accordance with their traditions of the youngest indigenous persons. 
Indigenous children are more exposed to recruitment by illegal armed groups and face 
difficult humanitarian conditions, including killing and maiming, recruitment by and use in 
armed forces and groups, abduction, sexual violence, attacks on schools and hospitals, and 
denial of humanitarian access, as was recognized in the August 2009 report of the 
Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Colombia, drawn up pursuant to 
Security Council resolution 1612 (2005).11 In order to deal with this situation, the 
Colombian State should, as a matter of urgency, implement the recommendations of the 
Secretary-General contained in that report, especially those intended to prevent the 
recruitment of children. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Violence and other crimes against the physical and cultural survival of indigenous 
peoples 
</b></p>
<p>16. Paradoxically, it appears that the decision of the indigenous peoples not to take part 
in the internal armed conflict has resulted in an increase in violence and threats against 
them. They are arbitrarily and without reason accused, individually and collectively, of 
collaborating with whichever armed group is opposing the Security Forces.12 
</p>
<p>17. In view of the persistent risk of attacks against life and bodily integrity to which the 
indigenous peoples in various parts of Colombia are exposed, the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights has requested the adoption of precautionary and provisional 
measures, on both an individual and a collective basis, in order to protect leaders and whole 
communities. According to the Government, inter-institutional groups have been formed to 
care for each indigenous community with members under the protection of measures

<p>requested by the Inter-American Commission. Despite the existence of these measures, 
numerous indigenous peoples and communities continue to report selective killings of their 
leaders, spokesmen and traditional authorities. The Awa people in the Nari&#241;o department is 
one of the most affected indigenous groups.  
</p>
<p>18. The Monitoring Unit for the Presidential Human Rights and International 
Humanitarian Law Programme has stated, with regard to the killing of indigenous persons, 
that the killing of one such person constitutes not only the taking of a life but also an attack 
on tribal stability and survival.13 According to the Monitoring Unit, from 1998 to July 2008 
there were 1,075 murders of indigenous persons in Colombia.14 However, according to 
other sources, the figure is higher &#8211; 1,365 murders of indigenous persons during that period, 
plus, inter alia, cases of threat (321), forced disappearance (254), injury (492) and sexual 
violence and torture (216).15 The Vice-President&#8217;s Office recorded a 71 per cent increase in 
the killing of indigenous persons during the period January-September 2009 compared with 
2008.16 
</p>
<p>19. The armed groups operating outside the law clearly pose a threat to the whole of 
Colombian society, but particularly to the indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with extreme concern that the illegal armed groups, chiefly the Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia &#8212; Ej&#233;rcito del Pueblo (Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia &#8212; People&#8217;s Army) (FARC-EP), operating in many indigenous areas seem to be 
completely unaware of human rights standards and international humanitarian law. FARC-
EP and other illegal armed groups are the main perpetrators of killings of indigenous 
persons and other serious crimes, such as the recruitment and exploitation of indigenous 
children, forced displacement, acts of sexual violence and the use of anti-personnel mines.  
</p>
<p>20. The Government has been endeavouring to demobilize the paramilitary groups, and 
its efforts have produced major successes. However, the demobilization programme has 
resulted in de facto amnesties or in promises of reduced sentences for demobilized 
combatants, which has given rise to protests against a culture of impunity. Moreover, it is 
clear that the paramilitary groups have not been completely disbanded; on the contrary, in 
recent months there seems to have been an increase in the number of members of 
paramilitary groups or new criminal gangs (Bacrim). 
</p><p>21. Furthermore, human rights violations continue to be committed by members of the 
Security Forces, and several cases involving indigenous victims remain unsolved. In 2008, 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that indigenous peoples 
and communities in departments such as Antioquia, Cauca and Choc&#243; had been victims of 
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment attributed to members of the 
Security Forces.17 In addition, the Constitutional Court, in its Decision 004, referred to the 
threatening, harassment and persecution of individuals, families and communities by some 
individual members of the Security Forces.18 In that connection, the Special Rapporteur 
notes with concern the so-called &#8220;false positives&#8221;, whereby indigenous individuals

<p>disappear and are subsequently reported, without grounds, as being guerrilla fighters killed 
by the Security Forces during combat.19 The &#8220;false positives&#8221; were one of the main 
concerns regarding extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions expressed by the 
Special Rapporteur in June 2009 at the end of his mission to Colombia.20  
</p>
<p>22. The information indicates an insufficient level of attention on the part of the 
authorities responsible for the administration of justice, particularly the Office of the 
Attorney-General, with regard to abuses committed by members of the Security Forces and 
illegal armed groups against members of indigenous communities. According to data from 
the Office of the Attorney-General, 182 law suits involving indigenous victims have been 
assigned to its Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Unit (163 of them relate 
to homicides, of the more than 1,075 homicides reported by the State during the past ten 
years) &#8211; according to information provided by the Government, not all investigations into 
the killing of indigenous persons are handled by that unit. The Special Rapporteur considers 
that the persisting situation of impunity is unacceptable, as it puts the ethnic and cultural 
survival of indigenous peoples at grave risk. The Office of the Attorney-General and the 
other authorities responsible for the administration of justice are reminded that these serious 
violations should be investigated and judged independently, promptly and impartially. 
</p><p>23. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur notes the information provided by the 
Government on measures taken to prevent the repetition of abuses by members of the 
Security Forces and ensure effective penalization. These measures include a project entitled 
&#8220;Strengthening the justice sector in order to reduce impunity in Colombia&#8221;, and a 
programme entitled &#8220;Expanding coordination between the national jurisdiction and the 
special indigenous jurisdiction&#8221;. The latter consists in characterizing the justice systems of 
18 indigenous peoples with a view to strengthening those peoples&#8217; systems for the 
administration of justice and linking them to those of the local authorities in the 
neighbouring areas. The Special Rapporteur considers the investigation task forces fielded 
by the National Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Unit in the case of law 
suits involving indigenous victims to be a positive factor in eliminating impunity. The 
judicial authorities should have access to all means necessary for establishing such task 
forces or similar mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>24. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur noted another useful mechanism &#8211; the 
Indigenous Guard&#8217;s, or traditional security and protection units, of the indigenous peoples 
of Colombia. In general, the Government should respect, support and legitimize in the role 
in order to ensure their effective functioning. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Military presence in indigenous areas 
</b></p>
<p>25. The indigenous peoples have repeatedly complained about the occupation of 
schools, council meeting places (&#8220;cabildos&#8221;), sacred sites and dwellings by members of the 
Security Forces. The Special Rapporteur received information about the Security Forces 
establishing a military presence on indigenous reserves without any prior consultation with 
the affected communities. He also received information about the Security Forces using 
indigenous persons, including children and adolescents, as informants.

<p>26. Representatives of the Ministry of Defence maintain that members of the Security 
Forces do try to consult with indigenous communities before the establishment of a military 
presence and that they use indigenous community members as informants only when it is 
necessary for the physical protection of their communities. Also, the Military General

 Statement of Mr. Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p>at the end of his mission to Colombia, 8&#8211;18 June 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13669 
</p>
<p>Command&#8217;s Standing Order No. 048 of 2008 forbids the use of children and adolescents in 
intelligence-gathering activities. In any event, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
use of indigenous community members as informants and the mere presence of members of 
the Security Forces within indigenous communities, at the very least, frequently puts at risk 
the communities that the Security Forces are trying to protect. 
</p>
<p>27. Government initiatives to strengthen respect for human rights in indigenous areas by 
members of the Security Forces do exist. In its Directive No. 016 of 2006, the Ministry of 
Defence spells out its policy vis-&#224;-vis indigenous peoples, emphasizing the need to 
strengthen the protection of their human rights and specifying the procedures that the 
Armed Forces should follow when operating within indigenous territories. This policy is 
part of the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s Overall Human Rights and International Humanitarian 
Law Policy, which covers the conduct of the Security Forces during operations and states 
that the Colombian National Army&#8217;s operational orders always include instructions relating 
to the treatment of indigenous communities and the rights bestowed on them by the 
Constitution when the Security Forces are operating within indigenous territories.21 Also, 
the Special Rapporteur notes that Circular No. 151 of 2004 requires the Security Forces to 
designate points of contact with the indigenous authorities in each region where they 
operate. 
</p>
<p>28. In connection with those initiatives, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to 
consult and try to reach agreement with the affected indigenous peoples on the conditions 
of any military presence within their territories. Respect for the autonomy and the 
traditional decision-making structures of indigenous communities is extremely important at 
all times. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples it is stated that &#8220;States shall undertake effective consultations 
with the indigenous peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular 
through their representative institutions, prior to using their lands or territories for military 
activities&#8221; (art. 30, para. 2). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Forced displacement and confinement 
</b></p>
<p>29. The forced displacement of indigenous peoples threatens their cultural and physical 
survival, as the Constitutional Court has pointed out, and gives rise to critical humanitarian 
issues such as overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and food shortages. The public 
authorities are not prepared to respond adequately to the humanitarian needs of the victims 
and, in particular, the women and children. Of grave concern is the acute impact of forced 
displacement on indigenous women, who, according to the Constitutional Court, are among 
those who have been affected most severely by the crimes, injustices and inequities that 
accompany armed violence and forced displacement.22 
</p>
<p>30. In the past five years, the displacement of indigenous peoples has increased 
disproportionately in comparison with the displacement of the rest of the population. 
According to figures from <i>Acci&#243;n Social</i>, between 2006 and 2007 the displacement of the 
rest of the population increased by 16.8 per cent, while the displacement of the indigenous 
population increased by 23.1 per cent. Furthermore, some indigenous communities are in a 
situation of confinement and receiving no humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>31. In the years following the mission of the previous Special Rapporteur, regulations 
for better responding to the needs of the displaced population were adopted within the 
framework of the National System of Comprehensive Care for the Displaced Population

</b></p>
<p>(SNAIPD) and its &#8220;Directive for the Comprehensive Care of the Indigenous Population in 
Situations of Displacement and Risk, with a differentiated approach&#8221;. This directive guides 
the programmes and actions of the organs of SNAIPD at the national and the regional level, 
in order that the necessary resources are allocated to them, the differentiated approach 
ensuring the comprehensive care of indigenous populations as collective subjects of the 
law. Furthermore, the National Council for the Comprehensive Care of the Displaced 
Population (CNAIPD) adopted resolutions on implementing a differentiated approach vis-&#224;-
vis displaced indigenous persons23 and, in 2006, approved a comprehensive plan for the 
support of indigenous communities in situations of extreme vulnerability and risk of 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>32. However, as the Constitutional Court concluded in its Decision 004 of 2009, under 
the prevailing circumstances it is difficult to see how those initiatives have been translated, 
into practical actions for ensuring that the indigenous peoples of Colombia are not 
disproportionately affected by the armed conflict, for preventing the forced displacement 
caused by the armed conflict, or for providing appropriate and timely material assistance to 
its victims.24 
</p>
<p>33. The Constitutional Court has ordered a series of measures for responding adequately 
to the various problems that confront displaced indigenous persons. These measures include 
the development of a country-wide Programme to Guarantee the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples Affected by Displacement and the development of plans for the protection of 34 
indigenous peoples identified as being at serious risk of cultural or physical extermination &#8211; 
all with the effective participation of the legitimate authorities of the indigenous peoples. It 
should be mentioned that, for its part, the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia 
(ONIC) has identified numerous other indigenous groups at risk of extinction because they 
have fewer than 500 members each, including 18 groups with fewer than 200 members and 
10 groups with fewer than 100. 
</p>
<p>34. Regarding implementation of the orders of the Constitutional Court in its Decision 
004, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that it had carried out several 
activities under the Programme to Guarantee the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Affected by 
Displacement and in connection with the preparation of 34 &#8220;ethnic safeguards plans&#8221;, 
including the drafting of a proposal that will be the subject of consultations with the leaders 
of the indigenous peoples and serve as input to the &#8220;ethnic safeguards plans&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur stresses the need to intensify the efforts in question and 
finalize the &#8220;ethnic safeguards plans&#8221; within the deadlines specified by the Constitutional 
Court and in accordance with the relevant international norms. He also stresses the need to 
develop similar programmes for other vulnerable indigenous communities at risk of 
extinction, in cooperation and consultation with indigenous leaders and organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Land and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>36. Respect for and protection of the right to land and territories are a constant demand 
of the indigenous peoples in Colombia. Over the last decades, Colombia has moved

<p>forward in the recognition of the land rights of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples. The 
number of official indigenous reserves now stands at 710, located in 27 of the country&#8217;s 
departments and in 228 municipalities; according to the Government, they occupy a total of 
approximately 34 million hectares, equivalent to 29.8 per cent of Colombia&#8217;s national 
territory.25 
</p>
<p>37. However, some representatives of the indigenous peoples say that much of the land 
purchased and handed over to indigenous communities is unproductive or not suited to their 
cultural needs. A mere 7.68 per cent of the indigenous reserves (covering an area of 
1,290,000 hectares) are situated in agricultural areas, and they are inhabited by 
approximately 65 per cent of Colombia&#8217;s total indigenous population. The other reserves 
are situated in the Amazon forest, the Orinoqu&#237;a savanna and the Guajira desert.26 The 
territorial crisis is evident in the Ca&#241;o Mochuelo reserve, located in the Casanare 
department (Orinoqu&#237;a region). According to information received by the Special 
Rapporteur, the reserve is not sufficiently large to ensure the physical and cultural survival 
of the peoples living there. The soil is of low fertility and between May and November 
more than 65 per cent of this land is subject to flooding. As a result, there is concern that a 
serious food crisis might impact this reserve. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the establishment, expansion and improvement of reserves seem not to 
be proceeding in a manner consistent with the numerous needs identified. In November 
2008, 450 dossiers relating to the establishment, expansion, improvement and restructuring 
of indigenous reserves were being processed.27 According to data for 2004 from the 
Colombian Rural Development Institute (INCODER), the indigenous territories still the 
subject of dossiers being processed have a total area of 1,627,758 hectares, populated by at 
least 380,000 indigenous people. The departments with most land to be assigned are Cauca 
(309,000 hectares), Amazonas (276,000 hectares) and Boyac&#225; (nearly 100,000 hectares). In 
the departments of Magdalena, Caquet&#225;, Putumayo, Cesar, Tolima, Valle, Arauca and 
Vaup&#233;s, the territories awaiting assignment have a total area of over 50,000 hectares. 
</p>
<p>39. Prior to 2007, the establishment and expansion of reserves were the responsibility of 
the Colombian Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA), which later became the Colombian 
Rural Development Institute (INCODER).28 The Rural Development Statute (Law 1152 of 
2007) transferred responsibility for the establishment, expansion and improvement of 
indigenous reserves to the Ethnic Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior and 
Justice. In 2009, the Constitutional Court declared the Rural Development Statute to be 
unconstitutional because it had not been the subject of consultation, so that today there is a 
need to clarify the responsibilities of public authorities with regard to the various legal 
processes concerning indigenous reserves.  
</p>
<p>40. It is important to emphasize that recognition and protection of the territorial rights of 
the indigenous peoples are crucial for establishing sustainable conditions of peace and 
ensuring the survival of the indigenous peoples, as acknowledged by the Constitutional 
Court.29 In Decision 004, the Constitutional Court noted that, in some cases, uncertain

<p>tenure arrangements greatly facilitated the invasion and seizure of indigenous lands, so that 
there was a link between the expansion and improvement of reserves and certain aspects of 
the armed conflict (such as armed forces, illicit crops, or military activities in areas of 
expansion).  
</p><p>41. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to bring Colombia&#8217;s public policy 
relating to economic development of the country (particularly as regards natural resource 
extraction and agro-industry and tourism infrastructure &#8220;megaprojects&#8221;) into line with the 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to land and natural resources, in accordance with the provisions 
of ILO Convention No. 169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. Between 1993 and 2006, the Constitutional Court found approximately 
18 times in favour of indigenous peoples in cases where their land rights were being 
violated by intrusive initiatives or large infrastructure projects. Among the indigenous 
peoples affected by the launching of projects without appropriate consultation are the 
Motil&#243;n Bari people (oil prospecting and drilling),30 the U&#8217;wa people (oil prospecting and 
drilling),31 and the Embera Katio people of the Alto Sin&#250; (the Urr&#225; I hydroelectric 
project).32 There are many other examples of concessions granted and projects authorized 
without the necessary prior consultation with the affected communities. Although the 
Government has provided information about consultations regarding various projects, the 
information does not establish that the consultations were carried out in accordance with the 
relevant international standards.33 
</p>
<p>42. Thus, their is still not full compliance with the recommendation of the former 
Special Rapporteur, that investment, infrastructure, natural resource extraction and 
exploitation, industrial production and other major projects should not be promoted without 
full and genuine prior consultation with and the involvement of the indigenous peoples34 
(see section D below). In view of the free trade agreements that the Colombian Government 
has concluded, and is in the process of concluding, which would facilitate the exploitation 
of natural resources within indigenous territories, it is important to ensure that these 
agreements explicitly provide for the rights of the indigenous peoples to be respected, 
particularly the right to free and informed prior consultation.  
</p>
<p>43. The aerial fumigation of illicit crops has particularly affected the indigenous 
peoples. The Constitutional Court has ordered that the aerial fumigation of illicit crops be 
suspended until consultations with the indigenous peoples have led to agreement or 
eradication methods that are less detrimental to the indigenous peoples&#8217; survival and 
cultural integrity.35 The former Special Rapporteur recommended that there be no aerial 
fumigation of illicit crops in the vicinity of indigenous settlements unless the indigenous 
communities expressly requested it in full knowledge of the implications.36 The 
Government has stated that, pursuant to that recommendation, since 2005 progress has been 
made with regard to the right to prior consultation on the eradication of illicit crops, and it 
has provided detailed information about the consultations carried out in that connection. 
However, the Special Rapporteur has received information indicating that, in many cases, 
the eradication of illicit crops by glyphosate spraying is continuing to occur without

<p>adequate consultation with the indigenous communities affected and has given rise to 
health problems and food shortages. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Consultation and agreement 
</b></p>
<p>44. The lack of prior consultation with the indigenous peoples on decisions that affect 
them is a persistent problem in Colombia. The Constitutional Court has developed 
considerable jurisprudence relating to the right to consultation, establishing in the national 
legislation a framework for promoting the right to consultation as embodied in ILO 
Convention No. 169 and in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples.37 Despite that, violations of the right to consultation have persisted in several 
contexts, as shown in subsequent years by cases brought before the Court, which has ruled 
both on draft laws and public policies and on proposals with an impact on the use of land 
and natural resources.38  
</p>
<p>45. More recently, the Court declared the General Forestry Act (Law 1021 of 2006) and 
the Rural Development Statute to be unconstitutional as they had not been the subject of 
appropriate consultation with the indigenous peoples. On declaring the General Forestry 
Act to be unconstitutional, the Court stressed that the Constitution provided for special 
protection of the right of ethnic groups to participate in the taking of decisions that affected 
them and that such special protection implied a duty to develop processes for consulting 
with indigenous and tribal communities on the adoption and implementation of decisions 
that might affect them.39 There are currently several draft laws on indigenous matters under 
consideration in Colombia,40 and these should be the subject of consultation and agreement 
with the indigenous peoples; the Special Rapporteur notes Government statements that 
steps have been taken in that regard. 
</p>
<p>46. Efforts are being made by the Government to promote dialogue with the indigenous 
peoples, such as: the creation of a Standing Committee for Consultation (between 
indigenous organizations and the State on all laws and administrative decisions that could 
affect them);41 the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission and an 
Amazonian Committee; and the dialogues that took place in the context of the Minga Social 
y Comunitaria (Social and Communal Workshop) in 2008 and 2009. Also, a dialogue is 
taking place between the State and the indigenous peoples on compliance with the orders 
issued by the Constitutional Court in its Decision 004 &#8211; specifically regarding preparation 
of the 34 &#8220;ethnic safeguards plans&#8221;. Nevertheless, numerous factors have prevented the 
initiatives in question from leading to permanent relevant dialogue that would allow the 
parties to make satisfactory progress on the issues important to indigenous peoples.

<p>GE.10-13669 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>47. The development of effective consultation procedures that conform to international 
standards is one of the main challenges facing Colombia. According to information 
provided by the Ministry of the Interior and Justice, Decree 1320 of 15 July 1998, which 
creates a framework for consultations with indigenous peoples, is continuing to be 
implemented even though both the Constitutional Court42 and ILO43 have concluded on 
numerous occasions that it is incompatible with Convention No. 169 and have called for the 
competent ministries to revise it.44 It is essential, therefore, to develop and implement, in 
cooperation with the indigenous organizations and authorities, consultation procedures as 
stipulated by the Constitutional Court and ILO. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur notes the information provided by the Ministry of the 
Interior and Justice regarding the formation of a working group exclusively dedicated to the 
subject of prior consultation. The Ministry states that the group is in the process of 
preparing a draft law to regulate the consultation process. The preparation and adoption of a 
draft law on the right to consultation, which could provide an excellent opportunity for 
ensuring that the consultation process is effective and in conformity with international 
principles and standards, should be carried out in consultation with the indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>49. There are significant differences regarding the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights between the indigenous peoples and the population of Colombia as a whole. 
Furthermore, the effects of the armed conflict, particularly displacement, have left many 
peoples and communities in a highly vulnerable situation. There is a need to strengthen 
programmes for realizing the social and economic rights of indigenous peoples, including 
the right to be provided with food and health services, especially in the case of those 
communities which have been displaced or otherwise affected by the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>50. The departments where indigenous peoples account for a large percentage of the 
overall population have worse social indicators than the rest of the country. As regards 
maternal mortality, for example, while the national average is 73.1 deaths per 100,000 live 
births,45 the following departments report rates far higher than that figure: Guain&#237;a (386), 
Choc&#243; (250.9), Guaviare (171.2), Amazonas (158), La Guajira (131) and Cauca (125.9).46 
As regards infant mortality, while the national average is 15.6 deaths per 1,000 live births,47

<p>in those same departments the rates are also far higher: Guain&#237;a (40.5), Choc&#243; (32.8), 
Amazonas (29.9), La Guajira (24.2) and Cauca (21.2).48 
</p><p>51. The Government is paying some attention to the health needs of indigenous peoples; 
among other things, it is modelling their health situation and looking into the possibility of 
incorporating traditional medicine into the Public Health Plan 2007&#8211;2010. Mutual health-
care societies have been established in collaboration with traditional indigenous authorities 
and, through the Colombian Family Welfare Institute, there have been efforts to tackle the 
problem of malnutrition both through supplementary food programmes and through 
awareness and prevention programmes. According to the Government, since 2003 the 
coverage of the indigenous population by the subsidized health-care regime has increased 
by 87 per cent, from 603,833 beneficiaries in 2003 to 1,132,138 in 2008, which means that 
81 per cent of the indigenous population was covered by 2008. 
</p>
<p>52. However, although their access to health care is clearly on the increase, indigenous 
groups do not appear to have the same access to and enjoy the same quality of health care 
as the majority of Colombians &#8211; a situation aggravated by the armed conflict. According to 
information received by the Special Rapporteur, the Security Forces have occupied health-
care facilities in the department of Nari&#241;o, leaving the inhabitants reluctant to visit those 
facilities for fear of stigmatization and retaliation on the part of illegal armed groups. 
Furthermore, roadblocks, stigmatization and threats are deterring people from seeking 
medical treatment and other health-care services locally.49 Likewise, indigenous women are 
facing difficulties in accessing sexual and reproductive health services, especially when 
they are victims of forced displacement. Indigenous children are particularly vulnerable to 
violations of the right to food and health. In 2008 and 2009, some State bodies, and the 
indigenous communities themselves, published reports of severe malnutrition in Kogui and 
Arhuaco communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range and in the 
departments of Choc&#243;, Guaviare and Cauca, among others. 
</p>
<p>53. As regards education, the Ministry of Education has developed and is promoting an 
ethno-educational policy with the aim, according to information provided by the 
Government of introducing intercultural education at all State and private schools in the 
country. During 2008 and 2009, the Government, within the framework of the Cooperative 
Board on Education Service Policies for Indigenous Peoples (CONTCEPI), made proposals 
for the establishment of an Indigenous Education System (SEIP). Significantly, according 
to information provided by the Government, the number of indigenous persons enrolled in 
schooling programmes increased from 319,226 in 2007 to 331,469 in 2008 and 343,676 in 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>54. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
commented that &#8220;Despite an established programme for bilingual education 
(<i>etnoeducaci&#243;n</i>) the coverage is limited and illiteracy rates high.&#8221;50 In fact, the Government 
estimates that 28.6 per cent of Colombia&#8217;s indigenous persons over 15 years of age are 
illiterate. Also, it should be pointed out that the education of indigenous peoples is being 
seriously affected by the armed conflict and, in particular, displacement.

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal and political framework 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes the readiness of the Government of Colombia to 
recognize the rights of indigenous peoples. Clearly the State is addressing indigenous 
concerns and developing plans and proposals for responding to the recommendations 
of the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Stavenhagen.  
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> In spite of this, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the numerous 
indications that the grave situation of indigenous peoples in Colombia has not been 
addressed with the level of urgency it deserves. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls the comment of the Constitutional Court regarding the lack of consistency 
between, on one hand, the serious undermining of rights recognized in the 
Constitution and enshrined in law and, on the other, the resources actually assigned 
for ensuring the enjoyment of those rights in practice and creating the institutional 
capacity necessary for implementation of the corresponding constitutional and legal 
mandates.</b>51<b> 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> There is a need for progress in the adoption of appropriate public policies and 
national laws for enforcement of the rights of the indigenous peoples, including a law 
on consultation processes, with the full and effective participation of the indigenous 
authorities and representatives. Both the processes and the public policies and 
national laws that are agreed upon should comply with the international standards 
relating to the rights of indigenous peoples, including those recognized in the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention No. 169. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure all necessary support 
for the effective functioning of the State organs of control and justice, including the 
functioning and funding of the Early Warning System, and adequate funding of the 
Constitutional Court to enable it to follow-up its decisions. He also recommends that 
greater financial resources be assigned to the local representatives of the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Internal armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Call for peace 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the State of Colombia to seek a negotiated 
solution to the armed conflict, with the involvement of civil society, and particularly 
the indigenous authorities, so that real and lasting peace may be achieved in 
Colombia. It is recommended that support be given to the dialogue and peace-
building initiatives proposed by the indigenous authorities and their organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> It is also recommended that, in coordination with indigenous authorities and 
organizations, political agreements be concluded on the clearing of explosive devices 
that have been left abandoned after fighting in urban and rural areas during the 
armed conflict. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government invite a 
competent international organization to monitor the clearance process and provide 
humanitarian guarantees to communities in that connection.

</p>
<p><b>  Violence against indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities at the national, 
regional and local levels to afford effective protection to indigenous leaders. In that 
connection, the Colombian Government should, as a matter of urgency and in 
consultation with the indigenous peoples themselves, adopt budgetary and operational 
measures to strengthen protection arrangements, including the precautionary and 
provisional measures prescribed by the Inter-American Human Rights System. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The protection measures established by the Ministry of the Interior and Justice 
should be adapted to the circumstances and needs of the leaders and authorities of the 
indigenous peoples. In that process, the Indigenous Guard and other indigenous 
community initiatives should be respected. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The State authorities, especially the Office of the Attorney-General, should, 
acting in compliance with international human rights principles, take all necessary 
steps to properly investigate violations of the human rights of indigenous peoples, to 
bring the perpetrators to justice and to ensure that such human rights violations do 
not recur. In particular, the Special Rapporteur urges the Office of the Attorney-
General to arrange for the creation, as a matter of urgency, of special investigatory 
commissions for cases of violence against indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The State is urged to invite the United Nations Special Adviser on the 
Prevention of Genocide to monitor the situation of the indigenous communities that, 
according to Decision 004 of the Constitutional Court, are under threat of cultural or 
physical extermination. The State is also urged to continue cooperating with the Office 
of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The Special Rapporteur stresses that the armed groups must abstain from 
recruiting indigenous children for activities relating to the hostilities, which 
constitutes a serious violation of human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> All armed personnel, legal and illegal, must comply with all the rules of 
international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Military presence in indigenous areas 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts being made by the Security 
Forces to promote respect for human rights by their members in the exercise of their 
duties. He urges them to intensify those efforts and to respect the autonomy of the 
indigenous peoples, and to consult with the indigenous peoples&#8217; authorities on the 
conditions governing any presence that may be required within their territories, in 
compliance with article 30 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. Those efforts should be intensified through, inter alia, 
cooperation at the international level, particularly with the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Forced displacement and confinement 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s efforts to prepare the &#8220;ethnic 
safeguards plans&#8221; called for by the Constitutional Court in Judgement T-025 of 2004 
and Decision 004 of 2009. He urges that those plans be prepared and implemented 
exactly as stipulated by the Constitutional Court, with full participation of the 
organizations and authorities of the indigenous peoples at each stage. Also, he stresses 
the need to develop similar plans for other vulnerable indigenous communities at risk 
of extinction. It should be ensured that all human and financial resources necessary 
for the effective implementation of those plans are available. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13669 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> On the basis of special guarantees, the Government should protect the land of 
indigenous peoples that have been forcibly displaced, so as to prevent seizures of the 
land in the absence of the indigenous peoples and enable them to return to it. Also, the 
Government should ensure that displaced indigenous communities can return safely, 
of their own free will, with dignity and without fear of forced displacement in the 
future. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers it important that a distinction be made 
between the different forms of displacement of indigenous peoples &#8211; displacement 
within the same reserve, displacement between reserves and displacement across the 
national border (Wayuu, Awa, Sikuani and Embera peoples); with the third form of 
displacement, the binational character or the refugee status of the peoples in question 
should be recognized and respected. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> It must be ensured that, when it is impossible for displaced indigenous 
communities to return to their land, they are able to live in dignity, with full access to 
basic social services. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the situation of 
indigenous children and women affected by the armed conflict, and he urges the 
Government to strengthen its programmes for responding effectively and with 
targeted assistance to their needs. He urges the State to comply fully with Decision 092 
and Decision 237 of 2008 issued by the Constitutional Court and to respond in a 
differentiated manner to the situation of indigenous women and children in rural and 
urban areas, particularly women and children who have been displaced. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take the measures necessary 
for speeding up the establishment, expansion and improvement of reserves, drawing 
up timetables with clear deadlines for the actions to be taken. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that recognition and protection of the 
territorial rights of indigenous peoples are essential for establishing sustainable 
conditions of peace and ensuring the survival of the indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The State should promptly clarify the competences of the public authorities as 
regards the various legal processes relating to reserves in order that the inalienable, 
unattachable and imprescriptible character of the indigenous territories may be 
guaranteed. The competent authorities should ensure that in the course of those legal 
processes the principles of openness, transparency and indigenous participation are 
respected. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to bring Colombia&#8217;s public policy 
relating to the economic development of the country (particularly as regards natural 
resource extraction and infrastructure &#8220;megaprojects&#8221;) into line with the collective 
and individual rights of the indigenous peoples. He recalls the recommendation of the 
previous Special Rapporteur that investment, infrastructure, natural resource 
extraction and exploitation, industrial production and other major projects should not 
be promoted without full and genuine prior consultation with and the involvement of 
the indigenous peoples. Also, it is essential to respond properly to the decisions of the 
Constitutional Court regarding intrusive initiatives and large infrastructure projects. 
</b>77.<b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes the need for concerted action to prevent the 
cultivation of illicit crops, but also the complexity of the issue. He recommends that 
the efforts to deal with the issue be strengthened and recalls the recommendation of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-13669 
</p>
<p><b>Mr. Stavenhagen that, except when expressly requested by an indigenous community 
that has been fully apprised of the implications, no aerial fumigation of illicit crops be 
carried out near indigenous settlements and the areas from which they obtain their 
food and other necessities.</b>52<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Consultation and agreement 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that agreements be reached with the 
indigenous peoples on the draft law regarding consultation and care be taken to 
ensure that it is consistent with the applicable international standards, the decisions of 
the Constitutional Court and relevant international mechanisms. He is confident that 
the support of the United Nations System, especially the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, will be helpful in that respect.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Regarding consultation committees, the Special Rapporteur considers that such 
forums should be promoted, with guaranteed exercise of the right of communities to 
participate, with the adoption of agreed consultation arrangements and with 
recognition of the representative status of indigenous organizations. He urges the 
Government to ensure that all agreements reached with indigenous peoples in the 
consultation committees and other forums be duly respected and implemented. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> With a view to be improving the provision of necessary social services to the 
indigenous peoples, Colombia&#8217;s population statistics should be updated, with more 
systematic census-taking so as to obtain detailed information regarding their socio-
economic conditions of peoples and with the establishment of an agreed system for the 
collection of socio-demographic information that involves a differentiated approach in 
the case of the indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> In collaboration with indigenous authorities and organizations, there should be 
a concerted effort to reduce the high levels of mortality and morbidity in their 
communities. In particular, health centres with medical staff should be established 
within indigenous territories, in order that care may be provided prompted &#8211; 
especially to the many communities in remote areas. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the State to develop and implement a strategy for the prevention of death caused by 
malnutrition among children, pregnant women and the elderly in indigenous 
communities. The Government should take steps to ensure that the financial resources 
available to local authorities for investments designed to improve the health of 
indigenous peoples are sufficient.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> There is an urgent need for progress in applying, on an agreed basis, the special 
education system for indigenous peoples in compliance with Decision 207 of 2007. 
Accordingly, the State should provide the indigenous peoples with the power, and 
budgetary resources required by them in order to independently implement the 
bilingual and intercultural education programme in indigenous areas and ensure that 
vulnerable indigenous groups &#8212; particularly ones that have been displaced &#8212; have 
access to education. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the State to align local, municipal and national 
development plans, and other instruments reflecting public policy, more closely with 
</b></p>

<p><b>the needs of the indigenous communities. Its institutions need to recognize the 
indigenous authorities and the decision-making mechanisms of the various ethnic 
groups, and local authorities should participate in the development of plans and 
programmes. Also, there is a need for steps to ensure the sound management by local 
government authorities of public funds transferred to indigenous reserves.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Other recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the United Nations agencies in 
Colombia, including the representation of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, in cooperation with the Government and the indigenous peoples, 
provide technical assistance to the State in order that the recommendations made in 
this report may be implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the State of Colombia, the indigenous peoples 
and other relevant entities to establish processes for dialogue and the adoption of 
lasting social covenants aimed at implementing the recommendations of various 
human rights organizations, ILO Convention No. 169, the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the recommendations made in this report.
