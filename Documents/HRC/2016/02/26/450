<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum presents information on alleged violations of international law 
</p>
<p>related to events in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip between 
</p>
<p>12 June and 26 August 2014. It provides additional information to the Report of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the implementation of resolution S-21/1 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/76) of 19 September 2014, based on OHCHR monitoring in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p>2. Following the kidnapping, on 12 June, of three Israeli youths who were later found 
</p>
<p>murdered near Hebron, Israeli security forces launched an operation involving mass arrests 
</p>
<p>of individuals perceived to be associated with Hamas, amid a climate of hatred in some 
</p>
<p>parts of Israeli and Palestinian society. This and the murder, on 2 July, of a 16-year-old 
</p>
<p>Palestinian youth, in apparent revenge for the murder of the three Israelis, in turn provoked 
</p>
<p>widespread clashes between Palestinians and Israeli Security Forces (ISF), resulting in 
</p>
<p>many Palestinian deaths and injuries, as well as injuries to ISF officers.  
</p>
<p>3. This situation formed the backdrop to the military escalation in Gaza, where an 
</p>
<p>increase in hostilities between Israel on the one hand, and Hamas and other Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups on the other, had already been noted in early June when the Israeli Defense 
</p>
<p>Forces (IDF) carried out targeted killings of Palestinians, and Palestinian armed groups 
</p>
<p>increased mortar and rocket fire towards Israel. The situation continued to deteriorate, and 
</p>
<p>Israel formally launched a military operation, which lasted from 7 July until the final 
</p>
<p>ceasefire on 26 August.  
</p>
<p>4. This period saw destruction in Gaza on an unprecedented scale, resulting in a huge 
</p>
<p>loss of life, disproportionately affecting civilians, and massive damage to homes, 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, hospitals and schools. The response by the ISF to widespread protests 
</p>
<p>against the military operation in Gaza by Palestinians in the West Bank, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, resulted in numerous Palestinian deaths and many more injuries. 
</p>
<p>5. Throughout the events, OHCHR maintained a continued monitoring presence in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory. In Gaza, the overwhelming number of alleged violations, 
</p>
<p>coupled with the prevailing security situation during the escalation, which severely 
</p>
<p>restricted staff movements, made difficult the gathering of first-hand information or the 
</p>
<p>verification of second-hand information on individual incidents. In addition, OHCHR has 
</p>
<p>encountered difficulties in Gaza gathering information about alleged violations by 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups, some witnesses apparently fearing reprisals or reluctant to 
</p>
<p>criticize the actions of armed groups. Since the 26 August ceasefire, conditions have 
</p>
<p>allowed verification to proceed. It will be for the independent, international commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry, established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1, to further 
</p>
<p>establish the facts and circumstances of possible violations and to identify responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The situation in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Overview 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 12 June, three Israeli youths disappeared in the Hebron Governorate of the 
</p>
<p>southern West Bank. In response, the ISF conducted extensive search operations across the 
</p>
<p>governorate, during which many allegations of damage to property and theft of money and 
</p>
<p>gold from Palestinian houses and shops were reported. ISF imposed restrictions on freedom </p>

</p>
<p>of movement of Palestinians. Clashes between the ISF and Palestinians resulted in 
</p>
<p>Palestinian deaths and injuries: between 12 June and 7 July 2014, seven Palestinians were 
</p>
<p>killed,
1
 and 786 were injured,
</p>
<p>2  
in incidents involving the ISF in the West Bank. The ISF 
</p>
<p>detained hundreds of Palestinians, and raided a number of Palestinian welfare 
</p>
<p>organizations, universities and media throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
3 
</p>
<p>The bodies of the three Israeli youths - Naftali Fraenkel (16-year-old), Gilad Shaer (16- 
</p>
<p>year-old), and Eyal Yifrah (19-year-old) - were discovered on 30 June 2014 in a shallow 
</p>
<p>grave near the city of Hebron. 
</p>
<p>7. The kidnapping and murder of the three Israeli youths and the security response 
</p>
<p>were accompanied by a rise in the use of extreme anti-Palestinian rhetoric in Israel. Calls 
</p>
<p>appeared in Israeli social media inciting revenge and hatred.4 On 1 July 2014, around 200 
</p>
<p>Israelis marched through the centre of Jerusalem chanting &#8220;death to Arabs&#8221;. They 
</p>
<p>reportedly harassed Palestinians, entered restaurants looking for Palestinian employees, 
</p>
<p>tried to attack them and caused damage to businesses employing Palestinians.
5
 On 2 July, 
</p>
<p>the burned body of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian youth from Shu&#8217;fat 
</p>
<p>in East Jerusalem, was found in West Jerusalem. Six Israelis were arrested on suspicion of 
</p>
<p>committing the killing on 6 July.
6
 On 17 July, the Israeli authorities indicted three Israeli 
</p>
<p>suspects for the murder. The indictment also charged two of the defendants with the 
</p>
<p>attempted kidnapping of a seven year-old Palestinian boy the night before the murder.
7
 
</p>
<p>8. Following the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, there were widespread protests 
</p>
<p>and violent clashes between Palestinians and ISF, notably in Shu&#8217;fat. Between 2 and 7 July, 
</p>
<p>568 Palestinians were reportedly injured during these clashes, including 31 by live 
</p>
<p>ammunition.<footnote name="8">6  www.un.org/press/en/2014/sgsm16324.doc.htm </footnote> Seventeen ISF officers were also reported injured.
9 
</p>
<p>At that time, Israel 
</p>
<p>resumed its policy of punitive demolitions, which had been suspended in 2005.
10 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. After a short lull, the launch of ISF military operations in Gaza prompted further 
</p>
<p>clashes between Palestinians and ISF, with particular intensity during the last two weeks of 
</p>
<p>July, during which 12 Palestinians were killed and more than 1,000 reportedly injured.<footnote name="11">9  www.mag.idf.il/261-6958-en/Patzar.aspx. </footnote> 
</p>
<p><b>  Excessive use of force by ISF 
</b></p>
<p>10. Between 12 June and 26 August 2014, 27 Palestinians, including five children, were 
</p>
<p>allegedly killed by the ISF. Three of the 27 fatalities during this period were recorded in 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem. This figure equals the total number of Palestinian fatalities in such 
</p>
<p>incidents in the whole of 2013.<footnote name="1">37  www.mag.idf.il/261-6958-en/Patzar.aspx.  </footnote>2 Sixteen of these deaths occurred in the context of

<p>demonstrations against the Israeli military operation in Gaza and related clashes.
13
</p>
<p> In 
</p>
<p>addition, according to OCHA, some 3,000 were injured, including more than 980 injured by 
</p>
<p>live ISF ammunition, and around 1,<footnote name="20">14. </footnote>0 by rubber-coated metal bullets.
14
</p>
<p> Whilst clashes 
</p>
<p>were intense in East Jerusalem, the proportion of those injured by live fire was much lower 
</p>
<p>than in the rest of the West Bank: 193 of 1,<footnote name="3">5  Source: Palestinian Police. Number of Palestinians denied, July 2013: 46; July 2014: 1152.  
</footnote>21 injured in East Jerusalem.   
</p>
<p>11. During these demonstrations, Palestinians often threw stones, burning tires, Molotov 
</p>
<p>cocktails, and fireworks, among other objects, at the ISF. Use of live fire against the ISF 
</p>
<p>was also reported on a few occasions. ISF often used tear gas, skunk water,
15
</p>
<p> stun grenades, 
</p>
<p>rubber bullets, rubber-coated metal bullets, and live ammunition to disperse demonstrations 
</p>
<p>and clashes.<footnote name="1">33  Source: OHCHR. 
</footnote>6  
</p>
<p>12. OHCHR&#8217;s initial findings indicate that many of those allegedly killed by the ISF did 
</p>
<p>not appear to pose a lethal threat.
17
</p>
<p> If verified by further examination and established, this 
</p>
<p>would raise concerns about the effective enforcement of the ISF rules of engagement and 
</p>
<p>their adherence to international legal principles of necessity and proportionality and other 
</p>
<p>relevant human rights standards.
18 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. In one case documented by OHCHR, three men were killed by live ammunition in 
</p>
<p>the context of clashes following a demonstration in Beit Ummar in Hebron Governorate on 
</p>
<p>25 July. A 47-year-old Palestinian man working for the non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>Defence for Children International was observing the demonstration from around 200 
</p>
<p>metres away and was not taking part in the clashes when he was killed by live ammunition 
</p>
<p>fired by ISF officers reportedly located on a corner in the main street. In the same incident, 
</p>
<p>a 30-year-old Palestinian man, also allegedly not taking part in the clashes, was hit in his 
</p>
<p>chest by live ammunition fired by ISF officers reportedly located on the roof of a building 
</p>
<p>some 80 metres from the victim. A third Palestinian man (36-year-old), who came to help 
</p>
<p>him, was also hit by live ammunition in his leg and chest and killed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mass detentions 
</b></p>
<p>14. Between 12 June and mid-August 2014, between 1,<footnote name="10">7  gisha.org/updates/3363. </footnote>0 and 1,500 Palestinians were 
</p>
<p>detained in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
19
</p>
<p> These included about 300 children, 
</p>
<p>27 Palestinian Legislative Council members and more than 60 of those freed in the prisoner 
</p>
<p>exchange that secured the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011. Most of those 
</p>
<p>detained were from East Jerusalem or the southern West Bank. About 170 Palestinians 
</p>
<p>were reported to have been placed under administrative detention.

</p>
<p>15. During the same period, of those Palestinians detained, approximately 500 were 
</p>
<p>reportedly East Jerusalemites, including some 200 children. Generally they were arrested 
</p>
<p>either during clashes or for alleged participation in clashes and demonstrations.
21 
</p>
<p>They 
</p>
<p>included 184 individuals who were indicted.
22
</p>
<p> Sixty Palestinians were arrested on 13 
</p>
<p>August, and 40 more on 15 August in East Jerusalem. According to residents, the ISF 
</p>
<p>typically broke the main doors of the houses in early morning raids while families were 
</p>
<p>sleeping and many of those arrested were blindfolded.
23
</p>
<p> On 16 August, the Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities released about 90 East Jerusalemites detained during previous days, reportedly 
</p>
<p>imposed house arrest for five days and set bail at up to 5,000 NIS for many of them.
24 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16. In the southern West Bank, search and arrest operations allegedly targeted 
</p>
<p>organizers and participants of demonstrations and clashes, as well as former detainees. In 
</p>
<p>July and August, about 500 persons were reportedly detained in the southern West Bank,
25 
</p>
<p>including 129 between 1 and 26 August 2014.
26
</p>
<p> ISF conducted frequent arrest operations in 
</p>
<p>the city of Hebron, the villages of Beit Ummar and Husan, and Ayda Refugee Camp near 
</p>
<p>Bethlehem. Further arrests were carried out in the central and northern areas of the West 
</p>
<p>Bank.  
</p>
<p><b>  Punitive demolitions 
</b></p>
<p>17. Shortly after the discovery of the bodies of the three Israelis on 30 June 2014, ISF 
</p>
<p>forcibly removed the families of two men suspected of having committed the killings from 
</p>
<p>their respective apartments in Hebron and partially destroyed both dwellings. Six relatives 
</p>
<p>of the suspects, including two children, were forcibly displaced as a result.
27
</p>
<p> On 18 August 
</p>
<p>2014, the apartments of the two suspects were completely destroyed and the apartment of a 
</p>
<p>third suspect was sealed,
28
</p>
<p> following a decision of the Israeli High Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>According to media reports, the IDF stated that the demolitions &#8220;issue a severe message of 
</p>
<p>deterrence to terrorists and their accomplices &#8211; that they will pay a price if they continue 
</p>
<p>their terrorist activities and harm innocent people&#8221;.29 Earlier, on 1 July 2014, the Israeli 
</p>
<p>High Court sanctioned the punitive demolition of parts of the house of the family of a 
</p>
<p>Palestinian from Idhna (Hebron) suspected of killing an Israeli police officer in April 2014. 
</p>
<p>As a result, eight people, including four children, were forcibly displaced.
30 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18. Israel had formally ended its policy of punitive demolitions in 2005, following a 
</p>
<p>recommendation of a military commission which reportedly indicated that they were not an 
</p>
<p>effective deterrent, although one house and one apartment in East Jerusalem were 
</p>
<p>demolished and sealed respectively in 2009.
31 
</p>
<p>The apparent resumption of this practice is a 
</p>
<p>matter of concern. Punitive home demolitions impact the entire family constitute a form of

<p>disappearance of the three Israeli youths, in particular in Hebron Governorate. The Hebron 
</p>
<p>area was effectively cut off from the rest of the West Bank for days by closures imposed by 
</p>
<p>the IDF; male Palestinians aged between 16 and 50 were not allowed to travel abroad 
</p>
<p>through the Allenby Bridge; and workers holding valid work permits for Israel were 
</p>
<p>prevented from travelling to work for several days.
34
</p>
<p> Restrictions on Palestinians travelling 
</p>
<p>across the Allenby Bridge to Jordan also increased.  
</p>
<p>20. Although Israeli officials claimed that no special restrictions were imposed on 
</p>
<p>Palestinians, figures provided by the Palestinian police indicate that the number of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians who were denied access to the bridge increased by more than 2,000 per cent 
</p>
<p>between July and early August 2014 when compared with the previous year, although 
</p>
<p>reportedly by mid-August 2014 numbers had returned to the 2013 average.
35
</p>
<p> Israeli 
</p>
<p>authorities reportedly cited &#8220;security concerns&#8221; when denying access. Palestinians who 
</p>
<p>were denied access allegedly did not have the possibility to challenge the decision or to 
</p>
<p>obtain the reasons for denial of access in writing. These restrictions on freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement raise concerns as to Israel&#8217;s compliance with its obligations under Article 12 of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Settler violence  
</b></p>
<p>21. After the discovery of the bodies of the three Israelis on 30 June 2014, settler 
</p>
<p>violence against Palestinians reportedly erupted throughout the West Bank, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem. It was in this context that the youth Mohammed Abu Khdeir was killed.   
</p>
<p>22. Several attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians were documented, including 
</p>
<p>physical assaults, stone-throwing at Palestinian cars, and &#8220;price tag&#8221; incidents.  Attacks by 
</p>
<p>Palestinians against settlers or other Israelis were also recorded. In a case monitored by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, on 25 July, an Israeli settler opened fire at a group of Palestinian demonstrators 
</p>
<p>on the road to Huwwara village (Nablus) killing a 19-year-old Palestinian and injuring four 
</p>
<p>others, after some Palestinian protestors threw stones at cars driven by settlers. Shortly 
</p>
<p>after, a 22-year-old Palestinian was killed by live ammunition in related clashes with ISF.<footnote name="3">4  www.btselem.org/press_releases/20140617_collective_punishment_in_hebron_district

</p>
<p>24. On the night of 7 July 2014, Israel announced the launch of the military operation in 
</p>
<p>Gaza.
42
</p>
<p> Between 7 July and 26 August, according to the United Nations Department of 
</p>
<p>Safety and Security, the IDF carried out 4,028 air raids, firing 5,<footnote name="8">1  www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/07/18/live-updates-ground-operation-gaza/. </footnote>30 missiles, as well as 
</p>
<p>16,507 artillery and tank projectiles and 3,494 naval shells. According to data compiled by 
</p>
<p>the Protection Cluster, which is still being verified,
43
</p>
<p> a total of 2,256 Palestinians, including 
</p>
<p>1,572 civilians were killed during the summer&#8217;s escalation in hostilities. Among these, 306 
</p>
<p>were women and 538 were children. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 
</p>
<p>11,231 Palestinians (including 3,540 women and 3,436 children) were injured during the

45
</p>
<p> According to the IDF, the Israeli Internal Security Agency

<p>clusters. OHCHR leads the Protection Cluster in OPT. For more on the cluster system, see 
</p>
<p>www.ochaopt.org/content.aspx?id=1010056. OHCHR compiled figures on fatalities in its capacity as 
</p>
<p>leader of the Protection Cluster. The methodology used involves the compilation of initial reports of 
</p>
<p>fatalities from the media and other sources which are then crosschecked and verified in collaboration 
</p>
<p>with a number of international, Palestinian and Israeli partner organizations. Where available, each 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s name, age, sex and place of death is determined, as well as their status as a civilian or 
</p>
<p>combatant where this can be determined. Multiple sources are cross-referenced, not only from media 
</p>
<p>and various human rights organizations, but also information released by the IDF and by the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups regarding the identity of combatants. Information from the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Health in Gaza is one, but not an exclusive, source of information. Verification of the information 
</p>
<p>collected is continuing. Figures are published on the website of OCHA on behalf of the Protection

<p>the height of the escalation, approximately 500,000 Palestinians, more than a quarter of the

48 
</p>
<p>This was the largest displacement in 
</p>
<p>Gaza since the Israeli occupation began in 1967.49  
</p>
<p>27. During the first phase of air, land and naval strikes between 7 and 17 July, Israeli 
</p>
<p>forces hit open areas and fields that were allegedly used to launch rockets against Israel, 
</p>
<p>training sites belonging to armed groups, and members of armed groups. According to data 
</p>
<p>compiled as of 17 July, 245 Palestinians, including 157 civilians had been killed.
 50
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Civilian objects, including buildings and installations belonging to the local authorities, 
</p>
<p>industrial infrastructure, and civilian homes were damaged.51   
</p>
<p>28. The ground operation, accompanied by air and naval strikes, ran from the night of 
</p>
<p>17 July until 5 August. During this phase, there was a significant increase in Palestinian 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties and displacement. On 18 July, the Israeli Civilian Affairs Liaison Office 
</p>
<p>announced a three-kilometre restricted access area on the Gaza side of the fence between 
</p>
<p>Israel and the Gaza Strip, making approximately 44 per cent of the Strip a declared &#8220;no-go-
</p>
<p>zone&#8221;.52 Until 5 August, the areas most severely affected by the Israeli military ground 
</p>
<p>operation were east of Salahadeen Road, the main highway running the length of the Strip, 
</p>
<p>although some areas west of the road were also affected. According to data compiled by the 
</p>
<p>Protection Cluster, 1,<footnote name="7">0  www.mag.idf.il/163-6859-en/Patzar.aspx?pos=9 and www.mag.idf.il/261-6958-en/Patzar.aspx  </footnote>91 Palestinians, including 1,286 civilians, were killed between 18 
</p>
<p>July and 4 August.
53 
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>29. From 5 August, there was a period of alternate ceasefires and strikes by air, land and 
</p>
<p>sea as the IDF withdrew its ground forces and reduced the &#8220;no-go-zone&#8221; to 500 metres from 
</p>
<p>the fence.
54 
</p>
<p>Two ceasefire agreements were reached on 5 August and on 10 August but 
</p>
<p>broke respectively on 8 August and 19 August. On 21 August, the IDF targeted and killed 
</p>
<p>senior members of the Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.
55
</p>
<p> Two 
</p>
<p>days later, on 23 August, the IDF destroyed six high-rise apartment buildings.
56
</p>
<p> Reports, 
</p>
<p>including of warnings given to residents and statements by the IDF, indicate that at least 
</p>
<p>some of these buildings were targeted.57 According to data compiled, between 5 and 26 
</p>
<p>August, 201 Palestinians were killed, including 130 civilians.
58
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>30. As illustrated below, information received raises serious concerns with regard to the 
</p>
<p>alleged failure of the IDF to respect the legal principles of distinction, proportionality and 
</p>
<p>precaution in attack. These concerns arise in the context of targeting decisions, the taking of 
</p>
<p>all necessary precautions; proportionality of the attacks; respect for the distinction between 
</p>
<p>civilians and civilian and military objectives, especially during the ground operation;

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31. Actions by Palestinian armed groups also raise serious concerns, as set out below, 
</p>
<p>including regarding targeting decisions; indiscriminate attacks; respect for distinction and 
</p>
<p>proportionality; locating military objects in civilian buildings; launching rockets from 
</p>
<p>densely populated areas; and execution of suspected collaborators. The IDF has accused 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups of: locating tunnels used for military purposes under civilian 
</p>
<p>objects; using hospitals and ambulances for military purposes;
60 
</p>
<p>using civilians as human

<p><b>A. Alleged violations by the Israeli Defence Forces

<p><b>  Air and naval strikes  
</b></p>
<p>32. Throughout the military operation, the IDF destroyed civilian homes, including 
</p>
<p>homes of employees of the local authorities, of alleged members of Hamas and of armed 
</p>
<p>groups, and of civilians with no apparent affiliation to an armed group, causing a large 
</p>
<p>number of civilian casualties and housing units destroyed or severely damaged.
63
</p>
<p> Up to 26 
</p>
<p>August 2014, 142 Palestinian families in Gaza had three or more family members killed in 
</p>
<p>the same incident, amounting to 739 fatalities,
64
</p>
<p> the majority having occurred in the course 
</p>
<p>of the destruction of civilian homes.  
</p>
<p>33. Some of these attacks appeared to be targeting specific individuals alleged to be 
</p>
<p>members of armed groups but appear disproportionate due to the large numbers of civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties. For example, on 12 July 2014, at approximately 2100 hours, an Israeli air strike 
</p>
<p>completely destroyed a two-storey house belonging to the Al-Batsh family, in Tofah area, 
</p>
<p>eastern Gaza city, killing at least nineteen Al-Batsh family members, including five 
</p>
<p>children and four women, one pregnant.
65
</p>
<p> Witnesses told OHCHR that the house was 
</p>
<p>targeted with two missiles, flattening it and causing severe damage to neighbouring houses. 
</p>
<p>Three Palestinians living in a house across the road were killed. According to leaflets 
</p>
<p>dropped by the IDF above Gaza City on 28 July 2014, two persons killed in this attack were 
</p>
<p>allegedly members of an armed group.  
</p>
<p>34. In other attacks, it was unclear what the target was. At around 1830 hours on 20 
</p>
<p>July, three missiles hit two apartments in a nine-storey building in the Remal area of Gaza 
</p>
<p>City. Eleven persons, including seven children and three women, were killed. Residents 
</p>
<p>said no prior warning of the planned attack was given. Some of the casualties were 
</p>
<p>displaced persons who had sought refuge with their relatives. According to information

<p>member of an armed group. OHCHR has no information on the possible military objective 
</p>
<p>for which the two apartments may have been targeted. 
</p>
<p>35. In a number of cases, IDF launched its attacks on houses and residential buildings 
</p>
<p>either around the time of breaking the Ramadan fast at sunset, or at the beginning of the fast 
</p>
<p>at dawn. This is a time when families are known to congregate to eat together, making it 
</p>
<p>very likely that any such attack targeting an individual would be disproportionate, and 
</p>
<p>therefore raising questions whether sufficient precautions were taken to protect civilian life. 
</p>
<p>In one such case documented by OHCHR, at 1948 hours on 20 July 2014, an Israeli air 
</p>
<p>strike hit a three-storey residential building of six apartments belonging to Abu Jam&#225; family 
</p>
<p>in Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, south of the Gaza Strip, killing 25 members of the 
</p>
<p>same family. The fatalities included 19 children, a one-day-old baby, and five women 
</p>
<p>(three were pregnant). Surviving family members said they received no prior warning from 
</p>
<p>the IDF. The Military Advocate-General has ordered a criminal investigation into this 
</p>
<p>incident.66 
</p>
<p>36. In another incident, on 16 July 2014, four children (aged between nine and eleven 
</p>
<p>years) were killed, and one adult and two children were injured, on a beach in Gaza City.
67 
</p>
<p>Witnesses reported that the children had been playing hide and seek on the beach when the 
</p>
<p>attack took place. One child went to hide in an empty zinc-roofed building, while others 
</p>
<p>were approximately 50 metres away. An air strike reportedly hit the building and the child 
</p>
<p>died immediately. The remaining children then ran towards the beach road. Reportedly, as 
</p>
<p>they were running, a shell from the sea landed in the area killing three children and injuring 
</p>
<p>two others. Witnesses claimed that the Israeli Naval Forces aimed at the group of children 
</p>
<p>running away from the sea, and reported that a third missile landed in a nearby area, hitting 
</p>
<p>one person who had been trying to rescue the children. According to media reports, the IDF 
</p>
<p>claimed that it had aimed at &#8220;Hamas terrorist operatives&#8221; and that the &#8220;reported civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties from this strike are a tragic outcome&#8221;.68 In a television interview, a spokesperson 
</p>
<p>for the Israeli Prime Minister said that the children had been killed due to &#8220;mistaken fire&#8221;.69 
</p>
<p>Based on information collected by OHCHR, there were no apparent military targets: the 
</p>
<p>area was calm and no rockets were fired towards Israel from that location at that time. The 
</p>
<p>Military Advocate-General has ordered a criminal investigation into this incident.70 
</p>
<p><b>  Ground operation 
</b></p>
<p>37. OHCHR documented a number of cases relating to the ground operation in which 
</p>
<p>civilians were killed in possibly indiscriminate and/or disproportionate Israeli attacks, or in 
</p>
<p>situations where there was a possible failure to take all feasible precautions to protect 
</p>
<p>civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>  Beit Hanoun 
</b></p>
<p>38. OHCHR documented a case in which at least eight civilians from one family were 
</p>
<p>killed in the morning of 26 July 2014 in a strike on their residential building. Some 50 
</p>
<p>members of the Wahdan family lived in the four-storey building, located approximately two 
</p>
<p>kilometres from the fence in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. On 16 July 2014, following the 
</p>
<p>escalation of hostilities, the majority of the family members left the building seeking 
</p>
<p>greater security in Jabalia and Beit Hanoun, but 15 were unable or unwilling to leave before

</p>
<p>the shelling made it too dangerous to do so. On 18 July 2014, at 0100 hours, the IDF 
</p>
<p>reportedly arrested seven men in the building, who were subsequently interrogated at Erez 
</p>
<p>in Israel and released after three days. The men sought refuge elsewhere, but remained in 
</p>
<p>contact by mobile phone with the family members remaining in the building. In their last 
</p>
<p>contact they were told that IDF soldiers had remained in the building until 25 July 2014. 
</p>
<p>Hours later, on 26 July, the house and those neighbouring it were bombarded, killing all 
</p>
<p>eight family members.  
</p>
<p>39. According to media reports, an IDF commander confirmed that the presence of 
</p>
<p>civilians in the houses was known to the IDF.

<p>  Witnesses told OHCHR that the family 
</p>
<p>was in contact with the ICRC requesting evacuation from the house prior to the attack, but 
</p>
<p>were told it was not possible due to intense military activities in the area. During a lull in 
</p>
<p>fighting on 5 August 2014, two of the bodies were recovered from the rubble; another body 
</p>
<p>was recovered on 10 August, and the remaining five several days later.  
</p>
<p>40. The presence of IDF soldiers in the house is an indication that the IDF was aware 
</p>
<p>that civilians were in the house, and may still have been in the area at the time of the attack. 
</p>
<p>It is unclear in this case whether the IDF took all feasible precautions to ensure that the area 
</p>
<p>was free of civilians before its attack and that it warned the civilians remaining in the area 
</p>
<p>of an imminent attack. The number of civilian casualties and the scale of damage in the area 
</p>
<p>&#8211; almost the whole surrounding area was flattened &#8211; raises concerns as to whether the 
</p>
<p>attack was disproportionate and/or indiscriminate.  
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Shuja&#8217;iya<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. Between 19 and 21 July 2014, the IDF carried out attacks in Shuja&#8217;iya, reportedly 
</p>
<p>with artillery, tank projectiles and airstrikes. Many residents of this densely-populated area 
</p>
<p>to the southeast of Gaza City, reported hearing heavy shelling from late night on 19 July. 
</p>
<p>On 20 July, a family living on Al-Biltaji Street decided to leave their house for safety when 
</p>
<p>shells hit the house. As the family of 16 and a neighbour were attempting to leave, 
</p>
<p>numerous shells hit their staircase, killing three children, three women and two men and 
</p>
<p>injuring five others.
72
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42. Residents of Shuja&#8217;iya also reported continuous shelling as they fled their homes. 
</p>
<p>Shells hit houses, shops, cars and streets in an apparently indiscriminate manner. Between 
</p>
<p>0600 hours to 0700 hours on 20 July in the Al-Turkman area, many residents fled their 
</p>
<p>houses after a night of heavy bombardment. As the Ayyad family was running westward on 
</p>
<p>Mansura Street, at least two shells hit the street, killing 11 family members, including five 
</p>
<p>women and four children, and killing eight other persons.73 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR also received reports of attacks on civilians during humanitarian pauses.  In 
</p>
<p>Shuja&#8217;iya, a 22-year-old Palestinian, searching for his relatives with other rescuers during a 
</p>
<p>humanitarian pause on the afternoon of 20 July, was allegedly shot several times by the IDF 
</p>
<p>and killed. The man, who had helped to carry the stretcher of an injured person, was clearly 
</p>
<p>unarmed and was shouting the name of his lost cousin as he walked to his relative&#8217;s house 
</p>
<p>across rubble from destroyed houses. As the victim stepped into an alley, he was shot from 
</p>
<p>an easterly direction. Based on witness accounts and video footage provided to OHCHR, he

</p>
<p><b>  </b>Khuzza&#8217;a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>44. On 23 and 24 July 2014, in Khuzza&#8217;a, another densely-populated area in southern 
</p>
<p>Gaza, hundreds of residents fled or tried to flee their homes during heavy bombardment of 
</p>
<p>their respective neighbourhoods. A 16-year-old girl with a disability, who fled her home in 
</p>
<p>a wheelchair with her family on 24 July, was found dead on 1 August near the entrance to 
</p>
<p>the town. Reportedly, her body had injuries indicating that she might have been killed by 
</p>
<p>shelling. The girl&#8217;s relatives left her behind reportedly after the IDF opened fire on them, 
</p>
<p>injuring the girl's brother who was pushing her wheelchair. Attempts by the family to 
</p>
<p>retrieve the girl in the following days were impeded by continued strikes.
75 
</p>
<p>Witnesses told 
</p>
<p>OHCHR that IDF soldiers fired indiscriminately at civilians trying to escape the area 
</p>
<p>including some with white flags. 
</p>
<p>45. In another instance at around 0600 hours on 24 July, several hundred residents 
</p>
<p>trying to leave their homes reportedly found themselves surrounded by IDF tanks and IDF 
</p>
<p>soldiers. The group, many of them carrying white flags, were reportedly asked by IDF 
</p>
<p>soldiers to sit on the floor. IDF soldiers reportedly asked for a Hebrew speaker in the group 
</p>
<p>to stand up. As a 57-year-old man attempted to do so, he was reportedly shot and killed.76  
</p>
<p><b>  Rafah 
</b></p>
<p>46. On 1 August 2014, in eastern Rafah, in the context of reports that an IDF soldier had 
</p>
<p>been captured, the IDF carried out massive shelling and bombardment in the 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods of Al-Shoka, Zalata and the vicinity of the defunct airport.77 According to 
</p>
<p>information gathered by the Protection Cluster, 111 Palestinians, including 94 civilians and 
</p>
<p>11 confirmed members of armed groups, were killed, some while fleeing their homes.78 
</p>
<p>OCHA reported that thousands of residents from Rafah Governorate were displaced, 
</p>
<p>fleeing to seek refuge, including in UNRWA shelters.79 As of the afternoon of 3 August 
</p>
<p>2014, UNRWA was providing shelter to 259,321 in 90 schools across the Gaza Strip; 6,000 
</p>
<p>more than on 2 August.80  
</p>
<p>47. Witnesses told OHCHR that ambulances were prevented from reaching the dead and 
</p>
<p>wounded. Instead, relatives were exposed to enormous risks amidst continuous shelling as 
</p>
<p>they carried the corpses and injured to nearby hospitals. Based on the information available 
</p>
<p>to OHCHR, it is hard to understand how the very high number of civilian casualties and the 
</p>
<p>scale of damage caused by the shelling and bombardment carried out in Rafah, reportedly 
</p>
<p>as a response to the alleged capture of the soldier, could be consistent with the principles of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and distinction enshrined in international humanitarian law.81

<p><b>  Attacks on schools serving as United Nations-designated shelters for internally-
</b></p>
<p><b>displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>48. OHCHR documented a number of cases where those seeking shelter found they had 
</p>
<p>nowhere safe to go. Of particular concern were the seven separate occasions when 
</p>
<p>UNRWA schools that had been used as Designated Emergency Shelters were either hit 
</p>
<p>directly or struck nearby by shells or other munitions, injuring and in three cases, killing 
</p>
<p>civilians sheltering there.   
</p>
<p>49. The three most egregious cases in which UNRWA schools used as shelters were hit 
</p>
<p>were at Beit Hanoun Elementary Co-educational &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;D&#8221; School (on 24 July 2014), 
</p>
<p>Jabalia Elementary Girls &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; School (30 July 2014) and Rafah Preparatory Boys 
</p>
<p>&#8220;A&#8221; School (3 August 2014), which were roundly condemned by the Secretary-General, the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner, the UNRWA Commissioner-General and others.
82
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>50. In total, some 45 civilians were killed and more than 200 injured. United Nations 
</p>
<p>premises are inviolable under international law, whilst civilians are protected from direct 
</p>
<p>attack under international humanitarian law. The Military Advocate General (MAG) has 
</p>
<p>stated it is launching a criminal investigation into the incident in Beit Hanoun.83 
</p>
<p>51. The case in Rafah, on 3 August 2014, illustrates the concerns. At around 1045 hours, 
</p>
<p>a missile hit an area approximately five metres from the main gate of a UNRWA school 
</p>
<p>used as a shelter for some 2,700 internally displaced persons, killing 12 people, including 
</p>
<p>an UNRWA guard.  Six of those killed were inside the school premises and five were 
</p>
<p>outside when the attack occurred. The location of the twelfth victim has not been 
</p>
<p>determined. Among the dead were eight children. A number of people passing by were 
</p>
<p>injured. According to witness accounts, the children from the shelter were buying ice-cream 
</p>
<p>from a street vendor at the gate of the school, when the missile hit the road. UNRWA 
</p>
<p>notified the Israeli authorities 33 times of the coordinates of the shelter, and the fact that it 
</p>
<p>was housing displaced persons, the last time one hour before the incident.
84 
</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses 
</p>
<p>said that there were no activities of armed groups in the area at the time. Media reported 
</p>
<p>that the IDF were targeting three members of an armed group on a motorcycle or firing at 
</p>
<p>IDF in the vicinity of the school.
85
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. An internal Board of Inquiry has been established by the Secretary-General which 
</p>
<p>will &#8220;<i>review and investigate a number of specific incidents in which death or injuries 
</i></p>
<p>occurred at, and/or damage [was] done to, United Nations premises&#8221;.86   
</p>
<p><b>Attacks on hospitals and medical personnel 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b> </b>According to the World Health Organization, 17 hospitals and 56 primary health 
</p>
<p>clinics were destroyed or sustained damages during hostilities.

<p>54. In one case OHCHR monitored, a warning given by the IDF before an attack on a 
</p>
<p>private medical clinic in Al-Shaf, east of Gaza City, did allow civilians to evacuate, despite 
</p>
<p>extremely short notice. On 12 July 2014, a neighbour living adjacent to the medical clinic 
</p>
<p>received a telephone call from the IDF requesting him to warn the staff at the clinic of an 
</p>
<p>imminent attack. The neighbour passed on the warning to family members of clinic staff. 
</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, he received another telephone call from IDF stating that the aerial 
</p>
<p>attack would start in five minutes. People were evacuated from the clinic and its vicinity 
</p>
<p>and there were no civilian casualties. Notwithstanding the successful evacuation, this attack 
</p>
<p>still raises concerns regarding compliance with the special protection for hospitals under 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law.
88 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55. At least 17 out of 32 hospitals were damaged,89 many directly impacted by Israeli 
</p>
<p>strikes; one hospital and 54 primary health clinics were destroyed outright.
90
</p>
<p> On 21 July 
</p>
<p>2014, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir El Balah was directly hit numerous times, killing 
</p>
<p>three people, including one patient, and injuring at least 40 others. At least two others who 
</p>
<p>were evacuated from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital died in other hospitals from their wounds. 
</p>
<p>According to witnesses, intense shelling of the area had been ongoing for some time when 
</p>
<p>the hospital was hit several times, including the Special Surgery Department, completely 
</p>
<p>destroying several rooms. Reportedly, no warning of the pending attack was given. The 
</p>
<p>IDF claimed that the target was a cache of anti-tank missiles in the hospital&#8217;s immediate 
</p>
<p>vicinity.
91
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>56. This attack would appear to violate the special protections given to hospitals under 
</p>
<p>international law. Due to their vital importance to the civilian population, and the function 
</p>
<p>they perform, there are specific provisions in international humanitarian law regarding 
</p>
<p>when hospitals lose their protection. Where hospitals are being used to commit acts harmful 
</p>
<p>to the enemy, they may lose their protection from attack. However, their protective status 
</p>
<p>may only cease after due warning has been given specifying a reasonable time limit, and 
</p>
<p>after such warning has remained unheeded.  The time given must be long enough to allow 
</p>
<p>the unlawful acts to be stopped or for the hospital patients to be removed to a place of 
</p>
<p>safety.<footnote name="9">9  Rule 55, ICRC Customary IHL Study; Articles 11 and 12, ICESCR. 
</footnote>2  
</p>
<p>57. There are also numerous reports of attacks on or near ambulances and ambulance 
</p>
<p>staff, causing death, injury and damage. In several cases, this was even after ambulances 
</p>
<p>coordinated their movement directly with the Israeli Civil Liaison Office or through the 
</p>
<p>ICRC. For example, on 25 July 2014, at around 2310 hours, a Palestinian Red Crescent 
</p>
<p>Society (PRCS) ambulance went to Al-Qarara in Khan Younis after the ICRC was 
</p>
<p>contacted by the Liaison Office to evacuate a child. Three PRCS staff, including the driver, 
</p>
<p>had to leave the vehicle to reach the child, which they did only after coordination with the 
</p>
<p>IDF via the ICRC. The IDF then allegedly shot the driver. The remaining PRCS staff were 
</p>
<p>allegedly shot at several times and only able to evacuate the driver 30 minutes later. He 
</p>
<p>subsequently died from his injuries.  The Military Advocate-General has ordered a criminal 
</p>
<p>investigation into this incident.<footnote name="93">www.mag.idf.il/261-6958-en/Patzar.aspx. </footnote>

<p><b>  Attacks on other civilian objects and infrastructure  
</b></p>
<p>59. Civilian objects protected under international humanitarian law - such as industrial 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, farms, water and sanitation installations, the Gaza Power Plant, a water 
</p>
<p>desalination station, mosques, and universities - sustained severe damage or were 
</p>
<p>destroyed. Many of these are subject to special protection, including mosques and 
</p>
<p>educational institutions,<footnote name="9">4  Rule 1, ICRC Customary IHL Study. 
</footnote>8 as well as objects, such as the power plant and water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation facilities, which may be seen as objects indispensable to the survival of the 
</p>
<p>civilian population and whose destruction will have a significant impact on the population&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to health, water and an adequate standard 
</p>
<p>of living.99 In any event, the widespread impact of destruction of such facilities would make 
</p>
<p>it very unlikely that such attacks could be proportionate. While the IDF reportedly denied 
</p>
<p>targeting the power plant,
100
</p>
<p> the Israeli authorities confirmed that they had targeted 
</p>
<p>mosques on a number of occasions and the Islamic University in Gaza.101  
</p>
<p>60. According to United Nations figures, 26 government schools were totally destroyed 
</p>
<p>and 209 schools sustained damages (122 government schools, 83 UNRWA schools and 
</p>
<p>four private schools) due to their proximity to targeted sites, or as result of direct attacks.
102
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>UNRWA estimates that 118 of its installations, including schools, health centres, and 
</p>
<p>warehouses, have been damaged during the war.
103
</p>
<p> Furthermore, three universities were 
</p>
<p>directly hit in Israeli strikes and eight universities sustained collateral damage.
104
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>61. Water and sanitation infrastructure in the Gaza Strip sustained damage reportedly 
</p>
<p>amounting to USD 33 million.
105
</p>
<p> According to the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, 63 
</p>
<p>water facilities were damaged; among them 23 were completely destroyed.
106
</p>
<p> As a result, 
</p>
<p>40 per cent of the population were deprived of access to running water while, by 20 August, 
</p>
<p>the rest of the population were receiving running water only on average every three to four 
</p>
<p>days.
107
</p>
<p> A wastewater pumping station serving 200,000 people was also damaged in Gaza

</p>
<p> According to the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, six of its staff members were 
</p>
<p>killed during Israeli attacks while they were working.
109 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>62. The sole power station in Gaza was forced to shut down after its fuel tanks and one 
</p>
<p>turbine were hit in Israeli strikes. According to media, the IDF denied intentionally 
</p>
<p>targeting the power plant, but did not rule out that the plant was hit by mistake.
110
</p>
<p> The 
</p>
<p>shutdown of the power plant deprived households of both electricity and access to water 
</p>
<p>and sewage treatment. It also increased the vulnerability of hospitals forced to rely on 
</p>
<p>precarious generators.
111
</p>
<p> The cost of repairing the power plant is estimated at USD 10 
</p>
<p>million, and will take several months provided all necessary materials are allowed to enter 
</p>
<p>Gaza.
112
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>63. The escalation severely affected the livelihoods of farmers and fisherfolk. According 
</p>
<p>to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 17,000 hectares of cropland and 
</p>
<p>other agricultural infrastructure was substantially damaged, and half of Gaza&#8217;s population 
</p>
<p>of poultry birds was lost directly in Israeli strikes or through lack of water, feed or care 
</p>
<p>resulting from access restrictions.
113
</p>
<p> On 6 July, the fishing limit was reduced from six to 
</p>
<p>three nautical miles.
114
</p>
<p> The fishing sector lost an estimated 234.6 tons of fish - 9.3 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the local fishermen&#8217;s yearly catch - during the first month of hostilities.115 
</p>
<p><b>  Transfer of detainees to Israel and forced work for military purposes 
</b></p>
<p>64. Approximately 66 Palestinians were detained by IDF in Gaza during the 
</p>
<p>offensive.
116
</p>
<p> Of these, 31 were transferred to Israel and the rest were subsequently released. 
</p>
<p>In late October, local human rights organizations reported that 22 were still in Israeli 
</p>
<p>detention,
117
</p>
<p> many charged with membership of or affiliation with armed groups, with one 
</p>
<p>detainee held under the Unlawful Combatants Act. According to a local human rights 
</p>
<p>group, 10 detainees were allegedly subjected to beating, prolonged standing and stress 
</p>
<p>positions during interrogation.
118
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>65. In another case, a 17-year-old Palestinian youth told OHCHR he was detained and 
</p>
<p>forced to work with the IDF for several days. On 23 July, at approximately 1300-1400 
</p>
<p>hours, the boy was walking through an IDF checkpoint on Al-Basteen Street in Khuzza&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>after clearance was given to civilians to evacuate their homes to safer places in Khan 
</p>
<p>Younis. He said that he was detained, interrogated and forced to spend a night in a dark 
</p>
<p>room without windows, and forced to escort soldiers more than once to locate tunnels

<p><b> B. Alleged violations by Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Indiscriminate rocket fire and targeting of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>66. Palestinian armed groups fired large numbers of projectiles towards Israel.120 While 
</p>
<p>some projectiles, especially mortars, may have been directed at military objectives, rockets 
</p>
<p>lack precision in terms of aiming at specific targets. Many Palestinian armed groups 
</p>
<p>reportedly indicated their intention to attack large population centres in Israel.
121
</p>
<p> In 
</p>
<p>numerous statements, Palestinian armed groups claimed responsibility for rocket fire at 
</p>
<p>Israeli towns &#8220;in reprisal for Israeli abuses or aggression&#8221;.122 In other statements, 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups warned Israeli civilians living in &#8220;&#8230; the Gaza rim and the towns 
</p>
<p>close by&#8230; not to return to their homes. Those of them who stay out of necessity should 
</p>
<p>remain inside shelters and protected places&#8221;.123 Attacks directed at civilians are prohibited 
</p>
<p>under international law. Also, the vast majority of rockets fired cannot be precisely targeted 
</p>
<p>and, as such, are indiscriminate in nature and violate the principle of distinction. 
</p>
<p>67. According to Israeli Government sources, attacks by Palestinian armed groups 
</p>
<p>resulted in the killing of six civilians in Israel.
124
</p>
<p> On 21 August 2014, a four-year-old boy 
</p>
<p>was killed, when a mortar hit a car in a community near Gaza.
125
</p>
<p> Approximately 224 
</p>
<p>rockets reportedly hit Israeli residential buildings, cars and a synagogue, during the 
</p>
<p>escalation.
126 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Military operations in densely-populated areas and</b> <b>locating weapons in United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations facilities</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The IDF, on 20 August 2014, reported that 1,600 out of 3,600 rockets had been fired 
</p>
<p>from civilian areas.
127
</p>
<p> Allegedly, rockets and mortars were fired from or in the vicinity of 
</p>
<p>United Nations facilities, schools, graveyards, mosques and the power plant.
128
</p>
<p> OHCHR 
</p>
<p>documented two cases involving rocket fire from populated areas.  
</p>
<p>69. At around 2200 hours, on 20 July 2014, six civilians in different locations, north of 
</p>
<p>the main cemetery in Al-Faluja neighbourhood of Jabalia, sustained stone and shrapnel 
</p>
<p>injuries when a rocket fired by Palestinian armed groups fell short and landed on a house 
</p>
<p>north of the cemetery. OHCHR received multiple reports that members of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups frequently fired rockets from the cemetery towards Israel. The cemetery was 
</p>
<p>repeatedly hit by the IDF during the escalation.  
</p>
<p>70. On 29 July 2014, at approximately 1630 hours, a number of Israeli shells 
</p>
<p>consecutively hit a house in Al-Qasaseeb neighbourhood, a short distance from the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned cemetery, killing 11 people from the same family. OHCHR received 
</p>
<p>reports that members of Palestinian armed groups sought refuge or were in close proximity

<p>to the house after having fired a number of rockets towards Israel, possibly from the 
</p>
<p>cemetery the same day.     
</p>
<p>71. There are allegations that weapons belonging to Palestinian armed groups were 
</p>
<p>stored in homes and in other civilian structures.129   
</p>
<p>72. On three occasions UNRWA confirmed that weapons components had been placed 
</p>
<p>in three vacant UNRWA schools in Gaza in breach of the inviolability of United Nations 
</p>
<p>premises.
130
</p>
<p> As highlighted by UNRWA, the incident endangered civilians, including staff, 
</p>
<p>and put at risk UNRWA mission to assist and protect Palestine refugees in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>Immediately after discovering the items, UNRWA informed all key parties and condemned 
</p>
<p>these violations of international law.  On all occasions when weapons were found, they 
</p>
<p>were found in schools that had been shut down for the summer, and which were not being 
</p>
<p>used to shelter displaced persons.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary executions of alleged collaborators 
</b></p>
<p>73. Approximately 21 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel were allegedly 
</p>
<p>executed by Palestinian armed groups during the escalation, of whom 16 were allegedly 
</p>
<p>taken from Katiba Prison by armed masked men and summarily executed, while the five 
</p>
<p>others were allegedly executed in other locations.
131 
</p>
<p>The majority of these executions took 
</p>
<p>place immediately after the killing of three Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades commanders in 
</p>
<p>Rafah by the IDF. Witnesses reported seeing at least 10 dead bodies, apparently executed 
</p>
<p>by Palestinian armed groups, on 22 August 2014.
132
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>74. According to available information, two of those killed were already held in 
</p>
<p>detention in Katiba prison, one of the main prisons in Gaza City, accused of collaborating 
</p>
<p>with Israel during the period prior to the July-August escalation. OHCHR documented the 
</p>
<p>execution of a 23-year-old man on 23 August 2014. The man had been arrested on 23 
</p>
<p>October 2013 and charged with treason. He had appeared in court twice since the arrest, but 
</p>
<p>there was no court decision before his execution.
133 
</p>
<p> In another case, a 45-year-old man, a 
</p>
<p>former Palestinian Authority civil police officer who had been sentenced by a military court 
</p>
<p>on 9 April 2013 to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment for collaboration with Israel, was executed on 
</p>
<p>22 August. According to the man&#8217;s relatives, masked men took him from the Hamas-
</p>
<p>controlled prison at around 0230 hours to an empty building nearby where he was allegedly 
</p>
<p>ill-treated before being shot dead. His family received no official notification of the 
</p>
<p>execution but his body was handed over to them later that morning.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Israel  
</b></p>
<p>75. During the Israeli military operation in Gaza, the IDF Chief of Staff ordered that a 
</p>
<p>General Staff Mechanism for Fact-Finding Assessments (the 'FFA Mechanism') would 
</p>
<p>examine &#8220;Exceptional Incidents&#8221; that occurred during Operation Protective Edge.134 The 
</p>
<p>FFA Mechanism was established in response and as part of the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/28/80/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>recommendations of the &#8220;Turkel Commission&#8221;.135 According to information published by 
</p>
<p>the MAG in December 2014 regarding &#8220;exceptional incidents&#8221;, the MAG has conducted an 
</p>
<p>initial examination with regard to more than 100 incidents. Allegations with regard to 
</p>
<p>approximately 100 incidents have been referred to the FFA Mechanism for assessment. 
</p>
<p>Fifty of these incidents have been examined by the FFA Mechanism and referred to the 
</p>
<p>MAG for a decision. The MAG decided to close nine of these cases without opening a 
</p>
<p>criminal investigation, while 11 incidents have been referred back to the FFA Mechanism 
</p>
<p>for further examination.136 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>76. The MAG has ordered the opening of a total of thirteen criminal investigations, five 
</p>
<p>following referral by the FFA Mechanism, and eight more on the basis of allegations that, 
</p>
<p>according to the MAG, &#8220;indicated <i>prima facie</i> grounds for a reasonable suspicion of 
</p>
<p>criminal misconduct without the need for prior examination by&#8221; the FFA Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>Included in the list of incidents to be subject to a criminal investigation are the attack on the 
</p>
<p>UNRWA school in Beit Hanoun on 24 July, the attack on the Abu Jam&#225; home on 20 July 
</p>
<p>2014, the attack on Gaza beach on 16 July 2014, the attack on the ambulance driver near 
</p>
<p>Khan Younis on 25 July 2014, and the alleged mistreatment of the 17-year-old boy who 
</p>
<p>said that he was held by the IDF from 23 July 2014, amongst other incidents. The 
</p>
<p>remaining cases await a decision.
137
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>77. The MAG has decided to close the investigations into nine cases. One of these 
</p>
<p>relates to the killing of Abu Kaware family members in Khan Younis on 8 July 2014. The 
</p>
<p>investigation found that the attack was &#8220;carried out against the building due to its use for 
</p>
<p>military purposes by Hamas&#8221;, noting that &#8220;the IDF provided precautions to the residents of 
</p>
<p>the building to vacate the premises. These precautions included an individual telephone call 
</p>
<p>and the firing of a non-explosive projective at the roof of the premises, as part of the 'knock 
</p>
<p>on the roof' procedure&#8230;&#8221; The investigation&#8217;s findings continue: &#8220;Following the provision 
</p>
<p>of the precautions, the residents vacated the building. Subsequently, a number of people 
</p>
<p>were identified as returning to the premises for unknown reasons. However, at this stage, 
</p>
<p>the bomb had already been released and could not be diverted from its target&#8221;.138 The 
</p>
<p>investigation report does not specify the timings of the telephone call and the firing of the 
</p>
<p>non-explosive projective and the time lapse between them and the actual attack. Thus, it is 
</p>
<p>unclear whether the IDF gave the civilians sufficient time to evacuate the premises. 
</p>
<p>Witnesses informed OHCHR that soon after the &#8220;roof knocking&#8221; rocket hit the building, 
</p>
<p>people in the vicinity started running toward the attacked house to see what had happened, 
</p>
<p>just when the major attack occurred killing nine people (including six from the Kaware 
</p>
<p>family).
139
</p>
<p> &#8220;Roof-knocking&#8221; is an inherently ambiguous method of warning. In this case, it 
</p>
<p>is possible that people mistook the &#8220;roof knocking&#8221; for the main attack. 
</p>
<p>78. OHCHR notes that the investigations carried out by the FFA Mechanism and 
</p>
<p>reviewed by the MAG are positive steps towards establishing accountability and justice for 
</p>
<p>victims in Gaza. However, there are two significant shortcomings: firstly, the focus of the 
</p>
<p>FFA is on &#8220;exceptional incidents&#8221;, as opposed to all incidents that trigger the State&#8217;s duty to 
</p>
<p>investigate or any policies or tactics that may infringe international law; and, secondly, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 135  The Turkel Commission, established to investigate the May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, was given a mandate to review 
</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s mechanisms for investigating alleged violations of the laws of armed conflict, and made specific 
</p>
<p>recommendations to strengthen these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> 136  www.mag.idf.il/261-6958-en/Patzar.aspx. This was an update to information released by the MAG in September 
</p>
<p>2014, and was included in this report just prior to its finalisation without it being possible to fully analyse the updated 
</p>
<p>information published by the MAG. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/28/80/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>MAG has a dual role as both legal advisor and investigator. On the one hand, the MAG 
</p>
<p>advises the IDF on the legality of military operations, whilst on the other hand, it is 
</p>
<p>responsible for investigating allegations of unlawful actions, including potentially those 
</p>
<p>carried out on the basis of MAG advice. This raises concerns that investigations will be 
</p>
<p>limited to selected incidents and will not address failures to ensure respect for international 
</p>
<p>law at the policy level.  
</p>
<p>79. These concerns endure in the context of the continued failure to ensure meaningful 
</p>
<p>accountability in respect of earlier escalations in Gaza. According to local human rights 
</p>
<p>groups, despite numerous allegations of crimes under international law, only four Israeli 
</p>
<p>soldiers have been prosecuted and convicted for three incidents that occurred during the 
</p>
<p>2008-09 escalation; one of the convictions was for stealing a credit card.
140
</p>
<p> In 2013, the 
</p>
<p>Military Advocate General publicly stated that it found no basis for opening criminal 
</p>
<p>investigations into some 65 incidents involving the IDF during the November 2012 
</p>
<p>escalation.
141
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>80. There are also concerns regarding accountability, including a remedy for victims, in 
</p>
<p>respect of alleged violations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The past lack of 
</p>
<p>human rights compliant investigations and access to an effective remedy in cases of alleged 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force by the ISF and settler violence is well documented.
142
</p>
<p> There was 
</p>
<p>little information available at the time of writing on the opening or progress of 
</p>
<p>investigations into specific incidents. Israeli authorities must ensure that effective 
</p>
<p>accountability measures are put in place and that victims of the aforementioned alleged 
</p>
<p>violations are afforded a remedy. Additionally, the policies of administrative detention and 
</p>
<p>punitive demolitions must end and remedy must be provided to their victims.  
</p>
<p><b>  Accountability for violations by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Palestinian authorities have an obligation to ensure that allegations of violations 
</p>
<p>of international law are promptly, thoroughly, effectively, independently, impartially and 
</p>
<p>transparently investigated, and that those responsible are brought to justice. To date, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR has no information that such investigations are being carried out. There are again 
</p>
<p>fears that impunity will prevail and only add further fuel to the possibility of more violence 
</p>
<p>in the future.
143
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>  Commission of Inquiry  
</b></p>
<p>82. The Commission of Inquiry established by resolution S-21/1 and mandated to 
</p>
<p>investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights 
</p>
<p>law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, &#8220;<i>in the context of the military operations 
</i></p>
<p><i>conducted since 13 June 2014, whether before, during or after</i>&#8221;, is continuing its 
</p>
<p>investigations. It will report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session.144

</p>
<p> 140  www.btselem.org/accountability/20140905_failure_to_investigate.  
</p>
<p> 141  The Secretary-General has also highlighted concerns regarding accountability following the 2012 escalation 
</p>
<p>(A/68/502, paras.30-34).

<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The events of 12 June to 26 August 2014 were utterly devastating, and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences will continue to be felt by Palestinians across the Gaza Strip for some 
</b></p>
<p><b>time to come. These events were unprecedented, but tragically not unfamiliar, 
</b></p>
<p><b>occurring against a backdrop of ongoing violations of international human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law across the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The violations and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence only sow the seeds for further breaches, more loss of life, and ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>instability in the region. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Effective accountability is a key means to break the cycle of violence, human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violations and impunity. Today, as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to try to 
</b></p>
<p><b>rebuild their broken lives, they battle with the fear that similar escalations will again 
</b></p>
<p><b>erupt, and that Gaza will again be devastated as has happened repeatedly in recent 
</b></p>
<p><b>years. On their side, Israelis too will continue to live in fear of attacks. Meanwhile, 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continue to drive the conflict, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with wider implications for peace and security in the region. This protracted conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b>is at a critical juncture, with recent heightened tensions emphasising the imperative 
</b></p>
<p><b>for an end to the ongoing and recurrent human rights violations by all parties and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the prolonged occupation, as well as the full realisation of the right to self-
</b></p>
<p><b>determination.
