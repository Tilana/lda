<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>Mission to Honduras (18&#8211;22 February 2013</b>)*  
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination visited Honduras 
from 18 to 22 February 2013 at the invitation of the Government. In accordance with its 
mandate (Human Rights Council resolutions 7/21, 15/12 and 21/8), the Working Group 
gathered information on mercenaries and mercenary-related activities, as well as on the 
effects of activities of private military and security companies on the enjoyment of human 
rights. It also discussed with the authorities the progress on the implementation of its 
recommendations made after the Working Group&#8217;s previous visit to Honduras in 2006.   
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes a number of positive developments since its last visit, 
such as the accession of Honduras in 2008 to the International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries and its adoption of the Organic 
Law of the National Police (the Law) and the Regulations for the Control of Private 
Security Services (the Regulations) in the efforts to regulate and monitor activities of 
private security companies (PSCs) at a national level. 
 However, the Working Group regrets that the domestic law has not been amended to 
define and prohibit mercenaries, despite the accession to the Convention in 2008. As far as 
activities of PSCs are concerned, the Working Group found that there had been little

</p>
<p>progress in regulating and monitoring the activities of PSCs and many of its 
recommendations still remain to be implemented. Regrettably, PSCs in Honduras are still 
powerful entities operating beyond the State&#8217;s control and the Government faces significant 
legal, structural and institutional challenges in exercising effective oversight over PSCs. 
The existing legal and regulatory framework falls short of international standards and its 
implementation is hampered by the lack of institutional capacity of the authorities 
responsible for regulating PSCs.  These shortcomings, coupled with the prevailing violence 
and insecurity in the country and the lack of guarantee of security by the State, produce an 
environment in which PSCs have grown exponentially and have gained power in the 
security sector and have acted in some situations with impunity. The unprecedented level of 
crimes and violence in the country has added to the confusion of roles and functions 
between PSCs and the security forces of the State, where these companies operate often in 
concert with or with knowledge of the police and the military.  This has not been 
adequately addressed by the State and there is a critical need for immediate legal and 
institutional reforms to fight this culture of impunity.   
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommended, inter alia, amending the Law and the 
Regulations to strengthen the criteria for granting a licence to PMSCs; allocating resources 
to the Ministry of Security and building the institutional capacity to properly administer the 
licensing and registration processes for PMSCs and to monitor their activities;  enhancing 
the capacity of the police and public prosecutors, particularly at the regional level, to 
properly investigate and prosecute crimes committed by private security guards and to 
ensure that victims receive effective remedies; and including a definition of &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; 
in domestic legislation and amending the Penal Code to include a definition of &#8220;mercenary&#8221; 
and specifically prohibit their activities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination visited Honduras 
from 18 to 22 February 2013 at the invitation of the Government of Honduras. In 
accordance with its general practice, the Working Group was represented by two of its 
members, Patricia Arias and Elzbieta Karska, on this occasion.  
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/2 and Human Rights 
Council resolution 15/12, the Working Group is called upon to monitor mercenaries and 
mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations in different parts of the 
world, as well as to study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military 
assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment 
of human rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, a private military and/or security company (PMSC) is to be 
understood as a corporate entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or 
security services by physical persons and/or legal entities. Military services include 
specialized services related to military actions including strategic planning, intelligence, 
investigation, land, sea or air reconnaissance, flight operations of any type, manned or 
unmanned, satellite surveillance, any kind of knowledge transfer with military applications, 
material and technical support to Armed Forces and other related activities. Security 
services include armed guarding or protection of buildings, installations, property and 
people, any kind of knowledge transfer with security and policing applications, 
development and implementation of informational security measures and other related 
activities.1  
</p>
<p>4. During the five-day visit, the Working Group visited Tegucigalpa and San Pedro 
Sula. Owing to the security constraints, the Working Group was unable to visit the Bajo 
Agu&#225;n region in the Department of Col&#243;n. In Tegucigalpa, the Working Group met the 
Vice-President, Mar&#237;a Antonieta de Bogr&#225;n, and held meetings with representatives of the 
Ministries of External Relations, Internal Affairs, Justice and Human Rights, Defence and 
Public Security, as well as members of the National Congress, prosecutors of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the National Commissioner for Human Rights. In San Pedro Sula, 
the Working Group met the Mayor, Juan Carlos Z&#250;niga, the Governor of the Department of 
Cort&#233;s, Gabriel Garc&#237;a Ard&#243;n, and the Police Commissioner. In addition to government 
officials, the Working Group met representatives of civil society organizations, the 
diplomatic community and international organizations, as well as private companies, 
including private security companies (PSCs) in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.   
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>5. Honduras has ratified all of the key international human rights instruments, 
including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See the draft of a possible Convention on Private Military and Security Companies, A/HRC/15/25, 
</p>
<p>annex, art. 2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Disappearance, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities.   
</p>
<p>6. Honduras underwent the universal periodic review in 2010 and made a number of 
voluntary pledges and commitments. It is relevant for the purpose of the present report that 
Honduras committed to &#8220;increasing the efforts of the State to improve conditions for citizen 
security, considering as priority elements attention to victims of violence and crime, arms 
control, the professionalization and modernization of the national police and armed forces, 
and making accountable all authorities responsible for the implementation of the policy and 
strategy on citizen security&#8221; (A/HRC/16/10, para. 85 (e)). 
</p><p>7. With respect to the issue of mercenaries, Honduras acceded to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries 
(Convention on Mercenaries) in 2008. Honduras is also a State Party to the Protocol 
Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of 
victims of international armed conflicts (Additional Protocol I), which defines mercenaries 
and provides that they are not to be granted the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Follow-up on recommendations of the Working Group 
following its first visit in 2006 
</b>8. The Working Group conducted its first visit to Honduras in 2006 (see 
A/HRC/4/42/Add.1) and examined the legal and institutional framework aimed at 
regulating activities of PMSCs in Honduras. The Working Group also gathered information 
about Your Solutions Honduras SRL, a Honduran PSC, which allegedly recruited and 
trained Hondurans and Chileans between July and October 2005 and sent them to Iraq to 
work as security guards to protect fixed facilities of the United States army. The Working 
Group expressed concerns about the lack of control over and monitoring of activities of 
PMSCs by the Government and the de facto exporting of private security services to other 
countries. The Working Group made a number of recommendations, including: acceding to 
the Convention on Mercenaries and amending the relevant article of the Criminal Code 
accordingly to reflect the objectives of the Convention; strengthening the implementation 
and enforcement of the existing laws and regulations applicable to PMSCs; ensuring the 
certification of services provided by PMSCs and the training of their agents; vetting of 
directors, shareholders, executives and all personnel of PMSCs; establishing an authority 
over the Ministry of Security to monitor the activities of PMSCs and to receive complaints; 
and prohibiting the export of private military or security services to other countries.   
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group discussed with various government officials the progress on the 
implementation of these recommendations. The Working Group positively noted that 
Honduras acceded to the Convention on Mercenaries on 1 April 2008, which is an 
encouraging sign of its commitment and political will to address this issue. In parallel, the 
Government has strengthened its legal and regulatory framework for exercising oversight 
over PSCs, as demonstrated by the adoption in 2008 of the Organic Law of the National 
Police (the Law) and its Regulations for the Control of Private Security Services (the 
Regulations).  Furthermore, the authorities closely followed the case of Your Solutions 
Honduras SRL and the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office investigated and prosecuted the company&#8217;s directors as well as government officials 
in November 2007 in connection with this matter. The charges were ultimately dismissed 
and the company&#8217;s activities have been suspended, according to information provided by 
the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>10. While noting these developments, the Working Group regrets that they have not 
been reflected in the supervision and effective control of PSCs and that many of its 
recommendations still remain to be implemented. As will be discussed in detail below, 
PSCs still largely operate without the necessary control and oversight by the State, as 
implementation of the existing laws and regulations remains weak and they do not impose 
specific requirements with respect to the vetting and training of security personnel, the use 
of force and firearms, and the adoption and implementation of internal policies relating to 
human rights and internal accountability mechanisms. The Ministry of Security also 
continues to suffer from a limited institutional capacity to administer the licensing and 
registration processes and to monitor activities of PSCs. Furthermore, as the Working 
Group found in 2006, many PSCs are owned by former high-ranking military or police 
officers, who exercise significant powers and influence in the security sector. The loose 
control over PSCs has unfortunately become the norm rather than the anomaly in the 
country and the Working Group regrets that conditions for citizen safety have not 
improved, or may even have worsened.   
</p>
<p>11. Furthermore, while noting the precedence of international treaties over Honduran 
law, the Working Group was concerned that Honduras has not yet included a definition of 
&#8220;mercenarism&#8221; in its legal framework following its accession to the Convention on 
Mercenaries in 2008. The existing Penal Code does not provide for a definition of 
&#8220;mercenary&#8221; or prohibit the recruitment, use, financing or training of mercenaries as 
required by the Convention. The Working Group encouraged the National Congress to do 
so during a meeting with three of its representatives.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Private security companies operating in Honduras  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context  
</b></p>
<p>12. A number of countries in Central America have suffered from high levels of 
violence and Honduras is one of the countries most affected. The increase in violence has 
reached an unprecedented level over the last several years in Honduras, particularly after 
the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in June 2009. The Honduran murder rate of 92 per 100,000 was the highest 
in the world in 2011 and has more than doubled since 2005. In addition, organized crime 
and drug trafficking reportedly rose sharply after the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in the context of the lack 
of effective law enforcement.     
</p>
<p>13. In the absence of a guarantee of security by the State, the civilian population in 
Honduras commonly possess and carry weapons and firearms to protect themselves and this 
is legally permitted.  Pursuant to the Act on Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives 
and Other Related Instruments, every person may apply for a licence to possess and carry 
up to five firearms. In addition, there is reportedly a wide circulation of illegal firearms 
smuggled from the military armoury and other sources. The extremely widespread 
possession of firearms undoubtedly contributes to the high crime rate and according to the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), 82 per cent of the homicides 
committed in Honduras in 2010 involved the use of a firearm.  
</p>
<p>14. Security has thus become a commodity in high demand in Honduras and this has led 
to the exponential growth of the private security sector. Today PSCs dominate and control 
the security sector in Honduras. According to the Ministry of Security, there are 706 
registered PSCs and 14,787 private security guards known to work for these companies in 
Honduras. This figure is already greater than the estimated number of police officers in the 
country, which is 14,000 at most. In addition to the registered PSCs and their guards, there 
are reportedly tens of thousands of unregistered and illegal security guards. According to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the National Police, the number of such private security guards is estimated at 60,000. This 
makes the ratio of private security personnel to police almost 5 to 1, rendering the authority 
of the police force minuscule compared to the power and the de facto authority of PSCs. 
Furthermore, many of the PSCs are reportedly owned by or have close connections with 
former high-ranking military or police officers, or even active officers in some cases, 
although the National Police and the Ministry of Defence maintain that no active officers 
own or work for PMSCs. To that extent, the PSCs in Honduras are undoubtedly powerful 
entities with significant leverage and there are significant challenges in ensuring that their 
activities are kept within the four corners of the law.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Types of private security companies operating in Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to the Ministry of Security, there are 706 registered PSCs in Honduras, 
which include 402 for-profit companies providing security services to third parties and 303 
so-called &#8220;non-profit&#8221; companies providing security services to their owners.  There is only 
one company which is registered and authorized by the Ministry of Security to provide 
training in security services. Maya Security, based in San Pedro Sula, set up the SWAT 
Academy, which reportedly provides training in security services through its professional 
foreign trainers, including those from Colombia and Panama. The size of the registered 
PSCs varies significantly, ranging from a company with two security guards to one with 
755 security guards. 
</p>
<p>16. Given the high crime rate, PSCs are used in various contexts by a wide range of 
actors, including public establishments such as hospitals, schools and universities, 
international organizations, private companies and individuals. In particular, PSCs are 
commonly recruited to protect properties belonging to private companies. For example, 
Dinant Corporation, an agricultural company specializing in palm oil production in the Bajo 
Agu&#225;n region, hires 62 security guards from Orion, a registered PSC reportedly established 
upon request by Chiquita Brands International to provide security services in the Bajo 
Agu&#225;n region, and 42 security guards of its own to guard its eight plantation sites, which 
are allegedly often trespassed upon by armed peasants in the area. 
</p>
<p>17. While the Working Group did not receive statistics on the nationality of PSC 
personnel, it appears that the majority of them are Honduran. The regulations require that 
managers and security personnel of PSCs must be Honduran nationals, and that foreign 
companies seeking to provide private security services in Honduras must have a partnership 
with a Honduran company providing similar services. However, the Working Group 
received information that foreign nationals work as security guards and that Colombians in 
particular have been identified among such foreign security guards in a number of cases.   
</p>
<p>18. In addition to the registered PSCs, there are said to be numerous unregistered and 
illegal security-service providers, who operate without any oversight by the State and are 
often equipped with military weapons and firearms. Concerns for safety have also led to the 
rise of community security guards and vigilante groups in enclosed neighbourhoods and 
residential developments, which are often referred to as &#8220;safe neighbourhoods&#8221;. These 
security guards are reportedly not well-educated or professionally trained as security 
guards, and not registered or controlled by the Ministry of Security. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. Regarding the mercenaries, as noted above in paragraph 11, the existing laws in 
Honduras do not yet define mercenaries or prohibit activities relating to mercenaries. It may 
be relevant to note, however, that article 317 of the Criminal Code prohibits recruitment of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>troops in Honduras for the service of a foreign nation, as well as the use of the national 
territory to invade or harass another nation. These offences are punishable by imprisonment 
ranging from three to six years. 
</p>
<p>20. PSCs are regulated by the Police Organic Law and the Regulations; title IV, chapter 
VI, of the law specifically addresses private security services. In accordance with article 
135, the Ministry of Security is responsible for the authorization, regulation and supervision 
of PSCs. Article 138 of the Law further establishes the Control Unit for Private Security 
Services, situated within the National Directorate of Preventative Services of the National 
Police (Direcci&#243;n nacional de servicios especiales preventivos). The unit is entrusted with 
the control and monitoring of PSCs, including controlling the types of weapons in their 
possession. It is extremely understaffed and has very little capacity to monitor the activities 
of PMSCs or their compliance with the Law and the Regulations. The unit is currently 
composed of only four staff at the national level to oversee 706 registered PSCs with 
14,787 private security guards, a task clearly beyond its capacity. 
</p>
<p>21. The registered PSCs are authorized to provide security services as prescribed in 
articles 136 and 139 of the Law and in the Regulations, which include protection of 
property, premises, facilities, fields or crops; protection during the organization of events, 
contests or conventions; protection of persons; transportation and distribution, custody or 
escort of goods or products; private investigation services, safety training, and other related 
services.   
</p>
<p>22. During its visit, however, the Working Group received information that some PSCs 
are performing functions inherent to the law enforcement authorities, such as investigation 
of crimes, arresting and detaining individuals suspected of crimes, controlling 
demonstrations and executing eviction orders, thereby stepping outside the scope of 
permissible activities prescribed in the Regulations. For example, International Security 
Systems, a PSC based in San Pedro Sula, publicly advertises investigation of crimes as one 
of its services. As discussed below in paragraphs 37 and 38, some PSCs in the Bajo Agu&#225;n 
region also allegedly conduct joint operations with the police and the military in arresting 
and detaining individuals and executing eviction orders, which has serious implications for 
the enjoyment of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Licensing process 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to article 10 of the Regulations, private security service providers with 
more than two security guards must be registered with the Control Unit for Private Security 
Services. PSCs must hold licences to provide services and unlicensed providers are subject 
to sanctions under article 299, No. 3, of the Penal Code.  According to article 138 of the 
Law, the Control Unit for Private Security Services provides an opinion to the National 
Police on the granting of licences to private security providers. No licence will be delivered 
to natural or legal persons who have criminal records, nor to any firm that has active 
members of the Armed Forces or the National Police among its partners. Officials of the 
National Police dismissed for serious misconduct or offences will not be able to own or 
form part of a security company.  
</p>
<p>24. Article 138 of the Law provides that to be granted a licence foreign PSCs are 
required to enter into a partnership with a Honduran company providing similar services. 
They are also required to appoint as manager a Honduran national by birth duly qualified in 
the field of security services. The article further provides that the security personnel 
working for these companies are required to be Honduran nationals. Article 154 of the Law 
prohibits PSCs from employing a number of guards that exceeds 6 per cent of the total 
National Police forces.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>25. Licences to PSCs are granted for a two-year period and are renewed subject to 
compliance with provisions of the Law and Regulations and payment of fees in accordance 
with article 144. In accordance with article 146 of the Law, natural and legal persons are 
authorized to provide for their own private security subject to the issuance of a licence by 
the Control Unit for Private Security Services and the payment of a fee equivalent to that of 
a PSC. Article 148 of the Law provides that individual guards and community groups 
entrusted with the security of neighbourhoods, residential areas and homesteads should 
register free of charge with the Control Unit for Private Security Services and will be 
granted a special authorization.   
</p>
<p>26. Licences may be revoked and renewal may be refused whenever the private security 
service provider fails to fulfil the obligations imposed by the Law and the Regulations.  
Article 50 of the Regulations sets out a range of obligations on the part of PSCs, including 
conducting anti-doping and psychometric tests that are determined by the Ministry of 
Security on an annual basis, and ensuring that their security personnel wear distinctive 
uniforms with their names, photo and identification document, approved by the Control 
Unit for Private Security Services, to differentiate them from State entities. Article 50 also 
obliges PSCs to report to the Control Unit for Private Security Services on a number of 
matters. Pursuant to article 50 (h) of the Regulations, PSCs are required to keep an 
inventory of weapons and ammunition, transportation and communication equipment, and a 
customer list, and to report any changes to this inventory to the Control Unit for Private 
Security Services on a monthly basis. These reports must also include the updated staff 
payroll and any modifications thereto. Article 50 (s) of the Regulations further provides that 
where companies with authorization to sell, exchange, transfer or donate weapons (or 
engage in other transactions) engage in such transactions, they must inform the Ministry of 
Security within 30 days of the transactions.   
</p>
<p>27. Article 39 of the Regulations requires PSCs to use only the authorized and duly 
registered weapons and prohibits the use of weapons reserved for the exclusive use of the 
National Police or Armed Forces. Article 7 of the Act on Control of Firearms, Ammunition, 
Explosives and Other Related Instruments specifies the weapons that PSCs are permitted to 
use, including handguns or sidearms of certain calibres.   
</p>
<p>28. The use of weapons and firearms in breach of the Regulations amounts to offences 
of various degrees.  According to article 46 of the Regulations, providing services without 
carrying a weapons permit or with weapons in disrepair, weapons without ammunition or 
prohibited weapons, makeshift weapons or imitations, amounts to a misdemeanour.  
Furthermore, according to article 47 of the Regulations, &#8220;serious&#8221; offences include:  
</p>
<p>(a) Exchanging weapons between companies or allowing staff to provide these 
without proper authorization;  
</p>
<p>(b) Possessing weapons and ammunitions which are not included in the 
inventory;  
</p>
<p>(c) Selling or exchanging weapons, ammunitions, armoured equipment and 
communication equipment with similar companies or individuals without proper 
authorization by the Ministry of Security.    
</p>
<p>29. In the light of an increase in incidents of shooting by unidentified individuals on 
motorcycles, article 63 of the Regulations prohibits the carrying of weapons by security 
providers on motorcycles without the company&#8217;s logo and  not wearing the uniform 
accredited by the Ministry of Security. In this connection, it is also relevant to note that the 
National Congress enacted a new law on 1 August 2012 banning the carrying of weapons in 
public in the Department of Col&#243;n, which includes the Bajo Agu&#225;n region. This law, 
however, does not apply to the police, the military and private security guards.     </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>30. While acknowledging the adoption of these regulatory measures, the Working 
Group regrets that these do not address some crucial elements in effectively regulating the 
activities of PMSCs. The Law and the Regulations do not impose sufficiently rigorous 
requirements with respect to the vetting of security personnel and the only types of 
individuals vetted from PSCs are those with criminal records, active members of the police 
or the military, and former police officers who have been dismissed for serious misconduct 
or offences. Notably, they do not call on PSCs to scrutinize other background information 
about their prospective security personnel, such as their prior employment records, or to 
verify that they are sufficiently trained to respect national laws and international 
humanitarian and human rights law. The lack of scrutiny of the backgrounds of prospective 
security personnel is a concern, particularly in the light of the lack of an accountability 
mechanism for private security guards implicated in human rights abuses, as discussed 
below in paragraphs 46 to 51. Furthermore, the criteria for granting a licence to PSCs as 
prescribed in the Laws and the Regulations do not require that PSCs have internal policies 
and regulations relating to human rights law, especially on the use of force and firearms, or 
on internal accountability mechanisms. With respect to the use of force and firearms, while 
the Law and the Regulations do specify which type of weapons and firearms may be used 
by PSCs, they are silent on the circumstances and the manner in which they may be used by 
private security guards. The Working Group is concerned that, while the adoption of the 
Law and the Regulations is a positive step in paving the way for regulating and monitoring 
the activities of PSCs, the Law and Regulations fall short of the existing international 
standards and in practice these gaps allow PSCs to continue operating in a vacuum.  
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group also regrets that the basic regulatory framework established by 
the Law and the Regulations does not seem to be effectively implemented in practice and 
violations of the Law and the Regulations do not seem to incur any legal consequences, 
such as the revocation of licences or sanctions. For instance, as discussed in paragraphs 38 
and 39 below, the Working Group heard many reports that PSCs possess and use weapons 
and firearms reserved for military use, such as the AK47.        
</p>
<p><b> E. Training 
</b></p>
<p>32. According to the Regulations, PSCs have an obligation to train their personnel, but 
there is no instruction on the content or the minimum number of hours of training private 
security personnel must complete. Although article 2 of the Regulations states that private 
security personnel &#8220;shall act with strict respect for human rights, maintaining proper 
treatment of people and avoiding abuses, arbitrariness and violence&#8221;, the Law and the 
Regulations do not specifically require PSCs to train their personnel to respect international 
humanitarian law and human rights law or rules on the use of force and weapons.    
</p>
<p>33. Article 8 of the Regulations establishes that natural or legal persons who are granted 
a licence to provide security training will be supervised by the Control Unit for Private 
Security Services with the assistance of the Honduran National Police. The Ministry of 
Security, through the police educational system, may train private security personnel with a 
view to certifying that the companies&#8217; training programmes strictly comply with national 
security. The Law prohibits the training of these security providers for the purpose of 
providing services abroad, a serious offence punishable by law.  
</p>
<p>34. In order to be granted a licence to deliver security training, PSCs must provide the 
list of staff who will be responsible for developing the training modules. This list must be 
certified by the police educational system at the request of the Ministry of Security. Of the 
706 registered PSCs in Honduras, there is only one company providing security training, as 
indicated in paragraph 15. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Working Group notes with concern that the Law and the Regulations merely 
provide for this broad institutional framework for training of PSC personnel and fail to spell 
out any specific guidance on the content of the training and selection processes for PMSC 
personnel. If the Law and the Regulations are to ensure that private security personnel 
respect human rights and refrain from the arbitrary use of force, it is imperative that they 
make training on these matters mandatory as a condition of granting and renewing a licence 
for PSCs and should establish rigorous criteria for the selection of PSC personnel.         
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights impact 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impact of private security companies&#8217; activities on the local population 
</b></p>
<p>36. During its visit the Working Group discussed the human rights situation in the Bajo 
Agu&#225;n region extensively with the Honduran authorities, civil society organizations and the 
private sector, including PSCs. The region is composed of a number of Departments located 
in the north of the country, including the Department of Col&#243;n on the coast of the 
Caribbean Sea. There has been a long-standing land dispute between peasants and 
entrepreneurs in the region, originating in the agrarian reform in the 1970s, which 
distributed land to peasants in order to promote migration to the less populous Bajo Agu&#225;n 
region. The agrarian reform was subsequently modified in 1992, allowing the peasants to 
sell their land acquired through the previous land reform to third parties.  The entrepreneurs 
in palm oil production seized the opportunity and acquired a significant percentage of the 
land, resulting in a high concentration of land in their hands, particularly of three of the 
entrepreneurs. The validity of those land sales is refuted by the peasants today on the basis 
that the entrepreneurs would have resorted to multiple forms of illegal means to force the 
sales and this dispute over the land ownership continues to fuel the conflict between the 
peasants and the entrepreneurs in the region. In July 2011, the current President of the 
Republic, Porfirio Lobo, signed the first agreements with the peasants of the Bajo Agu&#225;n 
region for the distribution of lands among them with long-term payment schemes. In the 
context of these agreements, a few of the main entrepreneurs and landowners agreed to sell 
a high number of hectares to the Government. On the other hand, the peasants have 
apparently withdrawn from their farms which they were occupying to concentrate 
themselves in a few, hoping that they would be granted those lands as indicated in the 
agreements, which did not happen.  The lack of security caused by the conflict, coupled 
with  the geographical location of the Bajo Agu&#225;n region with access to the Caribbean Sea 
and Guatemala through formal and informal border crossing points, reportedly perpetuates 
the high level of drug trafficking and organized crime in the region. The authorities have 
increasingly militarized the region in recent years in their effort to regain control of the 
region.              
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group heard contradictory information on the alleged role of PSCs, 
landowners and the State in the ongoing land dispute between peasants and landowners. 
According to information provided by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 46 
persons were killed in Bajo Agu&#225;n between 2010 and 2011 and 18 in 2012. The Honduran 
authorities have explained that the level of violence related to the land conflict &#8211; apparently 
aggravated by the ongoing drug and arms smuggling as well as trafficking in persons in this 
area &#8211; has led the Government to deploy a joint armed operation in Bajo Ag&#250;an composed 
of both police and military forces and referred to as the Xatruch III Task Force. According 
to the authorities, they face significant challenges in guaranteeing security in the Bajo 
Agu&#225;n region owing to the land conflict and the high level of drug trafficking and 
organized crime, which are intertwined and require a military operation.        </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Civil society organizations with which the Working Group has met also spoke of 
serious human rights violations allegedly committed by the police, the military and private 
security guards hired by landowners to protect African Palm plantations, the ownership of 
which is disputed. According to information provided by civil society organizations, the 
number of persons killed in Bajo Agu&#225;n between 2010 and March 2013 has reached 89.  
The Working Group was profoundly disturbed at the alleged involvement of private 
security guards in the killing, disappearance, forced eviction and even sexual violence to 
which peasants have been subjected in Bajo Agu&#225;n, often acting in concert with the police 
and the military. According to representatives of civil society organizations, private security 
guards hired by landowners carry prohibited weapons such as AK47s to threaten and kill 
peasants, a report denied by the representatives of the PSC Orion, which is most referred to 
in these complaints. This was also denied by representatives of Dinant Corporation, which 
has contracted Orion.   
</p>
<p>39. For instance, the Working Group heard reports that, on 15 November 2010, Orion 
security guards hired by Dinant Corporation shot at peasants occupying El Tumbador farm, 
resulting in the death of five peasants. Eyewitness described to the Working Group how the 
Orion security guards, who were identified by their blue uniforms, were carrying prohibited 
weapons such as AK47s and M60s, which they fired in their attempt to expel the peasants 
from the farm. Members of the 15th Battalion were seen with Orion security guards at the 
site and some of them reportedly took off their military uniforms and changed into Orion 
uniforms before the shooting began. In another case, a peasant disappeared on 2 July 2012 
from his garden and his body was later found on the Panama farm controlled by the owner 
of Dinant Corporation, who is one of the most important landowners in Honduras. 
According to the peasants, the Panama farm is strictly controlled by Orion security guards 
and no peasants are able to enter the farm, which led to an inference that Orion security 
guards may be implicated in his disappearance and death.                    
</p>
<p>40. The Honduran authorities have denied the participation of private security guards in 
the implementation of eviction orders or any joint operation with the police and the military 
aimed at removing peasants occupying the disputed land. This information contradicts 
abundant reports by peasant organizations and national and international non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). Both the Honduran authorities and the representative of the Orion 
PSC interviewed by the Working Group have indicated that private security guards 
themselves have fallen victim to human rights violations in the context of the land dispute. 
For instance, Orion informed the Working Group that 14 of its private security guards had 
been killed and 4 had disappeared between 2010 and 2012.   
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group was also alarmed at the assassination of Antonio Trejo, a 
human rights lawyer representing peasants associations in the context of the land dispute in 
Bajo Agu&#225;n, who was shot by unknown gunmen in September 2012. Civil society 
associations have shared their concern with the Working Group that Mr. Trejo may have 
been killed by private security guards. The Working Group expressed great concern during 
its visit in Honduras that the brother of Mr Trejo, Jos&#233; Trejo Cabrera, and Santos J&#225;cobo 
Cartagena, both members of peasant associations, were shot dead by unknown gunmen.  
</p>
<p>42. In addition to these cases in the Bajo Agu&#225;n region, the Working Group also heard 
reports that on 11 May 2012, 16 civilian men, women and children travelling aboard a boat 
on the Patuca River in Ah&#250;as were shot at by a military-type single rotor helicopter with a 
door-mounted machine gun resulting in the death of four persons, among whom were two 
women who, according to some reports, were pregnant, a child of 14 years and a young 
man of 21 years. It has been reported that the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration directly supervised and participated in the operation on 11 May 2012 and 
that all the helicopter pilots allegedly involved in the operation were either Guatemalan 
military or contractor pilots temporarily deployed to Honduras from Guatemala. Although </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>the Government informed the Working Group about the existence of a tripartite agreement 
between Honduras, the United States of America and Guatemala to combat drug trafficking 
in Honduras, it was not able to collect necessary information to clarify the country of origin 
of the helicopter or its pilots during the visit.  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, the Working Group discussed with the Honduran authorities and 
representatives of civil society the case of the Association for a More Just Society (ASJ) 
and the killing of its lawyer Dionisio D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, who was representing private security 
guards working for Delta Security Service and Seguridad T&#233;cnica de Honduras (SETECH) 
in labour disputes. The crime occurred in circumstances in which Mr. D&#237;az Garc&#237;a was 
making significant advances in labour rights cases on behalf of 12 security guards seeking 
compensation for labour rights violations, such as 72&#8211;96-hour work-weeks without 
overtime pay, when he was shot and killed on his way to court by two men on a motorcycle 
in December 2006. 
</p>
<p>44. The two suspects for the murder of the lawyer were a former SETECH security 
guard and an agent of the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation. They were 
convicted of the crime and sentenced by the Tegucigalpa Sentencing Court on 19 March 
</p><p>2009. On 15 May 2012, however, the Supreme Court of Justice acquitted the two men on 
the basis of &#8220;weak evidence&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression issued a joint allegation letter on 26 
August 2012, raising concerns about the fact that one of the three judges of the Criminal 
Chamber of the Supreme Court was a legal advisor of Delta Security Systems (a parent 
company of SETECH) and that the Supreme Court heavily relied on evidence provided by 
the defence witnesses, who were being investigated for possible perjury.   
45. During the visit, the Working Group voiced its concern to the Government of 
Honduras and members of the judiciary about the lack of investigation and prosecution in 
cases involving various complaints of serious human rights violations perpetrated by PSCs, 
leading to complete impunity as discussed below in paragraphs 46 to 51. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Accountability and compensation to victims 
</b></p>
<p>46. Despite the serious allegations of killings, torture, enforced disappearances, sexual 
and physical violence, acts of threats and intimidation committed by private security 
guards, the authorities have not taken adequate steps to hold the perpetrators accountable or 
to provide remedies to the victims. The Working Group received consistent and recurring 
reports that complaints submitted by the victims are not properly investigated and the 
defendants are not prosecuted, which has resulted in the loss of public confidence in the 
judicial system. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office acknowledged that in the Bajo Agu&#225;n 
region alone, 73 complaints mostly relating to killings of peasants and a few of private 
security guards and others have been filed and the perpetrators have not been apprehended, 
prosecuted or punished in these cases. While the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office stated that 66 
of those cases are currently under investigation, the information received from other 
sources indicates that there has been little or no progress in the investigation and 
prosecution of the offenders. The Working Group was informed, for instance, that no 
meaningful efforts have been made to investigate the killing of peasants on the Panama 
farm on 2 July 2012 and on El Tumbador farm on 15 November 2010, discussed in 
paragraph 39. In both cases, security guards working for Orion have been identified as 
suspects for the crimes and the perpetrators have not been prosecuted to date. There is 
&#8220;denunciation fatigue&#8221; on the part of the victims and their families and supporters, as filing 
complaints with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office does not result, in most cases, in any 
investigations or action. In many cases, the victims do not report crimes to the authorities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>owing to a fear of reprisals and a deep mistrust of the law enforcement authorities and the 
judicial system.     
</p><p>47. In this regard, the Working Group also notes with concern that the law enforcement 
authorities have not yet resolved two cases of murder that the Working Group addressed in 
their communications to the Government of 5 December 2006 and 31 October 2012 
respectively. The first case is the killing of the lawyer, Dionisio D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, discussed in 
paragraphs 43 and 44 above. The second case is the killing of Antonio Trejo, discussed in 
paragraph 41 above. In neither of these cases have the perpetrators of the crime yet been 
identified or prosecuted. The total lack of progress in investigations into these cases is a 
sign of the ineffectiveness of the judicial system and the persistent pattern of impunity in 
Honduras.     
</p>
<p>48. According to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the low level of prosecution of crimes 
is largely attributable to the lack of capacity of the National Police (National Directorate of 
Criminal Investigation), which is responsible for conducting initial investigations of crimes. 
The public prosecutors may only direct the investigative process once the police have 
conducted initial investigations and gathered sufficient evidence of the commission of the 
crimes. According to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, however, the National Police 
reportedly lacks the necessary skills, scientific knowledge, equipment and resources to 
carry out effective investigations, which in turn negatively affects the ability of public 
prosecutors to prosecute the offenders.  Moreover, as the alleged human rights violations on 
the part of private security guards occur in the context of joint operations involving the 
police and army forces in which these guards allegedly participated, the fact that the 
Criminal Investigation Unit is part of the National Police makes it difficult to make 
progress on these investigations.       
</p>
<p>49. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office also identified other obstacles to its ability to 
effectively prosecute crimes. Firstly, it said that, in the case of murder, victims&#8217; families are 
often reluctant to allow the police and prosecutors to remove the bodies and conduct 
autopsies. According to the information received from other sources, however, there are 
very few cases, if at all, in which the victims&#8217; families refused the authorities permission to 
remove the deceased and conduct an autopsy. Any refusal to do so would be based on their 
distrust in the police and the justice system and the fear that they might destroy the 
evidence or would not properly investigate the case. Secondly, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office also identified the lack of direct contact with the victims and witnesses as one of the 
factors impeding its ability to prosecute crimes.  They stated that NGOs often have access 
to the victims and witnesses before the authorities commence investigations and take 
evidence away with them. While the Working Group was unable to verify this claim, its 
plausibility needs to be carefully assessed in the light of the fact that there are effectively no 
NGOs based in the Bajo Agu&#225;n region at present. On the other hand, the representatives of 
civil society indicated that this statement is not accurate and does not correspond to the 
reality.    
</p>
<p>50. One factor which certainly does impact the effectiveness of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office is its limited capacity at a departmental level. According to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, there are only four investigators in the Tocoa office and another four in the Trujillo 
office in the Department of Col&#243;n. The number is hardly sufficient to deal with the 
numerous complaints of killings and crimes in the department.   
</p>
<p>51. It is relevant in this context to note that the Control Unit for Private Security 
Services of the Ministry of Security has no mandate or power to receive or investigate 
complaints relating to the conduct of private security personnel. Furthermore, in the 
absence of any requirements in the Law and the Regulations for PSCs to establish any 
internal accountability mechanisms, it is unlikely that many PSCs in Honduras have done 
so, although the Working Group was unable to verify this.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Working Group is concerned that given the lack of effective investigation, 
prosecution and adjudication of crimes through judicial or non-judicial avenues, the victims 
are left without any form of remedy. There is also no State-funded mechanism to ensure 
that the victims have access to remedies through non-judicial avenues, such as a statutory 
compensation scheme. None of the victims that the Working Group met during the visit 
was provided with compensation, material or medical assistance to help them recover from 
the violence and trauma that they had suffered. In some cases, the deceased victims&#8217; 
families have not been able even to recover the bodies of their loved ones, let alone receive 
compensation.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>53.<b> Since the last visit of the Working Group in 2006, the Government has made 
some progress in seeking to regulate activities of PSCs, as evidenced by its adoption of 
the Organic Law of the National Police and the Regulations for the Control of Private 
Security Services. However, the Government faces significant legal, structural and 
institutional challenges to ensuring effective oversight of PSCs. While the adoption of 
the Law and the Regulations is a positive step, the legal framework has serious gaps, 
particularly with regard to the training and vetting of security personnel, the rules on 
the use of force and firearms, the implementation of internal policies and 
accountability mechanisms, as well as a total absence of mechanisms to provide 
reparations to the victims.  Further, the implementation of the existing laws and 
regulations is hampered by the lack of institutional capacity of the authorities 
responsible for regulating PSCs, such as the Ministry of Security and the National 
Police. These shortcomings, coupled with the prevailing violence and insecurity in the 
country and the lack of guarantee of security by the State, breed an environment in 
which PSCs exercise de facto control in the security sector and act with complete 
impunity. The Working Group stresses that the right to security is an inherent human 
right of all and underpins the enjoyment of other human rights.   Outsourcing the use 
of force to PMSCs seriously undermines the rule of law and the effective functioning 
of a democratic State institution responsible for ensuring public safety in accordance 
with international human rights standards and national laws.  The unprecedented 
level of crime and violence committed by private security guards, often with consent 
or agreement with the police and the military, has not been adequately addressed by 
the State and there is a critical need for immediate legal and institutional reforms to 
fight this culture of impunity.   
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Working Group also regrets that the domestic legal framework has not 
been amended to define and prohibit mercenaries, despite the country&#8217;s accession to 
the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries in 2008. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> In the light of these observations, the Working Group recommends that the 
Government of Honduras:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Amend the Organic Law of the National Police and the Regulations for 
Control of Private Security Services in order to strengthen the criteria for granting a 
licence to PMSCs, particularly with respect to the vetting and training of personnel, 
the recruiting processes and related requirements, the implementation of internal 
policies relating to international human rights law, the use of force and firearms, and 
the requirement for internal accountability mechanisms. In this regard, the 
Government is encouraged to consult the existing international law and standards for 
the protection of human rights;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Allocate adequate resources to the Ministry of Security and strengthen 
its institutional capacity to properly administer the licensing and registration 
processes for PMSCs and exercise effective oversight over their activities. In this 
regard, the Government should consider creating a specialized body or organ 
responsible for regulating and controlling PMSCs, rather than a section within the 
Ministry of Security, to fulfil these functions;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Strengthen the implementation and enforcement of the existing law and 
regulations to ensure that all private security service providers are licensed and 
registered by the Ministry of Security and that their activities are properly monitored.  
The Ministry should strengthen its monitoring role through various means such as 
inspections, reporting, supervising on the ground, and punish private security service 
providers in violation of the law and regulations, such as those operating without a 
licence, providing services other than those prescribed in the regulations or possessing 
and using prohibited weapons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Amend the Act on Control of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and 
Other Related Instruments to reduce the number of firearms that can be legally 
possessed by civilians and limit the number of weapons which can be possessed and 
used by PMSCs. It is necessary that the law distinguishes between possession and 
carrying of weapons in order to effectively regulate both; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure effective control over the circulation of weapons and firearms 
and prevent the smuggling of arms through the armoury or other sources;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Enhance the capacity of the police and public prosecutors, particularly 
at the regional level, to properly investigate and prosecute crimes committed by 
private security guards and to ensure that victims receive effective remedies;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Provide adequate resources and training to the National Police, so that 
they may fulfil their inherent and essential functions to guarantee public security and 
the safety of the Honduran population. In this regard, the Working Group recalls the 
voluntary commitment of Honduras during the universal periodic review to 
increasing the efforts to improve conditions for citizen security, including 
professionalization and modernization of the National Police and Armed Forces;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Effectively enforce the prohibition of the involvement of active members 
of the police and the military in PMSCs and punish those who are found in violation 
of this prohibition;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Amend the Penal Code to include a definition of &#8220;mercenary&#8221; and 
specifically prohibit their activities in accordance with the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Collaborate more effectively with the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on cases relating to 
allegations of human rights violations by PMSCs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Actively participate in the open-ended intergovernmental working group 
to consider the possibility of elaborating an international regulatory framework on 
the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military and 
security companies.
