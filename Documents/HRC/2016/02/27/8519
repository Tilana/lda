<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-
country basis, summaries of reliable and credible allegations of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteur, and were transmitted to the Governments concerned. It also contains 
replies from Governments. This addendum does not illustrate the state of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world, but rather 
reflects the state of information brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in transmitting these allegations to 
Governments, he does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does 
he support the opinion and activities of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a 
non-derogable right, and every human being is legally and morally entitled to protection. 
When the Special Rapporteur receives reliable and credible information that gives grounds 
to fear that a person may be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment, he may 
transmit an urgent appeal to the Government concerned. The communications sent by the 
Special Rapporteur have a humanitarian and preventive purpose, and do not require the 
exhaustion of domestic remedies. Governments are requested to clarify the substance of the 
allegations, take steps to protect the person&#8217;s rights, and are urged to investigate the 
allegations and prosecute and impose appropriate sanctions on any persons guilty of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period 21 December 2009 to 1 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
sent a total of 203 communications, consisting of 66 letters of allegations of torture to 34 
Governments and 137 urgent appeals to 53 Governments on behalf of persons who might 
be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. Government responses received up to 30 
January 2011 have been included. The responses received after that date will be duly 
reflected in a future communications report. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the timely responses received from 
Governments to the letters and urgent appeals transmitted. He regrets that many 
Governments fail to respond, or do so selectively, and that responses to older cases remain 
outstanding in large part. 
</p>
<p>5. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been 
obliged to reduce considerably details of communications sent and received, with attention 
given to information relating specifically to allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. As a result, requests from Governments to publish 
their replies in their totality could not be acceded to. Moreover, attention is given to 
information in Government replies specifically relating to the allegations, particularly 
information on the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) What steps were taken to ascertain the veracity of the facts alleged? 
</p>
<p> (b) Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim? 
</p>
<p> (c) The details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical 
examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the case. 
</p>
<p> (d) Full details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken (e.g. penal, 
disciplinary or administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrator(s)). 
</p>
<p> (e) What compensation and rehabilitation have been provided to the victim or the 
family of the victim? </p>

<p>Aux cours des derni&#232;res semaines, de 
nombreuses femmes vivant seules et travaillant 
dans les bases p&#233;trolif&#232;res de Hassi-Messaoud 
auraient &#233;t&#233; l&#8217;objet d&#8217;agressions r&#233;guli&#232;res 
perp&#233;tr&#233;es durant la nuit.  Leurs maisons et 
appartements auraient &#233;t&#233; saccag&#233;s et pill&#233;s par 
des hommes arm&#233;s de gourdins, de haches, de 
couteaux, leurs t&#234;tes encagoul&#233;es ou m&#234;me, &#224; 
visages d&#233;couverts. Les informations re&#231;ues 
indiquent que, dans plusieurs cas, des policiers 
auraient refus&#233; d&#8217;enregistrer leurs plaintes et 
auraient eu une attitude teint&#233;e d&#8217;indiff&#233;rence &#224; 
leur &#233;gard. Des informations re&#231;ues indiquent 
aussi qu&#8217;une femme a &#233;t&#233; br&#251;l&#233;e vive et se 
trouve actuellement dans le coma &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital de 
Ouargla.  
</p>
<p>Les informations re&#231;ues indiquent que ces 
actes sont r&#233;currents et similaires aux 
&#233;v&#233;nements du 13 juillet 2001 quand plusieurs 
centaines d&#8217;hommes s&#8217;en sont pris violemment 
&#224; un groupe de 39 femmes qui auraient choisi 
de vivre seules apr&#232;s que l&#8217;imam de la 
mosqu&#233;e locale les aurait qualifi&#233;es de 
prostitu&#233;es. Ces hommes auraient soumis 
presque toutes ces femmes &#224; des violences 
physiques et sexuelles et pill&#233; leur logement. 
Seules 3 personnes parmi les accus&#233;s auraient 
r&#233;ellement purg&#233; leurs peines tandis que les 
autres auraient &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;s par contumace 
ou innocent&#233;s. Aucun n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; 
pour viol.

<p>groupe de gendarmes et de policiers auraient 
barr&#233; l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; la place Addis Abeba &#224; Alger, 
si&#232;ge de la Commission nationale consultative 
de promotion et de protection des droits de 
l&#8217;homme, dans le but d&#8217;emp&#234;cher des m&#232;res de 
WGEIDaru(e)s de se rassembler pacifiquement 
devant cette instance, comme elles le font tous 
les mercredis depuis le 2 ao&#251;t 1998. 
</p>
<p>Une semaine plus tard, le 11 ao&#251;t 2010, une 
quarantaine de m&#232;res de WGEIDaru(e)s et de 
sympathisants auraient tent&#233; de se r&#233;unir &#224; 
nouveau. Des policiers et gendarmes auraient 
alors fait usage de la force pour r&#233;primer cette 
manifestation. M. Slimane Hamitouche aurait 
&#233;t&#233; jet&#233; &#224; terre par plusieurs policiers et aurait 
re&#231;u de leur part des coups de poings &#224; la t&#234;te 
et des coups de pieds. Mme Nassera Dutour 
aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; frapp&#233;e par plusieurs 
policiers et souffrirait aujourd&#8217;hui de 
courbatures et d&#8217;h&#233;matomes sur les bras et les 
jambes. Me Amine Sidhoum, qui venait au 
secours de Mme Nassera Dutour, aurait &#233;t&#233; 
projet&#233;e &#224; terre avec force et rou&#233;e de coups. 
Mmes El Boathie et Lekhal auraient &#233;t&#233; 
train&#233;es par terre par leur foulard. Cette 
derni&#232;re, asthmatique et souffrant de probl&#232;mes 
de thyro&#239;de, se serait &#233;vanouie et aurait &#233;t&#233; 
transport&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital. M. Ferhati Hac&#232;ne se 
serait &#233;galement &#233;vanoui lors de cette 
r&#233;pression brutale et aurait eu de violents maux 
de t&#234;te le lendemain. D&#8217;autres avocats pr&#233;sents, 
ainsi que des militants de la Ligue alg&#233;rienne 
des droits de l&#8217;homme, auraient &#233;t&#233; bouscul&#233;s. 
Plusieurs personnes, dont un p&#232;re de 
WGEIDaru de 82 ans, auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenues 
pendant pr&#232;s d&#8217;une heure dans un camion o&#249; ils 
avaient des difficult&#233;s &#224; respirer du fait de la 
chaleur &#233;touffante. 
</p>
<p>Le 18 ao&#251;t 2010, une nouvelle tentative de 
rassemblement par un groupe de m&#232;res de 
</p>
<p>violences. Il s&#8217;agit des nomm&#233;s Melis Arab, 
Amine Kellou, Imad Boubekeri et Moh 
Slimane Hamitouche. Ce  dernier, qui a &#233;t&#233; 
&#233;galement interpell&#233; au cours des 
rassemblements des 4 et 18 ao&#251;t, pour son 
comportement  r&#233;calcitrant et hostile envers 
les agents de l&#8217;ordre public, n&#8217;a fait l&#8217;objet 
d&#8217;aucune violence, avant d&#8217;&#234;tre relax&#233; sur 
instruction de M. le Procureur de la 
R&#233;publique de c&#233;ans, pr&#233;alablement avis&#233; par 
les services de police. 
</p>
<p>Les services de la s&#251;ret&#233; n&#8217;ont, &#224; aucun 
moment, r&#233;prim&#233; les regroupements des 
m&#232;res des WGEIDarus. L&#8217;intervention des 
policiers qui ont particip&#233; aux services de 
l&#8217;ordre, s&#8217;est limit&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;application des 
moyens l&#233;gaux en leur qualit&#233; de force 
publique investie des missions de 
r&#233;tablissement d l&#8217;ordre dans la cadre de la loi 
en vigueur. Ils se sont acquitt&#233;s de leur travail 
avec une certaine fermet&#233;, mais en faisant 
preuve de beaucoup de doigt&#233; et de tact 
surtout &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard des femmes et des personnes 
&#226;g&#233;es. 
</p>
<p>Aussi, le fait de faire appel au personnel 
f&#233;minin et leurs &#233;quipes relevant des services 
de la s&#233;curit&#233; publique et non pas des 
&#233;l&#233;ments des unit&#233;s r&#233;publicaines de s&#233;curit&#233;, 
habituellement &#233;quip&#233;s de moyens 
d&#8217;intervention, d&#233;note la vigilance des 
services de la s&#251;ret&#233; et l&#8217;assouplissement des 
mesures d&#8217;intervention entreprises envers les 
protestataires, pr&#233;f&#233;rant la canalisation du 
groupe, que de recourir &#224; d&#8217;autres moyens, en 
raison de la maitrise de la situation au regard 
du nombre r&#233;duit de personnes. Le r&#233;sultat 
qu&#8217;il n&#8217;ait &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233; aucun d&#233;p&#244;t de 
plaintes ou d&#8217;&#233;vacuation en direction 
d&#8217;h&#244;pitaux en raison de l&#8217;absence de tout cas 
de blessure en t&#233;moigne. </p>

<p>3. Azerbaijan Follow-
up from 
earlier 
cases 
</p>
<p>  Mr. Novruzali Khanmamed oglu Mammadov 
(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 6) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 6/10/2009, the Government 
indicated that while serving his sentence, Mr. 
Mammadov enjoyed fully and without 
restriction the rights and freedoms set out in 
the legislation of Azerbaijan and in the 
international instruments to which it is a 
party. Given the great importance Azerbaijan </p>

<p>attaches to fulfilling the requirements of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and of other fundamental international 
instruments in this area, particularly those 
that uphold the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, and in view of Mr. 
Mammadov&#8217;s work as a scientist, he was held 
in appropriate conditions while serving his 
sentence in penitentiary institutions. 
</p>
<p>The investigation found that, in June 2008, 
Mr. Mammadov underwent a comprehensive 
medical examination on first entering prison, 
as is mandatory for all detainees in 
accordance with the relevant order of the 
Ministry of Justice. Instrumental, laboratory 
and X-ray tests, as well as a medical history, 
revealed that he was already suffering from 
several chronic illnesses prior to his arrest. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mammadov remained under medical 
observation for the duration of his sentence. 
He received outpatient and inpatient 
treatment under the constant supervision of 
the medical service and was offered 
consultations with a cardiologist, a surgeon, a 
neuropathologist and other specialists. He 
underwent all the necessary clinical, 
instrumental and laboratory tests including an 
electrocardiogram, ultrasound tests and so 
forth. 
</p>
<p>In order to ensure that Mr. Mammadov had 
access to specialized tests and hospital 
treatment, he was offered hospitalization on 
more than one occasion, but each time he 
declined in writing. In July 2009, Mr. 
Mammadov was again offered 
hospitalization, and this time he accepted; as 
is routine, he was transferred to the medical 
treatment facility of the penitentiary service 
of the Ministry of Justice. </p>

<p>Based on his medical complaints and history, 
the patient underwent clinical, laboratory and 
instrumental tests in the neurology 
department of the medical treatment facility. 
In order to provide more specialized medical 
care, make an accurate diagnosis and exclude 
any other illnesses, highly qualified doctors 
were brought in from the Ministry of Health, 
including some employed in Azerbaijan&#8217;s 
leading specialist clinics. Mr. Mammadov 
was examined by the most senior doctors 
with advanced research degrees in urology, 
cardiology, endocrinology, ophthalmology 
and internal medicine, and neurosurgery, and 
was treated in accordance with their 
prescriptions. 
</p>
<p>As stated in the appeal, Mr. Mammadov was 
diagnosed with a number of illnesses, but not 
those referred to in that document. The 
patient was diagnosed with osteochondrosis 
of the vertebrae of the neck and spine, 
arthritis and a small cyst in the right shoulder 
joint, chronic hypertension, residual signs of 
bronchitis, an enlarged prostate gland and 
slight visual impairment; a number of nodules 
were detected in the thyroid gland. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the detection of prostate 
cancer, which is mentioned in the appeal, it 
should be noted that a medical examination 
by an urologist did not reveal any oncological 
disease. Mr. Mammadov received appropriate 
treatment for his enlarged prostate at the 
initial stage and was under constant medical 
supervision. The cataract was also present at 
the initial stage, but surgery was not required, 
and the patient was given the necessary 
medication. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mammadov was already suffering from 
the aforementioned conditions prior to his 
arrest; they were of a chronic nature, but, </p>

<p>because they were still in the early stages, any 
adverse effects had gone unnoticed. His 
illnesses were not life-threatening and did not 
require bed rest, he was not advised by 
medical staff to restrict his physical activity, 
and he moved around without assistance; he 
complained chiefly of pain in his right 
shoulder, which showed signs of plexitis. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mammadov was given the treatment 
prescribed by the consultants and attending 
doctors, which included antihypertensive, 
anti-aggregant and thyrostatic drugs, 
analgesics, and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatories. With treatment, the patient&#8217;s 
condition stabilized, arterial pressure returned 
to normal, thyroid gland function improved, 
dieresis was restored, and shoulder pain was 
reduced significantly. 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2009 at around 3 p.m., Mr. 
Mammadov&#8217;s condition suddenly 
deteriorated. The patient WGEIDlayed 
symptoms of an acute brain infarct, notably, 
headaches, nausea, signs of acute tachycardia 
and arrhythmia, a sudden drop in blood 
pressure and a pulse discernible only at the 
main arteries. The symptoms of brain 
ischemia gradually became more pronounced 
prior to the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia. 
</p>
<p>In view of the seriousness of his condition 
and in order to save his life, Mr. Mammadov 
was given specialist emergency care, 
including by a top civilian resuscitation 
specialist from the cardiology research 
institute of the Ministry of Health, who was 
brought in specially. Unfortunately, despite 
intensive medical intervention, all attempts to 
save Mr. Mammadov failed. As a result of 
progressive cardiovascular failure, his heart 
stopped at approximately 6.10 p.m., and he </p>

<p>died. 
</p>
<p>All the clinical signs and forensic test results 
indicate that Mr. Mammadov died of an acute 
brain infarct. The cause of death was 
confirmed by a commission of experts 
appointed to verify objectively the 
circumstances surrounding the death. The 
commission of experts concluded that &#8220;the 
diagnosis given to Mr. Mammadov based on 
the results of clinical, laboratory and 
instrumental tests was correct, the treatment 
administered was adequate, prompt and 
consistent, and the death is not causally 
linked to the tests and treatment&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Following Mr. Mammadov&#8217;s sudden death, 
the procuratorial authorities and the 
appropriate departments of the Ministry 
conducted a thorough investigation, which 
confirmed the circumstances set out above. 
Based on the results of the investigation, the 
Office of the Public Prosecutor for the 
Nizaminsk district of Baku declined to 
institute criminal proceedings, as no offence 
had been committed. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mammadov&#8217;s close relatives filed a civil 
claim with the Nasiminsk court in Baku for 
compensation for moral harm on the grounds 
that his death had been caused by a lack of 
prompt medical treatment. A preliminary 
court hearing took place on 29 September 
2009, and the case is to be considered on 15 
October. 
</p>
<p>It should be noted that all prisoners in 
Azerbaijan receive appropriate medical 
attention and support, regardless of 
nationality, race or social class or the gravity 
of their crimes. The State strives constantly to 
bring the work of the penitentiary system into 
line with international standards. In recent </p>

<p>years, legislation has been refined and 
effective measures have been implemented to 
safeguard the rights of all prisoners. In order 
to create more humane detention conditions, 
the law now enshrines, for the first time, the 
right of prisoners to lodge complaints against 
decisions by the administration; prisoners&#8217; 
right to receive an education and 
psychological assistance has been expanded; 
censorship of correspondence has been 
abolished; the deductions from prisoners&#8217; 
wages have been reduced; the level of 
funding and the number of visits and 
telephone calls granted have been increased; 
and additional benefits for prisoners have 
been introduced. 
</p>
<p>As part of the modernization of the 
infrastructure of the penitentiary system, the 
funding allocated to the penitentiary service 
from the State budget has been increased 
several times over. Last year, a new mixed-
regime prison that meets modern standards 
was opened for use in the Autonomous 
Republic of Nax&#231;ivan, while 2009 saw the 
opening of the Baku Remand Centre, which 
meets the highest international human rights 
standards and provides all the necessary 
conditions for the detention of accused 
persons with respect for their honour and 
dignity. Similar facilities are currently being 
built in the regions, in order to provide 
prisoners with expert medical care, education, 
socially useful jobs, sporting activities, 
sufficient time outdoors, and so on. 
</p>
<p>Regular reports by authoritative international 
organizations such as the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have 
highlighted the marked improvement in 
medical care for prisoners. </p>

<p>In order to provide prisoners with medical 
care that meets current standards and ensure 
the independence of medical specialists, 
medical services have been separated from 
the penitentiary service and reorganized 
under a central medical authority set up 
within the Ministry of Justice. The two 
hospitals under the Ministry of Justice that 
provide medical care for prisoners are 
equipped with state-of-the-art medical 
equipment and sufficient supplies of 
medication. Prisoners therefore receive 
medical care of the highest quality. This was 
confirmed by the conclusions of the 
representative of the Public Affairs 
Committee responsible for oversight of 
penitentiary institutions, which comprises the 
country&#8217;s most prominent and independent 
human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>It should be stressed that every death that 
occurs in a penitentiary institution is regarded 
as a critical event requiring careful 
investigation by the central medical authority 
of the Ministry of Justice and civilian 
specialists in order to establish whether the 
correct medical treatment was administered.

aims to overthrow and change the political 
system of the country, dissolve the

acts, inciting hatred and contempt against the

political activists. 
</p>
<p>On 13 August 2010, Mr. Abduljalil Al Singace 
was reportedly arrested at Bahrain International 
Airport on his way back from the UK with his 
family, following his participation on 5 August 
in a seminar on the human rights situation in 
Bahrain held at the House of Lords, during 
which he denounced the alleged deterioration 
of the human rights and environmental 
situation in the country. During his stay in the 
UK, Mr. Al Singace took the opportunity to 
meet with a number of international human 
rights organizations. According to reports, Mr. 
Al Singace, who is disabled and requires the 
use of a wheelchair, was forcefully 
apprehended by the authorities. On the same 
day, a peaceful demonstration in solidarity took 
place in front of Mr. Al Singace&#8217;s house, and 
was violently repressed by security forces 
using tear-gas, sound bombs and rubber 
bullets. Several demonstrators were injured in 
the course of the operation. 
</p>
<p>On 15 August 2010, security forces raided Mr. 
Abdul Ghani Al Kanja&#8217;s home, arrested him 
and confiscated his computer and mobile 
phones. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that Messrs Al Singace and Al 
Kanja are accused of &#8220;forming an organized 
network aiming at weakening the security and 
the stability of the country&#8221; under the Anti-
Terrorism Law and the Criminal Code. 
According to Mr Al Singace&#8217;s lawyer who 
spoke to the Public Prosecution Office, case 
numbers are yet to be assigned and Mr. 
Abduljalil Al Singace will face charges of 
sedition and making unauthorised contact with 
foreign bodies. Both Messrs Al Singace and Al 
Kanja are reportedly denied access to their

country by recruiting youths and juveniles 
and inciting them to compose sabotage 
groups to commit acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, 
attacking security personnel, nationals and 
foreigners residing in Bahrain, terrorizing 
them and damaging their private properties. 
</p>
<p>All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant 
to Law No.58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist 
Acts. The suspects were arrested under this 
law and not under Bahrain&#8217;s Code of 
Criminal Procedure which provides that 
suspects must be brought before the Public 
Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest. 
According to Article 27 of Law No. 58 of 
2006, Judicial Officers are granted the right, 
subject to the emergence of sufficient 
evidence, to issue a protective custody order 
for a period not exceeding five days, and if 
necessary, permission may be obtained from 
the Public Prosecution to extend the custody 
to a period not exceeding 10 days. Such 
permission is strictly granted if the Judicial 
Officer provides sufficient evidence that the 
extension of the custody is essential for the 
continuation of the investigations. Following 
this period of 10 days, the suspects were duly 
referred to the Public Prosecution. 
</p>
<p>As a principal division of the judicial 
authority, the Public Prosecution have 
commenced and handled criminal 
proceedings. Working in its capacity as an 
investigation and indictment authority, and, 
following intensive investigations by 
prosecutors into the clandestine terror 
network, the eight suspects were laid with 12 
charges under the Penal Code No. 15 of 1976,

<p>security authorities; and 
</p>
<p>- Unlawfully using force and violence to 
compel a public servant to abstain from his

</p>
<p>It is clear that all charges are on terror crimes, 
use of force and instigation to it. In this 
regard, it should be mentioned that all 
guarantees relevant to the suspects&#8217; rights 
have been respected during the investigations. 
</p>
<p>In response to the information received by the 
Working Group with regard to the reasons for 
the suspects&#8217; arrest, the Government would 
like to emphasize that the arrests were based 
purely on security measures, and were not 
motivated by nor linked to their peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, but had 
been in the light of the existence of confirmed 
information, investigations and evidence that 
they are part of a structured network aimed at 
compromising national security and abusing 
the country&#8217;s stability. 
</p>
<p>The suspects, along with all citizens of 
Bahrain, preserve their right to work 
legitimately and peacefully in defence of 
human rights, as enshrined by the Declaration 
on Human Rights Defenders. They also 
preserve the right of freedom of expression 
and opinion, as enshrined in the Constitution 
of Bahrain which provides that everyone has 
the right to express his opinion and publish it 
by word of mouth or in writing under the 
rules and conditions laid down by law, 
provided that the fundamental beliefs of 
Islamic doctrine are not infringed, the unity of 
the people is not prejudiced, and discord or 
sectarianism is not aroused. Legal action is 
only exercised against those who deviate 
from the scope of the legitimate and peaceful 
work in the defence of human rights and </p>

</i></p>
<p>freedom of expression and recourse to the 
execution of acts amounting to the abuse of 
law.  
</p>
<p>Following the arrest of the eight suspects, 
they have all confessed that they were indeed 
involved in forming sabotage groups and 
instructed them to carry out rioting, arson, 
vandalism and attacking security men. 
Abduljalil Al-Singace confessed that he 
supported the groups financially to purchase 
necessary equipment and materials to 
undertake such sinful acts. He also admitted 
in details that he, along with the other seven 
suspects, incited openly and secretly to spread 
chaos in the country and to carry out sabotage 
acts, along with fund raising from citizens 
and businessmen under the guise of religion, 
charity and support for the families of 
prisoners and alleged martyrs and victims of 
torture.  
</p>
<p>Further, security authorities have arrested 
individuals who carried out arsons and rioting 
in varying incidents and in various areas, all 
of whom have confessed that Abduljalil Al-
Singace was their main supporter and inciter 
for those acts. 
</p>
<p>In relation to the Working Group&#8217;s concern 
regarding whether the acts shall be 
criminalised as terrorist, the first two 
conditions (means used and intent) put 
forward by the group will be demonstrated. 
Firstly, with respect to the means used. The 
sabotage groups have been committing acts of 
violence, rioting, vandalizing private and 
public properties, carrying out arsons, 
blocking highways and crippling all forms of 
life activities. These groups have added 
violence to their acts by using Molotov 
bombs, homemade bombs and sharpened iron 
bars. Molotov bombs are considered as </p>

<p><i>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</i></p>
<p>improvised incendiary weapons and are 
primarily intended to set targets ablaze and 
destroy them. In fact, two police were killed 
in two separate horrific attacks by Molotov 
bombs: a policeman, and an innocent 
Pakistani passer-by, father of five. 
</p>
<p>Secondly, concerning the intent behind the 
aforementioned attacks, it may be seen from 
these acts of violence that the sabotage 
groups are aiming at the destruction of public 
order. They intend to cause fear among the 
general population and they chose to 
undertake their terrorist acts at night to spread 
even greater terror in the hearts of the general 
public. Some of the suspects have confessed 
that this intent was present while inciting the 
sabotage groups to commit acts of destruction 
to public order. 
</p>
<p>Hence, having seen that the means used by 
the sabotage groups can be described as 
deadly and of serious violence against 
members of the general population; and, 
having regard that the intent is to cause fear 
among the population along with destructing 
public order, one may fairly deduce that the 
bold presence of these two conditions 
cumulatively fulfil these acts to be 
criminalised as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>Last but not least, elucidation shall duly be 
made on the allegations on the violent 
repression by security forces of the peaceful 
protest in front of Abduljalil Al-Singace&#8217;s 
house. Principally, the Government has taken 
all necessary steps to ensure the right of 
peaceful assembly. Acting in accordance with 
Article 21 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Government 
recognizes that no restrictions may be placed 
on this right other than those imposed 
inconformity with the law and which are </p>

</i></p>
<p>necessary in the interest of national security 
of public safety, public order or the protection 
of the rights and freedoms of others. In this 
connection, participants in the protest in front 
of Al-Singace&#8217;s house have resorted to 
violence for realization of the purpose for 
which they have assembled (release Al-
Singace), causing their peaceful 
demonstration to be deemed as a riot. 
Security forces have exercised their authority 
granted by Article 180 of the Penal Code and 
ordered the demonstrators to WGEIDerse. 
Should the order come to no avail, security 
forces shall be empowered to take the 
necessary measures for WGEIDersing those 
who have not complied with the order by 
arresting them and may use force within 
reasonable limits against any person resisting 
said order. They may not use firearms except 
in extreme necessity or when someone&#8217;s life 
is in danger. The demonstrators have 
continued rioting despite receiving orders 
from security forces to WGEIDerse. Having 
ignored such orders, and, having regard to the 
interest of public order, security forces were 
compelled to use force to confront and 
terminate the mounting violence and 
WGEIDerse the rioters. In this connection, 
security forces have exerted force in 
accordance with the provisions of the public 
security forces law. Namely, Article 13 has 
regulated the use of force in WGEIDersing 
demonstrators and rioters. Force is only 
exerted following the failure of non-violent 
means, warning of resorting to the use of 
force and being the only remaining means of 
separation. Along with resorting to force in 
order to obstruct an assault or resistance from 
demonstrators or rioters. 
</p>
<p>In this connection, mention shall be duly 
made that these rioters and protesters, who </p>

<p>were initially incited by the suspects, have 
been camouflaging their acts of violence by 
labelling them as human rights activism or 
peaceful demonstrations or protests. It goes 
without saying that committing acts of riot, 
violence and vandalism under the disguise of 
promoting and protecting human rights 
reflects nothing but a solid violation of 
Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights which stipulates that everyone 
has the right to life, liberty, and security of 
person. The Government of Bahrain is bound 
to protect individuals and groups against the 
abuse of these fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>The Government of Bahrain reaffirms its 
adherence to the provisions stipulated in the 
UN body of Principles for the Protection of 
all Persons under any form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of 
detention are treated in a humane manner 
with respect for their physical and 
psychological integrity and inherent dignity 
of the human person. Most notably, with 
regard to the disability of Abduljalil Al-
Singace, he has been provided with a 
wheelchair and is always assisted when 
walking. Any arrest, detention or 
imprisonment is only carried out strictly in 
accordance with the provisions of the law and 
by competent officials or persons authorized 
for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption 
of this Body of Principles would make an 
important contribution to the protection of 
human rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law 
any act contrary to the rights and duties 
contained therein. 
</p>
<p>It is also worth stressing that the recent 
arrests have no relation whatsoever with the 
parliamentary elections scheduled to take 
place on 23 October next. All suspects do not </p>

<p>recognize these elections. They never 
participated in them, and not only did they 
boycott the elections, but they called for a 
boycott ever since the re-birth of 
parliamentary elections in 2002. 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain 
reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that all suspects 
are not deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and 
are entitled in full equality to fair proceedings 
before an independent and impartial tribunal. 
Bahrain also reaffirms its respect to the 
observance of the purposes and principles of; 
inter alia, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. Bahrain 
recognizes the relation between peace and 
security and the enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, and is mindful 
that the absence of peace and security does 
not excuse non-compliance. Bahrain also 
acknowledges the important role of the 
Human Rights Council in the contribution to 
the effective elimination of all violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
peoples and individuals, and fully supports its 
efforts in promoting universal respect for 
human rights along with its determination to 
examine thoroughly all the cases brought to 
its attention

<p>Concerning the situation of Dr. Abduljalil Al

Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture, 
Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi, a Bahraini human right 
activist who has been living in the United

<p>By a letter dated 12/10/2010, the Government 
indicated that the situation regarding Dr. 
Abduljalil Al-Singace, Mr. Abdulghani Al-
Khanjar, Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi and Mr. 
Mohammed Saeed (hereinafter the suspects): 
</p>
<p>As mentioned in a previous correspondence, 
these suspects were arrested in the light of the 
existence of confirmed information, 
investigations and evidence that they are part 
of a structured terrorism network aimed at </p>

<p>and Mr. Mohammed Saeed, a board member of 
the non-Governmental organization Bahrain 
Centre for Human Rights.  The persons 
mentioned were all arrested between 13 and 17 
August 2010, and their whereabouts remain 
unknown.   
</p>
<p>The situation of the persons named above was 
the subject of a communication sent on 20 
August 2010, to your Government by the 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism; Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders; and 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, the 
persons mentioned above, Dr. Abduljalil Al 
Singace (arrested on 13 August), Mr. Abdul 
Ghani Al Kanja (arrested on 15 August), Mr. 
Jaffar Al-Hessabi (arrested on 16 August) and 
Mr. Mohammed Saeed (arrested on 17 August) 
are being held incommunicado in an 
undisclosed place of detention since the day of 
their arrest.   
</p>
<p>In this connection, reports have been received 
indicating that Dr. Abduljalil Alsingace has 
been subject to physical and psychological 
abuse as a result of which he almost lost his 
hearing ability and has injuries in his back and 
other parts of his body. According to the 
information received, on 27 August 2010, Dr. 
Abduljalil Alsingace appeared before the 
Public Prosecutor.  Dr. Abduljalil Alsingace 
has reportedly been kept in solitary 
confinement since his detention and his 
</p>
<p>compromising national security and abusing 
the country&#8217;s stability through terrorism and 
violence.  
</p>
<p>Investigations thus far have found the 
network to be responsible for inciting and 
planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and 
contempt against the Government, 
threatening public order and endangering the 
safety and security of the Kingdom. The aim 
of the network is to overthrow and change the 
political regime of the country, dissolve the 
constitution and obstruct the enforcement of 
its provisions. 
</p>
<p>The network has spread disorder in the 
country by recruiting youths and juveniles 
and inciting them compose sabotage groups 
to commit acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, 
attacking security personnel, nationals and 
foreigners residing in Bahrain, terrorizing 
them and damaging their private properties.  
</p>
<p>All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant 
to Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist 
Acts. This law grants Judicial Officers the 
right, subject to the emergence of sufficient 
evidence, to issue a proactive custody order 
for a period not exceeding five days. If 
necessary, permission may then be obtained 
from the Public Prosecution to extend the 
custody to a period not exceeding ten days. 
Such permission is strictly granted, and only 
if the Judicial Officer provides sufficient 
evidence that the extension of the custody is 
essential for the continuation of the 
investigations. Given the nature of their 
suspected crimes, the suspects were arrested 
under this Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist 
Acts, and not under Bahrain&#8217;s Code of </p>

<p>prescription glasses have been confiscated.  His 
wheelchair and crutches have been taken from 
him and thus he has been forced to pull himself 
in the cell with his arms. Dr. Alsingace 
depends almost completely on the wheelchair 
for his movement since he was diagnosed with 
polio when he was two years old resulting in 
complete paralysis in one leg and partial 
paralysis in the other. As part of the torture he 
reported, Dr. Alsingace was kept standing on 
his partially paralyzed leg for two consecutive 
days.  Moreover, Dr. Alsingace was allegedly 
beaten on his fingers with a rigid object and 
slapped on both ears until he could barely hear 
from them.  His nipples and earlobes were 
allegedly pulled with tongs. Dr. Alsingace was 
reportedly forced to listen to the sound of the 
electricity machines to scare him and was 
threatened with rape against him and his 
female family members. Dr. Alsingace was 
also reportedly beaten with a rigid object on his 
back during the interrogation period in order to 
force him to sign papers of unknown content.  
</p>
<p>The information received also includes 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment of the 
other detainees who have reportedly been 
handcuffed; blindfolded; held in solitary cells; 
denied food and water for long periods; hung 
by their hands, their legs tied and their bodies; 
beaten until swollen and bruised; deprived of 
sleep; and forced to listen to the screams of 
others being tortured.  In this connection, we 
have received reports indicating the transfer of 
some activists and human rights defenders to 
hospitals as a result of mistreatment, including 
that of Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja.   
</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the reports received, 
on 6 September 2010, the Bahraini authorities 
published a ministerial order announcing the 
dissolution of the Board of Directors of the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure which provides that 
suspects must be brought before the Public 
Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest.  
</p>
<p>Following the ten days elapse, all of he 
suspects were duly referred to the Public 
Prosecution. As a principal division of the 
judicial authority, the Public Prosecution has 
commenced and handled criminal 
proceedings. Working in its capacity as an 
investigation and indictment authority, and 
following intensive investigations by 
prosecutors into the clandestine terror 
network, the suspects were charged under the 
Penal Code No. 15 of 1976, Law No. 58 of 
2006 with respect to Protection the 
Community from Terrorist Acts Law No. 4 of 
2001 with respect to Countering Money 
Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. 
</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the suspects have 
labelled their acts of violence as human rights 
activism or peaceful demonstrations or 
protests. It goes without saying that inciting 
to acts of riot, violence and vandalism under 
the disguise of promoting and protecting 
human rights reflects nothing but a solid 
violation of article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights which 
stipulates that everyone has the right to life, 
liberty and security of person. The 
Government of Bahrain is bound to protect 
individuals and groups against the abuse of 
these fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the concern expressed by the 
Working Groups with respect to the physical 
and mental integrity of the suspects and that 
they may have suffered torture and ill-
treatment, it is certainly worth stressing that 
the Government of Bahrain fully reaffirms its 
adherence to the provisions stipulated in the 
UN Body of Principles for the Protection of </p>

<p>Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS) and 
appointed an employee of the Ministry of 
Social Affairs to administer the society until 
the holding of a general assembly. The grounds 
reportedly provided were the organization&#8217;s 
lack of neutrality towards Bahraini society and 
the publication of articles issued by illegal 
entities on its website. This order reportedly 
follows a statement by the Ministry of Social 
Development published on 2 September 2010, 
in local newspapers in which it announced that 
it will take legal and administrative action 
against human rights organizations which, 
according to the Ministry, defend a specific 
category of citizens and neglect the others.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 28 
August 2010, the BHRS organized a press 
conference with other NGOs and in the 
presence of family members of detainees, 
including the human rights defenders 
mentioned above. During the press conference, 
BHRS denounced the conditions of detention 
and the lack of access to the detainees by their 
lawyers and families and called for respect for 
the right of due process and a fair trial.   
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed about the physical and 
mental integrity of Dr. Abduljalil Al Singace, 
Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Mr. Jaffar Al-
Hessabi, and Mr. Mohammed Saeed and 
allegations received that all of them are being 
held incommunicado in a secret place of 
detention since their arrest and that their fate 
and whereabouts remain unknown.  In this 
connection, concern is expressed about reports 
received indicating that Dr. Abduljalil Al 
Singace and the other detainees may have 
suffered torture and ill-treatment during their 
detention as a result of which some of the 
human rights defenders mentioned may have 
been transferred to hospitals.   
</p>
<p>all Persons under any form of Detention of 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of 
detention are treated in a humane manner and 
with respect for their physical and mental 
integrity and inherent dignity of the human 
person. Any arrest, detention or 
imprisonment, is only carried out strictly in 
accordance with the provisions of the law and 
by competent officials or persons authorized 
for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption 
of this Body of Principles would make an 
important contribution to the protection of 
human rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law 
any act contrary to the rights and duties 
contained therein.   
</p>
<p>Bahrain strictly refuses any recourse to 
torture. Any alleged incident of torture may 
not be overseen. It is unanimously agreed in 
Bahrain and amongst security authorities that 
torture is an unacceptable approach in 
handling any case or event, be it criminal or 
political. Bahrain has codified strict measures 
to penalize civil servants or officers should 
they conduct such unlawful acts. The suspects 
were all referred to forensic doctors and 
apparently, no complaint has been officially 
lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims 
of torture. 
</p>
<p>It is apparent that the information sent to the 
respected Working Groups is defamatory by 
all means. It has been noticed that most of the 
light was shed on Dr. Abduljalil Al-Singace 
and the alleged torture and ill-treatment he 
and the others are facing. It is recognized that 
Dr. Al-Singace requires extra care due to his 
partial paralysis in his legs. He is provided 
with a wheelchair and crutches and is always 
assisted when walking. He holds his 
prescription glasses and he is currently 
enjoying reading a book he requested titled </p>

The law guarantees the independence of the 
judiciary and the probity and impartiality of

</p>
<p>Secondly, the dissolution of the Board of 
Directors of the Bahrain Human Rights 
Society (hereinafter BHRS) 
</p>
<p>The BHRS has been working in the field of 
promoting and protecting human rights in 
Bahrain since 2001. The society has 
contributed to the development of human 
rights for almost ten years and is regarded as 
one of the most prominent societies working 
in this field. Having respected the work of the 
BHRS for man years, the Government of 
Bahrain regrets the accusation that the 
dissolution of the Board of Directors of the 
BHRS was related to the activities of the 
organization in defence o human rights in the 
country. The dissolution was based purely on 
administrative and legal measures. It was not 
motivated by BHRS`s activities in defence of 
human rights, but was a result of committing 
habitually administrative and legal violations. 
The BHRS have carried out unlawful </p>

</i></p>
<p>activities and cooperated with illegal bodies, 
along with engaging itself in political affairs 
away from human rights perception. 
</p>
<p>The BHRS refrained from condemning acts 
of violence and terrorism which aimed at 
compromising national security and abusing 
the country&#8217;s stability, and at compromising 
national security and abusing the country&#8217;s 
stability, and to justify such acts in 
contravention of the very basis of its articles 
of association, related to defence of human 
rights without discrimination, favouritism or 
biasness for any party. The society 
coordinated with some outlawed bodies 
known for their incitement to violence, 
terrorism and hatred of the regime within the 
framework of the so-called alliance for truth 
and equality. It was also apparent that BHRS 
combined political work with human rights-
related activities, which resulted in lack of 
impartiality, professionalism and 
independence. BHRS&#180;s website contained 
several violations and acts in contravention to 
Legislative Decree No. 21 of 1989 with 
respect to social and cultural clubs and 
associations. As a social society, it was 
supposed to refrain from engaging in political 
activities as stipulated in article 18, which 
provides that the society may neither engage 
itself in politics nor enter into any financial 
speculations. 
</p>
<p>Further, the society has published unlawful 
materials on its website and having carried 
out activities which are harmful to security, 
civil peace and stability of the country, it has 
thus violated article 3 of the abovementioned 
law, which stipulates &#8220;Every society 
established in violation of the public order or 
public norms or for any unlawful purpose or 
reason or with a view to damaging peace of </p>

<p>the state or form of the Government or its 
social order shall be null and void&#8221;. The 
BHRS also submitted false complaints to 
different human rights organizations and have 
spread provocative propaganda, news and 
false statements to destabilize public security 
and cause damage to public interests, along 
with filling false complaints to the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right of opinion and expression and 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, claiming that the 
Government had banned the BHRS from 
organizing a workshop related to human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>With regards to the dissolution of the Board 
of Directors of the BHRS, the ministerial 
order was a result of a proliferation of 
violations committed continuously by the 
society. Legislative Decree No. 21 of 1989 
with respect to social and cultural clubs and 
associations governs the BHRS. Violations of 
provisions of this law include: 
</p>
<p>- Article 16: BHRS failed to produce its 
annual budget and did not send its fiscal 
statements for auditing; 
</p>
<p>- Article 32: BHRS failed to call for new 
elections for the Board of Directors; 
</p>
<p>- Article 33: BHRS failed to notify the 
Ministry of Social Affairs prior to convening 
a General Assembly meeting; 
</p>
<p>- Article 39: BHRS has no viable Board of 
Directors; and 
</p>
<p>- Article 46 BHRS failed to provide the 
Ministry of Social Affairs with decisions 
taken by the Board of Directors. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the press conference of 28 
August 2010, organised by the BHRS in the </p>

<p>presence of the family members of the 
suspects including those of the 
abovementioned, the BHRS has exercised its 
constitutional and legal rights to strive for the 
protection of human rights. The Government 
of Bahrain considers such actions as an 
obligation and a duty to respect to protect and 
to fulfil human rights. The authorities of 
Bahrain have this conference and refrained 
from interfering with or curtailing the 
enjoyment of human rights for both BHRS 
and family members of the suspects. Bahrain 
is also bound to protect individuals and 
groups against human rights abuses, and it is 
grateful to human rights NGOs such as BHRS 
for being whistleblowers and drawing the 
Government&#8217;s attention to any human rights 
violations. Bahrain is also committed to fulfil 
human rights and it believes that the 
enjoyment of these rights are best achieved 
through the facilitation of human rights 
NGOs, hence it welcomes the organization of 
such conferences. 
</p>
<p>What was unfortunate in this press conference 
was an incident that was drawn to the 
attention of the Minister of Social Affairs by 
four journalists and three of the attendees. In 
the course of the press conference, the BHRS 
humiliated the journalists, sworn at them and 
ordered them to leave the hall. One reason for 
this was a question asked by one of the 
journalists of the BHRS regarding the refrain 
of the society from condemning the 
assassination attempt of their fellow journalist 
Mohannad Abu Zaltoon, Managing Editor of 
Al Watan Newspaper on 25 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>The journalists have sent separate letters to 
the Minister of Social Affairs condemning the 
unfortunate incident of the press conference. 
The journalists have argued that such attitude </p>

<p>by the BHRS is an unacceptable violation of 
the fundamental principles set forth in article 
19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>The BHRS, along with all other NGOs in 
Bahrain, reserve their rights of the legitimate 
and peaceful work in the defence of human 
rights as enshrined in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Right and Responsibility 
of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
to Promote and Protect Universally 
Recognised Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. They also preserve the right of 
freedom of expression and opinion, as 
enshrined in the Constitution of Bahrain. 
Legal action is only exercised against those 
who deviate from the scope of the legitimate 
and peaceful work in the defence of human 
rights and freedom of expression and recourse 
to the execution of acts amounting to the 
abuse of law. 
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain 
reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that all suspects 
are not deprived arbitrarily o their liberty and 
are entitled in full equality to fair proceedings 
before an independent and impartial tribunal. 
Bahrain acknowledges the significant role of 
the Human Rights Council in the contribution 
to the effective elimination f all violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
peoples and individuals and fully supports its 
efforts in promoting universal respect for 
human rights with its determination to 
examine thoroughly all the cases brought to

<p>7. Bangladesh 05/03/10 AL TOR On 12 January 2010, Mr. Saidul Islam 
Alamgir, a journalist, received a phone call 
from the Officer-in-charge of the district police 
station, asking him to go to the station at 9:00 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 08/07/2010, the Government 
indicated that on the basis of the allegation 
received, the concerned authorities appointed 
the Superintendent of Police (S.P.), Rangpur </p>

<p>p.m. that evening. Mr. Alamgir arrived at the 
station at 10:00 p.m., but the Officer-in-charge 
was not there. On his way back home, Mr. 
Alamgir was stopped at the Jahaj Company 
intersection by two officers in a police van. He 
was pushed into the back, where other officers 
beat him with guns, sticks, boots and fists. Mr. 
Alamgir&#8217;s nephew was reportedly also in the 
vehicle and he appeared to be injured. Mr. 
Alamgir was driven around the town of 
Rangpur for almost two hours, while the 
officers continued to beat him. A constable 
reportedly pressed his throat so that he would 
not scream and tried to rip out his tongue, 
while other officers pushed a stick into his 
right eye. Due to the beatings and other ill-
treatment, he sustained severe injuries to his 
eye, thighs, right hand and leg, waist and 
shoulders. 
</p>
<p>At the Kotowali police station, Mr. Alamgir 
was held in an overcrowded cell with 
approximately 35 other detainees. At 3:30 a.m., 
he was informed by an officer that two charges 
were being prepared against him. One hour 
later, another officer showed him the two 
complaints for theft and looting. In the cases, 
the police reportedly claimed that Mr. Alamgir 
had been arrested at the scene of the crime.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Alamgir&#8217;s friends, including other 
journalists, went to the police station at 
approximately 3:00 a.m., and they were 
verbally abused and threatened by the police. 
Due to his injuries and the lack of food, Mr. 
Alamgir collapsed in his cell the following 
afternoon. After repeated requests from his 
journalist friends, he was allowed to leave the 
cell to be cleaned and fed by his colleagues. At 
approximately 3:30 p.m., he was taken to the 
Rangpur Medical College Hospital by the 
police. Thirty minutes later, he was taken to the 
</p>
<p>District, Mr. Saleh Mohammed Tanvir to 
inquire into the matter. 
</p>
<p>The Superintendent of Police (S.P.) of 
Rangpur district took interview of the 
Officer-in-Charge of Kotwali (Rangpur 
Sadar) police station and others. The S.P. also 
analyzed relevant records and files. Upon the 
inquiry, it was found that on 12.1.2010 at 
9.00 pm. Mr. Saidul Islam Alamgir inspired 
his companions to create a chaos during raffle 
draw, which happened in the trade fair at 
Zilla School field. Then Alamgir lead 30 to 
35 miscreants to set fire to the office room 
destroy the stalls and looted the goods. Upon 
receipt of the complaint Sub-Inspector of 
Police, Mr. Abdur filed a case about this 
event in the kotwali (Rangpur Sadar) police 
station under section 
143/323/435/379/427/332/353 of Bangladesh 
Penal Code. The case number is 37 and is 
dated 13.1.2010. Consequently the police 
arrested Mr. Saidul Islam Alamgir and his 
companions. Some of them were hurt during 
the arrest when they tried to flee away. Police 
handed them over to the Court after arrest. 
There is no evidence of torture to Mr. Saidul 
Islam Alamgir and his companions. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. M.A. Moyeen Khan, S/o 
Haji M.A. Matin Khan, 17 Naya Polton, 
Dhaka organizer of the trade fair and the 
Chairman of Benaroshi, Moslin and Zamdani 
Private Ltd. Filed a case under section 
143/323/385/379/506/114 of Bangladesh 
Penal Code. According to the case filed Mr. 
Saidul Islam Alamgir and his companions 
approximately 10-12 in number tried to enter 
into the circus pandel of the same fair without 
ticket on 10.1.2010 at 8.50 p.m. The gate 
keepers did not allow them to enter into the 
pandel and this is why they were pushed and </p>

<p>Judicial Magistrate&#8217;s Court in Rangpur. He was 
not presented before the magistrate, as he was 
held in a cell at the court. The magistrate 
ordered his detention at the Rangpur Central 
Jail, without observing the detainee&#8217;s 
condition. This decision was overturned on 14 
January and Mr. Alamgir was released on bail, 
after his friends informed the court of the 
alleged torture he had sustained. 
</p>
<p>pulled by Mr. Alamgir and his accompanies. 
They also stole many articles and demanded 
extortion. Now investigation of the two cases 
is going on. Officer-in-Charge and 
Investigating Officer have been directed for 
further investigation and make authentic 
report in this regard. 
</p>
<p>During the inquiry of the Superintendent of 
Police, it was found that the statement on Mr. 
Alamgir is being detained at Kotwali 
(Rangpur Sadar) Police Station on 12.1.2010 
at 10.00 p.m. is not true. 
</p>
<p>It may be noted that in the above case, actions 
were taken in accordance with the law of the 
land and without any political considerations 
whatsoever. Both the print and electronic 
media in Bangladesh enjoy full freedom and 
media in Bangladesh continues to represent 
widely diverse and divergent opinions and 
points of view.

at Alarm Auto Engineering Works when he 
was approached by two police officers who 
asked him to accompany them to the police 
station. The officers took him to the Joydevpur 
Police Station, where Mr. Parvez was locked 
up in a room on the second floor. He was 
handcuffed, gagged, and his legs were tied up 
with a cotton towel while he was beaten with 
canes by three officers. He was also beaten 
with an iron rod on his legs, and pins were 
inserted into each tow. Mr. Parvez was thrown 
on the floor and two officers stood on high 
thighs and continued to beat him. He was also 
reportedly subjected to electric shocks on his 
hands and legs. Mr. Parvez was released a few 
hours later, after his father, a police officer, 
arrived at the station. Upon release, Mr. Parvez 
was taken to the hospital for treatment. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 24/11/2010, the Government 
of Bangladesh indicated that after extensive 
investigations, the witnesses of the case did 
not disclose sufficient grounds to prove the 
allegation brought by the complainant.. 
</p>
<p>The father of the victim Mr. Fayequjjaman, 
who himself is a Sub-Inspector of Police of 
Sadar Court, Narayangonj, stated that the 
incident took place on 30.10.2009 with his 
son and other three Probationer Police 
Officers was a minor misunderstanding only. 
He also mentioned that his brother-in-law 
exaggerated the factsto draw more attention 
from the authority concerned. He also 
mentioned that as a police Officer and father 
of Pervez Zakaria he understood the sagacity. 
Accordingly, he submitted a written letter to 
the Superintendent of Police of Gajipur 
District. Violation of Human Rights </p>

Superintendent at Gazipur Police Station, with 
the Divisional Commissioner of Police, The 
Minister for Home Affairs and the Home 
Secretary. Mr. Parvez&#8217; family reported that 
they were threatened by the police in order to 
force an amicable solution. 
</p>
<p>regarding this incident was not raised by the 
victim neither by the witnesses of the case 
during investigation. The Superintendent of 
Police of Gajipur district also held an 
investigation on the same complaint, but 
could not establish the allegation of human 
rights violation. During inquiry, it also 
transpired that the victim of the incident is an 
accused of three criminal cases of Joydevpur 
Police Station bearing case Nos. 55(8)08; 
52(9)08 and 23 (1)09. The cases are under 
trial. The observations on the questions raised 
in the communication of the Special 
Rapporteur are as follows: 
</p>
<p>i)   The facts noted in the complaint of the 
case could not be  substantiated as fully 
accurate; 
</p>
<p>ii) Superintendent of Police, Gajipur district 
directed Mr. Md. Gias Uddin Miah, Assistant 
Superintendent of Police, Headquarters, 
Gajipur to inquire in to the matter. He carried 
out the inquiry and submitted a report on 
11.03.2010. Also Mr. Abul Kalam Azad, 
Inspector of Police, Police Headquarters, 
Dhaka held a separate inquiry on the same 
complaint and reported on 16.03.2010. Both 
the officers could not establish the allegation 
because of insufficient evidence. 
</p>
<p>iii) The alleged perpetrators were three 
probationer Police Officers. No further action 
could be taken against them except 
disciplinary sanction action containing verbal 
caution, which was issued against them 
because the complaint was withdrawn 
through a letter submitted on 05.02.2010 and 
no violation of human rights could be traced 
against them.

under Sections 121A (&#8220;waging war or 
attempting to wage war against the State&#8221;), 
124A (&#8220;sedition&#8221;) and 114 (&#8220;abettor present 
when offence is committed&#8221;) of the Penal 
Code.   
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 10 
June 2010, Mr. Rahman reported that five or 
six men entered his cell, removed his clothes 
and then proceeded to hit him very hard with 
their elbows in his chest and back whereupon 
he lost consciousness.  When he awoke, he 
found himself lying in the room of the Second 
Officer of the CPS. 
</p>
<p>On 12 June 2010, Mr. Rahman was brought 
before the Magistrates Court on the basis of 
Case No. 2(6)2010. He then reported that he 
has been subjected to acts of inhuman and 
degrading treatment while in detention.  He 
was allegedly unable to stand on the dock and 
the Magistrate invited him to sit. The 
Magistrates Court ordered that Mr. Rahman be 
sent to jail and undergo a full medical check-up 
on the basis of jail regulations. The Magistrate 
also allowed Mr. Rahman's lawyers to meet 
him for half an hour. 
</p>
<p>On the same day, the police of the Detective 
Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan area submitted 
an application seeking a four-day remand to 
question Mr. Rahman regarding the case filed 
at the Uttara police station under the 2009 
</p>
<p>Mr. Hashmat Ali on 1 June 2010 filed a case 
with the Tejgaon Industrial Area Police 
Station against Mr. Mahmudur Rahman, 
acting Editor of &#8220;Amar Desh&#8221; for illegally 
using his name as publisher of the daily. 
</p>
<p>Following the cancellation of the declaration, 
a writ petition was filed by the daily &#8220;Amar 
Desh&#8221; with the High Court. On 10 June 2010, 
the High Court stayed for three months the 
order closing the daily. Following an appeal 
against the stay order, the Appellate Division, 
on 15 June 2010, issued an order staying * 
High Court&#8217;s order for four weeks. 
Meanwhile, the daily &#8220;Amar Desh&#8221; published 
regularly from 11 to 15 June 2010. The 
matter is currently pending before the court. 
</p>
<p>It may be noted that in the above case, actions 
were taken in accordance with the law of the 
land and without any political considerations 
whatsoever. Both the print and electronic 
media in Bangladesh enjoy full freedom and 
media in Bangladesh continues to represent 
widely diverse and divergent opinions and 
points of view. </p>

<p>Anti-Terrorism Act.  The remand was granted 
by the Magistrates Court. Mr. Rahman was 
reportedly taken to the Detective Branch 
offices in Dhaka on 12 June without any 
medical check-up being performed. 
</p>
<p>As a result of the above, Mr. Rahman has been 
on remand since 2 June 2010.   
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
charges against Mr. Rahman, and various staff 
working at the Amar Desh's daily newspaper, 
might be related to their activities as journalists 
and in defense of human rights.  Further 
concern is expressed about the physical and 
mental integrity of Mr. Rahman and the 
allegations that he might have been subject to 
ill-treatment during his detention.  
</p>
<p>10.  25/08/10 UA TOR Concerning the allegations of ill-treatment by 
the police following the arrest of several 
garment workers and labour rights activists. 
</p>
<p>The police have acknowledged the detention of 
21 garment workers and labour rights activists, 
following violent street protests relating to 
minimum wage in and around Dhaka. 
However, the number of people in detention is 
believed to be much higher, as the authorities 
have indicated that cases are being prepared to 
charge thousands of people with vandalism, 
arson and looting. Out of the 21, at least six 
female garment workers who were detained in 
early August, including a pregnant woman, 
were beaten by the police during interrogation. 
It is believed that one of the detainees is in 
urgent need of medical care as a result, but it 
has so far been refused. Mr. Montu Ghose, a 
legal advisor to the Garment Workers&#8217; Trade 
Union Centre, who was detained in late July, 
has also reportedly been ill-treated in police 
custody, including through sleep deprivation. 
He requires medical attention for a stroke he

believed to be receiving any. Other workers 
and activists have gone into hiding and their 
families have received death threats from the 
security forces.

<p>Concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of all those in detention 
following the street protests.

</p>
<p>  Arrest and ill-treatment of several protestersat 
Kastrychnitskaya Square. A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 
para. 16  
</p>
<p>By letter dated 11/02/2010, the Government 
indicated the following: 
</p>
<p>1. Many of the facts mentioned did indeed 
take place, but the information given is one-
sided and completely ignores the 
premeditated illegal nature of the actions of 
the participants in the unauthorized events. 
</p>
<p>2. The State guarantees the freedom to hold 
assemblies, meetings, street processions, 
demonstrations and pickets that do not disturb 
law and order or violate the rights of other 
citizens. This right is embodied in article 35 
of the Constitution, and procedure for its 
implementation is governed by the Mass 
Events Act. To ensure the full realization of 
citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms, and to uphold 
public morals, order and security, the 
organizers of any mass event are legally 
bound to apply to the local authorities and to 
obtain the appropriate authorization for the 
event to take place.  
</p>
<p> If the organizers do not have the appropriate 
authorization, the internal affairs agencies are 
legally empowered to halt the mass event. 
</p>
<p>3. The organizers of the events on 
Oktyabrskaya Square in Minsk on 9 and 16 
September 2009 did not submit any 
application in respect of the events to the 
Minsk Municipal Executive Committee, nor 
did they have any authorization for them. The </p>

<p>organizers were thus in serious breach of the 
law. 
</p>
<p>The unauthorized events were held at a place 
where such events are banned under Minsk 
Municipal Executive Committee decision No. 
1302 of 3 December 1998 prohibiting 
assemblies, meetings, street processions, 
demonstrations and pickets on Oktyabrskaya 
Square, Minsk. 
</p>
<p>The events were held less than 200 metres 
from underground pedestrian crossings, and 
the Oktyabrskaya and Kupalovskaya metro 
stations, which is also against the law. 
</p>
<p>On the basis of these circumstances, the 
internal affairs agencies took the necessary 
measures to stop the unauthorized mass 
events. 
</p>
<p>4. The illegal actions of the participants in the 
unauthorized event of 9 September 2009 were 
halted by militia officers. Twenty-seven 
individuals were detained for hearings. 
Twenty reports of administrative offences 
under articles 23.4, 23.34 and 17.1 of the 
Code of Administrative Procedure and 
Enforcement were drawn up in respect of 19 
hearings of participants in the unauthorized 
events. Eighteen administrative cases were 
submitted for the consideration of the court, 
and two were submitted to the Commission 
on Juvenile Affairs in the place of residence 
of the offender. 
</p>
<p>Seventeen citizens were held in the offenders&#8217; 
confinement centre of the Minsk Municipal 
Executive Committee Central Department of 
Internal Affairs, in line with established 
procedure, until their administrative offence 
cases were brought to court. The remaining 
detainees were released after identification. </p>

<p>Three of the detainees made complaints about 
their state of health: M.P. Sergiyets (abrasion 
on right eyebrow, nausea, bleeding, dizziness 
and pain around the heart), A.A. Senchilo 
(dizziness), and A.V. Koipish (toothache, 
weakness, periodic loss of consciousness). 
</p>
<p>They were all examined by emergency 
service medical staff and given the necessary 
qualified medical assistance. As there was no 
contraindication to their being held in a 
special militia facility or need for them to be 
hospitalized, they were taken to the above-
mentioned offenders&#8217; confinement centre. No 
other detainees complained about their health 
to the staff of the centre, as is borne out by 
their signatures on the relevant documents.  
</p>
<p>D. Borodko and V. Ivashkevich, who were at 
the Minsk Central District Internal Affairs 
Authority and the offenders&#8217; confinement 
centre, did not request any medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>The militia officers of the Minsk Municipal 
Executive Committee State Internal Affairs 
Department special regiment and the Minsk 
Central District Internal Affairs Authority did 
not use any special means or physical force 
on the detainees, nor did they apply 
psychological pressure. 
</p>
<p>On 10 September 2009, the Minsk Central 
District Court heard administrative offence 
cases against A. Rodachinskaya, V. 
Ivashkevich, D. Bondarenko, V. Lemesh, A. 
Senchilo, D. Dashkevich, D. Karpovich, D. 
Borodko and M. Sergiyets.  
</p>
<p>An investigation of the cases by the Supreme 
Court supported the Central District Court&#8217;s 
deliberations, in accordance with established 
legal procedure. All those involved were 
given the opportunity to provide a full 
explanation of the alleged administrative </p>

<p>offence, including with the participation of 
defence lawyers. D. Karpovich and V. 
Ivashkevich made use of their legal right to 
have a defence lawyer at the court hearing. 
</p>
<p>The administrative offence cases were 
considered in open court sessions. 
</p>
<p>The Minsk Central District Court imposed 
fines of between 5 and 25 base units. There is 
no doubt as to the legality, validity or fairness 
of the court&#8217;s decision, under which the 
above-mentioned individuals were sentenced 
to fines. 
</p>
<p>The law of procedure guarantees the 
constitutional right to appeal against court 
decisions in administrative offence cases. Of 
all those brought before the court for 
administrative offences, only S. Karpovich 
made use of that right. Minsk Municipal 
Court considered and dismissed S. 
Karpovich&#8217;s appeal against the court&#8217;s 
decision. 
</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decisions to impose a fine as an 
administrative penalty were complied with 
voluntarily by D. Borodko, D. Bondarenko, 
A. Senchilo, A. Rodachinskaya and D. 
Karpovich. 
</p>
<p>The Minsk District Administration 
Commission for Juvenile Affairs issued a 
warning to the minor I.V. Mikhailov and 
halted the administrative procedure against 
R.A. Tereshkov under article 9.6, paragraph 
10 (1), of the Code of Administrative 
Procedure and Enforcement. 
</p>
<p>5.  At 6 p.m. on 16 September 2009, a group 
of 47 citizens organized an unauthorized 
event on Oktyabrskaya Square in Minsk. 
They did not respond to repeated warnings by 
militia officers who, in order to halt the </p>

they brought for hearings at the Minsk 
Central District Internal Affairs Department. 
</p>
<p>After identification and preventive measures, 
the detainees were released within the legal

report being made. 
</p>
<p>The information concerning O. Korban, A. 
Sergeyenko, A. Stepanenko, N. Statkevich 
and Y. Misinkevich, in respect of the events 
of 16 September 2009 referred to by the 
Special Rapporteur, was not put before the 
court. 
</p>
<p>6. The Minsk Procurator&#8217;s Office registered 
some statements by citizens concerning 
illegal actions by members of the internal 
affairs agencies during the unauthorized 
events on Oktyabrskaya Square, Minsk on 9 
and 16 September 2009. 
</p>
<p>Such statements were received from A.A. 
Senchilo, M.R. Sergiyets, A.A. 
Rodachinskaya, D.S. Korsak, N.V. 
Sergeyenko, A.V. Bryuno, Y.V. 
Misyukevich, D.V. Nekhay and A.N. 
Stepanenko. A similar statement was also 
received from O.N. Gulak, president of the 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee national 
human rights defence association. 
</p>
<p>Inquiries were carried out into all the cases 
referred to, and it was decided on the basis of 
the results not to bring criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>The allegations were fully examined and are 
refuted by all the information collected. There 
is no basis for any change to the decision not 
to bring proceedings. The legality of the 
decisions has been verified by the Minsk

<p>Municipal Executive Committee State

and in accordance with legal requirements. 
</p>
<p>The use of force against participants in the 
event, who failed to obey officers of the 
internal affairs agencies and seriously 
violated law and order, during transport in the 
special vehicle for the subsequent 
proceedings in the regional units of the 
internal affairs agencies was recognized as 
legal. Overstepping of authority by members 
of the Minsk Municipal Executive Committee 
State Internal Affairs Department is not 
tolerated. 
</p>
<p>During the inquiry, no reliable witnesses were 
produced to confirm the illegal use of 
physical force or special measures by 
members of the Minsk Municipal Executive 
Committee State Internal Affairs Department 
in official vehicles. The actions of the 
members of that Department and the Minsk 
Central District Internal Affairs Department 
did not constitute a crime.

<p>Hence the facts described by the above-
mentioned individuals in their statements are 
not objectively confirmed.

<p>12.     Reportedly imminent execution of 
 Mr.Andrei Zhuk. (A/HRC/13/39.Add.1, Para. 
15) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 18/12/2009, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Zhuk was convicted by the 
Minsk Regional Court on 17 July 2009 under 
article 139, paragraph 2 (1), 2 (12) and 2 (15); 
article 205, paragraph 2; article 207, 
paragraph 3; article 294, paragraph 3; and 
article 328, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code 
of Belarus, and sentenced to the ultimate 
sanction of the law &#8211; the death penalty with 
confiscation of property. 
</p>
<p>On 27 October 2009 the criminal division of 
the Supreme Court of Belarus issued a 
decision confirming the sentence handed </p>

<p>down to Mr. Zhuk by the criminal division of 
the Minsk Regional Court on 17 July 2009, 
and his cassational appeal was denied. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuk received a written copy of that 
decision in prison (5 November 2009). The 
manner in which an appeal for clemency 
should be formulated was explained to him. 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to article 174, paragraph 2 (1), of the 
Penal Enforcement Code, Mr. Zhuk as the 
convicted party submitted an appeal for 
clemency on 13 November 2009, which was 
transmitted on the same day to the 
Presidential Pardons Commission. 
</p>
<p>Until that appeal is considered by the 
President, Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s sentence will be 
suspended pursuant to paragraph 7 of the 
Regulations on granting clemency for 
convicts and on reducing the criminal 
responsibility of persons cooperating in 
uncovering crime and in mitigating its effects. 
</p>
<p>2. Mr. Zhuk has been found guilty of 
committing a series of crimes. 
</p>
<p>Between 15 January and 23 February 2009 he 
and convict I.S. Sorokin broke into number 
31 Sadovaya Street in the village of 
Zazhevichi in the Soligorsk district of Minsk 
Region, where they stole an IZ-12 hunting 
shotgun, 30 cartridges, a cartridge belt and a 
hunting knife belonging to Mr. N.I. 
Dubovski, resulting in a loss of property 
worth 239,800 Belarusian roubles (around 85 
US dollars). 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuk used the hunting gun to make a 
sawn-off shotgun. 
</p>
<p>On 27 February 2009 at about 7.30 p.m., with 
the assistance of convict Mr. V.N. Moroz, 
Mr. Zhuk and Mr. Sorokin carried out an 
armed assault on Mr. G.A. Zubets and Ms. </p>

<p>S.N. Laptsueva, staff of the agricultural 
production cooperative Bolshevik-Agro, in 
the village of Krivichi, in the Soligorsk 
district of Minsk Region, and absconded with 
the cooperative&#8217;s payroll funds in a Chevrolet 
Niva car with car plate number 78-44 AX-5. 
</p>
<p>During the armed assault, Mr. Zhuk, with the 
help of Mr. Sorokin, who held the victims 
down, killed Mr. Zubets, shooting him in the 
head with the sawn-off shotgun, and Ms. 
Laptsueva with two shots, one to the shoulder 
and one to the head. After killing their 
victims, they took 62,468,810 Belarusian 
roubles in large bills (around US$ 26,000) 
and fled to Slutsk, where they divided the 
money between them. 
</p>
<p>On his arrest on 1 March 2009, Mr. Zhuk was 
in possession of narcotics: 0.7 ml of 
methadone, equal to 0.001 grams of dry 
substance, which he had purchased for 
personal use. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s guilt for the crimes for which he 
has been convicted is proven by the case file 
and is supported by all the evidence, which 
was appropriately investigated, evaluated and 
taken into consideration by the court during 
sentencing. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuk pleaded guilty on all counts and 
confirmed that he had killed Mr. Zubets and 
Ms. Laptsueva with shots to the head using 
the sawn-off shotgun. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuk, Mr. Sorokin and Mr. Moroz fled to 
the town of Slutsk, where they divided the 
money between them. Mr. Zhuk and Mr. 
Sorokin received 22 million roubles each, and 
Mr. Moroz received 16 million roubles. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Sorokin, as a defendant, gave a similar 
statement and confirmed that Mr. Zhuk shot </p>

<p>the victims dead with a sawn-off shotgun. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Moroz, as a defendant, confirmed that on 
27 February 2009 he had assisted Mr. Zhuk 
and Mr. Sorokin in an armed assault on the 
staff of the agricultural production 
cooperative Bolshevik-Agro who were 
carrying the payroll money. 
</p>
<p>Searches of the accused persons&#8217; homes 
conducted on 1 March 2009 resulted in the 
discovery and seizure of the following sums 
of money: 
</p>
<p>In Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s possession &#8211; 15,950,000 
roubles; 
</p>
<p>In Mr. Moroz&#8217;s possession &#8211; 11,302,200 
roubles; 
</p>
<p>In Mr. Sorokin&#8217;s possession &#8211; 17,400,000 
roubles, in bank packaging bearing the name 
of the open joint stock company 
Belagroprombank, dated 27 February 2009 
and with the reference number MFO 
</p><p>153001917. 
</p>
<p>Bank worker Mr. S.A. Tyabus has testified as 
a witness, confirming that on 27 February 
2009 money in such packets had been given 
to Ms. Laptsueva, who was killed by Mr. 
Zhuk during the armed assault. 
</p>
<p>The court conducted a thorough 
psychological assessment of Mr. Zhuk. 
</p>
<p>The forensic psychologists concluded that the 
accused, Mr. Zhuk, was and remains of sound 
mind. 
</p>
<p>At the time the crime was committed he was 
not manifesting any signs of temporary 
psychological disorder, and the court 
considered him to be fully aware of his 
criminal conduct. </p>

<p><i>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</i></p>
<p>In carrying out multiple killings, Mr. Zhuk 
was fulfilling the role allocated to him as part 
of a criminal plan. His actions constitute 
criminal behaviour in all respects. 
</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zhuk as accused had two prior 
convictions for wilful commission of crimes, 
and as he once again wilfully committed a 
criminal offence, the court had sound grounds 
to conclude that the accused was a recidivist 
under article 43, paragraph 1, of the Criminal 
Code. 
</p>
<p>When sentencing Mr. Zhuk, the court of first 
instance proceeded on the basis of 
individualization of the penalty, taking into 
account the nature and degree of public 
danger of the crimes committed, Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s 
role in those crimes, the motives and aims of 
the criminal conduct, information about his 
personality, the nature of the harm inflicted, 
and extenuating and aggravating 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>The court considered Mr. Zhuk&#8217;s open 
remorse for committing the crimes, his active 
assistance in their disclosure by helping to 
locate evidence and the weapons used in the 
crime, his partial redress of the wrong done, 
and the fact that he has a young child as 
extenuating circumstances. 
</p>
<p>The court, however, also noted the fact that 
Mr. Zhuk committed a crime, wilfully taking 
the lives of two people, among the 
aggravating circumstances, which also 
included the fact that he was under the 
influence of alcohol when the crime was 
committed. 
</p>
<p>As the organizer of and most active 
participant in the crimes, Mr. Zhuk acted in 
cold blood and in a particularly insidious </p>

<p>manner when committing them. 
</p>
<p>Taking into account the particularly 
dangerous nature of the crimes Mr. Zhuk 
committed and the exceptional danger he 
poses to society, the court was justified in 
handing down the highest possible sentence &#8211; 
the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>In handing down this type of sentence, the 
court took account of the provisions of Part 
III, article 6, paragraph 2, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> The Supreme Court of Belarus considers the 
sentence to be fair and in line with the degree 
of danger to society posed by the crimes 
committed and the information regarding the 
defendant&#8217;s personality. 
</p>
<p> There is no doubt about the legality and 
grounds for the sentence handed down to Mr. 
Zhuk. 
</p>
<p>3. Belarus recognizes the supremacy of the

<p> Article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter, &#8220;the 
Covenant&#8221;), which Belarus has ratified, 
provides, inter alia, that every human being 
has the inalienable right to life. This right 
shall be protected by law. No one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his life. In countries 
which have not abolished the death penalty, a 
sentence of death may be imposed only for 
the most serious crimes in accordance with 
the law in force at the time of the commission 
of the crime. Anyone sentenced to death shall 
have the right to seek a pardon or 
commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, </p>

<p>pardon or commutation of the sentence of 
death may be granted in all cases. Article 6 of 
the Covenant stipulates, however, that, 
&#8220;Nothing in this article shall be invoked to 
delay or to prevent the abolition of capital 
punishment by any State Party to the present 
Covenant.&#8221;

<p> Pursuant to article 24 of the Constitution, 
each person shall have the right to life. The 
death penalty, until it is abolished, may be 
used in accordance with the law as the 
ultimate sanction for particularly serious 
crimes, and only by sentence of a court. 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to article 59, paragraph 1, of the 
Criminal Code, the death penalty (shooting) 
may be applied as the ultimate sanction for 
certain particularly serious crimes involving 
premeditated deprivation of life among the 
aggravating circumstances (until such time as 
the death penalty is abolished).

<p>The above-mentioned individuals, as well as 
those remandees whose names are not known 
are currently being held in 24 import-export 
type containers, measuring 28.2 squared 
meters, which have been converted into cells 
by opening three very small barred windows on 
each side. Between 20 and 30 people are held 
in each container, with no distinction between 
remandees and convicted detainees. These 
types of containers were also used at the 
Provisional Detention Centre in Novo 
Horizonte in 2009. However, this detention 
facility has since been closed down.  
</p>
<p>The sleeping arrangements and bedding at the 
Provisional Detention Centre in Cariacica are 
insufficient, resulting in regular injuries due to 
detainees falling from improvised hammocks, 
which are necessary due to the overcrowding. 
In addition, there is no sewage system 
surrounding the containers, but only holes in 
the containers which lead urine and excrement 
to outside buckets. The water supply for 
drinking and washing is also inadequate, as 
detainees only have access to water for a few 
minutes every couple of hours. Furthermore, 
detainees are locked up throughout the day, 
even during the summer months, facing 
extremely hot temperatures. Finally, 
information was received regarding insufficient 
medical attention, despite reports of many 
illnesses among the detainees. A recent 
outbreak of scabies forced the authorities to 
burn all mattresses and uniforms. Additionally, 
on 4 February 2010, a man called &#8220;Adoterivo&#8221;, 
who suffered from hypertension, reportedly 
died due to the lack of medical attention and 
the poor conditions in the containers. </p>

Minas Gerais (Brazil).   
</p>
<p>According to the information received on 
10August 2009, Mr. Moreira Franco was 
arrested by the federal police in the context of 
an operation against drug dealers.  Mr. Moreira 
Franco would have been severely beaten by the 
police at the moment of his arrest, at the police 
station as well as during the interrogation in 
order to force him to sign a confession.  The 
beating reportedly caused damage in his 
shoulder, inguinal region, lower back and his 
teeth.  In this connection, two police reports 
dated 11 August and 3 December 2009 would 
have confirmed the existence of the mentioned 
injuries.  Mr. Moreira Franco would be in 
detention since October 2009 and would be 
awaiting sentence.

<p>Concerned is expressed about the physical and 
mental integrity of Mr. Moreira Franco.  In this 
connection, concern is expressed about the 
excessive use of force by the federal police at 
the moment of arrest as well as during the 
interrogation.  Further concern is expressed at 
the allegations that Mr. Moreira Franco may 
have signed a statement as a result of torture or

</p>
<p>Concerning Omar Khadr, a citizen of your 
country, who we understand is still detained at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay. Omar Khadr was 15 years 
old when he was arrested and 16 years at the 
time he was transferred to Guant&#225;namo Bay. 
Information received indicates that Mr. Khadr 
was subjected to prolonged and severe sleep 
deprivation by U.S. officials in order to 
enhance the extraction of information from him 
during interrogations conducted by Canadian 
officials in 2004 when he was 17 years old. 
Military commission proceedings against Mr. 
Khadr are scheduled to recommence in July 
2010 at Guant&#225;namo Bay.

<p>In a 29 January 2010 decision, Canada&#8217;s 
Supreme Court reasoned that violations of Mr. 
</p>
<p>By a letter of 10/05/2010, the Government of 
Canada indicated that it had taken many steps 
to address the interests of <b>Mr. Khadr</b> in 
respect of his detention by the United States 
in Guantanamo Bay. Canadian government 
observers have been present at his hearings 
before the Military Commission in 
Guantanamo Bay and the Court of Military 
Commission Review in Washington, D.C. 
Furthermore, officials of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Canada have carried out 
regular visits with Mr. Khadr and will 
continue to do so. The visits allow access to 
Mr. khadr to assess his welfare and treatment, 
and to obtain information about his mental 
and physical condition. </p>

<p>Khadr&#8217;s rights under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms were ongoing as the information 
obtained by Canadian officials during the 
course of their interrogations, conducted when 
Mr. Khadr was a minor without access to legal 
counsel or habeas corpus and had been 
subjected to improper treatment by the U.S. 
authorities at the time of the interview in 
March 2004, may form part of the case 
currently being held. In light of this decision, 
we remain seriously concerned that Mr. Khadr 
will continued to be tried in military 
commission proceedings that do not adhere to 
international fair trial standards. 
</p>
<p>In this connection, we would like to refer to the 
report on the Mission to the United States of 
America by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) that highlighted 
serious situations of incompatibility between 
international human rights obligations and the 
counter-terrorism law and practice of the 
United States. Concerns highlighted in that 
report relate mainly to proceedings conducted 
by military commissions, which have not been 
fully addressed by the adoption of the 2009 
U.S. Military Commissions Act, and the use of 
evidence obtained under torture or by coercion. 
Furthermore, we would like to refer to the 
report on the Situation of detainees at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay prepared by five special 
procedures mandate holders 
(E/CN.4/2006/120) that revealed a series of 
human rights violations of the detainees and 
recommended that terrorism suspects be 
detained and tried in accordance with criminal 
procedure that respects safeguards enshrined in 
relevant international law. 
</p>
<p>In view of Mr. Khadr&#8217;s prolonged and abusive 
</p>
<p>Canada has consistently sought to ensure that 
Mr. Khadr receives the benefits of due 
process, including acsess to Canadian counsel 
of his choice. More examples of the 
Government of Canada&#8217;s actions in respecto 
of  Mr. Khadr are outlined in the dissenting 
reasons of Justice Nadon of the Federal Court 
of Appeal (2009 FCA 246 at paragraph 88) 
which and can be viewed at 
http://decisions.fca-
caf.gc.ca/en/2009fca246/2009fca246.html. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Khadr was arrested in 2002 by U.S. 
Forces in the context of his alleged 
involvement in the armed conflict in 
Afghanistan following his alleged recruitment 
and use as combatant by al Qaeda, and was 
later transferred to Guantanamo Bay by the 
Americans. Mr. Khadr&#8217;s presence in this 
conflict was not the result of actions by 
Canada and at no time since his arrest has he 
fallen under Canadian jurisdiction. Mr. Khadr 
has been detained by the United States, has 
remained under U.S. jurisdiction 
continuously since then, and now faces 
serious changes pursuant to U.S. legislation. 
Therefore, while your letter raises important 
issues, most of them would be more properly 
addressed to the Government of the United 
States. 
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Government of 
Canada at no time requested that the United 
States subject Mr. Khadr to any form of 
mistreatment. To the contrary, the 
Government of Canada has consistently asked 
the Government of the United States to 
ensure that Mr. Khadr be treated humanely 
and in a manner consistent with his age. With 
respect to the allegation of sleep deprivation, 
it is important to bear in mind the particular 
facts as to when and how the allegation was </p>

<p>detention at Guant&#225;namo Bay, the perpetuated 
violation of his rights under domestic law and 
international human rights law, and given that 
he will most likely not be afforded with a trial 
according to international fair trial standards, 
we urge your Excellency&#8217;s Government to take 
appropriate remedial action in accordance with 
the recent Supreme Court decision and 
international standards. Given the ongoing 
violation of Mr. Khadr's rights, we are of the 
opinion that repatriation to your country, where 
he would be either released or prosecuted by a 
court of law in accordance with international 
fair trial standards, would pose the most 
suitable and effective option.  In our view, the 
sending of a diplomatic note to the 
Government of the United States formally 
seeking assurances that any evidence or 
statements shared with U.S. authorities as a 
result of the interviews of Mr. Khadr by 
Canadian agents and officials in 2003 and 2004 
not be used against him by U.S. authorities in 
the context of proceedings before the Military 
Commission or elsewhere, does not constitute 
an effective remedy for the human rights 
violations he was subjected to. 
</p>
<p>We wish to reiterate our deep interest that the 
violations of Mr. Omar Khadr&#8217;s rights come 
promptly to an end and would like to highlight 
our availability for consultations on this matter. 
</p>
<p>brought to Canada&#8217;s attention. In those 
circumstances, the decision of a Canadian 
official to proceed with the final interview did 
not amount to Canadian acquiescence in such 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>On January 22, 2009, the Honourable Barack 
Obama, President of the United States, issued 
an Executive Order ordering that the 
Guantanamo Bay detention facilities be 
closed no later than one year from that date 
and that the status of each Guantanamo 
detainee be immediately reviewed. As a result 
of this review, on November 13, 2009, Mr. 
Eric Holder, Attorney General of the United 
States, announced that the United States will 
proceed to trial against Mr. Khadr by way of 
a military commission trial. This choice of 
mechanisms put in place to try detainees is a 
matter for the U.S. authorities. 
</p>
<p>In your correspondence, you also refer to the 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
Mr. Khadr&#8217;s appeal. I note that, in its ruling, 
the Supreme Court recognized the 
constitutional responsibility of the executive 
to make decisions on matters of foreign 
affairs, given the complex and ever-changing 
circumstances of diplomacy, and the need to 
take into account Canada&#8217;s broader interests. 
In response to the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling, 
the Government of Canada delivered a 
diplomatic note to the Government of the 
United States on February 16, 2010, formally 
seeking assurances that any evidence or 
statements shared with U.S. authorities as a 
result of the interviews of Mr. Khadr by 
Canadian agents and officials in 2003 and 
2004 not be used against him by U.S. 
authorities in the context of proceedings 
before the Military Commission or elsewhere.

10:30 de la ma&#241;ana del d&#237;a 18 de septiembre, 
un contingente de Carabineros habr&#237;a impedido 
el acceso a un grupo de activistas Mapuche, 
incluyendo miembros de organizaciones y 
comunidades diversas, que caminaban

insultado y amenazado de nuevo despu&#233;s de ser 
introducido en el veh&#237;culo policial.

<p>Mr. Gan was detained on 12 November 2004 in 
Chencun town, Shunde District, Guangdong

<p>appealed; on 28 December 2005, the 
Guangdong Province Higher Court upheld his 
sentence. In April 2006, Gan Jinhua was 
granted a last-minute reprieve as the 
Guangdong Province Higher Court sent his 
case back for a retrial, but on 18 April 2008 
Gan was again convicted and sentenced to 
death by the Foshan City Intermediate People&#8217;s 
Court. Gan Jinhua appealed, but in December 
2009 the Guangdong Higher People's Court 
upheld the ruling.  Mr. Gan&#8217;s case is currently 
before the Supreme People&#8217;s Court for review 
of the death sentence. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gan was convicted and sentenced to death 
primarily on the strength of his confession. 
This confession was obtained after Mr. Gan 
had been prevented from sleeping for more 
than three days, interrogated over the course of 
more than one hundred hours, from 8 a.m. on 
12 November to 11 p.m. on 16 November 
2004, and threatened by the police while being 
questioned. As a result, there are glaring 
inconsistencies between Mr. Gan&#8217;s confession 
and the other evidence in the case, amongst 
others with regard to the way the robber 
entered and left the crime scene and the 
weapon used for the killing. Other 
inconsistencies concern the record of Mr. Gan's 
interrogation on 15 November 2004. It states 
that it took place in the Shunde Detention 
Center, but Mr. Gan&#8217;s wife, mother, and sister 
visited him that evening in the Chencun Police 
Station. Mr. Gan also stated that part of his 
statement was written by a policeman, who 
forced him to sign without allowing him to 
look at its content.   
</p>
<p>In the course of Mr. Gan&#8217;s final retrial, his 
wife, mother, and elder sister were prevented 
from testifying by the presiding judge,

<p>Mr. Gao Zhisheng was taken away from his 
home on 4 February 2009, and has been held at 
an unknown location since then. In your reply 
dated 1 April 2009, you indicated that Mr. 
Zhisheng was serving his probationary term in 
Beijing. In February 2010, however, the 
Chinese Embassy in the United States of 
America indicated that Mr. Zhisheng was 
working in Urumqi and had regular access to 
his family. The Foreign Ministry stated that 
&#8220;the relevant judicial authorities have decided 
this case&#8221; and Mr. Zhisheng, &#8220;according to 
Chinese law is where he should be.&#8221; However, 
his wife has indicated that she had not been 
able to contact him. According to recent 
statements made by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Mr. Zhisheng had been sentenced to 
prison for subversion, although it is unclear if 
this concerns his 2006 conviction for 
incitement to subversion or if a new conviction 
has been handed down. Mr. Zhisheng was 
released shortly after his 2006 conviction after 
he confessed. However, he later indicated that 
the confession had been coerced under threats 
by the state security personnel.  
</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Mr. Zhisheng&#8217;s fate and 
whereabouts remain unknown, concern is 
expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. Further concern is expressed that Mr. 
Zhisheng&#8217;s arrests in 2006 and 2009 may be 
directly related to his meeting with me during 
my country visit in 2005, despite the

<p>Concerning Ms. Mao Hengfeng who has been 
the subject of several communications since

appeal sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances; the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right 
to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context; and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment on 23 April 2010. No reply has 
been received from your Excellency's 
Government as of today. Ms. Mao was also 
interviewed during the mission to China of the 
Special Rapporteur on torture (see 
E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, Appendix 3, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>In March 2010, Ms. Mao Hengfeng was 
sentenced to 18 months re-education through 
labour for &#8220;disturbing social order&#8221;. On 27 
April, she was transferred to the Anhui

Labour Facility. On 21 July, her appeal was 
heard behind closed doors. During the hearing, 
Ms. Mao indicated that she had been beaten 
repeatedly since her transfer to the Anhui

so by the officers. She was also kept in 
unsanitary conditions, where she was 
prohibited from using the toilets or showers. 
As a result, she suffers from a skin infection. 
Ms. Mao&#8217;s family has not been allowed to see 
her, but despite her appeal being heard behind

<p>Concerning Mr. Guo Xiaojun, a Falun Gong 
practitioner from Shanghai.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Xiaojun is a 40-year-old resident in 
Room 504, N&#176; 1 Lane 880 Cangyuan road, 
Minhang District, Shanghai. He started 
practicing Falun Gong in 1997. Guo Xiaojun 
worked formerly as a lecturer in the Computer 
Science Department of Shanghai Jiaotong 
University, however, he was dismissed in 2001 
after his arrest and conviction for having 
distributed literature about Falun Gong. On 16 
December 2004, Guo Xiaojun was released 
from a labour camp. 
</p>
<p>On 7 January 2010, Guo Xiaojun was re-
arrested by the police of the Domestic Security 
Division, Baoshan District Public Security 
Bureau. Several policemen searched his home 
and confiscated his laptop computer, mobile 
phone, books and other personal belongings. 
Guo Xiaojun has since been detained in the 
Shanghai Baoshan District Detention Center. 
</p>
<p>On 18 January 2010, the director of the 
Domestic Security Division, Mr. Qiu Feng, and 
another policeman whose family name is Peng 
took Guo Xiaojun into a special interrogation 
room in the Baoshan District Detention Center

<p>and interrogated him from 2:15 p.m. to 5:00 
p.m. Subsequently, Guo Xiaojun was taken 
into another special interrogation room in the 
Detention Center and was interrogated non-
stop by a team of policemen lead by Qiu Feng 
from 5:45 p.m. on 18 January 2010 to 2:30 
p.m. the following day without being allowed 
to sleep. The police allegedly forced him to 
confess through sleep deprivation and by 
refusing to provide him with food. When Guo 
Xiaojun tried to support his head with his 
hands, Qiu Feng violently pushed away his 
hands. Furthermore, the police reportedly 
threatened to arrest his wife Xu Wenxin, who 
is also a Falun Gong practitioner, and to send 
their young child back to his hometown if Guo 
Xiaojun did not confess. 
</p>
<p>In February 2010, his defense attorney, Mr. 
Liang Xiaojun, terminated the contract with 
Guo Xiaojun under the threats of the Beijing 
Judicial Bureau. One official of the Beijing 
Judicial Bureau had reportedly warned Liang 
Xiaojun that he could no longer practice as a 
lawyer if he continued to represent Guo 
Xiaojun. 
</p>
<p>On 6 July 2010, the Shanghai Baoshan District 
Court tried Guo Xiaojun and sentenced him to 
four years&#8217; imprisonment. The basis of the 
conviction was Guo Xiaojun&#8217;s confession 
obtained through threats and ill-treatment. Guo 
Xiaojun declared he would retract his 
confession and said that this confession was 
obtained through threats and torture, however, 
his speech was cut short by the judge. Guo 
Xiajun has appealed against the court verdict. 
His wife also filed complaints with the police, 
the court and prosecutors, however, the 
authorities have reportedly not responded to 
those complaints. </p>

</p>
<p>Mr. Jeong Sang-un, aged 84, crossed the 
border from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea to China in September 2009. Shortly 
after arrival, he was detained by the Chinese 
authorities in Jilin Province, and kept in 
detention until he was forcibly returned to the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in 
February 2010. Once in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Mr. Jeong Sang-
un was sent to Yodok prison camp in South 
Hamkyung Province, without having faced a 
trial. 
</p>
<p>At the time when Mr. Jeong Sang-un was 
forcibly returned, he was in poor health and 
needed assistance to walk. The information 
received indicates that food and medication are 
insufficient at Yodok prison camp. It is also 
believed that torture is widespread, and that 
death in custody is common due to the hard 
and dangerous labour they are forced to 
perform, with very little rest.

<p>In light of the above, concern is expressed for 
the physical integrity of Mr. Jeong Sang-un.

meet his client only once, in July 2009, who 
informed him that he had been severely 
tortured while in detention to extract a 
confession, and that he would plead not guilty 
during his trial.

<p>On 28 December 2009, the provincial court in

six years imprisonment. The trial was 
reportedly held in secret. The Chinese

nor about the verdict.

<p>Li Feng, male, born 10 October 1963, Han 
nationality, junior middle school educational 
level, peasant from Quti Village, Quizhou 
Town, Anguo City, Baoding Municipality,

People&#8217;s Court in Hebei Province to a term of 
15 years&#8217; imprisonment (4 October 2002 to 3 
October 2017) for having committed the 
crime of employing a cult to organize the 
sabotage of law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>On 15 October 2003, Li was sent to Baoding 
prison to serve his sentence, and was 
transferred on 22 October to a prison on the 
northern outskirts of Shijiazhuang. Because 
Li suffered from hypertension and coronary 
heart disease, the prison authorities were 
seriously concerned regarding his continuing 
poor health, and had him promptly 
hospitalized for treatment (medical records 
attached). The major incidents are as follows: 
</p>
<p>Hospitalization: Li Feng was hospitalized in 
prison infirmary for four days from 12 to 16 
January 2006 and released after his 
hypertension and coronary heart disease 
conditions improved; he was again 
hospitalized in the prison infirmary for 46 
days from 3 February to 13 March 2008 and 
again released after his hypertension and 
coronary heart disease condition improved. Li 
has again been hospitalized for treatment in

<p>hypertension, gastritis and reflux 
oesophagitis, and is being treated with 
intravenous fluids and medications. 
</p>
<p>Outpatient treatments: When Li suddenly 
fainted in January 2005, the prison promptly 
arranged to have him treated at the provincial 
people&#8217;s hospital; because he was frequently 
vomiting, the prison arranged outpatient 
treatment for him on 10 November and 19 
December 2008, during which his gastritis 
and reflux oesophagitis were revealed by a 
CT scan. 
</p>
<p>On 3 March 2009, Li was admitted to the 
prison infirmary for dizziness, shortness of 
breath and coughing; he was diagnosed with 
hypertension, myocardial ischemia and an 
upper-respiratory infection, and was treated 
with oral medications. 
</p>
<p>On 6 May 2009, he was admitted to the 
prison infirmary for intermittent pain in the 
left thorax. He was diagnosed with an 
obsolescent myocardial infarction and treated 
with oral medications.  
</p>
<p>On 16 September 2009, he was admitted to 
the prison infirmary form recurrent chest 
constriction and shortness of breath; the 
diagnosis was hypertension and he was 
treated with oral medication. 
</p>
<p>After his incarceration, Li has been visited by 
family members 30 times in the period from 
29 October 2004 to date. From 2006 to the 
present, there have been six or seven visits 
per year. Currently, Li Feng&#8217;s speech and 
thought processes are clear, he walks 
normally, and his health condition has 
stabilized. The assertions that Li Feng has 
been tortured and denied visits from family 
members are contrary to the facts. </p>

<p>On 31 March 2006, Yu was approved for a 
two-year, six-month term of re-education 
through labour by the Beijing Municipal Re-
education Through Labour Administrative 
Committee. On 26 June 2006, Yu applied to 
the Beijing Municipal People&#8217;s Government 
for an administrative review of that decision; 
the Beijing Municipal People&#8217;s Government 
accepted the case for investigation, and 
upheld the original decision with regard to the 
applicant&#8217;s re-education through labour. 
Because his domicile of origin was Hebei 
Province, Yu was transferred into the re-
education through labour camp at Masanjia in 
Hebei Province on 21 may 2007. Yu had 
engaged in a hunger strike for a time at the 
Tuanhe labour camp in Beijing, and 
continued to refuse to eat after being 
transferred to the Masanjia labour camp. On 
28 May 2007, he was sent to the hospital at 
the re-education through labour centre in 
Liaoning Province for treatment; after a full 
physical examination, he was diagnosed with 
malnutrition, level-III dehydration and acute 
coronary syndrome. The hospital provided 
him with enhanced nutrition, fluid 
replacement and treatment of his symptoms. 
In 2008, having fully recovered and been 
released from the hospital, Yu was returned to 
the Masanjia camp after a hospital stay of a 
year and three months. 
</p>
<p>On numerous occasions while in the hospital, 
Yu clandestinely contacted Wang Yu (a drug

Dejun (sentenced to re-education through 
labour for employing cults, secret societies 
and superstitious activities to endanger 
society) escaped after sawing through the 
steel bars on a labour camp dormitory 
window. Yu also contacted his wife Ma Li, 
who provided Wang and Zui with a hiding 
place. In accordance with the provisions of 
article 24, paragraph 1 (1) (the re-education 
through labour terms of persons who escape 
or organize, incite or assist other to escape are 
to be extended by three months or more) and 
paragraph 2 (5) (the re-education through

apart from a period of treatment in the

strike, Yu remained in that camp from the 
time he was transferred there from the Beijing 
Tuanhe labour camp on 21 May 2007 until

<p>with] the legal system, and there is no 
evidence that he was ever sent to a 
brainwashing centre at Luotaishanzhuang in 
Fushun City. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of his family 
members allegedly being refused permission 
to visit him, investigation indicates that from 
May 2007 to his release form hospital and 
return to the labour camp in August 2008, he 
received visits from members of his family as 
normal; such visits were subsequently 
terminated, however, because members of his 
family had facilitated his escape. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of an alleged &#8220;suicide 
note&#8221;, the labour camp had arranged for more 
than a year of hospitalization and treatment 
for the effects of his refusal of food and water 
as well as for his acute coronary syndrome, 
and he was not returned to the camp until he 
had recovered. Yu wrote a statement of 
repentance on 1 October 2008. Te allegation 
that he had been forced to write a &#8220;suicide 
note&#8221; while in the labour camp has no basis in 
fact. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of the alleged solitary 
confinement, investigation indicates that for 
structural reasons, even now there are no 
solitary-confinement facilities at the Masanjia 
labour camp, so the accusation that Yu was 
held in solitary confinement has no basis in 
fact. There is also no evidence of his ever 
having been subjected to corporal punishment 
or maltreatment.

<p>33.     Mr. Xu Zhiyong, 
(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 38.) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 28/12/2009, the Government 
indicated that discoveries made by the Beijing 
municipal tax authorities in the course of 
routine tax survey work led them to suspect 
&#8220;Gongmeng Company&#8221; of tax evasion. After 
repeated investigations, they determined that 
the company owed a total of 248,245.52 yuan 
remaining in unpaid corporate income tax, 
enterprise tax and urban maintenance and 
construction tax. On the basis of the 
provisions of the Corporate Income Tax Law 
of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the Law of 
the People&#8217;s Republic of China on the 
Administration of Tax Collection, and the 
Supplementary Provisions of the Standing 
Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress 
Concerning the Imposition of Punishments in 
Respect of Offenses of Tax Evasion and 
Refusal to Pay Tax, the tax agency 
demanded, in strict accordance with the 
relevant procedure, that &#8220;Gongmeng 
Company&#8221; pay the overdue taxes by a set 
deadline, and fined the company in the 
amount of 1,241,227.60 yuan renminbi for 
tax evasion. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gongmeng Company&#8221; refused to accept the 
administrative decision taken by the tax 
authorities, and applied for administrative 
reconsideration. The tax authorities held 
hearings on 24 and 30 July 2009, with the 
participation of relevant &#8220;Gongmeng 
Company&#8221; staff; after giving a full hearing to 
the views of the defendants, the tax 
authorities found that the charges of tax 
evasion had merit and upheld the decision to 
impose the penalty. Because the &#8220;Gongmeng 
Company&#8221; had failed to pay the taxes within 
the prescribed period, the tax agency referred 
the &#8220;Gongmeng Company&#8221; case to the public </p>

<p>security agency in accordance with the law 
for investigation as a case of suspected tax 
evasion. As the corporate representative and 
cashier respectively of the &#8220;Gongmeng 
Company&#8221;, Xu and Zhuang were lawfully 
subjected to coercive measures [arrest and 
detention] and investigation by the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the 
&#8220;Gongmeng Company&#8221; repaid a portion of 
the taxes and fines in accordance with the 
repayment plan demanded by the tax 
authorities and undertook a commitment to 
repay the remainder, on 22 and 23 August the 
public security authorities completed legal 
procedures for the release of Xu and Zhuang 
on bail pending trial. Xu has expressed 
remorse for the tax evasion, and has written 
an &#8220;acknowledgement of the tax evasion by 
the Gongmeng Company&#8221;, expressing his 
willingness to assume corresponding legal 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>2. The &#8220;Gongmeng Law Research Centre&#8221; is 
an entity that the &#8220;Gongmeng Company&#8221; set 
up illegally and did not register with the Civil 
Affairs Department; it had presumptuously 
begun operating in the guise of a &#8220;private 
non-enterprise organization&#8221; in violation of 
the relevant legal provisions. Once the fact of 
that offence had been clearly confirmed with 
irrefutable evidence, the Beijing Municipal 
Civil Affairs Bureau proceeded to ban the 
&#8220;Gongmeng Law Research Centre&#8221;, lawfully 
seizing and confiscating the materials and 
objects used by the Centre for its illegal 
activities. Xu signed the return receipt of the 
written decision of the ban, and admitted that 
the organization had begun operating without 
being duly registered.

Coercive measures were lawfully applied to 
Xu and Zhuang in consequence of their tax 
evasion and thus have nothing to do with 
human rights issues. During the period in 
which they were subject to these coercive 
measures, all the rights and interests of Xu 
and Zhuang were guaranteed in accordance

<p>At the time when Mr. Jeong Sang-un was 
forcibly returned, he was in poor health and 
needed assistance to walk. The information 
received indicates that food and medication are 
insufficient at Yodok prison camp. It is also 
believed that torture is widespread, and that 
death in custody is common due to the hard 
and dangerous labour all detainees are forced 
to perform, with very little rest.

</p>
<p>On 6 June 2010, Mr. Said, aged 28, was 
dragged out of an internet caf&#233; in Alexandria 
by two plain-clothes police officers and 
severely beaten. According to the account of 
several witnesses, as a result of the violent 
beatings received, Mr. Said lost consciousness 
and felt to the ground where the two police 
officers brutally kicked him on the head and 
face until he died. The two police officers 
reportedly took the body of Mr. Said into their 
vehicle and left the scene only to come back a 
few minutes later to throw his body on the 
pavement.  
</p>
<p>The relatives of Mr. Said were informed of his 
death but they were prevented from seeing his 
body immediately. They were reportedly taken 
to Sidi Gaber police station by the police 
officers and told that Mr. Said had swallowed a 
bag of narcotics when the police approached 
him and died from the overdose.

<p>Said had died from a drug overdose. 
</p>
<p>A few days after the death of Mr. Said, 
shocking pictures of the victim&#8217;s dead body 
were distributed through the internet. On 12 
June 2010, the Ministry of Interior issued a 
statement indicating that Mr. Said died as a 
result of asphyxiation from swallowing a bag 
of narcotics. Further the statement condemned 
the posting of these pictures as an attempt to 
tarnish the image of the Egyptian security 
forces.  
</p>
<p>On 14 June 2010, the Prosecutor ordered a new 
medical examination to be carried out under 
the supervision of three forensic doctors to 
establish the causes of death. We are informed 
that the two police officers who are believed to 
have killed Mr. Said, continue to discharge 
their functions.  
</p>
<p>On 6 June 2010, Mr. Abdelsami&#8217; Saber 
Abdelsami, aged 60, was arrested on Ali 
Ameen Street in Nasr city, by members of the 
Nasr Police Department who were dressed in 
civilian clothing. He was transferred to Nasr 
Police Department and charged with insulting a 
police officer. It is alleged that Mr. Abdelsami 
died a few days later as a result of severe 
beatings while he was in custody.  
</p>
<p>On 7 June 2010, the public prosecutor called 
for the immediate release of Mr. Abdelsami. 
However, State Security Intelligence (SSI) of 
Nasr Police Department did not comply with 
the order.  
</p>
<p>It has been reported that Mr. Abdelsami was 
beaten at length during his detention, which is 
what would have led to his death. On 9 June 
2010, his family was able to visit him in prison 
and they noticed that Mr. Abdelsami was in a 
bad shape and looked as he had been hit. He 
reportedly told them that he was being beaten </p>

<p>The five men are being detained 
incommunicado in SSI's Nasr City sites. It is 
claimed that the five men were subjected to 
torture by the SSI agents who were trying to 
force them to confess to belonging to a banned 
movement allegedly wishing to overthrow the 
Government in Egypt. 
</p>
<p>The five men were forced to remain standing 
for many days and were prevented from 
sleeping. According to the information 
received, they were regularly severely beaten 
and on many occasions were given electric 
shocks on sensitive parts of their bodies. 
Former detainees in SSI's Nasr City sites allege 
that a near-majority of detainees in SSI's Nasr 
sites were subjected to torture.

<p>Concerning the situation of Mr. Adam Yahya 
Abdellah Khalil Haouli, aged 37, who fled to 
Egypt following the civil war in Sudan in 2002. 
Mr. Haouli, a United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) card 
holder since 2004, is married with three 
children, and lives in Al Jeeza, Egypt where he 
works as a street vendor.  
</p>
<p>On 30 December 2009, at night, Mr. Haouli 
was allegedly arrested at his home by State 
Security Investigation (SSI) agents who were 
wearing their official uniforms. It is reported 
that the SSI agents present a judicial warrant 
nor did they explain the reason for Mr. 
Haouli&#8217;s arrest. They reportedly searched the 
house and confiscated various personal 
belongings, including mobile phones, 
computers, jewelry, a sum of 400 Egyptian

<p>USD. It is further reported that the SSI agents 
tied up Mr. Haouli and severely beat him in 
front of his family. He was reportedly taken to 
the SSI premises in Al Jeeza where he was held 
until 24 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that on 31 December 2009, when 
Mr. Haouli&#8217;s wife went to Boulak Al Dekour 
police station to file a complaint, she was not 
given any assistance and was asked to leave the 
police station.  
</p>
<p>On 24 January 2010, Mr. Haouli was 
reportedly transferred to the SSI premises in 
Nasr City where he was held in 
incommunicado and secret detention for 82 
days. On 15 April 2010, Mr. Haouli was 
accused by the State Security Court of 
belonging to a banned group which was 
allegedly involved in facilitating the transfer of 
African refugees to Israel. It is claimed that the 
prosecutor based his allegations on evidence 
allegedly obtained by torture. Mr. Haouli was 
reportedly taken to Tarah prison before being 
transferred back to the SSI premises in Al 
Jeeza where he is currently facing extradition 
to Sudan. It is claimed that Mr. Haouli fled to 
Egypt fearing persecution in Sudan during the 
civil war and that he would be in danger of 
being subjected to torture, if he is expelled to 
Sudan. 
</p>
<p>It is also reported that while in detention in 
Nasr City, Mr. Haouli was allegedly subjected 
to electric shocks on different parts of his body, 
forced to stand for long periods of time in 
various positions, deprived of sleep and beaten 
until he lost consciousness. It is further 
reported that Mr. Haouli was threatened with 
sexual assault if he did not confess to allegedly 
assisting other African refugees in fleeing the 
country. It is reported that Mr. Haouli was

<p>In view of above mentioned allegations of 
torture to which Mr. Haouli was reportedly 
subjected to while in detention, concern is 
expressed about Mr. Haouli&#8217;s physical and 
psychological integrity. Further concern is 
expressed that Mr. Haouli could eventually 
face harsh sentences on the basis of evidence

</p>
<p>By letter dated  14/01/2010, the Government 
indicated that Dr. Ashraf Abdel Ghaffar was 
not arrested on account of his membership of 
the banned organization of the Muslim 
Brotherhood but was detained on remand in 
connection with case No. 404 of 2009 
concerning higher State security (better 
known as the International Organization 
case), in respect of which he was charged 
with the offence of laundering funds obtained 
through donations collected abroad and 
channelling them into the funding of 
activities of the organization of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in Egypt. 
</p>
<p>2. Dr. Ashraf Abdel Ghaffar was not held in 
arbitrary or incommunicado detention, as 
alleged in the appeal, but was arrested and 
detained on remand in connection with the 
case. He enjoyed all legal and judicial 
guarantees prescribed by Egyptian legislation 
in respect of pre-trial detention and by the 
rules of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
governing the proper implementation of

indicated that Ms. Medhine, an Ethiopian 
national whose full name is Medhine Hadish 
Kafi, was arrested while trying to cross 
illegally into Israel via Egypt, contrary to the 
claim in the urgent appeal that she was 
seeking asylum in Egypt and was arrested at 
the border between Egypt and the Sudan. The 
Egyptian authorities took appropriate legal 
measures to deal with her and placed her in 
Qanatar Women&#8217;s Prison pending 
deportation, as she had breached Egyptian 
law by entering the country illegally with a 
view to going to Israel. These measures were 
taken after consultations with officials at the 
Ethiopian Embassy in Cairo. The deportation 
process was suspended and Ms. Medhine was 
given permission to contact the Cairo bureau

<p>Refugees (UNHCR) and to present her case 
to UNHCR in order to explore the possibility 
of her filing an asylum application and to 
determine what kind of international 
protection she might need. 
</p>
<p>UNHCR officials interviewed Ms. Medhine 
on 9 and 22 November and again on 3 
December 2009, at the headquarters of the 
Passports, Immigration and Nationality 
Department. The relevant Egyptian 
authorities were subsequently informed, 
based on these interviews, that the UNHCR 
bureau in Cairo considered Ms. Medhine 
Hadish Kafi to meet the criteria for refugee 
status, defined in the international standards 
set out in article 1 A. (2) of the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 
and that UNHCR intended to explore more 
durable and appropriate solutions for her, 
including resettlement. 
</p>
<p>On 26 December 2009, Galila Ibrahani (Ms. 
Medhine&#8217;s daughter), who was with her 
mother in prison, began to haemorrhage 
blood from the mouth and the anus, and to 
experience breathing difficulties. She was 
found to have an enlarged kidney and spleen. 
She was taken straight away to Abu al-Rish 
Children&#8217;s Hospital for treatment, but she 
died from a number of chronic illnesses, 
while being treated at a specialized medical 
facility and not, as the appeal claims, in 
prison. The matter was recorded in Sayyida 
Zainab police station administrative report 
No. 7091.

<p>and lack of medical care, we should like to 
point out that the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor, an independent judicial body, 
oversees and inspects prisons and detention 
facilities to ensure that full legal guarantees 
are afforded to prisoners and persons in 
detention. A total of 179 inspections have 
been carried out since February 2008. In this 
connection, we must point out that Egyptian 
law does not distinguish between Egyptian 
and foreign prisoners with regard to the 
exercise of all the rights and guarantees 
provided under Egyptian law in accordance 
with Act No. 368 of 1956, concerning the 
regulation of prisons, and other related laws. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, no person seeking political asylum 
in Egypt can be deported, except in 
accordance with the rules laid down in the 
1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees. The Egyptian Constitution 
furthermore prohibits the expulsion of 
political refugees. Egypt will continue to 
follow the path which it has taken for decades 
of abiding by the international treaties on 
refugees and cooperating closely with the 
UNHCR bureau in Cairo, notwithstanding the 
large number of refugees and immigrants 
which Egypt receives and the burden on its 
economy, infrastructure and limited 
resources: Egypt hosts not just 41,481 
registered refugees and asylum-seekers but 
between 3.5 and 4 million Sudanese 
nationals.

workers, in particular Mr. Temesghen 
Gebreyesus, Mr. Mattewos Habteab, Mr. 
Seyoum Tsehaye and Mr. Dawit Isaac and the 
conditions of their detention. Dawit Issaac, 
Temesghen Gebreyesus and Mattewos Habteab 
were the subject of a communication of 12 
August 2009 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders. To date, no reply has been

Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
Similarly, no response to this letter has been

Gebreyesus, a sports journalist and member of 
the board of the biweekly Keste Debena, and 
Mr. Mattewos Habteab, cofounder and editor 
of the biweekly Maqaleh, were both transferred 
to a prison in the Dahlak Islands. Reports 
suggest that detainees in this penitentiary 
facility are kept in solitary confinement in 
underground cells, in which the heat is 
unbearable. It appears that very few prisoners 
have returned alive from that prison upon the 
expiration of their sentences.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Seyoum Tsehaye, a freelance reporter and 
photographer, who is the former head of the

unknown places of detention. In 2009, he was 
taken to the air force hospital in Asmara. Most

<p>Concerning  Mr. Tsotne Gamsakhurdia.On 8 
April 2010, Mr. Tsotne Gamsakhurdia was 
sentenced to nine years and six months&#8217; 
imprisonment by the First Instant Court of 
Georgia for attempted murder, illegal purchase 
and possession of weapons. There was 
reportedly no evidence with regard to the last 
two charges.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Gamsakhurdia was held in solitary 
confinement since his arrest in early 2010. He 
is kept in isolation and only allowed to walk 
outside once or twice per week, without seeing 
any other detainees. Seven months after he was 
detained and after filing several requests, he 
was granted access to a radio and allowed to 
see his family once a month. However, since 7 
July 2010, he has been denied the possibility of 
seeing his family, for allegedly trying to bribe 
the medical personnel in the prison. Mr. 
Gamsakhurdia&#8217;s conversations with the 
medical personnel were recorded by prison 
officials and later aired on public television, 
</p>
<p>By letter dated  15/12/2010, the Government 
indicated that the relevant authorities took all 
efforts to provide Mr. Gamsalthurdia with all 
rights that prisoners have, including 
safeguarding an state of health, providing him 
with necessary dietary meals, unimpeded full 
medical assistance, meeting with members of 
family, lawyer etc. Since his detention, 
however, Mr. Gamsalthurdia refused to take 
meals, medicaments, declined offers to 
undergo medical examinations and blamed 
prison staff in ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>The MCLA General inspection undertook full 
investigation in order to inquire Mr.

<p>Gamsakhurdla&#8217;s allegations and we would 
like to present the detailed information below: 
</p>

only once or twice per week however, in 
reality he similar to other prisoners, spends at 
least one hour per day on fresh air and has the </p>

<p>where he appeared in his underwear. A 
criminal investigation was reportedly initiated 
in this regard, with the possibility of adding 
three more years of imprisonment to his 
sentence.  
</p>
<p>After Mr. Gamsakhurdia declared himself on a 
hunger strike, his cell was raided and his 
belongings were taken away by the prison 
staff. Since his imprisonment in April 2010, he 
has reportedly been denied the possibility of 
filing a complaint or giving a written complaint 
to his lawyer, as they are always destroyed in 
front of him. During a family visit, his mother 
was intimidated and forced to return a letter to 
her son.  
</p>
<p>On 4 August 2010, Mr. Gamsakhurdia was 
exposed to a non-stop audio in his cell. It had 
allegedly been tested on him earlier but with 
less intensity and for shorter periods of time.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Gamsakhurdia&#8217;s defense lawyer has filed 
complaints with the Court of Appeal and the 
European Court of Human Rights regarding his 
alleged arbitrary detention and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Tsotne

<p>possibility to communicate with other 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>It was also mentioned that Mr. Gamsalthurdia 
cell was raided; his belongings were taken 
away and he was deprived of his right to have 
press, correspondence and telephone calls. 
These allegations are not substantiated by the 
facts. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gamsalthurdia is also claiming that he 
has been denied the possibility of meeting 
with his lawyer, filling a complaint or giving 
a written complaint, as they are always 
destroyed in front of him. The Ministry, if 
necessary, is ready to present relevant records 
from the journal of registry drawn up since 
the detention of Mr. Gamsalthurdia. These 
records are clear evidence that since his 
detention of Mr. Gamsalthurdia had met his 
defense counsels approximately 90 times. 
Moreover, Mr. Gamsalthurdia had met his 
Priest 23 times. These meetings are private; 
prison staff has no right to attend those 
meeting. Accordingly, Mr. Tsotne 
Gamsalthurdia has the opportunity to give 
written complains and/or oral messages to his 
lawyer, at any time.  
</p>
<p>As for medical examinations, let us remind 
you that Mr. Gamsalthurdia was arrested and 
accommodated at Tbilisi prison # 8 on 30 
October 2009. This is a newly constructed 
building which was officially opened in 2007. 
The conditions in the above mentioned prison 
institution is in line with international 
standards. The same day he went on a hunger 
strike. 
</p>
<p>Due to his refusal to stop the hunger strike, he 
was placed at the Medical Establishment for

<p>requisite diet and medical assistance. The 
same day the medical personnel of the 
Medical Establishment for inmates and 
Convicts drew up a plan of medical 
examinations for the assessment of his state 
of health. While being under the constant 
supervision of the medical specialists Mr. 
Gamsalthurdia continued refusing meal and 
requisite medications, though the doctors 
made every effort to persuade him to 
terminate hunger strike. He was informed on 
daily basis about the effect of a hunger strike 
on his state of health.  
</p>
<p>Along with refusal to take meal and 
medications, he also refused to be consulted 
by a psychologist or undergo medical 
examinations. In order to assure interested 
party in the noted information, we are ready 
to present records of his medical history.Mr. 
Gamsalthurdia voluntarily terminated a 
hunger strike on 4 December 2009. 
Remaining under the permanent supervision 
of the medical personnel he had undergone 
various examinations: It is noteworthy that 
despite termination of the hunger strike he 
refused to take medicines and declines every 
offer to be examined by the medical 
personnel. 
</p>
<p>On 25 December 2009, Mr. Gamsalthurdia 
went on hunger strike again. He refused to 
receive both meals and medicine. On 9 
February, 2010, he refused to give consent on 
all kind of medical assistance or examination. 
MCLA would like to note that Mr. 
Gamsalthurdia remained under the 
supervision of the medical personnel all the 
time, he was every day advised to take 
medicines and meals, but to no avail. He had 
undergone a consultation with specialist 
medical personnel. However, he refused to </p>

</p>
<p>He terminated hunger striking on 27 February 
2010 and proceeded on receiving meals. 
Despite the advice of the medical personnel 
co receive meals with small rations; Mr. 
Gamsalthurdia neglected the mentioned 
advice. Mr. Gamsalthurdia remained under 
the permanent supervision of the medical 
personnel. It is noteworthy that despite 
termination of the hunger strike he refused to 
take medicines. The Ministry would like to 
inform you that the he decided, again, to go 
on a hunger strike on 3 May 2010. He 
declined, again, all the offers to receive 
meals, medicines prescribed for him and to be 
administered with medical assistance of the 
medical personnel. 
</p>
<p>On 14 June 2010 Mr. Gamsalthurdia began to 
receive sweet tea. On 21, 22, 23 and 24 June 
he received meals (breakfast, dinner and 
supper). On 25 June 2010 he again went on a 
hunger strike and was receiving only sweet 
tea. 
</p>
<p>The fact that until this day, he refuses to 
undergo any kind of medical treatment, 
except 
</p>
<p>Dental, makes it apparent that Mr. 
Gamsalthurdia has no genuine interest in 
medical examinations or treatment and his

<p>Concerning the situation of Dr. &#193;gnes Ger&#233;b, 
an obstetrician, gynecologist and midwife, 
founder of the Napvil&#225;g Birthing Centre, and 
advocate for women&#8217;s home-birth rights in

<p>expectant parents. 
</p>
<p>Dr. &#193;gnes Ger&#233;b is currently imprisoned on 
charges of endangering life during the exercise 
of her profession following arrest on 5 October 
</p><p>2010. It is alleged that Dr. Ger&#233;b, who is 59 
years old, has been subjected to humiliation 
and ill-treatment in detention since her arrest. 
</p>
<p>Dr. Ger&#233;b was arrested on 5 October 2010 at 
the Napvil&#225;g Birthing Centre, Alma utca, 
Budapest, after assisting the delivery of a 
premature child. It is reported that when the 
expectant mother &#8211; who had been advised by 
Dr. Ger&#233;b to give birth in hospital because of 
certain conditions present during the pregnancy 
&#8211; arrived at the Centre for a routine 
consultation and examination. It was found that 
she was in an advanced stage of labour, and the 
child was born extremely rapidly. An 
ambulance was immediately called as the 
midwives began to assist the mother. The 
ambulance arrived approximately twenty 
minutes later, followed by the police. 
</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the police demanded the 
identification papers of all persons present, 
including the father of the child, the health 
professionals, and families taking part in a 
parental class on the premises. Dr. Ger&#233;b and 
two other midwives were subsequently taken 
into custody. 
</p>
<p>It is alleged that, since her arrest, Dr. Ger&#233;b has 
been subjected to humiliation and ill-treatment 
while in detention. On 12 October 2010, Dr. 
Ger&#233;b appeared in an open court for the first 
time, restrained by both handcuffs and foot 
shackles. According to reports, the shackles 
were applied so tightly that they created a 
10cm open wound on her ankle, and Dr. 
Ger&#233;b&#8217;s requests for the shackles to be 
loosened had been denied. Upon being 
</p>
<p>of Justice on the rules of implementing  
custodial sentences and pre-trial detention, 
handcuffs, one-wrist cuff with strap held by 
the officer, and leg shackles have been 
applied as movement restriction tools. 
</p>
<p>The use of such combination of movement 
restriction tools has been decided by the 
prison authorities on the basis of the fact that 
the prisoner has been admitted only four days 
before, and the risk assessment has not yet 
been completed by that time. 
</p>
<p>Further reason of applying these measures 
was that the case of the detainee generated 
significant media attention and participation 
of unpredictable number of protesters have 
been expected in the area of operation. 
Therefore the prison authorities had to ensure 
safety taking into consideration such 
conditions.  
</p>
<p>It is a basic requirement toward the Prison 
Service that the prisoners should be kept 
safely in order to guarantee the success of 
criminal procedure as a whole and individual 
procedural actions thereof. To this end, it can 
exclusively apply means regulated by law, 
and upon application thereof individual 
circumstances should be taken into 
consideration, as well.  Accordingly, relevant 
regulation on using movement restriction 
tools requires individual decision in each case 
based on the assessment of the detainee 
concerned.  Application of security measures 
may have seemed exaggerated from an 
external point of view, however taken into 
account that neither the reaction of the 
detainee, nor that of the public were not 
foreseeable, the measures for application of 
movement restriction tools cannot be 
challenged from the point of view of security, 
and they neither infringed the applicable </p>

<p>questioned by the judge as to whether the 
shackles were necessary, in light of the fact 
that she had made no attempt to escape, Dr. 
G&#233;reb&#8217;s guards replied that &#8220;it had been 
ordered&#8221;. Furthermore, a member of a 
Hungarian political party who visited Dr. 
Ger&#233;b in detention has reported that Dr. Ger&#233;b 
is subjected to nude, full body cavity searches 
before and after receiving visitors. It is 
reported that the authorities have since 
prevented any further visits to Dr. Ger&#233;b from 
parliamentary representatives. Dr. Ger&#233;b is  
granted only one visit a month from family 
members, and one ten-minute phone call per 
week. 
</p>
<p>In January 1998, Hungarian Parliamentary 
Civil Rights Commissioner, Dr. P&#233;ter Polt, 
ruled that women have the right to choose to 
give birth at home, and that the State is obliged 
to regulate home births. The decision was 
based in the woman's right to self-
determination in accordance with, inter alia, 
Articles 8, 54, 66 and 70/D of the Hungarian 
Constitution. However, it is reported that the 
State&#8217;s continued refusal to regulate home birth 
serves to de facto criminalize the work of 
independent midwives such as Dr. Ger&#233;b. The 
Hungarian Public Health Authority (ANTSZ) 
requires independent midwives to have one of 
their licenses to legally work in a home 
environment; however, such licenses are 
allegedly not granted, as successive 
Governments have failed to recognize 
independent midwives as a professional group, 
notwithstanding the aforementioned ruling. 
Consequently, while it is legal for a woman to 
give birth at home unassisted, it is illegal for 
her to do so with the help of an independent 
midwife. Before her arrest, four further cases 
involving Dr. Ger&#233;b and other midwives (all 
facing charges of &#8220;having endangered life 
</p>
<p>rules.   
</p>
<p>In the course of the court hearing, the judge 
ordered the prison service officer (being a 
woman) to remove the handcuffs. The judge 
also inquired the reason for applying the leg 
shackles, accepted the officer&#8217;s response 
related thereto and made no further decision 
on the removal of the leg shackles. According 
to Article 48 (5) of above mentioned Decree, 
the judge is fully authorised to decide on the 
use of movement restriction tools which must 
be executed by the prison service officer 
without consideration.  
</p>
<p>As the judge made no altering decision on the 
application of the leg shackles, the prison 
service officer made no omission in that 
respect.  
</p>
<p>It was only after the court hearing upon return 
to the prison premises that the detainee 
indicated to the prison service officer that the 
shackles stressed her right ankle. The tool has 
been removed immediately and the prisoner 
has been escorted to the medical unit.  
</p>
<p>The medical report, dated on the same day, 
describes the following injuries in connection 
with the use of leg shackles:   
</p>
<p>-light purple discoloured stripe, size of 7x4 
cm, on the skin of the right leg, interior ankle; 
</p>
<p>-superficial bruise, 2x0.5 cm on the right leg, 
posterior part of the ankle; 
</p>
<p>-reddish skin, size of 4x2 cm, with small red 
spots around, on the right foot exterior side. 
</p>
<p>On the command of the deputy governor of 
the prison, the medical examination has been 
repeated on 13 October 2010.  On the latter 
occasion the following injuries had been 
recorded: </p>

reportedly decided to hear all the cases together 
as a single case.  
</p>
<p>Serious concern is expressed at the physical 
and psychological integrity of Dr. Ger&#233;b given 
the allegations received indicating ill-treatment 
during her detention. Further concern is 
expressed that the arrest, detention, and 
charges against Dr. &#193;gnes Ger&#233;b may be 
related to her legitimate and peaceful activities 
in defense of human rights, more specifically, 
in defense of women&#8217;s rights.

around the right ankle in spots; 
</p>
<p>-on the right side of the Achilles&#8217; tendon of

treated with antiseptics. 
</p>
<p>The doctor anticipated 7-day healing period 
for these injuries as a normal healing 
procedure if there is no complication.  
</p>
<p>On admission, Dr. &#193;gnes Ger&#233;b has been 
submitted to the compulsory medical 
examination. The aim of such check-up is to 
examine and decide on whether the detainee 
can be admitted to community and to 
establish if there have been any visible 
injuries on the detainee.  Neither on this nor 
on any other occasion did Dr. Ger&#233;b have to 
undergo any body cavity search or strip fully 
naked.    
</p>
<p>The detainee&#8217;s connection with her family is 
normal; she regularly uses all authorised 
forms of maintaining connection with her 
family. She has received two parcels from her 
daughter on 27 October 2010 and has been 
visited by her mother and son once on 2 
November 2010.  Her legal representatives in 
the criminal case visited her in the place of 
detention 11 times.  
</p>
<p>Before every visit each prisoner should be 
searched by examination of the clothes,

shall be performed by an officer of the same 
sex and in a decent manner.

<p>The pre-trial detainees as well as the non-

<p>representatives. Within the 10 minutes 
duration they can launch as many calls as 
they wish. This possibility has been ensured 
to Dr. Ger&#233;b each time. 
</p>
<p>On 25t October 2010 at 16.05 hours two 
Members of the Hungarian Parliament 
representing the political party entitled as 
&#8220;Lehet M&#225;s a Politika&#8221; (abbreviated as 
&#8220;LMP&#8221;) wanted to visit the detainee, but they 
failed to present any document reflecting the 
aim of their visit. The deputy governor 
refused to give permission on the basis of the 
verdict of the Prosecutor Highest Office No. 
Bv. 2761/2009 issued on this matter. 
Accordingly, an MP can visit a pre-trial 
detainee in certain, justified cases even 
without the permission of the prosecutor or 
the judge as a member of a Parliament&#8217;s 
committee, if authorised and mandated with 
specific task by the Parliament&#8217;s committee 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>On 27 October 2010, the chairperson of the 
Committee of Human Rights, Minority, Civil 
and Religious Matters of the Parliament 
delegated two MPs to gain information on the 
conditions of Dr. Ger&#233;b&#8217;s arrest and 
detention, and to that end to maintain regular 
contact with Dr. Ger&#233;b. The letter of 
authorization was sent to the prison 
authorities. After issuance of the letter of 
authorization by the chairperson of the 
Committee of Human Rights, Minority, Civil 
and Religious Matters of the Parliament 
regular entries to and visits of, Dr. Ger&#233;b by 
the MPs are ensured by the prison authorities.  
</p>
<p>It can be concluded from the above that Dr. 
Ger&#233;b is currently under pre-trial detention, 
however Dr. Ger&#233;b has not been subjected to 
humiliation and ill-treatment in detention </p>

<p>since her arrest.  
</p>
<p>Dr. &#193;gnes Ger&#233;b has not submitted any 
complaint relating to her treatment in prison 
during her detention since her arrest. On 13 
October 2010, political party &#8220;LMP&#8221; 
submitted an interpellation to the Minister of 
Interior criticizing the alleged strip- and body 
cavity search, and the application of 
movement restriction tools, especially the use 
of leg shackles.  
</p>
<p>The State Secretary of the Ministry of Interior 
responded to the interpellation. On 14 
October 2010, the legal representative of the 
detainee addressed the governor of the prison 
concerning the circumstances of the court 
escort and the medical examination. The 
governor gave full response to the inquiry.  
</p>
<p>In relation to the interpellation, the Minister 
of Interior ordered the Director General of the 
Prison Service to carry out an investigation of 
the case. As a result, the application of 
movement restriction tools may have seemed 
as an exaggerated demonstration of force, 
however there was no infringement of 
regulations and rules in connection with their 
application.  
</p>
<p>Removal of the leg shackles was not 
specifically ordered by the judge at the court 
hearing. Consequently, the prison officer did 
not commit any omission.  
</p>
<p>As the detainee herself stated in the records, 
no strip-down search or body cavity 
examination had been carried out during her 
detention in the prison premises. 
</p>
<p>According to preliminary findings, 
examination of clothes including strip-down 
applied at the police arrest premises may have 
not been in full compliance with relevant </p>

<p>The Parliamentary Commissioner for Civil

Ger&#233;b, which is currently in progress. 
</p>
<p>The legal basis of arrest and detention are 
provided by Act XIX of 1998 on Criminal 
Proceedings. The legal provisions contained 
in the Act and the measures based on those 
provisions are fully compatible with

<p>53. India 23/12/09 AL TOR Concerning Mr B.M., aged approximately 16, 
son of Mr U.M., of Ghojadanga Paschim Para, 
Khalbedi and Mr A.A., aged 22, of Angrail 
Village, District North 24 Parganas, West 
Pengal.  
</p>
<p>On 10 June 2009, B.M. was approached by An 
officer from the Border Security Force 
(&#8220;BSF&#8221;), DIB, along with two other constables 
of Ghojadanga BSF Camp, Battalion-94, 
Company-A, Police Station-Basirhat, District: 
North 24 Parganas, as he was standing outside 
his home. The constables suspected B.M. of 
being a smuggler, as there was a group of 
smugglers crossing the Bidhyadhari Khal canal 
at that time. Mr M. was beaten by the 
constables on the spot, and was then forcibly 
taken to the Ghojadanga BSF Camp, and was 
beaten en route by a BSF Officer with a 
wooden stick. 
</p>
<p>Mr M.&#8217;s aunt witnessed the incident and 
together with Mr M.&#8217;s mother and two 
members of the Etinda Panitor Gram 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 6/04/2010, the Government of 
India indicated that it had examined the 
communication and found it to be inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>The investigation into the matter has shown 
that the subject was called for questioning to 
the local BSF post on 8 June 2009 at about 
1100hrs on suspicion of his involvement in 
smuggling activities but was left off the same 
evening. He was neither beaten nor ill-treated. 
In fact, the subject has no grievance against 
the BSF; neither has he lodged a complaint 
against the BSF nor is he aware of any such 
complaint on his behalf &#8211;something to which 
the subject has testified in writing. The matter 
only bears out the Government of India&#8217;s 
earlier submissions on similar allegations to 
various special procedures that the allegations 
against BSF are only a tactic by criminal 
syndicates active in the region to thwart 
BSF&#8217;s enforcement drivers against illegal 
cross-border activities of these syndicates.

<p>Panchayat village council went to the 
Ghojadanga BSF Camp to request the reason 
for Mr M.&#8217;s detention. The BSF officer and the 
Assistant Commander would not disclose any 
reason, and assured them that Mr M. would be 
released that evening. In fact, Mr M. was not 
released until the following day. During this 
detention, Mr M. was physically beaten and 
also verbally abused by the constables who had 
arrested him, leaving him with injuries 
including a hematoma and severe pain on his 
left thigh, left ear, left wrist and right shoulder.  
</p>
<p>In a separate incident, on 14 May 2009, three 
BSF officers from Out-Post No. 8, Angrail 
BSF Camp arrived at the home of Mr A.A., 
requesting to see him. The officers pushed 
aside Mr A.&#8217;s mother and then forcibly took 
him to Agrail BSF Camp. During his detention 
at the camp, Mr A. was slapped a number of 
times, and tied up to a tree with an iron chain, 
and left there overnight. The next day he was 
severely beaten by the BSF officers, while 
being forced to lie upside down. He was beaten 
on his back, waist, buttocks, and chest with 
sticks, and was denied food overnight and the 
next day, until his father arrived with food. Mr 
A. was then transferred to the Custom Office of 
Petrapole and forced to sign blank papers. He 
was not informed of any charges being made 
against him. Mr A. was released on the same 
day after his family paid an amount of Rs. 
</p><p>1000. Mr A. required hospitalization as a result 
of the injuries sustained at the hands of the 
BSF officers.  
</p>
<p>Mr A.&#8217;s family tried to lodge a complaint about 
his treatment at the Gaighata Police Station, 
but the officers there refused to accept the 
complaint. His mother has also made a written

<p>On 7 July 2009, Mr A. was requested to attend 
a meeting with the Commanding Officer of 
Angrail Camp, but fearing for his life, Mr A. 
did not attend. Mr A. was subsequently issued 
a notice by the Superintendent of Customs,

officers at the border area with cattle for which 
he did not have a valid document. This is

TOR 
</p>
<p>Concerning Mr. A. S, a 28-year-old dalit. 
</p>
<p>Mr. A.S. was arrested on 4 January 2010 at 
10:00 p.m. by a police officer. He was held in 
police custody remand (PCR) until 11 January 
and was charged with robbery. Throughout the 
detention period, Mr. S was beaten repeatedly, 
including on his arms and legs with wooden 
planks, and on his genitals. It is believed that 
he may have suffered from vision loss and a 
fractured arm and leg. During this time, his 
family was not allowed to see him, and he was 
neither given food nor allowed to use the 
bathroom. On 7 January, as part of the 
investigation, a police officer took Mr. S to the 
place where the alleged robbery took place. 
The officer (whose name remains on record 
with the mandate holders) then proceeded to hit 
him on numerous occasions on his head and 
genitals with his boots, and forced him to jump 
in public for thirty minutes. The same 
procedure was repeated in front of the victim&#8217;s 
house. In addition, Mr. S was verbally abused 
regarding his caste and his religion. The officer

<p>By a letter dated 6/04/2010, the Government 
of India examined the communication and 
found  that it would not be possible to 
investigate the allegation in absence of 
information about the specific place of 
occurrence of the alleged incident. It is, 
therefore, requested that information be 
provided about the specific place of 
occurrence of the alleged incident 
(village/town/area/district/state) to enable 
suitable investigations. 
</p>
<p>The Permanent Mission of India requests that 
the response of the Government of India be 
presented in full to the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the Question of Torture. </p>

<p>also threatened Mr. S by stating that he would 
shoot all the boys born in the same caste. 
</p>
<p>When Mr. S was presented before a court, the 
police officer presented a false medical 
certificate and threatened Mr. S not to speak 
about his experience in detention. Mr. S 
refused to request medical treatment for fear of 
reprisals. His family has also received 
threatening messages not to take legal action. 
Mr. S is currently detained under magisterial 
custody remand (MCR) and has not had access 
to medical attention. He reportedly cannot walk 
properly and stammers due to the beatings and 
requires urgent medical attention.

<p>55.  03/02/10 AL TOR Concerning A., a minor. 
</p>
<p>During lunch break on 5 November 2009, A., 
son of S.M., was at his school, Pandit Ram 
Chandra Mishra Inter College in Vidhyachal. 
He was trying to play hockey when the 
Principal, approached him and severely beat 
him, causing a fracture in his shoulder and ribs. 
The next day, Mr. M went to the school, where 
he received an apology from Mr. D and 100 
Rupees for A&#8217;s medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>Ajay was treated at a community health centre 
and on 11 November, he was taken to the 
Mirzapur District Hospital for further 
treatment. He died that night at his home. A&#8217;s 
body was taken by the police to perform an 
autopsy. A First Instance Report (FIR) was 
filed against Mr. D.

<p>Further information received also indicates that 
other children have also been subjected to 
corporal punishment at school. On 11 
September, M and R students at Marwadi Seva

</p>
<p>With regard to the incident of 11 September 
2009 at Marwadi Sewa Sangh Siksha 
Niketan, Varanasi, the concerned teacher was 
suspended and later dismissed from the 
service. Stern instructions were issued by the 
authorities to the institution to sensitize the 
teachers and to emphasize student counseling 
so as to prevent recurrence of such incidents. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the incident of 31 October 
2009 at Sacred Heart Christian School, Urai, 
the concerned teacher was dismissed from the 
service. A follow-up investigation was 
conducted on 1 October 2010 in which about 
100 school students were asked about 
corporal punishment practice in the school. 
No complaint was received during this 
investigation.

<p>the Question of Torture..

<p>56.  05/02/10 JUA FRDX; 
TOR; 
HRD 
</p>
<p>Concerning Mr. Devi Singh Rawat, a lawyer 
and human rights defender based in Rajasthan, 
India, working particularly on the issue of 
torture. From 2006-2008 he worked with the 
National Project on Prevention of Torture 
(NPPT) in India, including participation in 
training sessions.  
</p>
<p>On 5 January 2010, Mr. Singh Rawat filed a 
complaint against officers from Adarsh Nagar 
Police Station in the Ajmer District of 
Rajasthan, alleging that two individuals, Mr. 
Gopal Swaroop and a Mr. Rajkumar, had been 
subjected to acts of torture. He filed his 
complaint before Judicial Magistrate No. 4, 
naming 3 police officers as the alleged 
offenders. The court recorded statements by the 
complainants and witnesses under sections 200 
and 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
and adjourned the case until 11 February 2010 
to allow for further investigation. The 
complaint was filed by Mr. Singh Rawat on 
behalf of a request by the State Law Officer of 
NPPT.  
</p>
<p>On 30 January 2010, Mr. Singh Rawat was 
allegedly summoned to the Adarsh Nagar 
Police Station, where he was asked to 
withdraw the complaint, or face consequences 
as a result. However, Mr. Singh Rawat refused 
to do so.  
</p>
<p>On 31 January 2010 at approximately 11:00am, 
a fight broke out between police officers and 
members of the public during elections for 
Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) (a local 
governance body) in Palra Village, which falls 
within the jurisdiction of Adarsh Nagar Police 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 09/12/2010 the Government 
indicated that the initial investigation shows 
that the subject was arrested as per procedure 
laid down by the law. 
</p>
<p>The matter is sub judice. 
</p>
<p>The Permanent Mission of India requests that 
the response of the Government of India be 
presented in full to the Special Rapporteur. </p>

<p>Station. It is reported that several voters who 
had travelled to Palra from Khajpura village 
were arrested by Adarsh Nagar police and 
prevented from casting their votes. The police 
allegedly attempted to seize their vehicle, 
leading to a scuffle which developed into a 
fight between the police and voters. A police 
vehicle was damaged and several individuals 
received minor injuries. Approximately 20 
people were arrested at the scene and several 
had charges filed against them.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Singh Rawat was not present at the scene 
at the time of the incident, and is resident in 
another area. He was therefore not reportedly 
connected in any way to the election under way 
in Palra village. However, he was arrested later 
that day, in relation to the violence, at his 
residence and taken to Adarsh Nagar Police 
Station. His relatives were not informed of his 
arrest. It has been reported that the police 
physically assaulted and abused Mr. Singh 
Rawat and up to 15 other detainees upon 
arrival at the police station. Whilst in detention 
they were forced to remove their clothes and 
were then photographed. These photographs 
were later provided to the press.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Singh Rawat was charged with 
&#8220;Voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public 
servant from his duty&#8221; and &#8220;Assault or criminal 
force to deter a public servant from the 
discharge of his duty&#8221; under Sections 332 and 
353 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under 
Section 3 of the Protection Against Property 
Damage Act for &#8220;mischief causing damage to 
public property&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>During a hearing to remand the detainees into 
custody on 1 February 2010, a bail application 
was filed on behalf of Mr. Singh Rawat. The 
hearing was held before Judicial Magistrate 
No. 5  as the presiding officer of the original </p>

<p>Jurisdictional Court No 4  was on leave. Mr 
Mhendra Dabi refused Mr. Singh Rawat's bail 
application and remanded the detainees into 
custody until 11 February 2010.  
</p>
<p>A second bail application was filed later the 
same day before a District and Sessions Judge 
under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code. At a hearing at 2:00p.m on 2 February 
2010, the Additional District and Sessions 
Judge No. 2, granted bail to Mr Singh Rawat 
and the other detainees. Mr Singh Rawat and 
the others were released from the Central 
Prison in Ajmer at 6:30p.m that evening. 
Charges remain pending against all of the 
detainees.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest of and 
charges against Mr Devi Singh Rawat, in 
addition to his reported ill-treatment while in 
detention, are related to his work in defence of 
human rights, particularly his work against 
torture and for speaking out against violations 
of human rights by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>57.  06/07/10 AL TOR Concerning the Prevention of Torture Bill, 
2010, adopted by the Lok Sabha, the Lower 
House of Parliament on 6 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010 (&#8220;the 
Bill&#8221;) was drafted in an effort to complete the 
ratification process of the Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (&#8220;Convention against 
Torture&#8221;), which India signed in 1997. 
However, the Bill fails to comply with several 
provisions found in the Convention against 
Torture, including on the definition of torture, 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; 
investigation and prosecution; and 
compensation, among others. 
</p>
<p>The definition of torture found in the Bill only 
foresees one purpose for torture, obtaining 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 26/10/2010, the Government 
indicated that of India had examined the 
communication and would like to inform that 
the Bill is currently undergoing careful 
scrutiny in the Parliament and due attention 
would be paid to all the concerns that have 
been expressed, including by the civil society, 
on various aspects of the Bill. 
</p>
<p>The Permanent Mission of India requests that 
the response of the Government of India be

the Question of Torture. </p>

<p><i>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</i></p>
<p>information, as opposed to the definition found 
in the Convention against Torture, which also 
includes torture as a form of punishment and 
intimidation or coercion. The Bill only includes 
acts that cause &#8220;grievous hurt&#8221; or &#8220;danger to 
life, limb or health (whether mental or 
physical)&#8221; as torture, a narrower definition than 
that found in the Convention, which 
encompasses &#8220;severe pain or suffering&#8221;. 
Additionally, an act of torture may only be 
punishable if it is done to extract a confession 
or information and if it is based on 
discrimination. As such, both elements need to 
be present for it to constitute torture. 
Furthermore, the Bill does not prohibit 
complicity in torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. In terms of punishment, 
the Bill sets a maximum of ten years 
imprisonment, which does not seem in 
accordance with the seriousness of the crime. 
</p>
<p>With regard to investigating and prosecuting 
acts of torture, the Bill requires the &#8220;previous 
sanction&#8221; of the Central or State Government 
before a court may take up a case. This 
provision is contrary to article 12 of the 
Convention against Torture, which calls upon 
States to carry out prompt and impartial 
investigations wherever there is ground to 
believe that an act of torture may have taken 
place. To require previous sanction would limit 
the number of cases investigated and grant de 
facto immunity to certain perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>In addition, complaints have to be filed within 
six months from the date on which the offence 
took place. This poses serious problems for 
many victims, as they may remain in detention 
for longer than six months, without access to 
any complaints mechanisms or at risk of 
further torture or ill-treatment if they file a 
complaint. </p>

<p>Another issue of concern with regard to the 
Bill is the lack of a provision concerning the 
rights to redress and compensation, as 
established in article 14 of the Convention 
against Torture. The Bill does not provide for 
any mechanism under which a victim may seek 
or obtain compensation. The Bill is also silent 
on the use of statements obtained through 
torture and other preventive mechanisms such 
as ensuring access to legal counsel following 
arrest or detention and monitoring places of 
detention, including the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture. 
</p>
<p>58.  21/09/10 JAL HLTH; 
TOR 
</p>
<p>Concerning the lack of access to palliative care 
and pain treatment in India. 
</p>
<p>More than half of India&#8217;s Regional Cancer 
Centres do not offer any palliative care for pain 
management. Only 10 of the 29 existing 
Regional Cancer Centres have effective 
programmes and five others offer limited 
palliative care. It is estimated that more than 
one million people suffer from moderate to 
severe pain due to advanced cancer, and only a 
few receive proper treatment. The same occurs 
for people with HIV/AIDS, paraplegics, 
patients with advanced renal diseases and 
others who require palliative care. 
Additionally, many of the Regional Cancer 
Centres do not have health workers who are 
trained in palliative care. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the availability of morphine, 
hospitals and pharmacies generally stopped 
stocking it as a result of the adoption in 1985 
of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Act. The Act had been created in 
order to create a balance between the 
obligation to ensure the availability of opioids 
for medical purposes and to take steps to 
prevent their misuse. However, burdensome

<p>licensing procedures in state regulations mean 
that hundreds of thousands of patients do not 
have access to the necessary medications. In 
2008, only 4% of those requiring morphine had 
access to it. In 1998, the national Department 
of Revenue drafted a model rule for states to 
use in order to simplify the medical use of 
morphine. The Department at the time 
indicated that existing regulations denied &#8220;easy 
availability of morphine to even terminally ill 
cancer patients&#8221;, and caused &#8220;undue sufferings 
and harassment&#8221;. However, despite this 
recommendation by the Department of 
Revenue, only 14 of the 35 states have 
implemented the model rule. 
</p>
<p>In terms of policy, there is no national 
palliative care policy or program and, despite 
the fact that considerable resources have 
reportedly been invested to strengthen the 
cancer care system in India, very few funds 
have been allocated to palliative care. At the 
state level, only Kerala has a palliative care 
program in place. 
</p>
<p>The failure to ensure availability of palliative 
care leaves many patients suffering from 
severe pain, which may constitute cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment.

<p>Since their arrival in Central Jail Tihar in April 
2007, Ms. Safia Shafi, Ms. Bushra Mansoor, 
Ms. Shabana Gohar, Ms. Samira Wasim and 
Ms. Anisa Jabbar who were pregnant at the 
time of their arrest have given birth to five 
children. Reportedly, medical staff treated the 
pregnant MFI women inhumanly and slapped 
their faces during delivery. After delivery, no 
food or medication was given to the women for 
the next two days, while in the hospital food is 
usually served two times a day. Sanitary pads 
were not provided after delivery. One MFI 
woman was not administered stitches correctly 
and subsequently new stitches were 
readministered without any local anesthetic. 
During a medical checkup in Deen Dayal 
Hospital, it was found that Ms. Qamar Parveen 
and Ms. Sajida Waheed have cysts in their 
ovaries. While surgery was recommended, the 
Senior Medical Officer refused this, reportedly 
stating that &#8220;You take care of it at your own 
expense outside after your jail term.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>On 28 January 2010, the Government of India 
rejected the applications made on behalf of the 
MFI detainees for political asylum and 
subsequently all criminal charges against them 
were reportedly withdrawn. The MFI members 
continue to be held in custody, pending a 
decision by the courts on whether their 
deportation to Pakistan would be lawful.  
</p>
<p>In Central Jail Tihar, the MFI members are 
detained in unsanitary and overcrowded 
facilities which have reportedly resulted in 
communicable diseases. If MFI detainees are 
sick they are scarcely referred to an external 
hospital and the prison authorities make them 
clean drainage lines with their bare hands.

has been diagnosed with a tumor in his brain; 
however, reportedly no medical help is 
forthcoming. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Muhammad Ashfaque is diabetic and 
suffers from an illness affecting his backbone. 
The prison staff only gave him Metaformin 
tablets and his sugar level is getting higher. 
When Mr. Muhammad Ashfaque raised this 
issue with the prison staff he was reportedly 
told that &#8220;medication is very expensive outside 
and we cannot afford it, nor can we refer you to 
an outside hospital&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdul Waheed underwent heart bypass 
surgery before his arrest and is still suffering 
from acute heart-related illnesses and blood 
pressure. Reportedly, he is not getting proper 
medical treatment but only receives pain-
killers. The prison authorities asked Mr. Abdul 
Waheed to take care of his medical needs at his 
own expense from outside.

<p>Mr. Abdul Rashid is diabetic, but the prison 
authorities did not allow him to visit an 
Outpatient Department. Due to high diabetic 
condition his eyesight deteriorated and he has 
blurred vision.

medication that did not help and the prison 
staff allegedly beat her. Ms. Kulsoom Khan 
was then sent to Deen Dayal Hospital where 
some liquid was withdrawn from her spine 
which generated pain in her lower spine. In 
Deen Dayal Hospital, Ms. Kulsoom Khan was 
reportedly given electric shocks once or twice 
daily. She was tied to the bed with ropes and 
would be unconscious for hours. Upon her

Gohar, Sana Riaz, Shahzaib, Hassan AlGohar, 
Asad Gohar, Zill-e-Gohar, Mary Gohar, 
Abhaya Gohar, Aamir Gohar, Tabassum Gohar 
and Abasah Gohar). However, the prison 
authorities do not have the required medication 
for children and the detained children are given 
adults&#8217; medication instead. Thus the two-year-
old Ms. Abasah Gohar was given full 
antibiotics over 15 days and subsequently 
developed gastric problems.

to tear Ms. Anusiya&#8217;s sari, rip her blouse and 
grab her breast. When she refused to have

police jeep to several towns. When Mr. 
Marimuthu inquired into the destination, he 
was beaten by the officers. On 23 June, he was 
taken back to the Periyakulam Police Station, 
where he was brutally beaten on his back, 
while his legs were bound with a chain. He was 
later forced to undress and sit against a wall, 
while his limbs were stretched in all four 
directions. Because Mr. Marimuthu continued 
to deny his involvement in any crime, he was 
kicked and beaten on his back and ears until he 
confessed. The following morning, Mr. 
Marimuthu was released and threatened not to 
tell anyone about the ill-treatment. On 23 June, 
Mr. Marimuthu filed complaints with several 
authorities, but no response has been received. 
The National Human Rights Commission 
transferred his complaint to the Superintendent 
of Police, but no investigation was started.

<p>On 13 July 2008, Mr. Asunmaikkodi was told 
to go to the police station by Mr. Babul 
Jesudoss, Sub-Inspector of the Sethur Police 
Station. When he arrived at the station, Mr. 
Asunmaikkodi was slapped on the cheek and 
told his fingerprints would have to be taken, as 
he was a suspect in several cases of theft. 
When he refused, Mr. Asunmaikkodi was 
verbally and physically abused by Sub-
Inspector Jesudoss. He was hit on the face, 
kicked on his back, grabbed by the neck and 
pushed into a wall, and chained to a window 
grill. After a few hours, he was given the 
option of being subjected to additional ill-
treatment or to have his fingerprints taken and 
be released. He agreed to have his fingerprints 
taken. Upon release, Mr. Asunmaikkodi was 
once again threatened by Head Constable Mr. 
Dhanam. On 14 July 2008, Mr. Asunmaikkodi

Arul refused to lodge a complaint against the 
perpetrators allegedly because they were his 
relatives, and accused Mr. Muthukumar 
instead. Mr. Muthukumar was then verbally 
and physically assaulted by Mr. Arul, who also 
forced him to undress and beat him with a 
metal baton. Two other constables then stood 
on Mr. Muthukumar&#8217;s hands while Mr. Arul 
beat him with a metal baton on his back. He 
was left chained and naked on the floor of the 
police station. His family members were also 
forced to take their clothes off and threatened 
with violence if the filed any complaints 
against the ill-treatment. Mr. Muthukumar and 
his family are required to report daily to the 
police station. On 2 September 2008, </p>

from the Sembanar Koil Police Station. All 
four men took turns beating Ms. Chellappa

Chellappa&#8217;s daughter, Ms. Thilagavathi, was 
sexually harassed by the four officers. The

themselves and took Ms. Chellappa to the

<p>Re: Haseena Ara

<p>The subject was related to a notorious 
terrorist Abdul Qayoom Bhat who was 
suspected to be involved in the killing of a 
Security official. 
</p>
<p>The Subject was called for questioning at the 
police post on 4 July 2004 and was 
questioned for about two hours in the

some unknown place by terrorists who 
wanted to project the security forces in a bad 
light. The subject was ultimately recovered 
from JVC Hospital, Bemina, Srinagar where 
she was treated for simple injuries and 
relieved thereafter. Allegations, such as those 
contained in the communication, are 
invariably made at the instance of militant 
groups in order to put pressure on the security 
personnel, as also to derive financial benefits 
from the Government. 
</p>
<p>Re: In habitants of village Choun and 
Nadigam 
</p>
<p>The allegations are baseless. On 6 May 2004, 
the village of Choum was cordoned off for a 
search operation when some unscrupulous 
elements in the village deliberately instigated 
a confrontation with the security officials in 
order to provide a chance to the hiding 
militants to escape. Allegations, such as those

Mr Thounaojam Surjit and Mrs 
Leimapokpam Nganbi Devi were arrested on 
5 August 2009 after observing due 
formalities, including the presence of lady 
police. They were later produced before the 
magistrate on 6 August 2009 and remanded 
first into police custody and later into judicial

Phanjoubam Sakhi Leima, Mrs Khangembam 
Lourembam Nganbi and Mrs Yumlembam 
Mema were arrested on 4 August 2009 after 
observing due formalities under Unlawful

with suspect organizations and apprehension 
that they were planning to commit offence. 
They were released on 8 January 2010. It may 
be noted that on 6 August 2009, two days 
after the above-mentioned arrests, an unruly 
mob gathered at about 23.10 hrs on National 
Highway-39 in violation of prohibitory orders 
that had been promulgated by the local 
authorities. As a result, the police, which used 
minimal force under due supervision, was 
forced to WGEIDerse the mob with anti-riot 
equipment. It was during this WGEIDersal 
that Mr Naorem Prakash sustained injuries, 
including on his eyes and nose, and was 
evacuated to a local hospital for treatment. A 
police case was duly registered and an

<p>By letter dated 8/10/2010, the Government 
inidciated that the allegations pertaining to 
Mr. Aptarul Hossain have been examined and 
found to be inaccurate. The subject&#8217;s real 
name is Akhtar-Ul-Zaman who was a part of 
a three-member smuggling gang that was 
trying to intrude from across the border on 15 
February 2008. The subject sustained a bullet 
injury in his left leg when his gang 
disregarded the Border Security Force (BSF) 
patrol&#8217;s warning and, instead, tried to attack 
the patrol, thereby forcing the patrol to open 
fire. The subject was immediately evacuated 
to Sub-Divisional Hospital, Bangaon, District 
24 Parganas where doctors on emergency 
duty provided him necessary medical 
treatment. He was later referred to a bigger 
hospital in Kokata for specialized treatment. 
In June 2009, the subject was convicted by 
the local Court to two years rigorous 
imprisonment and a fine. It may be noted that 
adequate mechanism are in place to monitor 
any human rights violations by the BSF. 
During 2005-09, 45 BSF personnel, including 
eight officers, were awarded punishments for 
human rights violations.

<p>With regard to allegations pertaining to Mr. 
Neel Kumar Mondal and Mer. Dwijen

<p>The subject, who does not live with his

from Angrail, was apprehended along with 
some cattle that he was trying to smuggle 
across the border at about 0530 hrs on May 
</p><p>2009. Later, as required, the subject and the 
seized cattle were then handed over to the 
local Customs authorities who, since the 
subject was in a fine condition, did not insist 
on medical examination of the subject before 
accepting him in custody. The subject was 
later released by the Customs authorities as 
per their rules and procedures. After this 
incident, the BSF approached the subject&#8217;s 
mother thrice asking her to persuade her son 
to refrain from smuggling. However, the 
mother requested the BSF to be lenient 
towards her son&#8217;s smuggling activities in 
view of the condition of the family. The 
subject is still suspected to be active and goes

from poor families, as couriers of contraband 
goods. Not only do these syndicates attempt 
to defy the prohibitory orders imposed by the

from bronchopneumonia, excess fluid in his 
lungs, a urinary tract infection and various 
other health problems. Despite the fact that the 
treating doctor recommended he receive 
additional treatment in Jakarta, he remains in 
Papua, as prison authorities have indicated they 
lack the funds to transfer and treat him. Mr. 
Karma had suffered from health problems 
before his arrest, but prison conditions have 
aggravated his health condition.

<p>During the arrest and in the police vehicle, 
some of the activists were punched and beaten 
with rifle butts. They were transferred between 
police stations, including the regional police 
station (Polda, Polisi Daerah), the district 
police station (Polres, Polisi Resort) and the 
police mobile brigade (Brimob, Brigade Mobil 
Tantui base). Most of the detainees were 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment in police 
custody. They were forced to crawl on their 
stomachs over hot asphalt, billiard balls were 
forced into their mouths, they were whipped 
with electric cables, beaten on the head with 
rifle butts until their ears bled, and shots were 
fired close to their ears. Afterwards, while they 
were still bleeding, they were thrown into the 
sea and dragged out. It has been reported that 
Special Detachment 88 officers were 
responsible for the most severe assaults.  
</p>
<p>On the same day, nine other people were 
arrested for having helped organize the event

<p>On 10 March 2009, 11 of the detainees were 
transferred to correctional facilities in Java, 
more than 1,000 kilometres away from their 
families. It is believed that neither the 
detainees nor their families were informed of 
their transfer. Lawyers from the Malang branch 
of the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan

permission to visit three of them, Leonard 
Hendricks, Johan Teterissa and Abraham

in Malang, East Java. On 12 February 2010, 
LBH received a copy of a letter from the East 
Java regional office of the Ministry of Justice 
and Human Rights to the Director General of 
Prisons in Jakarta, informing them of LBH&#8217;s 
application and asking the Director General to 
coordinate with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
They have not heard either from the East Java 
office of the Ministry of Justice and Human 
Rights or the Director General of Prisons since 
then.

<p>Particular concern is expressed over Mr. 
Teterissa, who has not received medical 
treatment since the arrest and ill-treatment. He 
has a high fever, is in constant pain and cannot 
see properly. The prison authorities have 
denied his request for external medical 
treatment, and a doctor who went to see him on 
15 July was also turned away. It is also 
believed that Mr. Teterissa may be denied 
access to sufficient food and clean water in 
prison. </p>

arrested by the Police Mobile Brigade 
(BRIMOB) in the Indonesian province of

interrogation about the whereabouts of local 
pro-independence guerrillas (OPM/TPN), 
BRIMOB officers shot Mr. Wayeni and sliced 
his abdomen open with a bayonet, causing his 
death. It is alleged that the victim was unarmed

arrest. BRIMOB maintains that Wayeni's 
injuries came while he was resisting arrest with 
a homemade firearm. A video was reportedly 
recorded a few moments before Mr. Wayeni&#8217;s 
death by an unknown source. It shows 
Indonesian police officers taunting Mr. Wayeni

<p>Concerning the use of excessive force by the 
security forces and the Basij militia against 
demonstrators on 27 December 2009, alleged 
arbitrary arrests and the suppression of (at least 
initially) peaceful assemblies.  
</p>
<p>Widespread protests broke out in Tehran, 
Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz, Qom and 
several other cities in Iran on 27 December 
</p><p>2009. Reports and videos indicate that Basij 
militia and security forces attacked protesters 
using excessive force and live ammunition. 
Near Daneshjoo Park in Tehran, for instance, 
members of the Basij militia beat 
demonstrators with batons, wood sticks and 
metal pipes, killing at least one person. As this 
demonstrator&#8217;s dead body was moved through 
the crowd, other demonstrators started 
attacking the Basij members, brought several 
of them down from their motorcycles, and set 
vehicles of the security forces on fire. In an 
unspecified location, security forces tied a 
young protestor to the back of a van and

<p>demonstrators attacked the van, took the 
passengers out and set the van on fire.  
</p>
<p>In Enqelab Street and at Pol-e College in 
Tehran security forces used live ammunition 
against protesters. Three persons were 
reportedly killed at Pol-e college. Mr. Seyd Ali 
Moussavi, aged 35 and nephew of Mr. Mir 
Hossein Moussavi, an opposition candidate for 
president in the recent elections, was shot in 
the back, apparently injuring his heart, and 
killed by security forces at around noon in 
Enqelab Square.  
</p>
<p>Reports further indicate that four protesters 
were killed in Tabriz. Reports vary as to the 
overall death toll on 27 December 2009, fifteen 
dead being the highest number indicated in 
reports we have received.  
</p>
<p>About 300 persons were arrested on 27 
December 2009. They include three advisers to 
Mir Hossein Moussavi, namely Messrs. Alireza 
Beheshti, Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad and 
Mohammad Bagherian, and two aides to the 
former President Mr. Mohammad Khatami, 
Messrs. Morteza Haji and Hasan Rasooli. In 
the early morning hours of 28 December, Mr. 
Ebrahim Yazdi, aged 78, a former foreign 
minister and now leader of the Freedom 
Movement of Iran, was arrested.

accused by the authorities of having 
&#8216;orchestrated&#8217; the unrest. Some had been 
released by 18 June 2009.  Police on 
motorcycles also reportedly beat opposition 
supporters who had staged a sit-in in Vanak 
Square, Tehran, to protest the results of the 
elections. 
</p>
<p>On 14 June, up to five students including 
Fatemeh Barati, Kasra Sharafi, Mobina 
Ehterami, Kambiz Sho'a'i and Mohsen Imani 
were shot dead when security agents reportedly 
stormed a dormitory at Tehran University and 
opened fire.  Numerous students were arrested 
and many others suffered serious injuries 
during the raid.  In another incident on the 
same day, approximately 100 riot police 
pursued some 300 students on grounds 
belonging to the University of Tehran.  Pepper 
spray and tear gas were reportedly used to 
restrain the student protesters.   Protestors were 
arrested also at demonstrations in provincial 
cities such as Zahedan, Tabriz, Mashhad, 
Babol, and Shiraz. 
</p>
<p>On 15 June, members of the Basij militia 
opened fire in the Velenjak, Jordan and Darous 
districts of Tehran. A video taken on 15 June 
2009 shows a member of the Basij firing 
towards demonstrators from a building used by 
the Basij. At least seven persons were killed on 
that day. 
</p>
<p>On 20 June, Ms. Neda Agha Soltani was shot 
on Khosravi street in Tehran. The bullet hit her 
chest just below the collar bone, and she died 
within a minute. Although she was 
immediately taken to Shariati hospital, where 
her death was confirmed, no autopsy was 
carried out before she was buried at Behesht-e 
Zahra cemetery. A member of the Basij militia

grabbed by witnesses and a picture of it posted

</p>
<p>Also on 20 June, opposite the Navvab metro 
station in Tehran, members of the Basij militia 
opened fire from the roof of the Lolagar 
mosque at persons in the street with 
Kalashnikovs and Heckler &amp; Koch G3 guns. A 
young boy was hit in the head and his brain 
spattered on the platform outside the metro 
station. A young man was hit in the throat by a 
tear gas bullet and died on the spot. 
</p>
<p>On 22 June, the Office of the Prosecutor 
General stated that it had started an 
investigation into the killings on 20 June. More 
than half a year later, no results of that 
investigation have been made public. 
</p>
<p>On 25 June, Basij militia on the roof of the 
Lolagar mosque shot and killed Mr. Ya&#8217;qoub 
Barvayeh, a student aged 27. The Basij militia 
removed the body. His family were told two 
days later where he was buried. 
</p>
<p>On 30 July 2009, Ali Reza Tavassoli, aged 12, 
was killed by blows in the head inflicted by 
Basij militia men at a demonstration to 
commemorate the 40th day since the death of 
Neda Agha Soltani. Members of the Basij 
militia removed his body from hospital. 
</p>
<p>The authorities reported that 36 persons died 
during the unrest following the elections, 
including members of the Basij militia, but 
family members of persons who went missing 
and who inquired with the authorities, report 
that they were shown albums containing

of two children, and Mr. Bu-Ali Janfeshani, 
aged 32, father of one.

<p>By letter dated 07/10/2010, the Government

<p>A criminal court in Oroomiyeh, West 
Azerbeijan Province, sentenced Sareimeh 
Ebadi and Bu-Ali Janfeshani to death on 
charges of adultery. The death sentence 
followed a trial in which they were allegedly 
denied the right to select their own defense 
attorneys. On 6 January 2010 (or 8 January, 
according to other reports received), Branch 12 
of the West Azerbeijan Court of Appeals 
upheld the death sentence. Both defendants are 
held in Oroomiyeh central prison.  
</p>
<p>penalty of stoning is stipulated in Islam in 
order to serve as a strong deterrent. However, 
Islam has set very difficult condition in 
punishing these types of serious offenses. The 
purpose behind the difficulty in proving guilt 
in such offenses is to reduce to minimum the 
probability of error in judgments.  The 
penalty is applied only after it is proved that 
the public conscience has been harmed and 
upon the testimony of many witnesses. 
Therefore, although the punishment is very 
harsh and severe, the evidence required for 
proof is also extremely complicated. The 
purpose of Islam for such harsh rules is to 
have a mechanism for deterrence and to 
prevent the recurrence of such crimes in the 
society. There are practically a lot less family 
betrayals in Islamic societies than in the 
secular Western societies. Islamic religious 
scholars believe that the punishment of 
stoning is totally different from execution and 
the two are not comparable. However, with 
respect to the accusation of adultery against 
Ms Sarimeh Ebadi, she was first tried in a 
court in the city of Orumieh, but because of 
the importance of the case, it should be heard 
by a provincial criminal court in accordance 
with article 4 of file law relating to the reform 
of general courts adopted in 2002. The case is 
presently under review by the provincial 
criminal court of West Azerbaijan in Branch

<p>Mr. Hossein Khezri was arrested on 31 July 
2008 in Kermanshah. On 11 July 2009, he was 
convicted for &#8220;enmity against God&#8221; 
(moharebeh) and endangering state security, 
and sentenced to death. During his detention, 
Mr. Khezri was reportedly subjected to torture, 
leading to the partial loss of his eyesight. His 
request for an investigation of the allegations 
of torture was denied in March 2010. On 11 
April 2010, he was transferred from Oromieh 
Central Prison to an unknown location. Such 
transfers of persons sentenced to death are a 
common indication that an individual&#8217;s 
execution is imminent. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Zeynab Jalalian was arrested in the spring 
of 2008 and held in a Ministry of Intelligence 
detention facility. It is believed that she was 
not granted access to a lawyer during her trial. 
In January 2009, Ms. Jalalian was convicted by 
the Kermanshah Revolutionary Court for 
&#8220;enmity against God&#8221; and was sentenced to 
death. The sentence was confirmed by the 
Supreme Court on 26 November 2009. In 
March 2010, Ms. Jalalian was transferred from 
Kermanshah Prison to an unknown location. In 
late March, she was transferred to Section 209 
of Evin Prison. It is believed that her transfers 
are in preparation for her execution.

Upon arrival and throughout the first 
interrogations, he was threatened with 
execution. He spent 86 days in solitary

throat several times, leading to him losing 
consciousness. Afterward, he suffered from 
severe pain in the neck and throat, which made 
eating or drinking intolerable. The aim of the

<p>On 18 September 2010, Ms. Ahari&#8217;s sentence 
of 74 lashes for &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221; was 
commuted to a fine. However, she was also 
sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment for 
&#8220;moharebeh&#8221; (enmity against God), two years 
for &#8220;gathering and colluding to commit a 
crime&#8221; and six months for propaganda against 
the system&#8221;, which she must serve at Izeh 
Prison. It is not clear if Izeh Prison has existing 
facilities for women. Mr. Ha&#8217;eri was sentenced 
by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court to 
two and a half years&#8217; imprisonment and 74 
lashes for &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221; and 
&#8220;gathering and colluding with intent to harm 
state security&#8221;. The convictions and sentences 
of both Mr. Ha&#8217;eri and Ms. Ahari will be 
appealed.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrests and 
convictions of Mr. Saeed Ha&#8217;eri and Ms. Shiva 
Nazar Ahari might be directly related to their 
work in defense of human rights. Further 
concern is expressed for the physical and

dated 11 February 2010 and 1 April 2010. We 
regret that we have not yet received a reply 
from your Excellency&#8217;s Government to these 
communications. Mr. Isa Saharkhiz&#8217;s case has 
also been considered by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and has been deemed 
arbitrary in its opinion adopted on 6 May 2010 
(Opinion No.8/2010). 
</p>
<p>On 27 September 2010, the authorities of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran reportedly informed 
the lawyer of Mr. Isa Saharkhiz that he had 
been sentenced to three years in prison, a five-
year ban on political and journalistic activities, 
and a one-year travel ban. Mr. Saharkhiz was 
detained in July 2009 shortly after the 
WGEIDuted presidential elections and was 
charged with &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader&#8221; 
and &#8220;propagating against the regime&#8221;. Mr. 
Saharkhiz&#8217;s arrest came two days after he 
printed articles criticizing the Iranian 
Government. He has on multiple occasions 
given speeches on the importance of the 
freedom of the press and of human rights, often 
criticizing the Government. According to the 
information received, he was arrested on 
account of participating in Karroubi&#8217;s political 
campaign for the recent presidential elections 
and for speaking out against the Government.  
</p>
<p>On 29 September 2010, Mr. Hossein 
Derakhshan was convicted by Branch 15 of the 
Revolutionary Court of cooperating with 
hostile States, propaganda against the system, 
propaganda in favour of counter-revolutionary 
groups, insults to the holy sanctities, and set-up 
and management of vulgar and obscene 
websites. He was sentenced to 19-and-a-half 
years in prison, a five year ban on political and 
journalistic activities and repayment of receive 
funds of 30,750Euros, US$2,900, and UK&#163;200 </p>

were allegedly for. Additionally, it has been 
reported that his lawyer has not been given a 
copy of the verdict and his family was not 
informed of his conviction until it was 
published in the news.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Derakhshan was detained at his family 
home in Tehran on 1 November 2008 in 
connection with comments he allegedly made 
about a cleric, spent over a year without charge 
and in solitary confinement for nine months, 
and has been prevented from receiving visits

Shirin Ebadi. She has also spoken openly about 
alleged shortcomings in the rule of law and 
administration of justice in the Islamic

<p>On 28 August 2010, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh&#8217;s

enforcement authorities. On 4 September, Ms. 
Sotoudeh was arrested, and subsequently 
summoned to appear in court. Her trial 
reportedly started on 15 November 2010, 
during which she reportedly faces charges of 
acting against national security; gathering and 
colluding to disturb national security; and co-
operation with a human rights body, the Centre 
for Human Rights Defenders, co-founded by 
Ms. Shirin Ebadi. Mr. Reza Khandan,

<p>Since her arrest, Ms. Sotoudeh has reportedly 
remained in solitary confinement in Evin 
Prison in Tehran, with only occasional contact 
with family members. On 3 November she met 
her two children and sister who reportedly 
found her in poor condition, having lost weight 
as a consequence of a hunger strike she had 
undertaken to protest against her arrest and the 
conditions of detention inside Evin prison. Ms. 
Sotoudeh has reportedly ended her hunger 
strike with the commencement of her trial on 
15 November. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, prior to 
her arrest, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh had been 
threatened with reprisals if she did not stop her 
human rights work. Her husband, Mr. Reza 
Khandan, also received threats urging him to 
stop his wife from defending her clients, 
including Ms. Ebadi. 
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention of Ms. Sotoudeh, and the threats 
against her husband, Mr. Reza Khandan, may 
be related to her legitimate activities in defence 
of human rights. Further concern is expressed 
for Ms. Sotoudeh&#8217;s physical and psychological 
integrity while in detention.

<p>than 32 elections over the past 30 years in 
accordance in accordance with the 
Constitution and ordinary laws of the country.  
[&#8230;] On 11 June 2009 tenth presidential 
election was held in Iran. Four candidates 
from different political orientations were 
contesting that election. Close to 40 million 
from the total of 45 million eligible voters 
participated in this election. [&#8230;] 
</p>
<p>While various programmes by the United 
Nations encourage countries to democratize 
that affairs of the state and use the system of 
free election, unfortunately, over the recent 
decade we have witnessed an ominous tend in 
preventing the exercise of this legitimate 
rights of the people. Foreign cultural 
institutes, financial instruments and 
subservient elite and intellectuals are 
employed as tools by certain big powers to 
intervene and make elections an arena for 
conflicts. By creating revolutions of different 
colors during elections, these powers try to 
materialize their own illegitimate political 
interests in order to make a mockery and 
undercut this basic and fundamental right of 
nations. 
</p>
<p>Despite the commitment of the of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to respect citizens&#8217; rights 
and the general right of people, including the 
right to assembly and express opinions, on 
Monday 15th of June, 2009 a very large and 
peaceful meeting was held in the capital of 
the country in support of the candidate who 
came second in the election. The meeting 
turned into a bloody riot inter alia  due to the 
penetration of terrorist elements who had 
entered the  country through its eastern 
borders and also because of the organizers&#8217; 
failure to accept any responsibility.

<p>banks were set on fire. A military station near 
Azadi Square in Teheran was attacked by 
armed persons and two of the attackers were 
killed. Unfortunately, and innocent mother 
and her daughter were also killed at their 
workplace, in the incident, because of firing 
of shots by the attackers near the military 
post. 
</p>
<p>The extent of destructions and use of non-
conventional incendiary materials with fast &#8211;
burning capability were indications which led 
the authorities to investigate the possibility of 
the presence of trained terrorist groups from 
outside country. 
</p>
<p>It was quite apparent that in the course of the 
incident, the law enforcement forces showed 
utmost tolerance and no one from the 
demonstrators was arrested. The law 
enforcement forces did not use any lethal 
weapons or ammunition, whatsoever, and the 
attack by 30 individuals armed with guns, 
knives and incendiary materials against the 
military post was the primary reason for the 
change in direction of the demonstration and 
resort to violence. 
</p>
<p>The riots and unrest by the opponent during 
the ensuing days after the election was 
intensified by false reports propagated by 
some foreign media. It also provoked further 
violence and destruction by supporters of the 
defeated candidates and other suspicious 
armed elements who began to be more 
assertive and visible. Despite all the 
precautions, there were loss of lives of 
personas present on the scene and in addition 
to attacks against banks and public and 
private places, a number of sacred locations 
were attacked and set on fire.

types of non-lethal equipment, including 
water hose, was used to WGEIDerse them 
during the initial phase. However, as the 
supporters of candidates became more 
aggressive and began to block streets and 
destroy public property, use of tear gas and 
batons became necessary in some cases. 
</p>
<p>The riotous and destructive behavior by the 
provoked groups and supporters of the two 
defeated candidates in the firs week after the 
announcement of the results of the election 
mainly in the capital and some other larger 
cities took a radical turn and brought about 
huge destruction of public property. The 
mechanisms employed by the police to 
prevent destruction in times of crisis were not 
adequately effective due to the restraint by 
the police and caused the wounding and 
injury of a large number of police, emergency 
and grass-root volunteers and substantial 
damages on public property. 
</p>
<p>A number of temporary arrests took place, but 
a large number of those arrested were 
released in the initial phases of investigation. 
Only those individuals for whom there were 
reasonable and corroborative grounds 
(arrested during the commission of an 
offence, availability of films and witnesses) 
showing involvement in assault and battery 
and destruction of public property were 
arrested and detained in detention centers.  
[&#8230;] some individuals with ties to political 
parties that were instrumental in provoking 
people to resort to radical and illegal actions 
that propagated lies and distorted public mind 
or were directly involved in the riots and 
unrest were also arrested. [&#8230;] all those 
arrested were arraigned and were told of the

<p>With the completion of the initial

rulings by the court are not final and can be

<p>Acting against national security: article 498 
states that any person who puts together a 
group of two persons inside or outside the 
country or manages such a group for the 
purpose of acting against the national security 
shall be subject to imprisonment of two to ten 
years.

<p>Disturbing the minds of the public: any 
person who propagates untrue statements or

persons of officials for the purpose of

who collects classified information and 
makes it available to others, if he/she 
succeeds shall be subject to imprisonment

<p>As it was explained earlier, most of those 
individuals were released (even without 
posting any bail or surety) in a show of 
Islamic compassion after a short detention 
despite the fact that they were involved in 
unlawful activities such as disturbing public 
peace or attributing lies to officials of the 
country. There also those who had committed 
more serious offences. Their cases were sent 
to he court along with the indictment. Some 
of the intitial rulings on these cases are 
explained below. These rulings are appealable 
and have been mostly issued with utmost 
leniency and tolerances. There also those who 
were involved in terrorist activities and 
carrying weapons and explosives, the 
punishments have nothing to do with political 
activities or election.

several police/court records with respect to 
arrestable offences including acting against 
the national security, revealing of classified 
information relating to his clients to foreign 
elements and propaganda against the Islamic 
Republic. He has been tried in the court under 
some of those charges. He was found guilty 
on a number of charges and was exonerated 
on some. He was arrested again on the 16th of 
Junes, 2009 after the unrest following the 
recent presidential election on the basis 
corroborative evidence. He served his 
sentence similar to other prisoners, 
benefitting from health services and he was 
able to contact his relatives and defense 
attorney. His case was tried in the court on 
the aforementioned charges. He was released 
on the 26th of August, 2009 on bail. His case 
is on the court docket for trial. The 
allegations in the letter of the Special

elections took place with extensive 
participation and large turnout of eligible 
voters. Altogether 500 million votes have 
been cast in the elections. On 11th of June, 
2009, the tenth presidential election was held 
in Iran. Four candidates from different 
political orientations contested in the election. 
Near 40 million people from the total of 45 
million eligible voters participated in the 
election. It was an unprecedented record of 
more than 85% turnout of voters. The ballot 
boxes witnessed the most impressive 
demonstration of democracy. The votes of 
people were collected under the supervision 
of trusted individuals from all communities 
(650 thousand) as well as the statutory 
regulatory bodies who were present at 45,000 
ballot boxes throughout the country. In all 
stages of casting votes and counting them, 
more than 90,000 observers, selected by the 
presidential candidates, watched and 
supervised the boxes.

<p>After inquiring and probing into the events in 
places such as the Tehran University 
Dormitory, it became clear that the incidents 
were instigated by certain extremist radical 
student groups. According to available 
information, some students organized radical 
meetings at the entrance gate of the 
University of Teheran in support of defeated 
candidates. They began inciting a rampage by 
shouting radical and derogatory and 
provocative slogans in a public place opposite 
the dormitory and in front of ordinary people. 
The people who did not like the radical 
slogans felt obligated to encounter the 
demonstrators in an unwanted fight. In the 
meantime, some extremist groups, 
unfortunately of unknown origin, abused the 
situation and maliciously resorted to violent 
and destructive actions. 
</p>
<p>According to the statements by the 
Commander-in Chief of the Revolutionary 
Guards (Sepah) and the Police, no order by 
the military or police was issued for entry 
into the University Dormitory.  Inquires show 
that Basiji forces were not present either 
when those incidents took place. A major part 
of the destruction was done by the provoked 
and irritated people who took matters into 
their own hands. They had nothing to do with 
the Basijis and official forces. 
</p>
<p>Following normalization of the situation, the 
relevant officials condemned the incidents 
and ordered inquiries into the bitter 
happenings. The results of those inquiries 
shall be presented in the relevant part. 
Contrary to false claims by the unruly and 
seditious papers, no student was killed and 
the allegation is totally false.

concerning the death of students are all 
baseless. Concerning Mr.. Mohsen Imam, 
claimed to have been killed, we wish to 
inform you that he is residing in Robat Karim 
in the periphery of Tehran and appeared on 
television and stated that he does no stay at 
the Dormitory. He showed his student 
identification card and personally rejected the

indicated that Mr. Seyyed Hussain Kazemi 
Borojerdi residing in Tehran was arrested of 
charges of establishing a sect with extremist 
persuasions, and acting and organising efforts 
to destroy public property, setting fire to a 
number of motorcycles and buses and 
concealing two firearms. He was sentenced to 
10 years in prison after completion of judicial 
proceedings. No person is prosecuted in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, solely for his/her 
belief or differences in easy of thinking, As is 
seen in the dossier of Kazemi he was 
convicted for his violent actions on the basis 
of law and due process.

</p>
<p>By letter dated 07/10/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Arash and Mr. Kamyar 
Alaie were arrested on the charge of acting 
against national security by collaborating 
with states belligerent to the Islamic Republic 
of Iran (U.S. and Israel). They identified 
experts and scientists in the country and sent 
them initially to one of the countries in the 
Persian gulf in the context of scientific 
cooperation and then to the United States 
where they were given quasi- espionage 
training. These activities and training were 
outside of the scope of then official activities 
and had absolutely no relation to their work. 
They were informed of the charges against 
them shortly after their arrest by the 
investigating judge who also remanded them. 
After filing a protest by the accused persons, 
their case was sent to the court where their 
protest was overruled on the 
</p>
<p>As is seen in their dossier, their arrest was 
totally on the basis of law and due process 
was applied in their trial. The charges against 
them have nothing to do with their activities 
that were alleged to be for prevention of 
AIDS, Regrettably, their humanitarian efforts 
in prevention, of AIDS were actually a cover 
for their illegal criminal activities that were 
contradictory to the national security and their 
medical profession,

<p>Concerning the arrest of a group between 400 
and 700 men by the Iraqi army in the Mosul 
region and their further transfer and abusive 
treatment in a secret detention facility near 
Baghdad.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, from 
September to December 2009, between 400 
and 700 men would have been arbitrarily 
arrested and detained by the Iraqi army in the 
course of an operation in the Mosul area and 
transferred to a secret detention facility near 
Baghdad, in the old Muthanna airport.  Since 
their arrest, the whereabouts of these detainees 
were allegedly unknown and family members 
would have been filing missing person reports.  
On 26 April 2010, 300 of these men would 
have been found in the Al Rusafa Detention 
Centre, of which 42 were reportedly 
interviewed.   
</p>
<p>While being held in such facility, this group of 
men would have been subject to torture and 
various forms of ill-treatment, including 
beatings; whipping; intentional wounding with 
firearms; breaking of limbs and teeth; 
suffocation; electric shocks; extraction of 
fingernails and toenails; acid and cigarette 
burns; rape by interrogators; detainees being 
forced to rape other detainees and threatened 
with rape of members of immediate family;

<p>humiliation; and denial of urgent medical 
treatment leading to, at least, one reported 
death in custody.   
</p>
<p>The alleged conditions of detention in the 
mentioned facility would have been 
inadequate, including overcrowding and poor 
holding facilities.  Detainees would have been 
intentionally denied access to medical care, 
family, and legal representatives. Further, 
according to the information received, no 
registry and/or records of the detention in such 
facility have been kept. Detainees would have 
been allegedly forced to sign false confessions 
of terrorist crimes.  
</p>
<p>Grave concern is expressed about the fact that 
the fate and whereabouts of 300 men of this 
group remained unknown between September-
December 2009 and April 2010 as well as 
about their physical and mental integrity.  Very 
serious concern is also expressed about the fact 
that the fate and whereabouts of the rest of the 
detainees in the framework of this operation 
remain unknown.  Serious concern is also 
expressed about the allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment which may have led to, at least, 
one case of death while in custody.  Further, 
concerned is expressed about the alleged 
conditions of detention as well as about the 
allegations of denial of medical treatment, legal 
counselling and family contacts.

<p>arrested in the Karrada District of Baghdad by 
Multinational Forces, American Battalion 101, 
who were reportedly wearing uniforms at the 
time of the arrest.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Khayat was reportedly initially 
detained in the Saddam Hussein International 
airport for a week, from 15 to 22 February 
2005, and was then transferred to the Abu 
Ghraib prison where he allegedly remained for 
a period of five months, from the end of 
February to the end of July 2005. According to 
reports received, Mr. Al-Khayat was then 
transferred to the Bouka Prison in Basra where 
he was detained for a period of one year, until 
the end of July 2006. During this time, he was 
visited for the first time by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on 17 
October 2005. Mr. Al-Khayat was then 
reportedly transferred back to the Abu Ghraib 
prison for two months, until the end of 
September 2006. His detention then allegedly 
continued at the Saddam Hussein International 
airport for a period of 7 months, until April 
</p><p>2007. It has been reported that during the time 
that Mr. Al-Khayat was under the custody of 
the American Battalion 101, he was held in 
secret detention for a period of three months, 
between 15 February and 15 May 2005  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 24 
April 2007, Mr. Al-Khayat was handed over to 
the Iraqi authorities. Following his transfer, 
Mr. Al-Khayat was detained in the Badush 
prison in Mosul city for 8 months, during 
which he was tried. In November 2007, he was 
reportedly transferred to the Soussa Castle 
where he remained for a period of sixteenth 
months, during which time he was again

sentence, on 18 October 2009, after 4 years and 
8 months of detention, and repatriated to the 
Syria Arab Republic under the auspices of the 
ICRC that same day. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, Mr. Al-
Khayat suffered torture and ill-treatment while 
in detention both in the hands of the American 
Battalion 101 and the Iraqi authorities. Under 
the custody of the American Battalion 101, in 
addition to being severly beaten, Mr. Al-
Khayat was reportedly tortured with an electric 
gun, had pepper spray sprayed in his eyes, his 
front teeth were broken, and a vein on his wrist 
was cut allegedly as a result of being shot by a 
U.S. soldier. It has been reported that, while in 
the hands of the Iraqi authorities, Mr. Al-
Khayat was forced to stand in the sun for 
extended periods of time and was severely 
beaten. It is alleged that the aim of this torture 
was to force Mr. Al-Khayat to make 
confessions, which he did. He was not allowed 
to read these confessions, which were later 
used in his trial.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Khayat was tried in 2006 by the Iraqi 
authorities, reportedly without being allowed to 
appoint a lawyer. It is alleged that during the 
trial, he informed the court that these 
confessions had been taken under torture but 
the court reportedly did not take this into 
account. He was sentenced to three years, on 
charges of breaching the residency law but was 
released on 18 October 2009.

<p>received, which originates from Government 
files of the United States of America, and has, 
subsequently, become publicly dubbed &#8220;the 
Wikileaks Iraq War logs&#8221;, relating to the 
alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi 
citizens by Iraqi security forces. We wish to 
inform your Excellency&#8217;s Government that we 
have addressed a similar letter to the 
Government of the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, there 
was extensive abuse of detainees by Iraqi 
security forces over a five-year period between 
2004 and 2009. The allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment were documented by forces of the 
United States of America. The information also 
suggests that such acts were conducted with 
impunity and appears to go normally 
unpunished. It is alleged that the vast majority 
of detainees are Sunni Arabs from central, 
western and north-western Iraq, held on 
suspicion of involvement in or supporting the 
Sunni armed groups that have fought against 
the Iraqi Government and US forces. The 
information received also points out that many 
hundreds of Shi&#8217;a Muslims suspected of 
supporting the al-Mahdi Army &#8211; followers of 
the radical religious figure Muqtada al-Sadr &#8211; 
who until recently engaged in armed activities 
against Iraqi and US forces, mainly in Baghdad 
and southern Iraq, form a sizable part of the 
detainee population. Most of the detainees have 
been held on suspicion of terrorism-related 
offences on the basis of the 2005 Iraqi Anti-
Terrorism Law, but without trial or charges 
being brought against them, and in some cases 
detained incommunicado or in secret detention 
facilities, for several years. The Anti-Terrorism 
Law defines terrorism broadly as &#8220;any criminal 
act carried out by an individual or an organized 
group targeting an individual, a group of 
individuals, national or private institutions and </p>

<p>causing damage to private or public properties 
with the aim of affecting the safety or security 
situation or national unity, or to terrorise and

</p>
<p>Thousands of Iraqi nationals who had been 
detained by US forces were handed over from 
US to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and 
July 2010 under a November 2008 US-Iraq 
agreement that contains no provisions for 
safeguarding the detainees&#8217; physical and 
mental integrity after the transfer. Article 4(3) 
of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), 
taking effect at midnight on 31 December 
2008, only states in broad terms that: &#8220;It is the 
duty of the United States Forces to respect the 
laws, customs, and traditions of Iraq and 
applicable international law.&#8221; It is alleged that 
tens of thousands of detainees are still being 
held by Iraqi authorities without trial, despite a 
2008 Amnesty Law that provided for the 
release of all uncharged detainees after six 
months of detention if they have not been 
brought before an investigative judge, and after 
one year of detention if they have not been 
referred to a specialized court. 
</p>
<p>We wish to draw your attention to two 
examples from &#8220;the war logs&#8221; as illustrations 
of several hundred allegations of systematic 
torture and ill-treatment by Iraqi forces.

<p>107.     Alleged excessive use of force by Iraqi  
security forces during an operation on 28 and 
29 July 2009 in Camp Ashraf, resulting in the 
death of eleven residents of Camp Ashraf and 
the wounding of over 200. 
(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para. 151) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 29/09/2010, the Government 
indicated that the following is the position of 
the Iraqi Government on the file pertaining to 
Camp New Iraq (formerly Camp Ashraf) 
since its assumption of responsibility for 
security: 
</p>
<p>1. After assuming responsibility for security 
on 30 June 2009 and imposing its sovereignty 
over the whole territory of Iraq, including 
Camp New Iraq, the Iraqi Government 
informed representatives of the residents of 
the Camp at a number of meetings attended 
by representatives of the United States 
Embassy in Iraq of its decision to open a 
police station in the Camp. The response of 
the Organization&#8217;s leadership was to reject 
the decision and to deny entry to the security 
forces. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee held a number of meetings 
with relevant international organizations, 
including the International Committee of the 
Red Cross and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in order to explain the Committee&#8217;s 
decision to open an Iraqi police station. The 
Committee&#8217;s decisions and the right of the 
Iraqi Government to impose its sovereignty </p>

<p>over the whole territory of Iraq, including the 
opening of an Iraqi police station in Camp 
New Iraq, were endorsed. 
</p>
<p>3. On 27 July 2009 the Iraqi Government&#8217;s 
decision to open a police station was 
implemented. Before the Camp was entered, 
negotiations were held for more than two 
hours, in the presence of the American side, 
with the leadership of the Organization in the 
Camp concerning the entry of the staff of the 
police station. The negotiations ended with 
the Camp leadership&#8217;s rejection of the 
decision to open the police station, and the 
security forces then proceeded to carry out 
their duty. The military leadership had 
ordered that weapons should not be loaded. 
The security forces met with opposition from 
the residents of the Camp, who used sticks, 
stones, sound grenades, swords and knives, 
and were sprayed with chlorine gas. The 
security forces achieved their aim of reaching 
the place within the Camp that had been 
selected for the police station. 
</p>
<p>4. The results of the entry operation were as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) Sixty-two members and 7 officers of the 
security forces were injured and more than 20 
Iraqi vehicles were seriously damaged; 
</p>
<p>(b) Thirty-six Camp residents were arrested 
when they left the Camp and attacked the 
security forces; they are now subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Iraqi judicial authorities in 
Diyala and have been placed in an 
appropriate detention centre that complies 
with human rights principles; they have been 
examined daily by doctors but refuse to be 
transferred to Government hospitals and are 
on hunger strike;

<p>al Gharbiya, near Jenin, in the West Bank.  
</p>
<p>Each of the children was visited in the middle 
of the night by Israeli soldiers who came and 
searched their houses, before escorting the 
children, accompanied by their fathers, to the 
village youth centre. At the village youth 
centre, each was accused of having thrown 
stones at the Wall. After their fathers had 
departed, they continued to be interrogated 
and, in order to obtain their confessions, were 
threatened with being transferred to Israeli 
intelligence.  
</p>
<p>Each child was blindfolded and placed in a 
large military vehicle with other children and 
transferred to Salem Interrogation and 
Detention Centre, where they were further 
interrogated by men in uniforms. The children 
were threatened with beatings and further 
detention, and each of them, afraid of the 
threats, confessed to having thrown stones and 
were forced to sign written confessions in 
Hebrew and/or Arabic which they did not 
understand. None of the children were given 
access to lawyers until they appeared inside the 
military court.  
</p>
<p>The second incident occurred in Haris village, 
near the city of Salfit, on 26 March 2009. On 
that date, Israeli soldiers entered several 
homes, ransacked houses and placed the village 
under curfew. They took at least 90 children 
from their homes and detained them at the 
village secondary school for almost a day, in 
order to prevent them from throwing stones at 
passing military vehicles. Four children were 
arrested. There were reports that during their 
detention, the children&#8217;s hands were tightly tied 
with plastic restraints, they were cursed at, 
kicked, slapped and beaten, particularly in the 
bathroom.  </p>

family during this initial detention.  
</p>
<p>The final incident occurred on 14 July 2009 in 
the village of Azzun, near Qalqiliya in the

</p>
<p>Concerning the arrest and detention of Mr. 
Jamal Juma. Mr. Juma has been the coordinator 
of the &#8220;Stop the Wall Campaign&#8221;, a Palestinian 
grassroots human rights organization, since 
</p><p>2002. A joint communication concerning the 
arrest and detention of another member of the 
&#8220;Stop the Wall Campaign&#8221;, Mr. Mohammad 
Othman, on 13 November 2009.  
</p>
<p>On 15 December 2009, Mr. Jamal Juma was 
summoned for interrogation by the Israeli 
Security Forces. After he had been interrogated 
at the Qalandia checkpoint, Mr. Juma was 
brought back to his house by security officials, 
who searched the premises for several hours 
and confiscated his computer and cell phone. 
He has been detained at the Moskobiyyeh 
Interrogation Center since 16 December, 
without charges and without access to a lawyer 
or family members. The court decided on 17 
December to introduce a ban on contacts with 
his attorney.  
</p>
<p>The first court hearing in Mr. Juma&#8217;s case was 
held on 21 December 2009, at the 
Moskobiyyeh Interrogation Center in the 
Russian Compound district of Jerusalem. 
Although the prosecution requested a 14-day 
extension of his detention period, the military 
judge granted only a 4-day extension for 
interrogation purposes. However, the court 
decided to interrogate Mr. Juma under the 
military court system, despite arguments of his 
attorney that the military court lacked 
jurisdiction over him, and that as a resident of 
East Jerusalem he should be brought before a 
civilian court. The next hearing in Mr. Jamal 
Juma&#8217;s case has been set for 24 December 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention without charge of Mr. Jamal Juma 
may be directly related to his peaceful 
</p>
<p>In a letter dated 12 February 2010, the 
Government responded to the communication 
sent on 23 December 2009. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Juma was arrested on December 16, 2009 
and was interrogated by the security forces 
for suspicions of contacting a foreign agent of 
a terrorist organization 
</p>
<p>The interrogation materials in his regard were 
transferred to the military prosecution in the 
West Bank for review and decision regarding 
his indictment. After reviewing his case it 
was decided not to file an indictment against 
Mr. Juma at this time. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Juma was released on 
January 13, 2010. 
</p>
<p>Response (not sure where this should be 
placed) 
</p>
<p>In confronting the threat of terrorism and 
protecting its civilians from suicide bombers 
and other attacks, Israel, like other countries 
facing such threats, has found that the use of 
administrative detention is, on occasion, a 
necessary and effective measure.  
</p>
<p>Where sufficient, admissible evidence exists 
against an individual, the authorities are 
required to bring those individuals to justice, 
rather than adopt such measures as 
administrative detention. Thus, this measure 
may be used as an exception only when the 
evidence in existence is clear, concrete and 
trustworthy, but for reasons of confidentiality 
and protection of intelligence sources, cannot 
be presented as evidence in ordinary criminal 
proceedings.

<p>activities in defense of human rights, especially 
to his advocacy work against the construction 
of the separation wall. In light of his 
incommunicado detention, further concern is 
expressed regarding the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Jamal Juma.  
</p>
<p>above, is recognized by international law and 
is in full conformity with Article 78 of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention 1949. 
</p>
<p>As an additional safeguard, the measure is 
only used in cases where there is 
corroborating evidence that an individual is 
engaged in illegal acts that endanger security 
and the lives of civilians, and each order is 
subject to judicial review. Administrative 
detention orders are limited to six months and 
any extension requires a re-evaluation of the 
relevant intelligence material, as well s 
further judicial review. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, local legislation governing the 
process grants all relevant individuals the 
rights to appeal the order to the Military 
Court of Appeals, for judicial review. 
Petitioners may be represented by counsel of 
their choice at every stage of there 
proceedings. All individuals have the 
additional rights to petition the Israeli High

</p>
<p>The above-mentioned 13 individuals were 
removed from their homes in the occupied 
Palestinian territory and taken to Al Jalame, 
which is an interrogation and detention centre 
located in northern Israel, near the city of 
Haifa. Reports indicate that cell no. 36 of Al 
Jalame is used to hold minors in solitary 
confinement in order to extract confessions. 
Minors held at Al Jalame for interrogation are 
denied access to a lawyer and do not receive 
family visits. 
</p>
<p>On 10 February 2008, A.S. was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from his family home around 
7:00 a.m. He was blindfolded and his hands 
were tied behind his back with plastic ties. A.S. 
was transferred to an Israeli military base at 
Soufin, near Qalqiliya where he was examined 
by a doctor. Reports indicate that A.S. was 
beaten by soldiers at the military base. Later on 
the same day, A.S was transferred to Huwwara 
Interrogation and Detention Centre and then to 
Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. 
There, he was allegedly put in a very small cell 
for the following 15 days. Information received 
suggests that A.S. had been interrogated for 
three days. For an entire day, his hands and feet 
were tied to the wall in the shape of a cross 
which caused severe pain and the swelling of 
his hands. He had to urinate in the cell. 
Subsequently, A.S. was transferred to Damoun 
prison. Abed Saleem was released from 
detention on 10 December 2009.

<p>Israeli soldiers from his family home around 
2:00 a.m.  He was blindfolded and his hands 
were tied behind his back with plastic ties 
before he was placed on the floor of a jeep for 
transfer. M.A. was first taken to a military 
checkpoint at Etzion Junction, in the West 
Bank. M.A. was reportedly slapped and kicked 
by a soldier for around five minutes at the 
checkpoint. M.A. was later transferred to 
Etzion Interrogation and Detention Centre and 
Ofer prison, in the West Bank, where he had 
been interrogated for eight days. Subsequently, 
he was transferred to Al Jalame Interrogation 
and Detention Centre, where he was detained 
for 25 days in total. During the first five days, 
he was put in a cell by himself. Afterwards, he 
was interrogated and was made to sit on a 
metal chair which was tied to the floor and his 
hands were tied behind his back. The 
interrogator, who introduced himself as 
&#8220;Chris&#8221;, told him that there were people who 
had confessed against him. During the 
interrogation, which lasted about one hour, the 
interrogator was shouting in M.A.&#8217;s face to 
make him confess, but he refused to. On the 
18th day of his detention, he was again 
interrogated.  After the interrogator threatened 
M.A. that his mother and siblings would be 
arrested, he confessed of throwing stones and 
Molotov cocktails. After he had confessed, 
they took him out of the cell and put him in a 
normal cell. After his confession, M.A. was 
transferred to Telmond Prison, near Tel Aviv. 
M.A. was accused of being a member of a 
banned organisation. His current situation and 
condition are unknown. 
</p>
<p>On 10 March 2008, S. K. was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from his family home around 
3:00 a.m. He was blindfolded and his hands 
were tied behind his back with plastic ties. He 
was then placed in a jeep for transfer to Salem </p>

<p>Interrogation and Detention Centre and 
subsequently to Al Jalame Interrogation and 
Detention Centre. S. K was put in a cell with 
another child, in which he stayed for 14 days. 
The cell was very small for two persons and 
had dim yellow lights and two holes in the 
ceiling for ventilation. The walls were grey and 
rough so that one could not lean back against 
them.  It was very hot inside the cell. The food, 
which was insufficient for two persons, was 
slipped through a small hole in the door. After 
two weeks, two additional persons were 
brought into the cell, which enhanced the 
overcrowding in the cell. The inmates only left 
the cell for interrogation or proceedings to 
extend the periods of imprisonment. On 13 
March 2008, S.K. was taken out of the cell for 
interrogation. S.K. was made to sit on a very 
small chair from midday to 6 p.m. His hands 
were tied behind his back which caused pain. 
He was allowed to go to the bathroom once. 
The interrogation was conducted by an 
interrogator whose name was reportedly Ran. 
He was then taken back to the cell and not 
being interrogated for another week. After that 
period, he was again brought for interrogation 
where he was confronted with a confession of 
one of his friends against him. Then, the 
interrogator wrote S.K.&#8217;s statement in Hebrew 
and asked him to sign it but he refused. Instead, 
S.K. asked to write his own statement in 
Arabic. This interrogation lasted for one and a 
half hours. After the interrogation, S.K. was 
transferred to Telmond Prison, near Tel Aviv. 
S.K. was accused of firing at soldiers and was 
sentenced by a military court to 30 months 
imprisonment. He is currently being detained 
and is scheduled to be released on 10 
September 2010.

<p>On 23 April 2008, A.A.was arrested by Israeli 
soldiers from his family home at 2:00 a.m. </p>

<p>Abed Akrout&#8217;s hands and legs were tied. A 
soldier grabbed A.A.by the hair and pushed 
him towards a jeep, banging his head against 
the bonnet, before putting him inside on the 
floor of the vehicle. A.A.was first taken to 
Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre 
and then Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention 
Centre. Upon arrival, he was taken to a room 
where his hands were tied from the back to a 
small chair, which was fixed to the floor. The 
interrogator, who introduced himself as 
&#8220;Franco&#8221;, spoke Arabic and stated that he 
ordered Abed Akrout&#8217;s arrest. A.A.was then 
put in solitary confinement and when he was 
interrogated again, he was once slapped hard in 
the face. Consequently, A.A.confessed to firing 
at a military jeep with a handgun.  Eight days 
after being arrested, the Al Jalame military 
court extended Abed Akrout&#8217;s detention period 
for another eight days. After his court 
appearance to extend his detention, A.A.was 
put in a very small cell where it was very 
difficult to sleep. The walls were painted grey 
and had some protrusions. The light was very 
dim. A.A.spent 65 days by himself in this cell. 
At the end of the 65 day period, A.A.was taken 
to the interrogator who asked him to write 
another statement about the shooting incident 
with more details this time. He promised that if 
A.A.wrote it, he would allow him to call his 
family. A.A.did what the interrogator told him 
and was allowed to talk to his family. Shortly 
after writing the statement, A.A.was 
transferred to Telmond Prison. A.A.was 
charged with shooting at a military vehicle and 
sentenced by an Israeli military court. He is 
still being detained and is scheduled be 
released on 23 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>On 12 August 2008, A.&#8217;A., was arrested by

<p>began calling to his mother to say goodbye, 
whereupon he was slapped violently on the 
neck by a soldier. A.&#8217;A. was blindfolded but 
not tied and was pushed into a jeep and made 
to sit on the floor. He was first taken to 
Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre 
and then to Al Jalame Interrogation and 
Detention Centre. Several weeks before being 
arrested, A.&#8217;A. reportedly found an unexploded 
device on the ground which he picked up 
causing it to explode. He lost two fingers from 
his right hand which was still bandaged at the 
time of his arrest. He was first taken before an 
interrogator upon arrival at Al Jalame and was 
told that he should confess to all charges to be 
brought against him as otherwise he would not 
have the bandages around his hand changed 
and therefore his hand would rot. Afterwards 
he was taken to a small cell, which had no 
ventilation. The cell, which was reportedly 
called cell no. 36, had holes for ventilation 
only; it had no windows. A.&#8217;A. slept on a 
mattress on the ground. The cell had one 
dimmed yellow light that was kept on for 24 
hours a day. The walls were grey, and had 
rough surfaces, so it was difficult to lean 
against them. A.&#8217;A. was kept in the cell for two 
days before being taken back for interrogation. 
For the interrogation, he was seated on a small 
chair. His feet and his left hand were tied to the 
chair. His right hand was kept free due to the 
injury. A.&#8217;A. was kept tied in this manner for a 
long time in the room without being 
interrogated or asked anything. &#8220;I will keep 
you alone until you rot,&#8221; the interrogator said. 
During interrogation, the interrogator shouted 
at A.&#8217;A. and threatened him again that he 
would not change the bandages and would let 
his hand rot. Subsequently, A.&#8217;A. confessed 
different offences as he wanted to end the 
interrogation. On 4 September 2008, A.&#8217;A. was </p>

<p>transferred to Telmond and then Megiddo 
Prison. A.&#8217;A. was charged with being a 
member of a banned organisation and 
sentenced by a military court. A.&#8217;A. was 
released on 12 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>On 30 October 2008, M.S. was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from his family home around 
1:30 a.m. Soldiers ordered everybody out of 
the house and one soldier threatened M.S. that 
anybody found inside the house would be shot 
at. M.S.&#8217;s hands were tied behind his back with 
plastic ties and a sack was placed over his head 
before he was placed on the floor of a jeep for 
transfer. During this transfer, M.S. was kicked 
and beaten by soldiers inside the vehicle. M.S. 
was first transferred to Huwwara Interrogation 
and Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame 
Interrogation and Detention Centre. M.S. was 
taken to cell 36, which was small and measured 
about 3x2 metres. There was a toilet inside the 
cell, but no shower. A mattress was on the 
floor. The walls were grey and rough. A yellow 
dim light was lit 24 hours a day, which hurt the 
eyes. He was kept for four days in the cell. He 
was given food through a hole in the door. 
Four days later, he was taken to the 
interrogation room, which had a desk and 
computer. There was a metal chair tied to the 
floor and placed in front of the desk. Shackles 
were also attached to the back of the chair. 
M.S. was forced to sit on the chair and his 
hands were tied behind his back with the 
shackles. M.S. was kept in this room sitting on 
the chair for about an hour, during which time 
no one was in the room except for him. One 
hour later, an interrogator who introduced 
himself as &#8220;Victor&#8221; entered the room and asked 
M.S. about his cell. When M.S. informed him 
about the cell, the interrogator told him that if 
he wants to get out of the cell, he would have 
to cooperate with the interrogator. He was then </p>

<p>asked about his activities and when M.S. stated 
that he had not done anything endangering 
security he was taken back to the cell. The next 
day, M.S. was taken again for interrogation. He 
was accused of conspiracy to carry out a 
suicide bombing, possession of weapons, and 
throwing home-made grenades, which M.S. 
denied. The interrogator said that M.S.&#8217;s 
friends have already confessed. For ten days, 
M.S. was taken every day for interrogation, 
which followed the same scheme. On the 10th 
day of interrogation, M. S. confessed to all 
accusations made against him so as to get out 
of the cell. These include conspiracy to carry 
out a suicide bombing, possession of weapons, 
manufacturing of explosives, throwing home-
made grenades, stones and Molotov cocktails. 
M.S. spent four more days in cell no. 36 before 
being transferred to Telmond, Megiddo and 
Damoun prisons. M.S. was sentenced by a 
military court to 45 months imprisonment and 
fined NIS 1,000. (US$250). M.S. is still being 
held inside Israel and is scheduled to be 
released on 3 July 2012. 
</p>
<p>On 13 January 2009, A.S. and two friends went 
to throw stones at settler cars travelling on the 
by-pass road between Qalqiliya and Nablus, to 
protest the Israeli offensive in Gaza. One of the 
boys was killed when the stone he threw 
bounced back off a car and struck him in the 
head. The remaining boys flagged down a 
passing car for help. The car they flagged down 
belonged to a guard from a local Israeli 
settlement who called the army to arrest the 
boys. The arriving soldiers tied A.S.&#8217;s hands so 
tight they began to swell and turn blue. A.S. 
asked the soldiers to loosen the ties but they 
refused. A.S. was first taken to Ariel Police 
Station, then to Huwwara Interrogation and 
Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame 
Interrogation and Detention Centre. A.S. was </p>

<p>taken to a small cell at Al Jalame. It had one 
yellow light that was on for 24 hours a day. It 
did not have any windows; only ventilation 
holes. The walls were grey, and had a rough 
surface. A.S. stayed inside this cell for 20 days. 
A.S. was interrogated three times, during 
which he confessed to having thrown stones 
three times. During interrogation, the 
interrogator shouted at him. A.S. had to sit with 
his head down and his hands were tied behind 
his back. The Al Jalame military court 
extended A.S.&#8217;s detention twice. After 20 days, 
A.S. was transferred to Megiddo Prison. A.S. 
was charged with throwing stones. He was 
convicted by a military court on 27 December 
</p><p>2009. His release is scheduled for 13 
December 2011. 
</p>
<p>On 13 January 2009, M.Z. went with A.S. and 
another minor to throw stones at a settler by-
pass road in protest at the Israeli offensive in 
Gaza (see above). One of the boys was killed 
when he was struck in the head by a rock. The 
other boys were arrested. Soldiers blindfolded 
M.Z. and tied his hands painfully tight. M.Z. 
was first transferred to Ariel Settlement, then 
Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre 
and then Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention 
Centre. He was kept in a small cell at Al 
Jalame, which had some gaps for ventilation 
and a bathroom. The light was yellow and dim 
and on around the clock. The walls were grey 
and had a rough surface so that a person could 
not lean against them. He was kept in the cell 
until 18 January 2009. On that day, he was 
taken out of the cell for the first time. He was 
taken to an interrogation room and made to sit 
on a small chair tied to the floor. They tied his 
hands to the chair and behind his back. He was 
kept in this position for about four hours, 
during which time he confessed to throwing 
stones twice and a Molotov cocktail once. M.Z. </p>

<p>signed a statement that was written in Hebrew. 
During interrogation, the interrogator kept 
shouting at him and threatened him to break his 
head. After the interrogation, he was taken to 
another cell, which was in the basement. He 
had to sleep on the floor in this cell, which was 
very cold. The next day, he was again taken to 
the interrogation room to meet with the same 
interrogator. He told the interrogator the same 
as he told him before. After 20 days in Al 
Jalame, M.Z. was transferred to Megiddo 
Prison. M.Z. was charged with throwing stones 
at Israeli cars. He was convicted by a military 
court on 27 December 2009. His release is 
scheduled for 13 December 2011.   
</p>
<p>On 21 January 2009, Israeli soldiers raided 
M.S.&#8217;s house but he was not there. The next 
day, he voluntarily gave himself up to the 
soldiers. M.S. was then picked up by soldiers 
in his village and transferred to Yakir Military 
Base. He was not tied or blindfolded. He was 
then transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and 
Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame. There, 
he was kept in a narrow cell that had no 
windows, just some gaps for ventilation. The 
walls were grey. The light was dim and yellow. 
It had a bathroom and a concrete bed. He spent 
two days in the cell without being asked 
anything. Afterwards, he was taken to an 
interrogator. The interrogator seated M.S. on a 
metal chair and tied his hands to the chair 
behind his back. He was accused of throwing 
Molotov cocktails and stones. M.S. was then 
taken back to the cell, and kept there for 24 
hours. Then he was taken back to the 
interrogation room and the same interrogator. 
The interrogator said that he would help him 
because he turned himself in. M.S. confessed 
to throwing Molotov cocktails and stones. M.S. 
was held for 20 days in Al Jalame before being 
transferred to Megiddo Prison. He was accused </p>

<p>On 22 January 2009, T.K.was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from the family home around 
midnight. He was pushed to the ground and his 
hands were tied tightly behind his back with 
plastic ties. T.K.was blindfolded and made to 
sit on the floor of a jeep for transfer. T.K.was 
first transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and 
Detention Centre before being transferred to Al 
Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. 
From 22 to 25 January 2009, T.K.was kept in a 
small cell of approximately 3x2 meters. Its 
walls had a rough surface and they were grey; 
so one could not lean against them. It had no 
windows; only gaps for ventilation. The cell 
had only one dim yellow light that was lit the 
whole time and hurt the eyes. The cell had a 
toilet but no shower. He was provided with 
food through a hole in the door. On 25 January 
2009, T.K.was taken to an interrogation room. 
There was a small metal chair in this room 
which was difficult to sit on. He was ordered to 
sit on this chair that was tied to the ground, and 
he was tied to the chair. He sat in this room for 
about an hour without being asked anything. 
Afterwards, an interrogator speaking fluent 
Arabic entered the room and told T.K.to 
confess. If he confessed he would be treated 
well. The interrogator made several 
accusations against him but T.K.did not 
confess to anything. This interrogation lasted 
about an hour. Afterwards, he was taken back 
to the cell and kept there for two weeks. He 
was not allowed to leave the cell. After two 
weeks, he was told that the interrogation was 
over and that he would be moved to a regular 
cell with the other detainees. T.K.was placed in 
a room with eight detainees, in addition to two </p>

sufficiently ventilated; it also had a television. 
In this cell, where he stayed for five days, 
T.K.signed confessions written by an informant 
who claimed to be from the West Bank and a 
security detainee in charge of the detainees. 
Afterwards, T.K.was taken back to the cell and 
the interrogation room, where he was seated 
again on the same metal chair. He was again 
tied. The same interrogator entered the room 
with his signed confessions. T.K.was then 
taken back to his cell where he spent 13 days, 
during which he was taken to the interrogation 
room every two days. T.K.confessed to all 
accusations made against him by giving a 
statement to the police. On 22 February 2009, 
T.K.was transferred to Megiddo Prison. 
T.K.was convicted by a military court to 42 
months of imprisonment. He is scheduled to be 
released on 22 July 2012.

<p>On 30 January 2009, M.R. was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from the family home around 
1:30 a.m. M.R. had his hands tied behind his 
back and was made to sit on the ground for 
about half-an-hour, before being blindfolded 
and placed in the back of a truck. The truck 
arrived at a military base and M.R. was taken 
to a clinic. At the entrance to the clinic a 
soldier grabbed the back of his head and 
slammed it against the clinic door, causing 
bruising to his forehead and resulting in a 
headache. Inside the clinic the doctor asked 
him a few general questions and filled in a 
questionnaire. M.R. hands were then retied and 
he was blindfolded again and taken outside 
where he was made to sit on his knees on the 
ground until around 10:00 a.m., a period of at 
least five hours. Afterwards, M.R. was 
transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and 
Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame

measured about 2 x 2.5 metres. However, 
another detainee was already inside the cell. As 
the cell was very narrow, the two detainees had 
difficulty to sleep.  The walls of the cell were 
grey and had rough surfaces so that one could 
not lean against them. There were no windows, 
just one gap for ventilation. A yellow dim light 
was lit 24 hours. M.R. remained in cell 36 for 
over two days before being taken for 
interrogation on 1 February 2009. M.R. was 
not tied and was seated in an ordinary chair. 
The interrogator asked him why he endangered 
State security. M.R. replied that he had not 
done anything to endanger State security. The 
interrogation lasted 15 minutes and he was then 
taken back to cell 36 for another day. On 2 
February 2009, M.R. was taken by a prison 
guard to another part of the detention centre 
where three other children were located and 
conditions were good. While in this section, 
M.R. informed two men, who introduced 
themselves as a detainee working with the Red 
Cross (Abu Taha) and the Fateh representative 
in the prison (Abu al-Abed), that he had thrown 
stones at Israeli cars and military vehicles. On 
5 February 2009, M.R. was taken back to cell

interrogation room and forced to sit on a small 
plastic chair that was tied to the floor. This 
time his hands were tied behind his back to the 
chair. The interrogator then accused M.R. that 
he had thrown stones at Israeli cars. When 
M.R. denied, the interrogator began shouting 
and said &#8220;I&#8217;ll beat the hell out of you if you 
don&#8217;t confess.&#8221; The interrogator then showed 
the confession that M.R. had given to the two 
men.  M.R. then confessed to throwing stones 
but denied a further accusation of throwing 
Molotov cocktails. The interrogation lasted 
around three hours during which time M.R. </p>

<p>On 24 February 2009, U.M. was arrested by 
Israeli soldiers from his family home around 
12:30 a.m. U.M.&#8217;s hands were tied tightly 
behind his back and he was blindfolded before 
being placed inside a military vehicle. U.M. 
was first taken to Huwwara Interrogation and 
Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame 
Interrogation and Detention Centre. Upon 
arrival at Al Jalame, he was taken to a doctor 
who examined him and was then taken to a cell 
that measured about 2x 2,5 meters.  The cell 
was closed from all sides and had only two 
gaps for ventilation. Its walls were grey and 
they had a rough surface so that it was difficult 
to lean against them. There was a toilet inside 
the cell. There were no mattresses and one had 
to sleep on the floor. U.M. was provided with 
food through a hole in the door. The light in the 
cell was yellow and dim. On 25 February 2009, 
he was taken to an interrogation room. An 
interrogator, who introduced himself as 
&#8220;Franco&#8221; was waiting for him in the room. 
U.M. was made to sit on a small low metal 
chair, which was tied to the floor in the middle 
of the room. U.M.&#8217;s hands were tied to the 
chair with shackles that were already tied to the 
chair. The interrogator asked U.M. general 
questions about his cousin, who had been 
arrested 25 days before. U.M. denied having 
done anything. In the course of the 
interrogation, the interrogator threatened U.M. 
to break his head if he did not confess. After

approached U.M. and introduced themselves as 
Abu Taha (50) and Abu al-Abed (40). They 
WGEIDlayed a great interest in U.M.&#8217;s 
situation. Everything that U.M. told them was 
written down by Abu al-Abed. Afterwards, the 
prison guard took U.M. to the interrogation 
room where &#8220;Franco&#8221; was waiting with the 
papers Abu al-Abed had written earlier.  U.M. 
first denied everything, but when the 
interrogator put pressure on him, U.M. 
confessed to all charges against him. On the 
same day, the police took his statement and 
U.M. was then taken back to the cell. After 40 
days at Al Jalame, U.M. was transferred to

affiliation with a banned organisation and 
preparing a Molotov cocktail. U.M. has not yet

M.A.in the neck causing him to fall to the 
floor. His hands were then tied with plastic 
cords behind his back and he was blindfolded. 
M.A.was then taken outside and placed on the 
floor of a waiting jeep. Once inside the jeep, 
M.A.was repeatedly kicked and slapped in the

interrogation. An interrogator, who introduced 
himself as Roee, accused him of having 
contacts with an external informant. M.A.was 
tied to a low metal chair he was sitting on. 
When M.A.refused to confess, the interrogator 
said that he will be locked up in the cell. 
M.A.was then taken back to the small cell 
where he remained for five days.  Afterwards, 
he was taken again for further interrogation. 
During the interrogation, the interrogator said 
that he knew everything about Monther 
Amarnah. When he denied the accusations, the 
interrogator started shouting and insulting him. 
Afterwards, M.A.was taken back to the cell. 
Three days later, M.A.was again taken for 
interrogation. This time, he confessed to 
having been in contact with an external

denied having assaulted Israeli soldiers at the

<p>TOR of sexual assault during interrogations by 
Israeli security and law enforcement personnel 
against nine Palestinian children in order to 
extract confessions.  
</p>
<p>Between January 2009 and April 2010, Israeli 
soldiers, policemen, Israeli Security Agency 
(ISA) interrogators and prison officers, have 
violently arrested, often from their homes, nine 
children aged between 13 and 16 years.  These 
arrests have allegedly been accompanied by 
violence and property damage.  During these 
arrests, children were reportedly blindfolded 
and their hands tied tightly behind their backs 
with plastic ties that have reportedly caused 
injuries in their flesh. 
</p>
<p>On arrival at interrogation and detention 
centres, children were allegedly denied access 
to a lawyer, for days or weeks, until the end of 
the interrogation process and once confessions 
were obtained.  According to the information 
received, abusive and threatening techniques 
are being employed against Palestinian 
children during interrogation, including sexual 
assault and threats of sexual assault, in order to 
obtain confessions.   
</p>
<p>Furthermore, children were reportedly made to 
sign confessions in Hebrew, a language few of 
them understand.  According to the allegations 
received, these confessions constitute primary 
evidence against the children in military courts.  
</p>
<p>According to reports received, the following 
children have been victims of the alleged 
incidences.  The list below includes 
information about name, sex, age, occupation, 
nationality as well as date and place of arrest 
and place of sexual assault or threat of sexual

<p>On 27 October 2010, Mr. Ameer Makhoul was 
convicted by Haifa district court of 
involvement in espionage operations with the 
Lebanese organization Hezbollah. It is reported 
that Mr. Makhoul was found guilty, subsequent 
to confession which formed part of a plea 
bargain reached between the prosecution and 
defence, on charges of contact with a foreign 
agent, espionage and aggravated espionage. 
Mr. Makhoul also pleaded guilty to charges of 
conspiracy to aid the enemy in a time of war, a 
charge which was later dropped. 
</p>
<p>Concern has been expressed that Mr. Makhoul 
may have confessed to these crimes as a result 
of torture or the use of other forms of violence 
against him while in detention. It is reported 
that Mr. Makhoul  previously stated in the 
Magistrate's Court in Petah Tikva that he had 
admitted to false accusations under duress, due 
to the harsh methods of interrogation to which 
he was subjected. Said methods of 
interrogation reportedly included sleep 
deprivation and constant interrogation while 
being tightly bound to an undersized chair in 
such a way as to cause him extreme pain.

<p>Mr. Makhoul is due to be sentenced in

military jeeps with Israeli soldiers surrounded 
Ms. Hana Shalabi&#8217;s house in Burqin village, 
near the West Bank town of Jenin. On 14 
September 2009, Ms. Shalabi was allegedly 
arrested by Israeli soldiers at her family home. 
Reportedly, Israeli soldiers acted in accordance 
with Military Order 378, Article 78(a) which 
authorizes an Israeli soldier to arrest and detain 
for up to eight days a Palestinian from the West 
Bank.  The Israeli soldiers allegedly shouted at 
and verbally abused Ms. Shalabi and members 
of her family and demanded that Ms. Shalabi 
hand over her identity card. It is reported that 
one Israeli soldier hit Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s father, 
aged 63, on his chest with the butt of a rifle, 
when he tried to intervene with an attempt to 
protect his daughter from verbal abuse. Ms. 
Shalabi was reportedly handcuffed and taken to 
Salem Detention Center in Occupied 
Palestinian Territory.

<p>It is alleged that some of the male soldiers 
accompanying Ms. Shalabi in the military jeep 
took pictures of Ms. Shalabi when her Muslim 
religious dress fell open, exposing her clothes

was subsequently transferred to Kishon

reportedly held in solitary confinement for 
eight days from 14 to 22 September 2009. Ms. 
Shalabi was allegedly subjected to daily 
interrogation sessions lasting from early 
morning to late evening for eight consecutive 
days and was allegedly subjected to sexual

<p>interrogators slapped Ms. Shalabi on the face 
and beat her arms and hands when Ms. Shalabi 
started shouting at the Israeli interrogator in 
response to the interrogator&#8217;s offensive and 
provocative way of calling her Habibti&#8221; 
(Arabic for &#8220;darling&#8221;). It is reported that after 
this incident the guards took Ms. Shalabi back 
to her cell, tied her to the bed frame and started 
taking pictures of her in that position.  
</p>
<p>It is alleged that at Kishon Detention Center 
Ms. Shalabi was detained in a cell measuring 
six square meters that had no windows or 
adequate ventilation and was reportedly in poor 
sanitary condition. It is reported that Ms. 
Shalabi was deprived of sunlight and could not 
establish whether it was day or night in order to 
respect her fast during Ramadan. As a result, 
she decided to fast during the entire eight days, 
refusing meals and drinking only water. When 
Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s interrogation period ended she 
reportedly continued to be detained at Kishon 
Detention Center for nine additional days. On 1 
October 2009, Ms. Shalabi was reportedly 
transferred to HaSharon Prison in Israel.  
</p>
<p>It is further reported that on 29 September 
2009, Israeli Military Commander, Mr. Malka, 
issued a six-month administrative detention 
order against Ms. Shalabi on the basis of 
alleged secret information which claimed that 
Ms. Shalabi was planning to carry out a 
terrorist attack. The detention order was set to 
expire on 28 March 2010 and was approved by 
military judge, Mr. Nun, of the Court of 
Administrative Detainees in Ofer Military Base 
on 5 October 2009. Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s detention 
order and its subsequent two renewals were 
reportedly based on alleged secret information 
claiming that she intended to carry out a 
terrorist attack. It is alleged that Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s 
trial counsel has not been permitted to see any </p>

<p>of the alleged evidence against Ms. Shalabi and 
has had no means of effectively challenging the 
detention after Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s appeal 
against the administrative detention order was 
refused. It is reported that Ms. Shalabi was 
held without charge or trial until 13 March

administrative detention order was issued, 
followed by a third administrative order on 12 
September 2010. This is due to expire on 11 
March 2011.  
</p>
<p>On 1 October 2009, on arrival to HaSharon 
Prison, due to overcrowding, Ms. Shalabi was 
reportedly placed in the same section as female 
Israeli criminal offenders. On 25 October 2009, 
after being held for 25 days among Israeli 
criminal offenders and following Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s 
attorney&#8217;s complaint to the HaSharon Prison 
administration, Ms. Shalabi was reportedly 
transferred to Section 12 of HaSharon Prison 
with other Palestinian female prisoners.  
</p>
<p>Reportedly, Ms. Shalabi continues to be held in 
Section 12 of HaSharon Prison together with 
approximately 18 other Palestinian female 
prisoners. Reportedly, the building of 
HaSharon Prison was known as the 
headquarters of the British Mounted Police 
during the British Mandate in Palestine, and as 
such, was not designed for the imprisonment of 
women. It is reported that due to the harsh 
detention conditions and overcrowding, Ms. 
Shalabi suffers from humidity, lack of natural 
sunlight and adequate ventilation, as well as 
poor hygiene standards.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed at the violent arrest of 
Ms. Shalabi and allegations of sexual 
harassment and ill-treatment towards Ms.

Further concern is expressed that Ms. Shalabi&#8217;s 
imprisonment amounts to arbitrary detention in 
light of the allegation that the investigation did 
not provide any evidence of the alleged 
&#8220;intention&#8221; before the Court. Further concern is 
expressed that Ms. Shalabi has been arbitrarily 
denied her right to a fair trial. Moreover, in

military court judges and prosecutors, concern 
is expressed that Ms. Shalabi has no effective

</p>
<p>Concerning nine cases of death in custody in 
Italy. We list the information received in the 
order of the alleged date of death, starting with 
the most recent case: 
</p>
<p>Mr. S.C., aged 31, was arrested on suspicion of 
drugs possession in a park in Rome at 11.30 
p.m. on 15 October 2009. The carabinieri who 
had arrested him took him to his parents&#8217; 
home, where they searched his room, and then 
to their holding cells. In the morning, the 
carabinieri took him to Rome Tribunal, where 
around noon he was subjected to fast track trial 
(processo per direttissima). Mr.S.C. had a 
weight of only around 40 kilograms and 
declared at the hearing that he was anorexic, 
epileptic and HIV-positive. According to 
members of his family, they noted at the 
hearing that he had a badly swollen face and 
bruises around his eyes. A visit at the tribunal&#8217;s 
medical service and another visit at Regina 
Coeli prison in Rome, where Mr.S.C. was 
taken after the trial, confirmed that he had 
facial injuries and difficulties walking. On the 
same day Mr.S.C. was taken to Fatebenefratelli 
hospital, where he was found to have two 
broken vertebrae. The following day, 17 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 12/05/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. S. C. was arrested on 
October 15, 2009, at 23.30 and brought to the 
Carabinieri post of Roma Appia: after the 
drafting of his arrest proceeding, he was 
brought to the detention cells of the 
Carabinieri post of Roma Tor Sapienza.  
</p>
<p>At 5.10, the Carabinieri staff of the latter post 
called for the intervention of an ambulance, 
reporting that Mr. S. C. had an epileptic fit.  
</p>
<p>In the morning of the 15th  of October 2009, 
Mr. S. C. was transferred by Staff members 
of the Carabinieri to the detention cells for 
arrested persons at the Court of Rome where 
his arrest was validated by the Judge; and the 
relevant order of pre-trial custody in prison 
was issued in accordance with Article 73 of 
the Consolidated Act on Drugs (DPR 
309/90).  
</p>
<p>He was examined by a physician at the 
infirmary of the Court of Rome where 
ecchymosed injuries, pain and injuries in the 
sacral part of the body and at the lower limbs 
were found.

<p>October 2007 (a Saturday), Mr.S.C. was again 
taken from the prison to Fatebenefratelli 
hospital and from there, at around 1.15 p.m. to 
the custodial section of Pertini hospital in 
Rome. His parents were informed of his arrival 
at the hospital only at around 9 p.m. and, 
having immediately driven to the hospital, 
were denied their request to see Mr.S.C. and 
told to return on Monday 19 October morning. 
On 19 October morning, Mr.S.C.&#8217;s parents 
were denied the visit on the ground that the 
required permit from the prison authorities had 
not been received yet. The following day, they 
were told that a permit from the competent 
judge was required to visit their son or speak to 
the doctors treating him. The next day, 
Wednesday 21 October 2009, Mr.S.C.&#8217;s father 
had obtained the judicial permit to visit his son, 
but lacked the required endorsement from the 
prison authorities. On 22 October at 6.20 a.m. 
Mr.S.C. died in hospital. The medical 
certificate speaks of a &#8220;presumed natural 
death&#8221;, but the public prosecution service has 
opened an investigation. 
</p>
<p>On 11 September 2008, a detainee of Velletri 
prison aged 41 (his name has not been reported 
to us) died at Velletri hospital. The man, who 
was taken to the hospital from the prison, had 
allegedly been beaten by police officers after 
having been arrested on suspicion of having 
stolen a bicycle. The autopsy report noted 
internal bleeding due to severe damage to the 
spleen and two broken ribs. The man 
reportedly accused the police of his state 
shortly before dying. 
</p>
<p>On 5 February 2008, a detainee in the prison of 
Imperia (his name has not been reported to us), 
aged 29, died in his cell. A natural cause of 
death has been excluded and the public 
prosecution has opened an investigation, but no 
</p>
<p>entry into the prison of Rome Regina Coeli, 
the physician certified the presence of 
ecchymosis, tumefaction of the face, pains 
while walking, pains to lower limbs, nausea 
and asthenia. Thus it was requested an urgent 
examination at the Hospital for the necessary 
diagnostic checks, as per Art. 17 of the Italian 
Penitentiary Act.  
</p>
<p>At the first aid of Fatebenefratelli Hospital in 
Rome, the fracture of two vertebra was found; 
the prisoner refused the hospitalization and 
re-entered prison and was sent to the 
therapeutic diagnostic centre situated inside 
the same prison.  
</p>
<p>On October 17, 2009, he was examined by 
the physicians of the prison and since the 
above-mentioned symptoms persisted, he was 
sent again at the protected ward of 
Fatebenefratelli Hospital and subsequently 
hospitalized at the protected ward of Sandro 
Pertini Hospital in Rome, where he died on 
October 22, 2009.  
</p>
<p>The judicial investigation is ongoing: three 
agents of the Penitentiary Police as well as 
eight medical doctors, who treated him, are 
under investigations.  
</p>
<p>The three members of the Penitentiary Police 
have been assigned to a different duty station, 
pending the relevant penal developments. At 
the issue of the penal investigation, an 
assessment shall be made whether suspending 
them from their duty or not. The Department 
of the Penitentiary Administration carried out 
an administrative investigation for assessing 
possible infringement of law as for the duties 
of the penitentiary Administration as well as 
the possible malfunctions occurred during 
that affairs.

<p>In December 2007, a man was found dead in 
his cell in Lecce prison (his name has not been 
reported to us) three days after having been 
taken into custody there. The office of the 
prosecutor opened a homicide investigation, 
but the results are not known as of today. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Aldo Bianzino died in his cell in Capanne 
prison in Perugia on 14 October 2007. He had 
been arrested at home two days earlier on 
charges of growing marijuana. The autopsy 
report found injury to the liver and internal 
bleeding &#8220;of traumatic origin&#8221;. A prison guard 
is currently on trial in Perugia on charges of 
having failed to alert medical services when 
Mr. Bianzino, in the night before his death, was 
calling for help. A second investigation against 
unknown perpetrators on charges of voluntary 
homicide is ongoing. 
</p>
<p>On 25 September 2005, 18-years-old Federico 
Aldrovandi died in Ferrara after an encounter 
with four police agents, who beat him with 
their batons (breaking two batons), and made 
him lie on the ground with his hands cuffed 
behind his back. The results of the medical 
forensic examination show bruises and 
haematoma all over Mr. Aldrovandi&#8217;s body, 
including a cut to the back of the head, 
squashed testicles, a deep wound to one 
buttock and scratches on the face. In July 2009, 
the Ferrara Tribunal found the four police 
agents guilty of culpable homicide by 
excessive use of force and sentenced them to 
three years and six months imprisonment. The 
police officers were not detained during the 
proceedings and not imprisoned after being 
sentenced. They continue to be on duty (as they 
have been since the death of Mr. Aldrovandi), 
as appeals proceedings in their case are 
ongoing. Police regulations provide that they

<p>2008 at Velletri Prison, it may be referable to 
Mr. S. B., born on August 18, 1965, 
imprisoned at Velletri remand prison and 
deceased on September 9, 2008 at the 
Hospital of that city where he was urgently 
hospitalised that morning.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>He was arrested on September 8, 2008 by the 
staff of Nettuno Police station, and rescued 
from the anger of some passers-by, since 
shortly before he had hit with a stick the 
owner of a shop.  
</p>
<p>The arrest report states that, during the 
accompanying and at the police station 
offices, he kicked out, threw punches, 
damaged the room and attempted self-
injuring gestures so that the request for 
intervention of the first-aid station was 
necessary.  
</p>
<p>He entered prison at 00.35 of September 9, 
2008 upon order of Velletri Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and already had several ecchymoses 
on all his body, inter-costal pains, pains to the 
face and limbs, as it is inferred from medical 
certificates of the examinations carried out 
upon his entry in the prison. At about 12.00 
his urgent hospitalization was ordered at 
Velletri Hospital where he died at about 15.00 
during the carrying out of diagnostic checks.  
</p>
<p>The relevant Penitentiary Authorities are still 
waiting for the results of the checks ordered 
by the Judicial Authorities.

<p>will be suspended from duty only after a 
possible confirmation of their conviction in 
appeals proceedings is upheld in third and final 
instance by the Cassation Court. Due to a 
general clemency measure applicable to their 
case and possibly to the statute of limitations, 
the four convicted police officers are highly 
unlikely to even partially serve the prison 
sentence. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Marcello Lonzi, aged 29, died in Livorno 
prison in July 2003, his face badly bruised and 
his body covered with blood.  While a first 
autopsy attributed his death to a cardiac arrest, 
but a second autopsy excluded natural death 
and highlighted traces of ill-treatment on Mr. 
Lonzi&#8217;s body. Two prison guards and an 
inmate are charged with homicide, but six

</p>
<p>With specific regard to the criminal 
proceeding (No. 4487/09) launched against 
four police officers, the judicial investigation 
is still ongoing.  
</p>
<p>As for the death occurred at Imperia Prison 
on February 5, 2008, it may be the case of 
Mr. A. B., born on November 4, 1979. He 
was found at 9,15 in his bed by his fellow 
inmates who had tried several times to wake 
him.  
</p>
<p>The administrative investigation carried out 
by the Regional Directorate of the 
Penitentiary Administration of Liguria, on 
behalf of the Directorate General for 
Prisoners and Treatment, has not identified 
failures or negligence, worthy of disciplinary 
interventions, as the staff has carried out his 
own work, professionally and diligently, in 
compliance with the general requirements of 
prison security.  
</p>
<p>Against this background, it is necessary to 
stress that the relevant judicial proceeding 
was concluded on March 24, 2010 with the 
conviction of the two fellow inmates of Mr. 
A. B., to additional detention penalties. In 
fact, at the conclusion of the first instance 
trial it was ascertained that his death had been 
caused by cardiac arrest following the use of 
drugs, having been introduced in the cell by 
the above convicted.   
</p>
<p>As for the death occurred at Lecce remand 
Prison in December 2007, it may be the case 
of Mr. V.F. , born on February 23, 1956.  
</p>
<p>He was found, at 11.15 of December 17, 
2007, dead in the bed of his cell by prison 
staff when the ordinary search of the cell was 
being carried out. During the previous check, </p>

alive.  
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the immediate intervention 
of prison medical staff, the resuscitation 
techniques were not successful and the 
Emergency service physician, who had 
intervened in the meanwhile, certified the 
death for heart circulatory collapse. Judicial 
investigations are still ongoing. 
</p>
<p>Mr. A. B., arrived at Perugia Capanne remand 
Prison on October 12, 2007, was found on 
October 14, 2007, in the bed of his cell by 
prison staff during the daily controls provided 
for by the internal regulation.  
</p>
<p>The prisoner was immediately assisted by 
medical prison staff, but the resuscitating 
techniques carried out did not give any results 
and the physician of the emergency service 
certified the death thereof.  
</p>
<p>The legal physicians who intervened, did not 
notice signs of external traumatisation, 
ascribing the death to acute cardiac 
insufficiency of such a nature to be 
determined.   
</p>
<p>For this case, there is an ongoing criminal 
proceeding against an &#8220;assistant&#8221; of the 
Penitentiary Police &#8211; for the crimes provided 
for by Article 593 (failure to rescue) and 328 
(nonfeasance) of the Italian penal Code &#8211; for 
having omitted to call a medical intervention, 
as the prisoner was asking for it.  
</p>
<p>Such assistant has been committed for trial, 
and the relevant hearing should take place on 
June 28, 2010, while waiting the outcome of

of manslaughter for excess performance of 
duty (Arts. 51, 55, 589 of the penal code) - 
have been condemned, at the first instance 
trial, on July 2009, to a 42-months detention 
penalty. All four convicted have lodged

intervened, found injuries on his face and

by the Regional Directorate of the

Prisoners and Treatment, has not recognized

responsibilities of prison staff or medical staff 
who rendered the necessary assistance. Such 
investigation did not reveal elements 
referable to a death for violent causes. Also 
the examination on Mr. M.L. fellow inmate 
did not give signs of injuries on his body and 
the injuries found by the physician on the face 
of the prisoner were ascribed to his sudden 
fall, fainting against the gate of the cell. The 
same result was given by the legal medical

</p>
<p>Mr. Israel fled the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region of China to Kazakhstan in 
September 2009 after he had provided 
information to Radio Free Asia&#8217;s Uyghur 
Service about the alleged torture to death of a 
Uyghur detainee and the subsequent arrest of 
two individuals whom the Chinese authorities 
accused of providing information on the case to 
the same radio station.  
</p>
<p>After his arrival in Kazakhstan, Mr. Israel 
applied for refugee status from the office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) in Almaty, which he was 
granted in mid-March 2010. Mr. Israel has also 
made an application to the Kazakh authorities 
for asylum, which is still pending.  At the end 
of March 2010, UNHCR had secured a 
resettlement offer for Mr. Israel from Sweden.  
Mr. Israel was scheduled to depart to Sweden

</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Kazakh authorities denied 
Mr. Israel&#8217;s application for an exit visa, 
indicating that his name appeared on Interpol&#8217;s 
terrorism watch list. Prior to that, the Chinese 
authorities had made an extradition request 
based on terrorism allegations against Mr. 
Israel.  
</p>
<p>The authorities agreed that Mr. Israel live in a

and that Mr. Israel be accompanied by 
representatives of UNHCR to interviews that 
have been conducted by the authorities 
repeatedly over the past months and were 
focused on his background and how he crossed 
the border into Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>On 23 June 2010, Mr. Israel was arrested by 
the authorities with a view to his possible 
extradition to China. A court hearing took 
place on 25 June and the court upheld and 
sustained the arrest in relation to the possible 
extradition. Mr. Israel appealed that court 
decision; the appeals proceedings are expected 
for today, 2 July 2010. Information received 
indicates that in case the appellate court 
upholds the lower&#8217;s court decision, the office 
of the Prosecutor-General is likely to request 
more information from the Chinese authorities 
in relation to the extradition request.

<p>Concern is expressed about the possible 
forcible return of Mr. Israel to China where he 
risks to be arrested and tried on terrorism 
charges in relation to the aforementioned

Mukhambetkaliev died in the emergency unit 
of Auliekolskiy regional hospital. It is alleged 
that Mr. Mukhambetkaliev died from injuries 
caused by severe beatings while in detention. 
An employee of the mortuary reportedly 
confirmed that Mr. Mukhambetkaliev&#8217;s body 
bore visible marks of torture and brutal 
beating, and that Mr. Mukhambetkaliev&#8217;s life 
would have been saved had there been timely 
medical aid. It is further reported that the 
medical forensic examination performed on 6 
October 2010, indicated that the body injuries 
and the subsequent death of Mr. 
Mukhambetkaliev were allegedly caused by 
beating with a heavy object.  
</p>
<p>On 6 October 2010, a criminal investigation 
was reportedly launched and on 8 October 
2010, the colony&#8217;s chief of control unit and the

(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 159) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 28/08/09, the Government 
indicated that the inquiry conducted by the 
Office of the Procurator-General of 
Kazakhstan, with the participation in his 
specialist capacity of a forensic medical 
expert, established that, on 13 May 2009 at 
approximately 11 p.m., five convicts from 
unit No. 3 of institution AK 159/7, having 
breached the institution&#8217;s schedule by failing 
to obey the lights out order, inflicted bodily 
injuries on themselves. Mr. O. Kruglikov, Mr. 
M. Ilyasov, Mr. O. Akhmetov and Mr. M. 
Umbetkaliev inflicted non-penetrating knife-
cut wounds to their abdomens without 
damaging internal organs. Convict Mr. D. 
Ershov inflicted a penetrating knife-cut 
wound to his abdomen without damaging 
internal organs. The convicts immediately 
received assistance from the medical section 
of the correctional colony. While receiving 
medical attention, they insulted colony 
officials, refused to comply with lawful 
requests and called on other convicts to refuse 
to comply. Four of the five were conveyed to 
the hospital in Shakhtinsk. After receiving 
qualified medical assistance, they did not 
require hospitalization and were returned to </p>

<p>the colony; none of them was released. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the 5 convicts mentioned, the 
forensic medical expert examined 
approximately 10 more convicts, including 
Mr. A. Galeta, Mr. S. Baiseitov, Mr. G. 
Lendov, Mr. A. Antonov and Mr. M. 
Nurzhanov, none of whom WGEIDlayed any 
kind of bodily injury, as the expert also 
concluded. 
</p>
<p>An inquiry at the hospital in Shakhtinsk 
indicated that, since 13 May 2009, no other 
convicts had been admitted for treatment for 
self-mutilation. 
</p>
<p>The cases of self-mutilation were logged in 
the record book of institution AK 159/7 as 
incident No. 2 of 13 May 2009. All the 
materials required for the taking of a decision 
on proceedings were transmitted by the 
colony&#8217;s administration to the Shakhtinsk 
internal affairs office. 
</p>
<p>On 22 May 2009, the Shakhtinsk internal 
affairs office declined to institute criminal 
proceedings on the grounds of lack of 
evidence that an offence had been committed. 
The lawfulness of the decision was checked 
by the Procurator&#8217;s Office, which agreed with 
it. 
</p>
<p>The special branches of the Karaganda 
Province Department of Internal Affairs 
(including the special-duties militia) were not 
involved in these events. 
</p>
<p>The convicts explained that they had 
mutilated themselves because of the 
restrictions at the colony on meeting relatives 
and receiving parcels, packages and printed 
matter. At the same time, demands were 
made for a reduction in the eligibility periods 
for transfer to an open prison and for parole; </p>

<p>for the consideration of repeat applications 
for parole; and for transfers to other 
correctional institutions. 
</p>
<p>The conditions for the serving of sentences, 
granting of parole and transfer of convicts to 
open prisons are regulated by the Criminal 
Code and Penal Enforcement Code of 
Kazakhstan; the administration of the colony 
thus has no right to change them. 
</p>
<p>The convicts who harmed themselves are 
inhabitants of the towns of Shakhtinsk and 
Abai in Karaganda province; consequently, 
the possibility of transferring them to 
correctional institutions with similar 
incarceration regimes in other regions was not 
considered. 
</p>
<p>During a personal visit by the Procurator, Mr. 
O. Kurymov, Mr. A. Galeta, Mr. M. 
Badygulov, Mr. A. Antonov, Mr. A. 
Mutagarov and other convicts testified when 
questioned that they had not participated in 
the self-mutilation on 13 May 2009. They 
were content with the medical service, food 
and living conditions in the colony. They had 
not made any complaints against the 
administration of the colony. At the same 
time, on 25 May 2009, with the aim of 
stabilizing the situation in the colony, 11 
negatively WGEIDosed convicts were 
transferred to other correctional institutions. 
</p>
<p>The convicts who had harmed themselves 
explained that they did not have any 
complaints against the administration of the 
colony, and that they were content with the 
food, medical service and living conditions. 
They reported that the act of self-mutilation 
was carried out with the aim of forcing the 
administration to transfer them to other 
colonies, and that they had not considered the </p>

<p>consequences. For committing the offences of 
failing to comply with the administration of 
the colony and inciting others to do the same, 
the aforementioned five convicts were placed 
in punishment cells for 15 days, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Penal 
Enforcement Code of Kazakhstan and the 
Correctional Institution Regulations, 
approved by Decree No. 148 of 11 December 
2001 of the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>The lawfulness of the decisions taken in 
respect of those who breached the 
incarceration regime, and of their placement 
in punishment cells, was checked by the 
Procurator, and no basis was found for the 
lodging of protests. The questioning and 
examination of the convicts by the medical 
expert did not corroborate the use of physical 
force, psychological pressure or torture 
against them, nor was any corroboration 
found of any concealment of mutilation in 
relation to 18 other convicts. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, 12 officers of institution 
AK 159/7 were served with a warning by the 
Procurator for failing to adequately explain 
their rights to persons convicted of serious 
and especially serious crimes and serving 
their sentences under a strict regime.

He has been documenting police ill-treatment 
of detainees in the village of Bazar Korgan, 
and in other parts of the Jalal-Abad region of 
Kyrgyzstan for several years.  
</p>
<p>On 15 June 2010, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov was 
detained by representatives of the Bazar 
Korgan District Police Department. According 
to information provided by his first lawyer 
appointed by the police, his detention was not 
officially registered until 16 June 2010, albeit 
he was arrested on 15 June 2010 and such 
registration under the law should have taken 
place within 3 hours following the arrest.  
</p>
<p>From 15 to 20 June 2010, Azimzhan Askarov 
was held incommunicado in a pre-trial 
detention centre in Bazar Korgan. According to 
his brother, who was arrested together with 
him and who was released on 17 June 2010, 
Azimzhan Askarov and he were subjected to 
daily torture during interrogations. Upon his 
release, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s brother 
appealed to human rights defenders with the 
request for urgent intervention, as Mr.

village of Bazar-Korgon, Dzhalal-Abad 
province, on 13 June 2010, the organizers of 
the disorders resorted to particular brutality in 
killing local police inspector M. Sulaimanov; 
seven other officers were wounded to varying 
degrees.

incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred, mass disorders and 
murder of a member of the law enforcement 
agencies and the military.

<p>On 16 June 2010, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov and 
Mr. Shukurzhan Mirzalimov were arrested on 
suspicion of having committed the above-
mentioned crime, and taken into custody at 
the Bazar-Korgon district internal affairs

until 16 August 2010, in order to carry out 
investigation. On 21 June 2010, a complaint 
was lodged with the Djalalabad district court 
appealing the court&#8217;s decision to prolong Mr. 
Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s detention. Human rights 
defenders were allegedly forced to pay a small 
bribe (upload mobile telephone balance) to 
have their appeal registered.

<p>The first meeting of Mr. Azimzhan Askarov 
with an independent lawyer and his colleagues 
took place on 20 June 2010. According to 
them, Mr. Askarov was very bleak, he could 
not sit. Both meetings took place in the 
presence of several police officers. It is 
believed that Mr. Askarov was beaten on his 
kidneys. According to the press release issued 
by the law-enforcement officials, the medical 
examination has not revealed any signs of 
physical mistreatment.  
</p>
<p>It was reported that Mr. Azimzhan Askarov 
was subjected to prolonged daily beatings by 
police officials, in order to force him to 
disclose the location of his film clips and video 
camera. Mr. Azimzhan Askarov has filmed 
violence, and arson attacks in the mainly 
Uzbek-populated district of Bazar-Korgon. Mr. 
Askarov is believed to have filmed rioters 
firing on unarmed civilians, while armed police 
officers present at the scene allegedly did 
nothing to prevent ransoms and even 
participated in them.  
</p>
<p>On 15 June 2010, police conducted its first 
search of Mr. Askarov&#8217;s house.  When they 
demanded to open the gates and his wife 
refused to do so, they fired in the air and broke

<p>The following day, the Bazar-Korgon district 
court ordered their pre-trial detention as a 
preventive measure. 
</p>
<p>The charges against Mr. Askarov and Mr. 
Mirzalimov are supported by the evidence of 
six of the police officers who were victims, 
the official reports of the confrontations 
between the police and Mr. Askarov, 
evidence from witness Mr. Makhmudzhanov 
Mavlyanbek, and the official reports of his 
confrontation with Mr. Askarov.  
</p>
<p>According to evidence from the above-
mentioned police officers, on 13 July 2010, 
Mr. Askarov and Mr. Mirzalimov were in the 
crowd, encouraging people to refuse to obey 
the law enforcement agencies, to take hostage 
the head of the district internal affairs office, 
and to kill the other police officers. 
</p>
<p>On 24 June 2010, Mr. N. Toktakunov, lawyer 
for Mr. Askarov, came to the Dzhalal-Abad 
provincial procurator&#8217;s office to submit a 
complaint concerning the alleged torture of 
his client. According to a forensic medical 
report dated 17 June, Mr. Askarov had 
bruising around his arm and lower back, 
serious enough to be considered an 
impairment to health but not causing any 
short-term health disorder.

<p>The inquiry conducted as a result of the 
complaint found that Mr. Askarov was 
arrested on 16 June 2010 and held in the cell 
where Mr. Makhmudzhanov and Mr. 
Mirzalimov were being detained on suspicion 
of having participated in the mass disorders. 
The same day, on the grounds that Mr.

being set on fire and many people being 
killed, Mr. Makhmudzhanov hit Mr. Askarov

Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s wife managed to flee to a

conducted on 17 June 2010, one during the day 
and another in the evening. Human rights 
defenders arrived at his house at the end of the 
first search. According to the neighbours, Mr. 
Azimzhan Askarov was brought with the 
police officers who carried out the second 
search. On both occasions, Mr. Askarov&#8217;s 
house was ransacked, and all food and his car 
were taken away from the house. According to 
human rights defenders, searches were 
conducted without a witness.

<p>On 17 June 2010, the Ombudsman of 
Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Tursunbek Akun declared at a 
press conference that the detention and charges 
against Mr. Azimhan Askarov were unfounded. 
A similar statement was issued by Kyrgyz 
human rights defenders on 15 June 2010, 
expressing concern concerning the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Askarov and stressing that he 
worked peacefully on monitoring human rights 
violations committed.

<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Azimzhan Askarov may be 
related to his peaceful activities as a human 
rights defender, in particular to monitoring and 
recording the violence and arson attacks related 
to the recent ethnic violence in the Jalal-Abad 
region. In light of the alleged prolonged 
beatings and incommunicado detention, further 
serious concerns are expressed regarding the

claims against him. Moreover, it was noted in 
the complaint that none of the police officers

<p>Concerning the large number of detentions and 
alleged torture and ill-treatment of ethnic 
Uzbeks in Osh and Djalal-Abad Provinces in 
the Kyrgyz Republic. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 02/112010, the Government of 
the Kyrgyz Republic indicated that the facts 
set out concerning the detention of possibly 
more than 1,000 ethnic Uzbeks do not reflect 
reality. As at 11 October 2010, law </p>

<p>Since the violence that erupted in June in the 
south of the Kyrgyz Republic, more than 1,000 
young ethnic Uzbeks have been detained. 
Additionally, more than 600 men aged between 
17 and 30 have been detained in several 
locations, including Kyzyl-Kystak Village and 
other locations in Narima region and in two 
Mahallas in Osh. In Shait-Tepe district, 470 
men were detained. There are reports of 
women and a minor aged 14 also being 
detained. These detentions have taken place in 
the context of daily raids in Uzbek 
neighborhoods, without arrest warrants, and 
usually carried out by military and police 
officers. In some instances, the security forces 
have held the detainees&#8217; families at gunpoint 
and threatened to shoot them if they protested 
the detention. Most families are not informed 
of where their relatives are taken upon arrest, 
leaving them without news of their 
whereabouts for hours or even days. 
</p>
<p>Once detained, the victims are taken either to 
police stations or to detention centres, 
including the Osh City Police Department, Osh 
Province Police Department, local police 
precincts and the National Security Service, 
where they are reportedly subjected to torture 
and ill-treatment. This includes removing 
fingernails, inserting sharpened sticks between 
the nails and the flesh, asphyxiation, burning 
with cigarette stubs, continuous beatings with 
rubber batons or rifle butts until the detainees 
sing the Kyrgyz hymn and speak Kyrgyz with 
no accent, punching and kicking. The purpose 
of the torture and ill-treatment has been to 
obtain confessions and names of persons who 
may be in possession of arms. On 11 July, one 
man died following his release, reportedly as a 
result of the ill-treatment received during his 
detention. The families of the detainees are 
often asked to pay substantial amounts of 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies in the city of Osh and 
in Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces had arrested 
and brought criminal charges against 287 
people for murder, rape and participation in 
mass disturbances. The courts ordered 258 
people to be detained on remand; non-
custodial preventive measures were ordered 
in respect of 29 people. 
</p>
<p>Following investigations, 111 criminal cases 
against 239 people were sent for trial. 
Investigations in the remaining cases are still 
ongoing. 
</p>
<p>Nor is there any foundation to the 
Rapporteurs&#8217; conclusions that the law 
enforcement agencies have been intimidating 
lawyers defending the interests of detainees, 
as evidenced by the fact that no complaints 
from lawyers have been registered with the 
law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the competent national 
authorities have been taking all necessary 
measures to guarantee respect for and 
observance of detainees&#8217; rights and freedoms. 
The Kyrgyz Republic is unfailingly 
committed to the provisions of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel 
Forms of Treatment. 
</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the disturbances 
that occurred in June in southern provinces of 
the country, appropriate coordination between 
the prosecution services, internal affairs 
agencies, national security services and local 
authorities was ensured. The public was kept 
informed about the steps being taken by the 
authorities to stabilize the situation across the 
country.

<p>money for their relatives&#8217; release. 
</p>
<p>Information was also received concerning men 
in military uniforms who are increasingly 
present in public health institutions, including 
hospitals, hampering access to medical 
attention for the victims due to fear of reprisals. 
In addition, some doctors are reportedly 
refusing to issue medical certificates for those 
people who have been subjected to torture or 
ill-treatment, or death certificates for those who 
died during or after the violence. Medical 
examinations of detainees who allege they 
have been tortured or ill-treated are also 
routinely refused. 
</p>
<p>Very few complaints of torture and ill-
treatment have been received by the 
authorities, as the victims and their families are 
afraid of reprisals. The response by the 
authorities has been that they cannot take 
action unless a complaint is filed. 
</p>
<p>For those in detention, access to a lawyer of 
their choice and the right to consult with a 
lawyer in private are always denied. Many 
lawyers have also been threatened, insulted and 
prevented from meeting with their clients. 
There are also reports of lawyers and family 
members being beaten by ethnic Kyrgyz upon 
arrival at police stations or other detention 
facilities, while the authorities simply watched. 
On 11 July, the head of police promised to 
provide armed escorts to one family visiting 
the pre-trial detention facility. 
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed regarding the physical 
and psychological integrity of the hundreds of 
ethnic Uzbeks allegedly detained following the 
violence that erupted in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>the teams set up to investigate the results of 
the mass disturbances, which led to deaths, 
destruction of property and other particularly 
serious offences in the city of Osh and in 
Osh, Jalal-Abad and Batken provinces, an 
interdepartmental command was established 
on 16 June 2010 in accordance with a joint 
instruction by the heads of the law 
enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>With the aim of preventing violations of civil 
rights during special operations, 
investigations and inquiries, the heads of the 
law enforcement agencies and security forces 
issued a second joint interdepartmental 
instruction on 7 July 2010, intended to 
strengthen the authorities&#8217; role in ensuring 
lawful behaviour, professional and military 
discipline, and moral and ethical standards, 
among individual members of the law 
enforcement agencies and security services 
on the ground. 
</p>
<p>Instructions were given concerning the need 
to ensure strict respect for the law and prevent 
unlawful actions by officials of the law 
enforcement agencies of Kyrgyzstan. On the 
ground, checks are constantly being carried 
out to ensure that individuals held on 
suspicion of having committed criminal 
offences are detained lawfully. Anyone 
detained, arrested or remanded in custody has 
access to qualified legal defence, in 
accordance with current criminal procedure 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>If unlawful acts that infringe civil rights and 
freedoms come to light, the liability of 
officials is investigated as a matter of course, 
regardless of their position, and criminal 
prosecutions are brought where necessary.

<p>organizations, together with the Office of the 
Ombudsman, have met and talked to 
individuals affected. Concerning the 
existence of torture and ill-treatment of 
defendants held in places of detention in the 
south of the country, the Office of the 
Ombudsman has been working closely with 
national human rights bodies to deal with all 
matters raised. A working group was formed 
from among Office officials and immediately 
visited the south of the country to hold 
meetings with defendants. Analysis of their 
meetings revealed that not all defendants 
wished to cooperate with the group&#8217;s 
inquiries and that not all defendants were 
guilty as charged. Officials of the Office 
carried out their own investigations and 
follow-up, the results of which indicated that 
law enforcement agencies had acted lawfully 
in restoring order and pursuing their 
investigations. In respect of these events, 
various press conferences, meetings with 
national leaders and discussions with national 
human rights organizations have been held to 
address the issues raised. 
</p>
<p>Public consultation is ongoing, while work 
with national investigative bodies is 
continuing to identify violations of 
individuals&#8217; rights and freedoms. Officials of 
the Office of the Ombudsman attend legal 
hearings on various human rights issues on a 
permanent basis. They give advice and 
monitor the situation of victims and those 
affected.

<p>Concerning Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov, an 
ethnic Uzbek journalist in detention in southern 
Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov was detained on 14 
June on charges of &#8220;inciting ethnic hatred&#8221; 
under Article 299 of the Kyrgyzstani Criminal 
Code and transferred to a police detention 
centre in the town of Jalal-Abad two days later. 
Mr. Abdusalamov had a cerebral hemorrhage 
in 2009, suffers from high blood pressure, 
stomach ailments and a heart condition. On 29 
June, he was transferred to a regional hospital 
after his lawyer filed six requests, but was later 
returned to police detention in Jalal-Abad. On 
24 July, he was once again taken to the hospital 
upon his lawyer&#8217;s request, after his health 
continued to suffer. He was subsequently taken 
back to police detention, despite the fact that 
his condition is said to be very poor.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed for the physical and 
physiological integrity of Mr. Ulugbek 
Abdusalamov, due to the lack of adequate 
medical attention. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 02/11/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Abdusalamov was 
apprehended in Nooken district as he 
attempted to cross the border of Kyrgyzstan 
into Uzbekistan on 14 June 2010. He was 
charged with incitement to ethnic hatred 
under article 299 of the Kyrgyz Criminal 
Code. The court ordered Mr. Abdusalamov&#8217;s 
remand in custody on 16 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdusalamov is the editor of the 
provincial newspaper Diydor (Meeting). He 
has also held the post of vice-president of the 
Jalal-Abad Province Uzbek Ethnic Cultural 
Centre for some time. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdusalamov took advantage of his 
professional position and systematically 
published in Diydor articles voicing separatist 
views aimed at inciting ethnic hatred and 
advocating the supremacy of the Uzbek 
people over other peoples in Kyrgyzstan, in 
violation of article 23 of the Mass Media Act. 
</p>
<p>The detainee undertook various activities 
between 2000 and June 2010, together with 
Mr. K. Batyrov, President of the Uzbek 
Ethnic Cultural Centre, Mr. O. Karamatov, 
Chancellor of the People&#8217;s Friendship 
University, and others, to advance the Uzbek 
diaspora&#8217;s position. The activities included 
demands to make Uzbek an official language, 
to open more institutions of secondary and 
higher education with instruction in Uzbek 
and to guarantee that 30 per cent of State and 
local Government and law enforcement posts 
were held by ethnic Uzbeks. </p>

<p>Mr. Abdusalamov ignored the law in force in 
Kyrgyzstan and purposely organized 
meetings of ethnic Uzbeks between April and 
May 2010 at A. Batyrov University, a private 
university in Jalal-Abad, and in places with a 
high concentration of ethnic Uzbeks in Jalal-
Abad and Osh provinces. Mr. Abdusalamov 
made explicit public calls for a violent seizure 
of high-level positions in State and law 
enforcement bodies and for the 
destabilization of their activities in the guise 
of criticizing the work of the country&#8217;s law 
enforcement bodies. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdusalamov, together with Mr. Batyrov 
and others, emphasized in their statements 
that there had not yet been a political 
assessment of the ethnic conflict that occurred 
in Osh province in 1990, which the ethnic 
Uzbek people had been awaiting for 20 years. 
He therefore called on ethnic Uzbeks to take 
decisive unlawful action. 
</p>
<p>The statements by Mr. Abdusalamov and 
other persons were repeatedly broadcast on 
the television channels Osh TV and Mezon 
TV, in violation of article 23 of the Mass 
Media Act. These statements provoked a 
public outcry from the people in the southern 
regions and subsequently caused the Kyrgyz 
population to conduct grass-roots meetings in 
Jalal-Abad. 
</p>
<p>The procurator&#8217;s office in Jalal-Abad stated 
that the accusations against Ulugbek 
Abdusalamov had emerged during the 
investigation of a violent incident that 
occurred at Batyrov University in Jalal-Abad 
on 19 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdusalamov was charged on 10 August 
2010 with offences under article 221,

<p>Mr. Azimzhan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek, was 
detained by the police on 15 June, suspected of 
being involved in the death of a police officer 
during the recent violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>On 26 July, the Jalal-Abad city court upheld 
the decision of the prosecutor&#8217;s office not to 
investigate allegations that Mr. Askarov had 
been tortured following his detention. The 
authorities have argued that the large bruises 
on Mr. Askarov&#8217;s body were produced by his 
cellmate. In addition, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office indicated that Mr. Askarov had 
confirmed that he had not been ill-treated. Mr.

Korgon, Dzhalal-Abad province, on 13 June* 
2010, the organizers of the disorders resorted 
to particular brutality in killing local police 
inspector M. Sulaimanov; seven other 
officers were wounded to varying degrees.

and 299 (inciting ethnic, racial, religious or

The following day, the Bazar-Korgon district 
court ordered their pre-trial detention as a 
preventive measure. 
</p>
<p>The charges against Mr. Askarov and Mr. 
Mirzalimov are supported by the evidence of 
six of the police officers who were victims, 
the official reports of the confrontations 
between the police and Mr. Askarov, 
evidence from witness Mr. Makhmudzhanov 
Mavlyanbek, and the official reports of his 
confrontation with Mr. Askarov.  
</p>
<p>According to evidence from the above-
mentioned police officers, on 13 July 2010, 
Mr. Askarov and Mr. Mirzalimov were in the 
crowd, encouraging people to refuse to obey 
the law enforcement agencies, to take hostage 
the head of the district internal affairs office, 
and to kill the other police officers.

for Mr. Askarov, came to the Dzhalal-Abad 
provincial procurator&#8217;s office to submit a

the complaint that none of the police officers 
had beaten him, and he refused to undergo a 
forensic medical examination.

<p>Mr. Azimzhan Askarov is currently appealing a

allegedly characterised by severe procedural

Mr. Askarov and the other defendants, all 
ethnic Uzbeks, were found guilty of murdering 
a Kyrgyz policeman during ethnic clashes in 
Bazar-Korgon in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>The trial was allegedly characterized by 
worrying irregularities with regard to fair trial 
procedure. At the opening of the trial hearing 
on 2 September 2010, family members of the 
deceased policemen reportedly verbally abused 
Mr. Askarov and threatened &#8220;to kill all the 
defendants and their children wherever they 
are&#8221;. During the hearing, relatives of the victim 
reportedly prevented Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives 
from entering the court room. It is also reported

defendants&#8217; lawyers were also attacked by 
relatives of the deceased police officer and 
injured police officers, who reportedly hit them 
with sticks, and threw a glass at them, which 
smashed against the bars of the cage holding

hitting one of the lawyers. It is reported that

restore order. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyers were 
allegedly denied the opportunity to question 
witnesses or submit petitions during the 
hearing. When the lawyers expressed concern 
that they would not be able to defend their 
clients under these conditions, the judge 
threatened to have their licenses to practice 
revoked. 
</p>
<p>Before the trial hearing on 6 September 2010 
began, family members of the deceased 
policeman and injured police officers posted 
flyers on the walls of the court building 
containing offensive language against Mr. 
Askarov and co-defendants and calls for the 
application of death penalty. The hearing itself 
was characterized by yet further allegations of 
procedural irregularities. A request by Mr. 
Askarov&#8217;s lawyer, Mr. Nurbek Toktakunov, 
that the hearing be deferred to allow him time 
to prepare an adequate defence was also 
denied; Mr. Toktakunov was also reportedly 
denied permission to meet with his client, and 
informed that he could only meet Mr. Askarov 
at the end of the trial process. Members of the 
audience, including family members of the 
deceased policeman, attempted to violently 
attack the defendants, and frequently subjected 
both the defendants and Mr. Toktakunov to </p>

<p>verbal abuse; racist remarks; and threats.  It is 
reported that no witnesses for the defence were 
heard during the trial, and that when Mr. 
Toktakunov stated his intention to call a 
witness, he was told by the victim&#8217;s relatives 
that the witness would &#8220;not leave this place 
alive&#8221;. Further, members of the audience also 
reportedly directed questions to the defendants 
without authorisation from the judge, and the 
accused did not receive a full explanation of 
their rights and responsibilities. It is also 
alleged that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives were 
subjected to intimidation and threatened not to 
attend the hearing. 
</p>
<p>Serious concerns have been raised regarding 
the treatment of Mr. Askarov and the other 
defendants while in detention. At the trial 
hearing of 6 September 2010, four of the 
defendants, including Mr. Askarov, allegedly 
bore visible marks indicating that they had 
been subjected to beatings. A petition by Mr. 
Toktakunov that his client be given a thorough 
medical exam was denied. When questioned by 
the judge, Mr. Askarov denied that he was 
subjected to any harm, although concern is 
expressed that this may have been out of fear 
of retribution.  
</p>
<p>On 15 September 2010, Mr. Askarov and all 
seven defendants were found guilty and 
sentenced to life imprisonment. The verdict in 
the trial was subsequently denounced by 
Kyrgyz Ombudsman, Mr. Tursunbek Akun, as 
being politically motivated. Mr. Akun also 
claimed that an alternative investigation into 
the policeman&#8217;s killing held by his office had 
found Mr. Askarov not guilty.  
</p>
<p>On 25 October 2010, Mr. Askarov appeared 
before Tashkumyr city court in order to appeal 
against the sentence. It is reported that upon 
arriving at the court, witnesses for the defence </p>

<p>were prevented from entering the court room 
by a group of individuals. Upon raising the 
issue with the judge, the defence lawyer was 
questioned as to why the defence team had not 
previously applied for protection for their 
witnesses. During the session, several 
defendants reportedly claimed that they had 
been subjected to torture during interrogation; 
however, the court reportedly failed to respond 
to the allegations. The next hearing in the 
appeal is scheduled for 3 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the conviction and 
sentencing of Mr. Azimzhan Askarov may be 
related to his legitimate and peaceful work in 
defence of human rights in Kyrgyzstan. Grave 
concern is also expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Askarov and his 
family, Mr. Toktakunov, and witnesses for the 
defence in this case, in light of the repeated 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment, attacks, 
harassment, and intimidation outlined above. 
Further concern is expressed regarding the 
aforementioned allegations of irregularities 
relating to due process during Mr. Askarov&#8217;s 
trial and appeal.

(A/HRC/4/33/Add.1 para 162) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 13/01/2010 the Government 
indicated that on 1 October 2008, because of 
mass disturbances in the town of Nookat, the 
interdepartmental investigation group (the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office and the Osh province 
Department of Internal Affairs of the State 
Committee for National Security) brought 
case No. 140-08-178 under article 233, 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 (Organization of mass 
disturbances), and article 174, paragraph 2 
(Malicious destruction or damage to

<p>Security led to the arrest and detention of 32 
people who had participated in the mass 
disturbances. On 10 October 2008, as a 
preventive measure, the 32 detainees were 
remanded in custody as suspects by the 
judicial authorities, and held in temporary 
holding facilities of the Osh province State 
Committee for National Security and Internal 
Affairs Office. Proceedings were brought in 
the preliminary inquiry against 9 organizers 
and 23 people who had participated actively 
in the mass disturbances.  
</p>
<p>On 2 November 2008, the interdepartmental 
investigation group brought final charges 
against those who had participated in the 
mass disturbances of having committed 
crimes under article 299, paragraph 2 (1) and 
(3) (Incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred), article 233, paragraphs 
1, 2 and 3 (Mass disturbances), article 174, 
paragraph 2 (Malicious destruction or damage 
to property), article 341, paragraph 2 (Use of 
violence against representatives of the 
authorities), article 259, paragraph 2 
(Organization of an association that infringes 
on the identity and rights of others), article 
259, paragraph 1 (Organization of an 
association that infringes on the identity and 
rights of others), and article 299, paragraph 2 
(3) (Incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred), of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>On 10 November 2008, after confirmation 
from the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the decision 
to prosecute, the case was referred to court 
for trial. On 16 November 2008, the Nookat 
district court sentenced the accused to 
prolonged periods of deprivation of liberty. </p>

<p>On 19 May 2009, under the supervisory 
procedure, the criminal division of the 
Supreme Court amended the judgements of 
the courts of first and second instance, 
excluding the article on malicious destruction 
or damage to property. Thirteen of the 32 
accused were acquitted, for lack of evidence, 
under the article on inducement of a minor to 
commit a crime. 
</p>
<p>The penalties imposed on the minors S. 
Nuraliyev,* who was sentenced to 10 years&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty, and A. Ergashev, who 
was sentenced 9 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, 
were reduced to 5 years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty each. The sentence imposed on V. 
Mashrapov was reduced from 20 to 6 years. 
The sentences of the women convicted, L. 
Saidaripova and Z. Abdikarimova, were 
reduced to seven years&#8217; deprivation of liberty 
each. Information from the Supreme Court on 
the sentences passed in the Nookat case 
</p>
<p>On 27 November 2008, Nookat district court 
sentenced I.U. Zokirov, A.A. Mashrapov, 
R.A. Erdoshov and others for crimes under 
article 156, paragraph 4; article 233, 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3; article 174, paragraph 
2 (2); article 341, paragraph 2; article 259, 
paragraph 2; article 295-1; article 297, 
paragraph 1; and article 299, paragraph 2 (3), 
of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>Using partial cumulative sentencing based on 
article 59 of the Criminal Code, the final 
sentences under the articles mentioned ranged 
between 9 and 20 years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty, to be served in correctional 
institutions. The period of imprisonment is </p>

article 61 of the Criminal Code, the period 
spent in remand is considered as part of the 
period of imprisonment, with one day in 
remand counted as the equivalent of two 
days&#8217; imprisonment. The convicted persons 
and their lawyers appealed against the 
sentences handed down by the court of first 
instance. By a decision of the Osh provincial 
court criminal and administrative offences 
division on 17 January 2009, the above-
mentioned custodial sentence passed by 
Nookat district court on 27 November 2008 
was partially amended in respect of S.M. 
Nuraliyev. The remaining part of the sentence 
was unchanged. By a decision of the Osh 
provincial court criminal and administrative 
offences division of 19 February 2009, the 
above-mentioned custodial sentence passed 
by Nookat district court on 27 November 
2008 in respect of L.I. Isakov and K.I. Isakov 
was unchanged.

<p>The court of supervisory instance considered 
the complaint lodged under the supervisory

</p>
<p>Concerning large numbers of foreign nationals 
on death row, some of whom have reportedly 
suffered torture or other forms of ill-treatment, 
and the alleged failure to meet international 
standards for fair trial.  
</p>
<p>As of May 2009, there are over five hundred 
individuals on death row in Libya, and 
approximately fifty percent of them are foreign 
nationals. Many of them are reportedly from 
sub-Saharan countries such as Chad, Niger, 
Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia. It is alleged that 
Libyan courts impose death sentences in trials 
which do not meet the international standards 
and foreign nationals are particularly 
discriminated against in court proceedings. 
They are reportedly often not provided with 
interpretation or translation assistance during 
legal proceedings when they do not speak or 
understand Arabic. Further, they are allegedly 
not given access to representatives of their own 
consular or diplomatic authorities. In addition, 
it is reported that foreign nationals on death 
row are disadvantaged vis-&#224;-vis Libyan 
nationals, as they generally have limited 
financial resources to seek pardon from the 
next-of-kin of alleged victims through qisas 
(financial compensation for the family of the 
murder victim) and diya (retribution for 
murder). They also do not have family 
members in Libya who can assist them to 
negotiate qisas and diya, and may be less 
familiar with the system.  
</p>
<p>To illustrate these allegations, we would like to 
bring to your attention the following cases of 
two foreign nationals currently in death row 
</p>
<p>A reply was received from the Government

<p>who have reportedly suffered torture and 
whose trials did not meet international 
standards:  
</p>
<p>Ms. Juliana Okoro, a Nigerian national, was 
arrested in 2000 on a murder charge. 
According to reports received, while she was 
held in the Bab Abu Gashir Police Station in 
Tripoli, Ms. Okoro was regularly beaten with 
her hands tied behind her back during eighteen 
days. Allegedly, she did not have access to a 
lawyer until two or three years after the arrest 
and was not provided with an interpreter during 
any of the court hearings. She was sentenced to 
death and her sentence was confirmed on 
appeal by the High Court in 2008. As of May 
2009, Ms. Okoro is on death row.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Haroun Mohamed Saleh Awwali, a 
national of Niger, was arrested on immigration 
charges in 2004 and transferred to Misratah 
Detention Center where a murder took place. 
After the incident, he was transferred to 
another detention centre where he was 
reportedly beaten with an electric cable to force 
him to &#8220;confess&#8221; the commission of the 
murder. He was also allegedly forced to thumb 
print a document that he was not able to read. 
According to the information received, Mr. 
Haroun Mohamed Saleh Awwali was not 
provided with a translator during his trial and 
did not understand the proceedings. He was 
subsequently found guilty of the murder at the 
Misratah Detention Centre and is on death row

<p>while deprived of his liberty. Mr Fathi El-
Jahmi was an activist advocating political 
reform in Libya.  
</p>
<p>Mr El-Jahmi was the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture on 4 February 
2008 and an urgent appeal sent by the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression on 22 April 
</p><p>2004. To date, no reply to either these 
communications has been received. 
</p>
<p>On 21 May 2009, Mr. El-Jahmi reportedly died 
in a hospital in Amman, Jordan. He had 
allegedly been transferred by Libyan security 
agents from the Tripoli Medical Centre some 
weeks earlier for emergency medical care 
while he was allegedly in a comatose or semi-
conscious state and his breathing reliant on a 
ventilator. Following his death, Libyan security 
agents reportedly supervised the repatriation of 
Mr. El-Jahmi&#8217;s body to Benghazi, Libya, 
where he is said to have been buried without an 
autopsy having taken place.  
</p>
<p>Following a visit of a physician of the non-
Governmental organization Physicians for 
Human Rights in March 2008, a report on Mr. 
El-Jahmi in detention concluded, &#8220;[n]ot only 
was he inappropriately confined in hospital for 
many months &#8211; he was also placed in a 
psychiatric facility without cause, and the 
Libyan Government never provided any 
evidence to support such an intervention&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the death of Mr Fathi 
El-Jahmi, while deprived of his liberty, might 
</p>
<p>indicated that the following is our reply to the 
enquiries made regarding the legal situation 
of Fathi el-Jahmi: 
</p>
<p>Question: Are the facts alleged in the above 
summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>Answer: The alleged facts are inaccurate 
inasmuch as the person in question received 
treatment at the Tripoli Medical Centre and 
he was admitted to the hospital at his own 
request. He received excellent care since the 
hospital is one of the best in the Jamahiriya. 
International human rights organizations 
praised the care that he was receiving in the 
hospital because they visited him while he 
was there. A delegation from Human Rights 
Watch was the last to visit him in the hospital 
on 26 April 2009. The organization issued a 
positive assessment of the health services that 
were being provided. 
</p>
<p>Question: Has a complaint been lodged? 
</p>
<p>Answer: The facts are inaccurate and no 
complaint has been lodged. 
</p>
<p>Question: Please provide the details, and 
where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and 
judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have 
been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>Answer: As the alleged facts and the 
accompanying questions are inaccurate, there 
is no reason to carry out any inquiries. 
</p>
<p>Question: In the event that the alleged 
perpetrators are identified, please provide the 
full details of any prosecutions which have 
been undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or 
administrative sanctions been imposed on the </p>

medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p>Answer: The alleged facts are inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>Question: Please share the medical records of 
Mr. El-Jahmi from the Tripoli Medical Centre 
where he was detained as well as the Medical 
Centre in Amman where he received medical 
care. 
</p>
<p>Answer: The medical records are regarded as 
personal data concerning the patient, and the 
law does not permit their disclosure to anyone 
apart from the patient or his family. 
</p>
<p>Question: Please indicate why Mr. El-Jahmi 
was moved to a psychiatric facility. 
</p>
<p>Answer: During the trial of the person in 
question, his lawyer requested that he be 
examined by a psychiatrist to assess his 
mental capacity, and the court ordered an 
examination. After examining him, the doctor 
issued a detailed report and concluded that 
the person concerned was criminally 
responsible for his acts and required long-
term psychiatric treatment and constant 
observation. 
</p>
<p>The court decided, in response to a request by 
his lawyer and the public prosecutor&#8217;s office, 
to have his case reviewed by a panel 
composed of three doctors specializing in 
psychiatry and mental illness. The doctors 
carried out their assignment after swearing an 
oath before the court to perform their duties 
faithfully and in accordance with the law. The 
panel concluded that the person concerned 
was not criminally responsible.  
</p>
<p>On 17 September 2006 the court held that the 
criminal proceedings could not be pursued 
because the accused was not responsible for 
his acts and ordered that he be admitted to Al-
Razi psychiatric hospital to receive the </p>

<p>Concerning Mr. T. C. and Mr. S. M.Mr. T. C. 
and Mr. S. M. were arrested on 29 December 
2009 by the Blantyre Police, following a public 
traditional engagement ceremony in Chirimba 
Township. They are currently in detention at 
Chichiri Prison, pending their trial for gross 
public indecency and unnatural offences. In 
addition, the State Prosecutor has allegedly 
applied for an order to force Mr. C. and Mr. 
M.to undergo anal examinations to prove that 
they had sex with each other.

<p>132. Maldives Follow-
up to 
earlier 
cases. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/4/33/Add.1 para 151 By letter dated 01/09/2010, the Government 
indicated that the incidences such as those 
referred to in the abovementioned 
communication occurred during the previous 
Government&#8217;s administration. At the time, the 
people of Maldives did not enjoy many of the 
rights and freedoms afforded under 
international law, including freedom from 
torture and arbitrary arrest. As such, 
incidences of arbitrary arrest and complaints 
of torture and cruel treatment during arrest 
and detention were frequent. 
</p>
<p>Since the assumption of office by the current 
administration on 11 November 2008, 
following the first ever multi-party elections 
in the country, the Maldives has made 
tremendous progress towards guaranteeing 
human rights for all. The new Constitution of 
the Maldives (August 2008), guarantees a 
wide range of fundamental rights and 
freedoms, including the freedom from 
arbitrary arrest or detention, as well as from 
torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading 
treatment or punishment to all within its </p>

<p>territory. To complement these Constitutional 
guarantees, especially in view of fortifying 
the safeguards against torture, the 
Government has made representations to the 
Parliament, advocating for the express 
prohibition of torture in the Maldives&#8217; Penal 
Code and to make torture a separate offence. 
Pursuing its endeavours, the Government, in 
December 2008, appointed the National 
Human Rights Commission as the National 
Preventive mechanism (NPM) under the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention Against 
Torture. 
</p>
<p>The Government attaches high importance to 
the establishment of a complaints standard 
that would allow people in detention facilities 
to comment or complain without hindrance or 
fear of reprisal. The Prisons Bills currently in 
draft stage takes this into consideration. At 
present, prisoners may send confidential 
letters to the Home Ministry, if they wish to 
make a complaint with regard to prison 
officials or the facilities. Furthermore, for the 
first time in the history of the Maldives, 
policemen were sentenced in January 2008 
after being found guilty of beating and 
torturing a man held in custody two years 
ago. 
</p>
<p>I am further pleased to inform that the 
Maldives was also one of the first countries to 
be visited by the Subcommittee for the 
Prevention of Torture in December 2007. The 
Government is undertaking steps to 
implement the recommendations of the SPT 
and to establish a wide range of checks to 
prevent torture and punish those found guilty. 
These include substantial reform of the 
Maldives Police Service, including the 
establishment of the Police Integrity 
Commission, mandated with, among others, </p>

<p>investigating allegations of torture. Moreover, 
frequent visits by the Human Rights 
Commission of the Maldives, the Maldives 
Police Service&#8217;s Ethical Standards Command, 
the Police Integrity Commission, and the 
Home Ministry&#8217;s Inspector General, to places 
of detention throughout the Maldives are also 
contributing to reducing abuse and 
mistreatment of detainees. Despite these 
steps, enormous resource constraints hinder 
to-date the complete implementation of the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>I assure you that incidences such as those 
referred to in your letter are taken with utmost 
seriousness by the Government which is also 
currently undertaking substantial measures to 
eliminate the deep-rooted culture of torture 
that has prevailed in the law enforcement and 
penitentiary system for several decades. 
Hence, in light of these developments, on 
behalf of the Government, I would like to 
further assure Your Excellency that 
incidences such as those referred to in your 
letter do not occur on a systematic basis and 
where it may occur, the perpetrators will be 
brought to justice. The current administration 
is fully committed to the elimination of the 
culture of torture in detention facilities and 
within the law enforcement system in general 
and to guarantee all the rights and freedoms 
prescribed in the Constitution of the 
Maldives.

<p>speech given on Wednesday 24 February 2010 
at the launch of the National Policing Stategic 
Framework at the Paul Octave Wiehe 
Auditorium (University of Mauritius), Prime 
Minister Navin Ramgoolam allegedly pledged 
to reinstate the death penalty for drug offences, 
including for trafficking Subutex 
(buprenorphine). Subutex is a drug commonly 
used to treat opiate dependence, and is 
acknowledged as an essential medicine by the 
World Health Organization.   
</p>
<p>The Prime Minister allegedly warned people 
who are on prescription Subutex against 
travelling to Mauritius, due to plans to scale up 
enforcement relating to trafficking in the drug.  
In his speech, the Prime Minister allegedly 
stated that: &#8220;We have to be severe. Subutex 
will not be allowed in the country. Even those 
who have to take Subutex under medical 
prescription will not be spared. It is better that 
they do not come to Mauritius on holidays with 
Subutex; they will have to face severe 
penalties&#8230;If you cannot live without Subutex, 
do not come to Mauritius. Go somewhere 
else.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Although buprenorphine is not currently used 
as opioid substitution therapy (&#8216;OST&#8217;) in 
Mauritius &#8211; Methadone being primarily used 
instead &#8211; any proposed restrictions and 
penalties on use and possession of 
buprenorphine in Mauritius would constitute a 
significant infringement of the right to health 
for nationals of Mauritius, as well as visitors to 
the country.  Additionally, the alleged proposal 
concerning imposition of the death penalty 
represents an infringement of other rights, 
including the right to life.  
</p>
<p>I would like to draw your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s attention to its commitment to 
protect the Right to Health as reflected in the </p>

<p>international legal instruments.  The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights provides that 
&#8220;everyone has the right to a standard of living 
adequate for the health and well-being of 
himself and of his family, including food 
(Article 25 (1)).&#8221;  Article 12 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights specifically provides for 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, which your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government acceded to in May 2006.  This 
includes an obligation on part of all States 
parties to ensure that health facilities, goods, 
and services are accessible to everyone, 
especially the most vulnerable or marginalized 
sections of the population, without 
discrimination. General Comment No. 14 of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights elucidates the requirements of 
respecting, protecting and fulfilling the right to 
health, encompassing both freedoms and 
entitlements, which specifically include the 
right to control one's health and body, and 
freedom from non-consensual interference 
(paragraph 8).  
</p>
<p>Additionally, Mauritius is a State Party to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, which prohibits arbitrary deprivation of 
life under Article 6.  The death penalty was 
abolished in Mauritius in 1995.  Article 6(2) of 
the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provides that &#8220;in countries 
which have not abolished the death penalty&#8221;, 
the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only 
for the most serious crimes&#8221;. As the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, arbitrary or 
summary executions observed in a report to the 
Human Rights Council, the conclusion to be 
drawn from a thorough and systematic review 
of the jurisprudence of all of the principal </p>

<p>United Nations bodies charged with 
interpreting the most serious crimes provision, 
is that a death sentence can only be imposed in 
cases where it can be shown that there was an 
intention to kill which resulted in the loss of 
life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Reinstatement of 
the death penalty for any drug-related offences 
is potentially in breach of the ICCPR, as these 
do not meet the threshold for &#8216;most serious 
crimes&#8217; under article 6(2) of the Covenant. 
Furthermore, the reinstatement of the death 
penalty under the given circumstances may 
amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
punishment under article 16 of the Convention 
against Torture (see A/HRC/10/44, paras. 38 to 
40). 
</p>
<p>Criminalization of use of OST in treatment of 
drug dependence has the potential to 
discourage users from accessing OST.  In 
doing so, it indirectly promotes continuance of 
risky behavior around health, and has the 
potential to undermine the effectiveness of 
health interventions and programs, such as 
those designed to prevent HIV/AIDS and 
hepatitis transmission amongst drugs users. As 
drug dependence should be treated like a health 
care condition, the right to non-consensual 
interference and physical integrity also applies 
to any treatment and care for people who use 
drugs. 
</p>
<p>Although there apparently has been no formal 
legislation or bill proposed as yet, if the alleged 
public proposals were to become law, the 
potential for people on legitimately prescribed 
medication being punished severely for their 
health status could be realized. I urge your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that the Right to Health of 
all persons is protected, along with the other 
relevant rights noted.   </p>

<p>R.C.H. El se&#241;or C H fue llamado a la 
Comandancia por el titular de la Secretar&#237;a de 
Seguridad P&#250;blica y posteriormente trasladado 
en una patrulla al Cuartel Militar, sin contar 
con una orden de aprehensi&#243;n. Una vez que 
arrib&#243; al Cuartel, fue esposado con las manos 
por detr&#225;s, amarrado de pies y rodillas con 
cinta adhesiva y vendado de los ojos tambi&#233;n 
con cinta adhesiva. Con el cuerpo casi 
inmovilizado, fue cuestionado sobre personas 
relacionadas con el crimen organizado. Al 
contestar de manera negativa, le fue puesta una 
capa gruesa de pl&#225;stico sobre su rostro en 
varias ocasiones durante tres horas.  
</p>
<p>Al siguiente d&#237;a, nuevamente fue sujeto a 
amenazas y torturas. El 18 de septiembre, le

favor por tortura e incomunicaci&#243;n. El 18 de

septiembre, cuando fue visitado por su esposa. 
Antes de ser puesto en libertad, fue amenazado 
de no hablar con los medios de comunicaci&#243;n.

H presentaron una queja ante la Procuradur&#237;a 
de Derechos Humanos de Baja California.

C.H. en el cuartel, pero no le realiz&#243; ning&#250;n 
examen m&#233;dico para confirmar la presunta 
tortura. Asimismo, se negaron a recibir la queja 
bajo el argumento de que no presentaba huellas 
de tortura El 21 de octubre, el se&#241;or 
C.H.intent&#243; presentar una denuncia en la 
Procuradur&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica, la cual

visit&#243; al se&#241;or C. H. para presionarlo sobre las 
declaraciones que habr&#237;a hecho. </p>

<p>Varios de los detenidos fueron presuntamente 
sometidos a torturas y otros malos tratos 
durante su detenci&#243;n. Los detenidos 
permanecieron con los ojos vendados y las 
manos atadas durante varios d&#237;as, fueron 
golpeados y sometidos a descargas el&#233;ctricas, 
ahogamientos con agua y asfixia con bolsas de

privados de agua y alimentos y, en ocasiones lo

les amenaz&#243; con matar a sus familiares con el 
fin de que firmaran confesiones en las cuales se 
compromet&#237;an a no informar sobre los malos

diferentes partes del cuerpo. Sin embargo, a 
pesar de contar con el certificado de las 
lesiones y la declaraci&#243;n de los detenidos, el

Esa misma fecha, los procesados fueron

(CERESO Tab), quedando sujetos al proceso 
penal 93/2010, proceso que actualmente se 
encuentra en etapa de instrucci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Contrariamente a los hechos denunciados 
ante los mecanismos internacionales, las 
personas aludidas nunca estuvieron en 
situaci&#243;n de arraigo. 
</p>
<p>El arraigo 
</p>
<p>Con la reforma constitucional al sistema de 
seguridad p&#250;blica y justicia penal de junio de 
2008, el arraigo se constituye como una 
medida cautelar que cumple con los 
est&#225;ndares establecidos en el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, 
as&#237; como con los principios para la protecci&#243;n 
de todas las personas sometidas a cualquier 
forma de detenci&#243;n o prisi&#243;n. El arraigo es 
dictado por una autoridad judicial 
especializada (jueces de control), con las 
condiciones y modalidades que la ley se&#241;ala. 
Dicha autoridad judicial es designada con 
base en los preceptos de transparencia e 
imparcialidad necesarios para garantizar el 
efectivo funcionamiento del sistema de 
justicia. 
</p>
<p>Las personas bajo arraigo gozan de los 
derechos del debido proceso, al igual que 
quienes est&#225;n sujetos a cualquier otra forma 
de detenci&#243;n. En la aplicaci&#243;n del arraigo, se 
proh&#237;be toda incomunicaci&#243;n, intimidaci&#243;n o 
tortura; debe informarse de los hechos que se 
atribuyen y los derechos que asisten; y debe 
garantizarse pleno acceso a un abogado a fin 
de asegurar una defensa adecuada, entre otras 
garant&#237;as que establece el art&#237;culo 20 </p>

El juicio de amparo procede en contra de la

garantizar la protecci&#243;n de estos derechos. 
Adem&#225;s, las personas bajo arraigo gozan de

<p>El Estado cuenta con un mecanismo que

habr&#237;an sido sometidos a torturas y tratos 
crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, los cuales 
consistieron, entre otros, en colocarles bolsas 
de pl&#225;stico en la cabeza; aplicaci&#243;n de 
descargas el&#233;ctricas en los genitales y distintas 
partes de cuerpo; en obligarles a beber agua

mediante la aplicaci&#243;n de presi&#243;n en el vientre 
par&#225;ndose encima de ellos; soportaron golpes y 
patadas en distintas partes del cuerpo; y

los seis agentes para que se declararan 
culpables del delito de asociaci&#243;n delictuosa.

Estado de Tabasco que tomara medidas 
urgentes para preservar la integridad f&#237;sica de 
los seis agentes, especialmente del Sr. Juan

Esa misma fecha, los procesados fueron

Readaptaci&#243;n Social del estado de Tabasco 
(CERESO Tab), quedando sujetos al proceso 
penal 93/2010, proceso que actualmente se

</p>
<p>Contrariamente a los hechos denunciados 
ante los mecanismos internacionales, las 
personas aludidas nunca estuvieron en 
situaci&#243;n de arraigo. 
</p>
<p>El arraigo 
</p>
<p>Con la reforma constitucional al sistema de 
seguridad p&#250;blica y justicia penal de junio de 
2008, el arraigo se constituye como una 
medida cautelar que cumple con los 
est&#225;ndares establecidos en el Pacto 
Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, 
as&#237; como con los principios para la protecci&#243;n 
de todas las personas sometidas a cualquier 
forma de detenci&#243;n o prisi&#243;n. El arraigo es 
dictado por una autoridad judicial 
especializada (jueces de control), con las 
condiciones y modalidades que la ley se&#241;ala. 
Dicha autoridad judicial es designada con 
base en los preceptos de transparencia e 
imparcialidad necesarios para garantizar el 
efectivo funcionamiento del sistema de 
justicia. 
</p>
<p>Las personas bajo arraigo gozan de los 
derechos del debido proceso, al igual que 
quienes est&#225;n sujetos a cualquier otra forma 
de detenci&#243;n. En la aplicaci&#243;n del arraigo, se 
proh&#237;be toda incomunicaci&#243;n, intimidaci&#243;n o 
tortura; debe informarse de los hechos que se 
atribuyen y los derechos que asisten; y debe 
garantizarse pleno acceso a un abogado a fin </p>

drink filthy drain water. The officers also 
urinated in his cell. U Nandawuntha, a monk, 
as well as Dr. Wint Thu were forced to stand

interrogated. Ko Myo Han was forced to stand 
for four days. U Nandawuntha was also forced 
to kneel on sharp gravel while an officer 
jumped on his calves and beaten on the head 
with a wooden rod. Four other officers 
reportedly dripped candle wax onto W.H.&#8217;s

to metal bars and beat him with bamboo rods. 
A stinging substance was also applied to his 
wounds. Ko Zaw Zaw was reportedly injected

to long jail terms. Their convictions were 
reportedly based on the confessions obtained 
under torture. Even though the Evidence Act 
prohibits the use of confessions obtained

Khin Nu has not received any other treatment 
nor has she been examined further. She has not 
been given permission to get treatment outside 
of the prison. Aside from this illness, she is 
also reported to be suffering from a range of

<p>Information received suggests that Ma Khin 
Khin Nu was sentenced to 17 years 
imprisonment in 2005 for supposedly giving 
false information about her ethnicity in order to 
get citizenship in Myanmar along with other 
members of her family. Ma Khin Khin Nu and 
her family members including father U Kyaw 
Min were all born in Myanmar and have been 
lifelong residents. In 2005, after Kyaw Min 
joined other elected members of parliament to 
call for the legislature to be allowed to sit, and 
after meeting with representatives of the 
International Labour Organisation visiting 
Yangon, it is believed that officials accused 
Kyaw Min and his family of lying about their 
ethnicity and falsely obtaining citizenship, 
accusing them of being Bengali rather than 
nationals of Myanmar. Five members of Ma 
Khin Khin Nu&#8217;s family were charged under 
section 18 of the 1982 Citizenship Act that, &quot;A 
citizen who has acquired citizenship by making 
a false representation or by concealment shall 
have his citizenship revoked, and shall also be 
liable to imprisonment for a term of ten years 
and to a fine of kyats fifty thousand&quot; and under 
the 1950 Emergency Regulations. Kyaw Min 
did not have a lawyer in court and explained 
that his family is Rohingya but because this is 
not an officially recognized ethnic group they 
had complied with designations of ethnicity 
determined by officials at the time. However, 
the court rejected this argument and found 
them guilty of lying about their identity. A

Loikaw Prison to Taunggyi prison to provide 
proper medical care, therefore, it is not

reference letter which describes that the 
authorities have denied access to him.

<p>On 9 April 2010, Mya Aye reached taunggyi 
prison. Since his arrival he received proper 
medical treatments rendered by a medical

superintendent from Shwenyaung Hospital 
and Dr. Hla Thein, Specialist from Taunggyi 
Sao San Htun Hospital as well as Deputy 
Head of Shan State&#8217;s Medical Department.

concerned have not received any complaints

<p>lawyer lodged appeals for Kyaw Min and his 
family at the Yangon Divisional Court and 
Supreme Court on a range of grounds pointing 
to the factual and procedural flaws in the 
original case; however, the courts successively 
dismissed the appeals without considering the 
substance of the appeals at all and merely 
restating what had already been decided in the 
lower-level court.

<p>We have also received information that Ko 
Mya Aye, who is currently detained at Taungyi 
Prison in Shan State and is one of the leaders 
of 88 Generation Students Group, is being 
denied access to proper medical treatment that 
he urgently needs for a heart condition. Ko 
Mya Aye appears to be suffering from angina 
which has recently become unstable causing 
heart failure and requiring urgent medical 
treatment. He is also said to be suffering from 
hypertension and gastric problems. The 
medical tests he requires apparently can only 
be done in Yangon.  On 9 April 2010, he was 
moved from Loikaw Prison in Karenni State to 
Taungyi Prison in Shan State. Both prisons are 
far from emergency medical care he would 
need if he has another heart attack, as well as 
for his family to make regular visits.  
Furthermore, the conditions under which Ko 
Mya Aye is being held, in a cell intended for 
death row prisoners without a toilet or running 
water, and where he is denied any exercise are 
believed to contribute to his ill-health.

<p>In August 2007, Ko Mya Aye was among the 
14 leaders of the 88 Generation Students Group 
arrested, reportedly without warrants. In 
November 2008, Ko Mya Aye received a

<p>Concerning serious violations of human rights 
committed at the Thai-Myanmar border against 
migrants who were deported to Myanmar from 
Thailand. 
</p>
<p>An increasing number of migrants from 
Myanmar living in Thailand are being deported 
to Myanmar, which receives four hundred 
deportees per month at the Ranong-Kawthaung 
checkpoint. Informal checkpoints have also 
been developed at various points along the 
Moei River.  
</p>
<p>It is alleged that the authorities present at the 
checkpoints are requesting money ranging 
from 1&#8217;000 baht to 1&#8217;600 baht (approximately 
$30 to $50) from the migrant workers in 
exchange for their release. Reports indicate that 
those who cannot pay the fees are sent to 
border camps where they are subject to 
beatings and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment, which may amount to torture, or 
forced labor. In February 2010, a 17-year-old 
Burmese worker was reportedly tortured and 
executed by the authorities at the checkpoint 
known as &#8220;Zero Gate&#8221; at the south of the 
Thailand-Burma Friendship Bridge. The boy 
reportedly attempted to escape after being told 
he would be sent to a forced labour camp if he 
did not pay fees to secure his release.  
</p>
<p>There are also reports that girls are being sold 
to brothels or to brokers while boys are being 
conscripted, if they are unable to pay the fees 
to secure their own release. As an illustration, 
in December 2009, a 17-year-old girl was 
reportedly sold to a broker who paid 1&#8217;800 
baht ($60) to secure her release from the 
checkpoint and took her back to Mae Sot. The 
broker then sold her for 2&#8217;000 baht ($67) to a 
man who raped her twice and pressured her to 
marry his friend.

<p>Concerning Nyi Nyi Tun. 
On 14 October 2009, Mr. Nyi Nyi Tun was 
arrested by the police and interrogated at 
Yangon divisional police office for six days. 
During this time, Mr. Nyi Nyi Tun was 
subjected to brutal beatings by 16 officers, in 
teams of two, in an attempt to obtain a 
confession. He was beaten with a baton and 
kicked with boots on his face and head while 
his hands were tied behind his back. He was 
also forced to kneel on gravel, his head and 
fingers were stepped on, and he was sexually 
abused with a baton. During these six days, he 
was also denied any food.  After the 
interrogation period, Mr. Nyi Nyi Tun was 
transferred to the Aungthabyay Interrogation 
Center of the Special Police Information Force, 
where he was examined by a doctor. As a 
result of the torture and ill-treatment, Mr. Nyi 
Nyi Tun now suffers from poor eyesight and 
has wounds in his knees and anus. Mr. Nyi Nyi 
Tun remains in detention.

<p>established as follows in the report of a 
Nepalese Army (NA) Court of Inquiry Board: 
</p>
<p>On the morning of 17 February 2004 a &#8220;12-
person covert team&#8221; of the NA, led by (then 
Captain) Major Niranjan Basnet, went to the 
home of Ms. Devi Sunuwar, who they 
suspected of being a Maoist cadre, in 
Kharelthok Village Development Committee, 
Kavre district. Not having found Devi 
Sunuwar, they arrested her daughter Maina, 
aged 15, and took her to the Shri Birendra 
Peace Operations Training Centre in 
Panchakhal.  
</p>
<p>As further established in detail in the report of 
the Court of Inquiry Board, at the Birendra 
Peace Operations Training Centre Maina 
Sunuwar was subjected to torture in order to 
extract information on Maoist activities. She 
was submerged in a large pot of water six or 
seven times, each time for about a minute 
(para. 11 of the Court of Inquiry Board report). 
Subsequently, she was given electrical shocks 
to her wet feet and wrists. This was done by 
two soldiers on the orders of a Colonel and 2 
Captains in the presence of a Major (paras 10 
and 13 of the Court of Inquiry Board report). 
When the soldier who was materially 
&#8220;administering electrical current&#8221; to Maina 
Sunuwar refused to continue because she 
started bleeding from her wrists, the two 
Captains ordered a non-commissioned officer 
to continue (para. 15 of the Court of Inquiry 
Board report).   
</p>
<p>After an hour and a half, the torture was 
stopped. Maina Sunuwar was blindfolded and 
her hands tied. When she started vomiting and 
foaming at the mouth, the sentries informed the 
Major, who in turn informed the Colonel. A 
medical orderly was called, but when he </p>

<p>arrived Maina Sunuwar was already dead  
</p>
<p>Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s body was then taken to a 
location approximately 50 meters from the 
fence of the barracks, where a pit was dug to 
bury her secretly. Before burial her dead body 
was shot in the back and pictures taken of it, in 
order to fabricate evidence of a shooting upon 
flight. The police were called and drafted a 
report of the incident as told by the military 
officers without visiting the place where the 
alleged shooting took place and without 
inspecting Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s body.  
</p>
<p>Thereafter, a Colonel  and two Captains were 
brought to trial before a Court Martial as 
recommended by the Court of Inquiry Board. 
On 8 September 2005 the Court Martial found 
the three officers guilty of negligence, 
concluding that Maina Sunuwar&#8217;s death was 
not the &#8220;result of intentional torture but [that 
she] died unfortunately and accidentally due to 
wrongful techniques used out of carelessness, 
fickleness and irrationality during the 
interrogation and due to her own physical 
weakness.&#8221; The Court Martial sentenced them 
to six months detention, imposed a total fine of 
100,000 rupees on the three officers and 
declared them ineligible for promotion for one 
to two years. The three officers were released 
immediately following the court martial 
decision because of the time spent confined to 
the barracks while awaiting trial.  
</p>
<p>In November 2005, the family of Maina 
Sunuwar filed a First Information Report with 
the police naming a Colonel,  two Captains and 
a Major. The Nepalese Army refused any 
cooperation with the police investigation. 
</p>
<p>The family of Maina Sunuwar also brought a 
writ of mandamus to the Supreme Court, which 
in September 2007 ordered that the case must </p>

<p>be investigated and brought before the Kavre 
District Court. In January 2008, the District 
Court issued arrest warrants for the four 
officers. In September 2009, the District Court 
ordered the Nepalese Army to produce the 
witness statements it gathered during the court-
martial procedure and to suspend the Major, 
and ordered the District Attorney to produce 
the defendants and witnesses. The Nepalese 
Army continued to refuse cooperation. Instead, 
it deployed the Major with the UN 
Peacekeeping Operation in Chad.  
</p>
<p>The Major was, however, repatriated by the 
UN when his involvement in the case was 
revealed. Upon his arrival in Tribhuwan 
Airport on 12 December 2009, he was taken 
under control of the Nepalese Army and 
accompanied to barracks instead of being 
handed over to the police or judicial 
authorities. On 13 December 2009, the Nepal 
Police requested the Army to hand him over, 
but he remains in army barracks as of today.  
</p>
<p>The Nepalese Army Court of Inquiry Board, 
which established the facts regarding the 
torture and death of Maina Sunuwar as 
described above, the Supreme Court decision 
of September 2007, and the arrest warrants 
issued by the Kavre District Court are 
important steps by Nepalese authorities to live 
up to these obligations under international 
human rights law. We urge your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to ensure that the Nepalese Army 
hands the Major over to the civilian authorities 
and that the Colonel and the two Captains are 
arrested, and that they are brought to trial on 
charges of torture resulting in the killing of 
Maina Sunuwar.

called him and asked him to take the 
documents to Galfutar. Once at Galfutar, Mr. 
Rai was arrested by five police officers dressed 
in civilian clothes. They put into a dark blue 
van and took him to his residence, which was 
searched while Mr. Rai was punched. He was 
then taken to the Hanumandhoka Police 
Station, where the officers accused him of 
robbery. He was taken to the Metropolitan 
Police Crime Division, where he was forced to 
take off his slippers. The officers beat him on 
the soles of his feet with a 2.5 foot long metal 
ruler, for approximately ten minutes. They 
questioned him about the documents he had 
been carrying, and continued to beat him when 
he did not give the response the officers 
wanted. After being interrogated, he was 
beaten for two more hours. His hands were 
then handcuffed behind his back, and he was 
once again beaten on the soles of his feet with 
bamboo sticks. He was also beaten on his legs, 
knees, and other parts of the body. 
Furthermore, he was hanged by one leg, while 
officers beat him with sticks and slapped his 
cheeks. As a result of the ill-treatment, Mr. Rai 
signed a confession.

<p>On 3 February, the District Court in 
Kathmandu ordered the Metropolitan Police 
Range, Hanumandhoka to provide medical

When he denied his involvement, he was 
beaten with a bamboo stick on the soles of his

<p>153.  08/09/10 AL TOR Concerning Ms. Mahima Kusule, aged 26. On 
13 July 2010, Ms. Mahima Kusule was asked 
to go to the Satdobato Police Station to identify 
a man who was reportedly responsible for a 
burglary. Although she did not recognize either 
of the men presented to her, she was pressured 
by the officers to identify them. Ms. Kusule 
was released on the condition that she report to 
the police the next day. On 14 July, she 
reported to the police station and was arrested 
on suspicion of the theft. She was then taken to 
the litigation room, where four police officers 
tied her hands, inserted a bamboo stick 
between her knees and hands and propped her 
legs up. She was beaten on the soles of her feet 
with a plastic pipe with a rod inserted in it for 
about 20 minutes by Head Constable Ms. 
Nirmala Pokhrel. Ms. Kusule was also beaten 
on her hands, thighs and chin with the pipe and 
slapped on the face. The officers threatened to 
subject Ms. Kusule to electric shocks and 
forced her to jump on the spot for 
approximately 15 minutes. She was then 
locked in a detention cell for the night. She was 
released the following day but told to report 
routinely to the District Police Officer. As a 
result of the ill-treatment, Ms. Kusule suffered 
from pain in her cheeks and hands, her left chin 
was deeply bruised and the soles of her feet 
were bloody. She also suffered from severe 
headaches, nausea and dizziness. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 01/12/2010, the Government 
of Nepal indicated that the allegations 
represented in the summary contained in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication are 
baseless and far from being accurate. 
</p>
<p>The complainant, Ms. Mahima Kusule, was 
accused of stealing Rs. 60,000 (sixty 
thousand NPR) by Ms. Goma Kusule, a 
resident of Bhimesor Municipality Ward #6 
of Dolakha District form the latter&#8217;s home. 
</p>
<p>Upon the registration of the complaint of theft 
against Ms. Mahima Kusule on July 13, 2010, 
she was summoned to the Police Office for 
due inquiry and investigation, during which 
she testified that she was not involved in the 
said incident of theft. Because no substantial 
evidence was found against Ms. Kusule, two 
hours after being summoned, under condition 
that se would again summon if needed. No 
further legal action has been taken against 
her. 
</p>
<p>It has been reported by various people of her 
neighbourhood that Ms. Kusule has been 
involved in several incidences of theft. No 
action, however, has been taken against her in 
the absence of concrete evidence. It is not 
difficult to assume that her allegation of being 
tortured and manhandled by police personnel 
is a tactics to hinder further investigations 
against her. The allegation that se was 
tortured in detention is thus completely 
baseless, fabricated and hypothetical.

<p>Indicated that with regard to the urgent appeal 
from the Special Rapporteur on the 
Promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, Special Rapporteur on Torture and 
other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment 
or punishment and Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, relating to the incident 
involving Ms. K.D.S. et al, the concerned 
authorities of the Government of Nepal have 
the following submission. 
</p>
<p>The facts and circumstances of the incident 
are as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. On April 9, 2009 approximately 8 to 10 
women including Ms. K.D.S. visited the Area 
Police Office, Chimdi, Sunsari district and 
verbally reported the incident of battery of 
Kara Devi. Sub-Inspector Rajesh Chaudhary 
requested them for a written complaint of the 
incident Without presenting written 
complaint, the group of the women left the 
Area Police Office in anger. 
</p>
<p>2. In the afternoon of April 10, 2009, 
approximately 100-150 women from 
WOREC Federation Nepal approached the 
Area Police office chanting various slogans 
and subsequently in utter demonstration of 
violence locked the office of Sub-Inspector 
Rajesh Chaudhary. They behaved disorderly 
and rude casting WGEIDleasure and anger 
and ragged the properties of the office. The 
police remained calm and asked for orderly 
demonstration and to present their demand or 
complaint in writing so that it could take its 
course. 
</p>
<p>3. On April 11, 2009 at about 14.00 hrs 
approximately 400-500 women chanting </p>

<p>slogans attempted to forcibly enter the police 
station en mass. The mood of the mass 
appeared disorderly and violent. Around 
16.00 hrs the women protesters set on fire a 
power trailer and vandalized a private van 
with registration no. Ko.-1-Cha 3871 in 
which journalists and human rights activists 
were travelling. Amid such situation, the 
police was forced to WGEIDerse the crowd 
with utmost restraint using light baton charge. 
As a result, in their attempt to run in the midst 
of the crowd minor injuries incurred onto ms. 
Thakani Devi Mahato, Ms. S.K., Ms. Sunita 
Shah and Ms. L. Ch. who were immediately 
taken to the hospital for treatment and were 
later discharged from the hospital, after minor 
primary treatment. Except this light use of 
force by the police to WGEIDerse the crowd 
in order to preventing the mob from incurring 
destruction to the public and private 
properties and harming the people around, 
they were neither beaten  by the police not 
were the subject to ill treatment. In all series 
of the agitations, they were treated with 
respect and honor and were not subject to any 
kind of misbehave as concocted in paragraphs 
of the communication. 
</p>
<p>4. Quickly responding to a complaint from a 
group of journalists and human rights 
activists against the officer-in-charge of the 
police station, Sub-Inspector Rajesh 
Chaudhary, the District Police Office in 
Sunsari on April 12, 2009 formed an inquiry 
committee in the command of Inspector Devi 
Prasad Baral to probe into the incident as 
demanded by the complainants. The inquiry 
committee in its report found out that the 
group of journalists and human rights 
activists were beaten and ill-treated by the 
agitating mob of the women staging 
demonstration in front of the Chamdi Police </p>

<p>Station and their vehicle was vandalized. No 
evidence was found to support the complaints 
against the Sub-Inspector Rajesh Chaudhary 
and other police personnel. 
</p>
<p>5. Besides the findings of the inquiry, a large 
number of ordinary people witnessing the 
incident at the area police office and its 
vicinity that day submitted a mass appeal to 
the Home Minister as well as other relevant 
Police offices in the district explaining what 
they saw during the incident. This 
spontaneous appeal of the ordinary people in 
the locality signed by 108 people, that 
included people from all spectrums of the 
society, local leaders of all political parties, 
office bearers of NGOs and INGOs and local 
civil society representatives present on the 
day, who were the witness of the situation, 
explained the real scene of the incident and 
called for not to fabricate and mislead the 
circumstance otherwise. 
</p>
<p>6. In the submission the candidly explained 
that the police had to use slight batons for 
self-defense and for the protection of the Area 
Police Station as well as for the protection of 
the property set ablaze by the violently 
agitating protestors. They have also outlined 
how the protesters, including the those 
claiming to be the members of WOREC and 
INSEC of Sunsari district and other women 
participating in the agitation, intentionally 
and wantonly started to violently destroy the 
Area Police Office and the property in the 
area. In their written submission the above 
mentioned representatives of the society have 
also demanded to punish those involved in 
the violent demonstration in the name of 
human rights defenders. The signed 
submission was sent to all relevant 
Government offices, police offices and </p>

organizations based in Nepal. 
</p>
<p>7. Therefore, in the light of the above, the 
Government of Nepal would like to transmit 
the followings: 
</p>
<p>1. The facts alleged in the communication are 
conveniently fabricated and remain utterly 
misled. 
</p>
<p>2. On the basis of the complaint lodged by the 
alleged victims, the authorities quickly 
responded by constituting a probe committee 
as explained in paragraph 4 above. 
</p>
<p>3. The result of the inquiry was as explained 
in above paragraph 4. 
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Government of Nepal 
takes this opportunity to reiterate its 
unflinching commitment to the norms and 
principles of human rights enshrined in the 
Interim constitution and prevalent law of the 
land. As a State party to the ICCPR and 
almost all of the core human rights 
instruments, protection and promotion of 
human rights remains at the highest priority 
of the Government of Nepal. The 
Government is aware of its human rights 
obligations as stipulated in the Constitution 
and the prevalent laws of the country as well 
as in the human rights instruments that it is a 
State party to, including the universal 
declaration of the human rights, as recalled in 
the communication. 
</p>
<p>The law enforcement authorities have been 
exercising utmost restraints while carrying 
out their bounden duty of maintaining law 
and order, ensuring access to justice, 
protecting lives, liberties and properties of 
individuals, safeguarding public institutions 
and properties, upholding laws and </p>

</p>
<p>Concerning the statement made by the 
Governor of south-eastern state of Abia that 
death row inmates should be executed to ease 
prison congestion. We are informed that the 
statement was uttered at a meeting of thirty-six 
State governors held on 20 April 2010.  
According to information received, there are 
currently about 870 inmates on death row, 
including women and juveniles.  
</p>
<p>In this connection, we would like to draw your 
Government attention to two main substantive 
areas of concern relating to the above 
mentioned statement, which in our view, needs 
to be addressed urgently.  
</p>
<p>First, there have been concerns raised that the 
Nigerian criminal justice system does not 
guarantee fair trial, as reflected by the national 
study group on the death penalty in 2004 and 
by the presidential commission on the reform 
of the administration of justice in 2007.  
Furthermore, we were informed that most 
people have been sentenced to death following 
trials which did not conform to international 
fair trial standards.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions raised concern 
in his mission report to Nigeria with regard to 
widespread procedural irregularities in death 
penalty cases and conditions on death row. He

<p>indicated that torture is consistently used by the 
Nigeria police to extract confessions and that 
these confessions have often been critical to the 
conviction of persons charged with capital 
offences. Moreover many defendants in capital 
trials have effectively had no legal 
representation and legal aid is not available for 
appeals. (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, Para. 28).  
</p>
<p>Following his visit to the country in 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
echoed these concerns pointing to his finding 
that torture and ill-treatment are widespread in 
police custody, and particularly systemic at 
criminal investigation departments, and that 
torture is frequently used for the purpose of 
obtaining confessions (A/HRC/7/3/Add.4, 
paras. 37 and 40). 
</p>
<p>These concerns, we are informed, continue to 
prevail in the criminal justice system. The 
majority of those on death row have been 
sentenced to death on the basis of confessional 
statements allegedly obtained under torture and 
some had no legal representation during trial or 
the preparation of the defense was often 
inadequate as counsel are not given timely 
access to the prosecution dossier.

<p>Concerning Mr. L.H., born on 1 November 
1980, currently confined at Oslo University 
Hospital, Ullev&#229;l, Psychiatric division, Acute 
unit, Post 5.  
</p>
<p>Since 15 January 2010, Mr. L.H. has been 
involuntarily committed to the psychiatric unit 
of Oslo University Hospital. He was retrieved 
by the police while sleeping in a hotel room, 
without being in any acute danger of his life or 
health.  
</p>
<p>Mr.L.H. has been diagnosed with OCD 
(obsessive compulsive disorder). While he

<p>By a message dated  4/05/2010, the 
Government indicated that  for the Norwegian 
Ministry of Health and Care Services to able 
to consider this urgent appeal we would ask 
you to kindly provide documentation that 
confirms that the plaintive, Mr. L.H. has 
agreed to the case being considered by the 
HRC&#8217;s Special Procedure. We will need to 
receive original documentation to this end. It 
would also be useful to receive guidance as to 
what level of detail the response is expected 
to have, as much of this information will fall </p>

<p>develops a deep anxiety in certain situations, 
he has no history of violent or other disturbing 
behaviour of any kind, and has never been a 
threat or danger to himself or anyone else. He 
can take care of himself, but because of his 
anxiety and psychosocial disability he needs 
some accommodation and care to fulfill some 
basic needs, such as being able to eat and 
drink. Prior to his confinement to the hospital, 
he was eating and drinking on a daily basis and 
was in good physical health and well 
nourished, even though his life situation was 
rather difficult.  
</p>
<p>However, after the confinement, he was 
reportedly denied reasonable accommodation 
to eat and drink at the University Hospital. 
Because of the denial of such accommodation, 
he was this time totally without food and liquid 
for more than nine days, and lost more than 
11.5 kilos in this period.  
</p>
<p>As a consequence, Mr.L.H. has been subject to 
different interventions which the medical 
personal of the hospital reportedly 
administrated due to &#8220;the need for medical 
treatment&#8221; and a &#8220;necessity due to an 
emergency situation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>On 25 January 2010, ten days after his 
confinement, he was given water intravenously 
to prevent total dehydration, a situation that 
could very shortly have led to his death.  
</p>
<p>Since 2 February, Mr.L.H. has been force-fed 
by a tube in his nose. In the days preceding 
this, Mr.L.H. was able to drink nutritional 
drinks (yoghurt, juice, and soup). Mr.L.H. 
wanted to continue drinking on his own, but 
instead he was strapped down and the tube was 
inserted with physical force. His private doctor, 
Dr. Coucheron, stated in a letter to the 
Regional Board of Health Supervision, dated 2 
</p>
<p>under Norwegian confidentiality regulations. 
</p>
<p>Act No. 62 of 2 July 1999 relating to the 
provision and implementation of mental 
health care (the Mental Health Care Act), 
with later amendments, was attached.

tube was carried through with the use of 
restraints and up to 10 health professionals 
holding the patient down while the tube was 
inserted into his stomach&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The hospital staff members have increasingly 
restricted Mr.L.H.&#8217;s communication with the 
outside world. On 1 February 2010, the 
hospital confiscated Mr.L.H.&#8217;s telephone and 
denied him of all contact external to the 
hospital, with the exception of his lawyer. 
Mr.L.H.&#8217;s father is allowed to communicate 
with his son only through the attorney and the 
hospital staff.  
</p>
<p>On 17 January 2010, Mr.L.H.&#8217;s father reported 
the case to the police, alleging illegal 
deprivation of liberty, but the case was 
dismissed by the police authorities.  
</p>
<p>On 16 February 2010, a complaint to the 
Control Commission was filed by both Mr.L.H. 
and his father on the decision on deprivation of 
liberty (compulsory mental health care). On 22 
February 2010, the Commission decided that 
Mr.L.H. will continue to be kept under 
involuntary admission. The decision is now 
being taken to court. The case is pending and 
no date has yet been set for the trial.  
</p>
<p>Mr.L.H. was involuntarily committed to a 
psychiatric hospital for the first time on 2 July 
2009 after he had asked for help and support 
from the health care system.  
</p>
<p>During the first psychiatric confinement, 
Mr.L.H. managed to escape from the hospital 
after seven days. For 16 days he and his father 
were on the run in Sweden, until Mr.L.H. was 
brought back to the hospital by the police 26 
July 2009. He was released from the hospital 
29 July 2009. </p>

provided additional information in reponse to 
questions 1, 2 and 5 in the communication. 
</p>
<p>l. Are the facts alleged in the above summary 
of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p>According to the Norwegian National 
Registry, one single person by the name of 
E.H.A is registered as residing in Norway, in 
the city of Stavanger. She was_born on 20 
February 1989. We believe this must be the 
person concerned, as this according to the 
information received from the United Nations 
would put her at 16 years in May 2005. 
</p>
<p>We wish to point out the importance of 
including the date of birth of parties 
concerned when we are asked to respond to 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>Referring to the alleged facts regarding legal 
aid, in the last paragraph of page 2, it is 
claimed that &quot;due to a lack of sufficient legal 
advice the parents of Ms E.H.A were not 
aware of the possibility to challenge the 
decision of the Control Commission of 26 
September 2008 before a court of law 
pursuant to chapter 7 of the Norwegian 
Mental Health Care Act and chapter 36 of the 
Civil Procedure Act.&quot; 
</p>
<p>This statement neither provides a complete 
nor an accurate view of the case.

impression that Ms E.H.A never received any </p>

<p>form of free legal aid, which is not the case. 
Pursuant to Article 17, section 3, sub&#172;section 
3, cf. article 19, section 1 of the Legal Aid 
Act, Ms E.H.A was granted free legal aid by 
the Control Commission, where she was 
represented by her attorney, Mr Hugo 
Dybwad. 
</p>
<p>Mr Dybwad was compensated for a total of 6, 
5 hours of work on this case, in accordance 
with his claim. Prior to this, Ms E.H.A had 
already been granted 7 hours of free legal aid 
by the Control Commission for work 
performed by her former her attorney. 
However, Ms E.H.A's mother did not show 
up for the Control Commission's meeting, and 
this was subsequently postponed. 
</p>
<p>Second, Ms E.H.A's parents were personally 
informed of the outcome of the Control 
Commission case number 105/08 through two 
equally worded letters dated 26 September 
2008, sent to both parents independently. In 
the third paragraph of this letter, the 
possibility of challenging the decision before 
a court of law, pursuant to the Mental Health 
Care Act article 7-1, is clearly stated in 
straight-forward terms. Hence, no legal 
assistance would be necessary in order to 
become aware of this possibility. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is part of the duties of any 
attorney acting on behalf of a client who is 
granted legal aid to review the outcome of the 
case and communicate it to the client, and 
further to inform the client of any action that 
can be performed to challenge the decision. 
This work is considered an integral part of the 
case, and covered by the original grant of 
legal aid. Consequently, Ms E.H.A's parents 
are supposed to have been made aware of the 
possibility to challenge the decision of the 
Control Commission before the courts by </p>

<p>their attorney. 
</p>
<p>If Ms E.H.A's parents were in fact unaware of 
the possibility of having the decision of the 
Control Commission tried before a court of 
law, this lack of knowledge was not a 
consequence of a lack of free legal aid, as Ms 
E.H.A was indeed granted free legal aid that 
should have covered such legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>2. Please provide the details, and where 
available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other 
inquiries, including relating to the allegation 
of rave, carried out in relation to this case. If 
no inquiries have taken -place, or if they have 
been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p>All complaints made to the police in Norway 
are filed in a central registry for criminal 
cases (STRASAK). Searches made in this 
registry did not produce any information on 
cases with Ms E.H.A registered as a victim of 
any form of sexual crime. Nor have her 
parents filed any such complaint on her 
behalf. 
</p>
<p> Searches made in the local police registry for 
Stavanger revealed information on an 
incident on 23 June 2005, when Ms E.H.A 
was found barefoot and rather exhausted in 
the middle of a road. The police took her to 
an emergency ward and her father was 
notified. 
</p>
<p>As our information indicates that no reports 
on sexual crimes against Ms E.H.A have been 
made to the police, we cannot give any 
further information concerning this part of the 
case. 
</p>
<p>5: Please comment on the official reason 
given to explain why Ms. E.H.A&quot;s application 
for legal aid was rejected. </p>

<p>The objective of the Legal Aid Act is not to 
provide citizens with unlimited legal 
assistance, but rather to ensure a provision of 
a minimum of legal assistance in cases where 
such assistance is deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>Free legal aid is secondary to other schemes 
that could cover the applicant's needs, such as 
the duty of public administrative bodies to 
provide citizens with the information and 
guidance, for example in the process of filing 
an application or appeal. In most cases where 
such alternatives schemes exist, additional 
assistance is not regarded a necessity. 
</p>
<p>The application for legal aid filed on 6 
November 2008 did not specify the exact 
nature of the legal advice sought, but it was 
apparent that the objective was to further 
pursue cases relating to the treatment of Ms 
E.H.A before various public administrative 
bodies, amongst them the regional branch of 
the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, 
the Patient Ombudsman and the Control 
Commission. The County Governor of 
Rogaland rejected the application on 11 
December 2008, with reference to the duty of 
public administrative bodies to provide 
information and guidance to the public. 
</p>
<p>The decision of the County Governor to reject 
the application for legal aid was 
subsequently, on 25 December 2008, 
appealed to the Norwegian Civil Affairs 
Authority, which on 5 March 2009 affirmed 
the County Governor's decision to reject the 
application, but stating a different reason for 
the rejection. In the opinion of the Norwegian 
Civil Affairs Authority, the fundamental 
needs of Ms E.H.A had been sufficiently 
covered by having several cases tried before 
administrative public bodies and exhausting 
the rights to administrative appeals, through </p>

<p>the free legal aid already granted by the 
Control Commission, and finally that the 
decision of the Control Commission could be 
challenged before the courts, in which case 
free legal aid would be granted by the court 
itself pursuant to article 16, section 1, sub-
section 2, cf. section article 19, section 1 of 
the Legal Aid Act. 
</p>
<p>As the Control Commission has the power to 
try any decision to compulsory admit a 
patient, and free legal aid will be granted 
unconditionally in such situations, the 
Norwegian Civil Affairs Authority found that 
any additional free legal aid to further pursue 
other cases than those already presented 
before the Control Commission would not be 
of great significance to Ms E.H.A or her 
parents, and that free legal aid provided by 
the public treasury would not be reasonable in 
these cases.&quot;

reportedly requested Rs 10.000 in bribes from 
his family. On 24 November, as a result of the 
refusal by his family to pay the bribe, Mr. 
Francis was charged with harbouring illegal 
arms and stealing a motorbike (FIR 273/2009 
and FIR 1274/2009). He was later presented

<p>torture. He was once again asked to pay a bribe 
and upon refusal to pay, was charged with theft 
(FIR 673/2009). Mr. Francis was then 
transferred to the ACLC at Shrifabad Police 
Station, where he was tortured in front of his 
mother and his mother-in-law. On 26 
November, he was presented before a 
magistrate&#8217;s court and, despite his visible 
injuries, was sent to Karachi central prison 
under judicial remand.

<p>Mr. Francis&#8217; mother tried to visit him in prison 
over the Eid period, but her requests were 
denied when she refused to pay bribes to the 
prison staff. On 7 December, she was able to 
visit him, and found him on a stretcher in an 
outside area, wearing only his underpants and 
hooked to a glucose drip. Mr. Francis was 
taken to the civil hospital in Karachi, where he 
was pronounced dead on 10 December. The 
post mortem indicated five counts of severe 
injury to his head and upper body. The cause of 
death was a hematoma on the left side of his 
head.

<p>On 26 February, the police raided the house of 
Mr. Muddasar Iqbal, in relation to a case of 
theft. Because he was not at home, his elder 
brother was arrested and taken to the police 
station. When Mr. Iqbal&#8217;s mother went to the 
police station to inquire about her son, she was 
told that he would be released if Mr. Muddasar 
Iqbal turned himself in. Mr. Iqbal went to the 
police chowki (kiosk), a sub-police station of 
Satellite Station. As soon as he arrived, he was 
beaten in front of his mother, who was ordered 
to leave the premises. 
</p>
<p>The following day, when Mr. Iqbal&#8217;s mother 
went back to the chowki, she found her son 
tied to a wooden cart and being beaten on his 
legs and the soles of his feet. A constable 
indicated that he would be released if she paid 
50,000 Rs., and when she stated that she did 
not have the money, the officers stabbed Mr. 
Iqbal&#8217;s feet with screwdrivers. The next day, 
Mr. Iqbal&#8217;s mother gathered approximately 
half of the money, but he was not released. On 
1 March, Mr. Iqbal was presented before a 
judge, and despite the fact that he could not 
walk, the judge did not ask about his treatment 
at the police station and ordered his detention 
on remand at Sargodha District Prison. In the 
meantime, Mr. Iqbal&#8217;s mother was continually 
harassed by officers from the Satellite Police 
Station, who threatened to detain her other son 
if she did not pay the rest of the money. 
</p>
<p>An assistant Sub-Inspector from Jhal Jhakian 
Police Station, believed to be close to the 
officer who had detained Mr. Iqbal filed an 
application before the court, indicating that Mr. 
Iqbal was wanted in another case. As a result, a 
civil judge ordered that he be transferred back 
to police custody. During the hearing, Mr. 
Iqbal was able to inform the judge about the

reports, the Naushahro Feroze police opened a 
criminal case against the two policemen 
accused of the abduction and rape of Mr. J. It is 
reported that without conducting a proper

officer, were allegedly trying to cover up the 
crime perpetrated by the accused policemen.

police station to see him, the police never

<p>According to reports received, on Friday, 5 
November 2010, five detainees were killed and 
seven seriously injured when Correctional 
Service warders shot at escaping detainees 
during a jail break from Baisu Jail, Mt. Hagen, 
Western Highlands Province, Papua New 
Guinea. Those killed and injured were 
reportedly part of a group of at least 55 
detainees who tried to escape. Sources said 13 
detainees had been recaptured while 37 
escaped successfully. According to information 
received the reason for the jail break was due 
to concerns by detainees with regards to their 
health following an outbreak of dysentery and 
suspected cholera in the jail and the deaths of a 
number of detainees. Four detainees reportedly 
died in the past few weeks and others were 
seriously ill. The health authorities are said to 
have inspected the jail and declared the facility 
unsafe for human habitation. Correctional 
Services were reportedly not taking the 
situation seriously enough despite the requests 
from the detainees. On 6 November, 50 
detainees from Baisu were reportedly 
transferred to Barawagi Jail in Chimbu 
Province and there are plans to transfer the 
remaining 183 detainees to other jails in the 
Highlands.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 22 
September 2008, Mr. Lawrence Karai was 
arrested at Port Moresby betting shop, 
Cameron road, Gordons, Bougainville at the 
request of Joel Warrah and Leon who own the 
shop. The owners had accused Mr. Karai, 
himself a worker at the betting shop, of stealing 
90,000 Kina from the shop. During the arrest, 
he was reportedly punched in the face and 
kicked by several police officers who accused 
him of lying about his whereabouts when the 
alleged theft occurred. On the way to the 
Boroko police station, he was blindfolded and </p>

several injuries to the hand, knees, and legs 
which made it difficult for him to move his 
hands and to walk for several weeks. He also 
suffered several facial abrasions and cuts to his 
body. Mr. Karai lodged complaints with two 
lawyers and appeared before the committal 
court in Waigani. On 10 October 2008, he was 
interviewed by police led by Mr. Susuve Epe 
(CID officer). It is alleged that he was punched 
and hit with a metal object during the 
interviewing. He was detained until June 2009, 
and his case was dismissed by the court for 
lack of evidence in September 2009. Mr. Karai 
now suffers from acute bodily pains and is 
disabled in the left hand.

a convoy on its way to register a candidacy for 
next year&#8217;s gubernatorial elections in 
Maguindanao province. Since the 
communication sent on the 30 November 2009, 
new information concerning that case has come 
to light which reveals specific and targeted 
sexual violence against the women victims.

Buluan town in Maguindanao province, was 
travelling on the road to Shariff Aguak, one of 
the main towns of Maguindanao, on the way to 
an electoral office to register him as a

tested positive for traces of semen, indicative 
of sexual abuse.  
</p>
<p>(ii) Some of the victims were shot in the genital 
area, and in the face rendering them 
unrecognizable.&#8220;  (page 6)  
</p>
<p>The body of Ms. M, in particular revealed 
evidence of very brutal sexual mutilation. Two 
of the women killed were pregnant, and some 
of the victims were hogtied.

<p>While some of the bodies were left on the 
ground and in the vehicles, while the majority 
were found in 3 different mass graves on a

<p>Edwin Dematera, Ms. Sherilyn Riocasa, Mr. 
Gerry Sustinto, Mr. Jenmark Barrientos, Mr. 
Mark Escartin. These 42 people are health 
workers and members of the Community for 
Health Development (COMMED) and the 
Council for Health and Development (CHD). 
Both organizations are providing community-
based healthcare in the Philippines.  
</p>
<p>On 6 February 2010, about 300 armed soldiers 
and policemen allegedly entered the farmhouse 
of Dr. Melecia Velmonte, in the province of 
Rizal, and arrested the above mentioned health 
workers who were attending a training seminar 
sponsored by the Community Medicine 
Foundation. The health workers were allegedly 
searched, handcuffed, photographed and 
interrogated.  The Police Superintendent 
reportedly showed an incomplete search 
warrant after handcuffing the health workers. 
</p>
<p>The 42 health workers were then allegedly 
detained incommunicado for two days in Camp 
Capinpin in Rizal. It is alleged that the 
detainees were handcuffed, blindfolded and 
subjected to torture and other forms of ill-
treatment during interrogation, including 
electrocution and sleep deprivation. Female 
health workers were allegedly sexually 
molested.  It is also alleged that they were 
forced to admit that they were members of the 
New People&#8217;s Army (NPA), the armed wing of 
the Communist Party of the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>On 8 February 2010, Ms. Leila De Lima, the 
Chairperson of the National Human Rights 
Commission was allowed to visit the detainees. 
The relatives of 8 of the detainees were 
allowed to visit them under close supervision 
of soldiers.

</p>
<p>On 11 February 2010, the health workers were 
charged of illegal possession of firearms, 
manufacturing bombs as well as of being part 
of the Communist Party of the Philippines, on 
the basis of explosives and firearms reportedly 
found by the army at Dr. Velmonte&#8217;s house. It 
is alleged that the military, who were carrying 
plastic bags at the time of the arrests, planted 
weapons within Dr. Velmonte&#8217;s farmhouse 
during the house search. The same day, the 
Supreme Court reportedly granted the petition 
for habeas corpus, ordering the military to 
present the 43 detainees at the Court of 
Appeals the following day and to answer 
allegations of torture, evidence-planting and 
illegal arrest and detention.  
</p>
<p>On 12 February 2010, the military and the 
police failed to present the health workers to 
the Court of Appeals. On 15 February 2010, 
the 43 detainees were brought to the Court of 
appeals. During the hearing, the military 
reportedly denied the allegations that the 
female detainees were sexually harassed and 
molested by the soldiers.

<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention of the above mentioned persons 
might be directly related to their work in

them. They were taken to a camp in Palico, 
Bantagas, where they where held for 17 days 
before being turned over to Batangas

at the camp, they were assaulted by military 
officers. They banged Mr. Batrina and Ms. 
Di&#241;o&#8217;s heads on the wall, and Ms. Di&#241;o&#8217;s 
fingers were squeezed together while bullets 
were inserted in between her fingers. The ill-

possession of firearms, explosives and drugs. 
They remain in detention, without access to a

pistol; six (6) live ammunitions for calibre 
9mm; two (2) grenades; one (1) improvised 
Anti-Personnel landmine; and one (1) 
electrical blasting cap. Per verification with 
the Firearms and Explosive Division of Camp 
Crame, Quezon City, said individuals did not 
have proper licenses and therefore were not 
authorized to carry firearms and explosives. 
</p>
<p>On 24 November 2009, the three were 
presented before the Provincial Prosecutor of 
Batangas for Inquest Proceedings. The 
Provincial Prosecutor found that the arrested 
persons violated Presidential Decree No.

Republic Act 9516 (Illegal Possession of 
Firearms and Explosives) docketed under 
NPS Docket No. IV-02-INQ-09K-00459.

<p>The alleged torture was not substantiated in 
the absence of their affidavit that would merit 
a formal complaint. Also based on the 
medical examinations conducted by Dr. Jaime 
L. Butiong of Apacible Memorial Hospital in 
Nasugbu, Batangas, on 10 December 2009, 
there is nothing in the findings that could 
indicate that the three persons were subjected 
to torture. Subjects were committed to the 
Provincial Jail pursuant to the Commitment

<p>According to reports received, Mr. Al-Attiyah 
is being held in solitary confinement since his 
transfer to Qatar.  In April 2010, Mr. Al-
Attiyah was reportedly relocated to the main

(defamation) of the Qatari Penal Code.

the Church of Evangelical Christians of 
Baptists in Tvarditsa village, Taraclia County, 
Republic of Moldova.   
</p>
<p>Mr. Grigori Djoltaili has allegedly been 
intimidated and physically assaulted by 
members of the majority Orthodox community 
in his village of Tvarditsa in Taraclia County. 
Reportedly the head of the local school did not 
allow him to complete his studies because Mr. 
Djoltaili&#8217;s parents are also members of the 
Church of Evangelical Christians of Baptists. 
Mr. Djoltaili ceased studies with an incomplete 
secondary education in 1991. In 1994, 
members of the Orthodox community of St. 
Pareschiva Church in the Tvarditsa village, 
Taraclia County, broke the gates of his house 
and entered his house without his permission 
and tried to kill his mother and father. His 
father was 60 years old at the time and his 
mother was 58. During the same events, the 
members of the Orthodox community also tried 
to assault him, but failed. In 1994, Mr. Djoltaili 
submitted a complaint concerning these events 
to the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Chadirlunga, but 
no action followed. Since then, Mr. Djoltaili 
has reportedly lived in extreme poverty, 
suffering also from malnutrition, among other 
things because of the marginal position to 
which he has been forced as a result of his 
minority religious affiliation. 
</p>
<p>On 12 July 2010, between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 
p.m., Mr. Djoltaili was approached in the 
Tvarditsa village by a person named &#8220;Alexei&#8221;

Orthodox St. Pareschiva Church. This person 
used threatening words and degrading terms

</p>
<p>Two days later, at a local Internet caf&#233;, the 
person named &#8220;Alexei&#8221; reportedly told other 
individuals that he and the police officer were 
planning to beat Mr. Djoltaili. On 15 July 
2010, when Mr. Djoltaili left an Internet caf&#233;, 
some persons followed him and used insulting 
phrases about his faith in Jesus Christ and his 
affiliation with the Baptist Church. They 
threatened that they would beat him intensely 
and would throw him into the local canal. 
Persons involved in this incident included the 
police officer Mr. Fyodor Maev.  
</p>
<p>Approximately one hour later on 15 July 2010, 
Mr. Ivan Arihov allegedly struck Mr. Djoltaili 
physically. This assault was stopped as a result 
of the intervention of a third party. On the 
same night, while Mr. Djoltaili was going 
home, a car stopped nearby. Several people got 
out of the car and ordered him to approach. Mr. 
Djoltaili refused and began to flee down an 
illuminated path. 
</p>
<p>On 20 July 2010, Mr. Djoltaili submitted a 
complaint to the prosecutor in Taraclia town. 
Following this complaint, the threats and 
attacks against him increased. Several days 
after submitting this complaint, and apparently 
as a result of the complaint, Mr. Ivan Arihov 
threatened to kill him. In addition, the local 
police officer required Mr. Djoltaili to attend 
the police station and put pressure on him to 
write another communication to the prosecutor, 
in which he would withdraw his complaint. Mr. 
Djoltaili is regularly called from unknown 
telephone numbers with similar pressure and 
threats to withdraw his complaint. A neighbor 
also informed Mr. Djoltaili that unknown 
persons came looking for him while he was not </p>

<p>178.  22/09/10 UA TOR Concerning the ill-treatment of Mr. Jereghi 
Simion and other detainees at Cahul 
Penitentiary No. 5.  
</p>
<p>On 13 May 2010, Mr. Jereghi Simion, a 
detainee at the Cahul Penitentiary No. 5, was 
reportedly subjected to physical ill-treatment 
by the Head of the Duty Unit, Mr. Racovita 
Ion, the Deputy of the Duty Unit, Mr. Urmanji 
Ghenadie, and the Officer on Duty, Mr. 
Rogoza Ion, causing him 13 bodily injuries, 
mainly on the kidneys, back and face.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Simion tried to file a claim against the 
officials of the penitentiary No. 5, which was 
reportedly refused by the Military Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, alleging that there was no evidence of 
any ill-treatment. It was reported however, that 
Mr. Jereghi Simion had a medical certificate 
proving the injuries. The Court of Cahul also 
issued a decision requesting the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office to initiate a criminal investigation, 
which was refused by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Simion was subjected to continuous 
psychological pressure and threats by the 
Penitentiary staff, and was beaten for filing a 
complaint. He was also held in solitary 
confinement for a long period of time. In 
addition, the poor quality and small quantity of 
the food received has deteriorated his health.  
</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 26 August and 3 September 
2010, five other detainees, including Mr. 
Musteata Veaceaslav, Mr. Moroianu Roman, 
Mr. Ignat Viorel and Mr. Bujor Gheorghe were 
reportedly ill-treated during their month-long 
detention in the Penitentiary No. 5.

<p>Romica Baba, aged 21, Mr. P. C. aged 18, Mr. 
R.M., aged 17, Mr. Cosmin Olteanu, aged 29, 
Mr. Vasile Vasile, aged 19, Mr. Ionut-Viorel 
Bulanas, aged 19.  
</p>
<p>On the evening of 18 February 2008, Mr. 
Olteanu was reportedly subjected to physical 
violence at the Panciu City Police Station, Iasi 
County, by Chief Agent Grosu Vasile and 
Superintendent Belibou Constantin of the 
Panciu City police service. The victim was 
repeatedly hit over the head and body, 
including ribs, liver, kidneys and the neck. He 
was threatened with heavy penalties and prison 
if he did not confess to theft. As a result of the 
beatings, he suffered liver and kidney injuries 
as well as neck pains, headaches and a bleeding 
lip. Over the four nights that Mr. Olteanu was 
kept in detention, he reportedly experienced 
insomnia, fear, dizziness and headaches. He 
was kept without food and water. At the 
ensuing trial, Mr. Olteanu reported the beatings 
and ill-treatment to the magistrate court, which 
did not take any action. Subsequently, Mr. 
Olteanu&#8217;s complaint against his treatment at 
the hands of the police and prosecutors was 
rejected by the Galati court of appeal on 18 
August 2009. Mr. Olteanu also petitioned a 
higher court to review the case, but this appeal 
was also rejected on 28 June 2010.  
</p>
<p>On 31 December 2009, Mr. Bulanas was 
reportedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment 
at the Tichelesti Penitentiary by Vasilache, an 
officer from the penitentiary intelligence 
services and Danut, a warder. The victim was 
beaten with rubber sticks on his feet and 
threatened with death. Consequently, he 
developed swellings in his legs, sharp pain in 
his ribs, kidneys and feet as well as dizziness 
and numbness in parts of his body. We have 
received three reports of cruel punishment 
</p>
<p>Mr. Olteanu Cosmin was placed under 
criminal investigation for committing, in 
actual concurrence, several crimes of first 
degree theft, robbery, burglary and 
destruction, with several injured parties. On 
February 29, 2008, he was placed in police 
custody for 24 hours and, on March 1, 2008, 
he was placed under preventive arrest for 29 
days.During the criminal investigation, he 
was questioned on the following dates: 
February 6, February 29 and March 1, 2008, 
in the presence of his public defender. 
Therefore, no hearing took place at the date 
mentioned in the letter of the Special 
Rapporteur. The Panciu Court has sentenced 
Mr. Cosmin Olteanu to 10 years term of 
imprisonment, to be served in detention. The 
Vrancea Tribunal allowed the appeal of the 
petitioner but reversed only the decision of 
the lower court with regard to the accessory 
punishment. The other provisions of the 
Panciu Court decision were maintained. This 
ruling became permanent upon being, issued 
by the Galati Court of Appeal which 
dismissed the appeal on points of law as 
unsubstantiated. Throughout the judicial 
proceedings of the first instance court and the 
appellate courts, the indicted person claimed 
he had not committed the crimes he was 
accused of and that his confession was 
obtained by means of violence exerted by the 
police. Both the first instance court and the 
two appellate courts ruled that the 
abovementioned line of defence was 
unsupported, as all hearings during the 
criminal investigation took place in the 
presence of an attorney, which would make 
the resort to violence or to the other means of 
pressures impossible. Mr. Olteanu Cosmin 
has also asked for a revision of the court 
decision, on grounds of a forced confession. </p>

in solitary confinement from his arrest until 19 
February 2010. When the victim complained 
about his treatment, Mr. Vasilache reportedly 
threatened the victim with transfer to a 
maximum security facility; if he did not 
withdraw the complaint he had made against 
him. On 30 July 2010, the Braila Court 
dismissed the complaint before Mr. Bulanas 
could present his arguments and witnesses&#8217; 
testimonies in support of his case. The 
complaint was reportedly dismissed before it 
was presented to the court.

<p>On 14 January 2010, Mr. M., a Roma, was 
allegedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment 
at Buzau Police Station, by several police 
officers, including Valeriu Iamandi, Manole, 
Vergu Daniel and Cucu. The victim was 
allegedly taken to a room where the policemen 
handcuffed him to a radiator. They proceeded 
to beat him with their fists, feet and a piece of 
wood similar to a chair leg. He received kicks 
to the stomach, ribs, head, feet, hands and over 
his face. During the assault, the policemen 
would take a break and verbally abuse him by 
calling him a &#8220;crow&#8221; (pejorative appellation for 
Roma ethnic). The victim alleges that he was 
beaten to induce a confession that he and Mr. 
Vasile had been involved in theft. The beatings 
resulted in bruises, swelling, scratches on his 
face, pain in the neck and ribs, and difficulty to 
breath. 
</p>
<p>On 1 May 2010, on the 1st floor of the Buzau 
Police Station, Mr. Vasile, a Roma, was 
reportedly subjected to torture to obtain a 
confession from him. The victim was 
reportedly put on a chair and hit with fists over 
the entire body while the police yelled at him 
and threatened to kill him. They beat him 
repeatedly for approximately 15 minutes. He

<p>The request for extraordinary review was 
dismissed by the Panciu Court and this ruling 
became permanent upon a criminal decisionof 
the Galati Court of Appeal 
</p>
<p>On May 18, 2009, Mr. Cosmin Olteanu 
lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office for abusive conduct, ilegall  arrest and 
abusive investigation. Mr. Olteanu claims that 
police used physical violence against him in 
order to force him to confess to the crimes he 
was being accused of. At the same time, he 
claimed that agents used physical violence 
against him on February 29 and March 1, 
2008, during his stay at the Detention Centre, 
and that  he was not allow for medical 
examination to ascertain his physical lesions. 
The prosecutor decided not to initiate the 
criminal investigation against the alleged 
perpetrators, as the claims could not be 
substantiated. Mr. Olteanu has challenged this 
decision. The General Prosecutor of the 
Prosecutor Office attached to the Galati Court 
of Appeal has dismissed this complaint as 
groundless. The decision was communicated 
to the petitioner within the prescribed legal 
period. Mr. Olteanu did not challenge the 
prosecutor&#8217;s ordinance in court, in accordance 
with the available means of judicial control 
no sanctions were taken against the police 
employees in question.

<p>Mr. lonut Viorel Bulanasi is detained in the 
Galati Penitentiary, serving a 2 years and 10 
months term of imprisonment for committing 
several first degree theft. The Fetesti Court 
placed Mr. Bulanasi under preventive arrest 
on July 24 2008, which was maintained 
throughout the judicial proceedings. Based on 
the report no. 82 of July 24, 2008, , the 
accused presented only two small lesions at

<p>reportedly suffered headaches, pain in the 
back, neck and kidney. They took him to the 
hallway where another person was being held, 
and handcuffed the two with the same pair of 
handcuffs.  
</p>
<p>On the evening of 25 May 2010, 12 masked 
men entered room 2 of the Tichelesti 
Penitentiary and requested Mr. Baba to pack 
his bags. The victim was then kicked and 
punched in the face and on different parts of 
his body, reportedly in the presence of Mr. 
Neagu, Prison Director. When the victim 
reportedly fainted during the attacks, the 
officers sprinkled him with water to regain 
consciousness and continue to beat him. He 
was also threatened with death by prison 
officials. The victim suffered cracked lips, loss 
of teeth, a broken nose, bleeding nose and 
mouth, bruises on the ribs and face, and 
shortness of breath. Some of the symptoms 
persist to this day. The victim reports that he 
was also accused of beating two detainees; who 
were put in his room following their ill-
treatment at the hands of the prison warders.  
</p>
<p>On 25 May 2010, in section 1 of the Galati 
Penitentiary, Mr. C. was subjected to a 
physical attack which resulted in the victim 
needing medical treatment for a cracked head, 
swollen jaw, bleeding of the lips, loss of teeth 
and the inability to eat. The incident was 
allegedly carried out by the officers and 
supervisors from rooms 2 and 10, namely Mr. 
Neagu, Prison Director; Adi and Chitu, officers 
of the penitentiary intelligence services; 
Cimpeanu, prison supervisor; and Sisu, Gabi 
and Baciu, warders.

<p>transferred from the Detention Centre of 
lalomita County to a Penitentiary on August 
13, 2008 and further moved to the Tichilesti 
Penitentiary for Minors and Young People on 
February 6, 2009. 
</p>
<p>On December 30, 2009, Bulanasi lonut-
Viorel and other prisoners used violence 
against another prisoner. Following the 
aggression, the prisoner was rushed to the 
medical ward of the prison and to the 
Emergency County Hospital in Bralia &#8211; the 
Emergency Unit, with the presumptive 
diagnosis of &#8220;skull, chest and upper lip 
lesions&#8221;.  On December 31, 2009, the 
management of the Penitentiary decided to 
separate the aggressors form the group, so as 
to prevent them from exerting physical or 
psychological pressure on the other persons 
in the room or to influence the investigation. 
In order to determine the administration to 
give up this measure, Stoica Cristian and 
Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel  instigated the other 
inmates not to go to the mess room for dining 
, to barricade in the room, light their cushions 
on fire and break the windows. These actions 
raised high security risks for the detainment 
place.Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel became 
recalcitrant and refused to accept the detailed 
corporal search and the check-up of his 
belongings, activities undertaken while 
getting the prisoners out of the room, in 
compliance with the specific security 
procedures.  However, no force or 
immobilization measures were further used to 
transfer the prisoners out of that room. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel does not 
feature in the records of the medical unit of 
the penitentiary with medical examinations or 
other clinical observations on December 31, 
2009 or during the next days. The chief </p>

<p>prison inspector was present at the level of 
the detainment section on December 31 2009, 
which accounts for the refusal of the three 
prisoners to obey the order of getting out of 
the room and their instigation of others to 
disobedience acts and the disturbance of order 
in the detainment place.  
</p>
<p>Three different reported incidents were 
maded with reference to prisoner Bu&#226;nasi 
lonut-Viorel for each disciplinary 
infringement, as follows:beating an inmate, 
instigation to revolt and disobedience to 
search measures. The applied sanctions were 
challenged b y the inmate before the 
delegated judge, who dismissed the 
complaints and maintained the decisions of 
the Penitentiary administration, noting that 
they were legal and substantiated. 
</p>
<p>Since his incarceration, Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel 
has constantly WGEIDlayed inappropriate 
behavior, receiving 13 sanctions for various 
disciplinary infringements. Since his arrival 
at the Tichilesti Penitentiary for Minors and 
Youngsters, the prisoner Bul&#226;nasi lonut-
Viorel was quartered in rooms adequate to his 
detention regime and age  
</p>
<p>The prisoner Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel was 
quartered alone in the room only in the period 
15 &#8211; 18 January 2010. This was not a 
disciplinary sanction but happened because 
another prisoner, quartered in the same room, 
was transferred to the Slobozia Penitentiary 
for judicial proceedings. There are complaint 
by Mr. Bul&#226;nasi lonut-Viorel against staff 
members of the Penitentiary. The 
administration of the detainment section has 
communicated that none of members of the 
staff was summoned by penal bodies with 
respect to these events, during the reference 
period or after. Furthermore, the above-</p>

<p>mentioned detainee did not put forth any 
judicial actions during December 31, 2009 &#8211; 
July 30, 2010, when he was transferred from 
the unit where the incidents took place. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Romica Baba is serving a 5 years and 8 
months term of imprisonment for committing 
several first degree theft. He was placed 
under 24 hours custody on February 5, 2009 
and under preventive arrest the following day. 
The preventive arrest was maintained 
throughout the judicial proceedings. Based on 
the body search report dated February 5, 
2009, the accused did not present any signs of 
violence at the moment of his arrival to the 
Detention Centre of the Galati Police 
Inspectorate. On February 27, 2009, he was 
transferred to the Tichilesti Penitentiary for 
Minors and Youngsters. 
</p>
<p>Mr. P.C  is detained in the Galati Penitentiary 
to serve a 8 years and 6 months term of 
imprisonment. In response to the petitioner's 
allegation that he was physically assaulted on 
May 25, 2010 during his stay in the Galati 
Penitentiary, it should be mentioned that he 
was transferred to the Galati Penitentiary only 
on July 6, 2010. Moreover, the records of the 
Tichilesti Penitentiary for Minors and Young 
People do not stipulate any negative event 
involving prisoners Baba Romica and C.P.on 
May 25, 2010. It is likely that the petitioner 
refers to another event involving the two 
above-mentioned people, dated April 26th 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>Thus, on April 26, 2010, guardian noticed 
that prisoners EML and NL, confined in room 
no. 2 designated to lodge young detainees in 
closed prison regime, WGEIDlayed signs of 
physical aggression on their faces and arms. 
Preliminary inquiries showed that they were 
physically harmed in the detention room by </p>

<p>several other prisoners, including Baba 
Romica and C.P.. 
</p>
<p>The two victims were taken to the prison 
surgery ward, and  the Braila County Hospital 
for thorough health investigations. While 
taking the victims to the hospital, the Head of 
the Shift Work has informed the management 
of the prison on the event. He ordered the 
aggressors to be moved to another detention 
room up to the end of the investigation. The 
prisoners in question refused to obey the 
command they had received; accordingly, the 
Deputy Director  decided to have them 
immobilized, which requires the use of 
physical force and rubber truncheons. In a 
short while their disobedience came to a halt 
and the prisoners complied to the commands. 
After the incident was solved, the detainees 
were taken to the prison surgery ward. 
</p>
<p>The prisoner C.P.was diagnosed with 
&quot;neurovegetative disorders with psychomotor 
agitation&quot;. The medical examination registry 
states that the prisoner Baba Romica was 
without subjective complaints&quot;. The prisoner 
M-L was diagnosed with: &quot;Violent 
traumatism to both arm and forearm, violent 
traumatism in the right thorax posterior area&quot;. 
For this reason, he was taken to the 
Emergency Unit of the Braila County 
Hospital, 
</p>
<p>The prisoner NL was diagnosed with: 
Multiple blows to the right temporal&quot;. Thus, 
he was also taken to the Emergency Unit of 
the Braila County Hospital. After having the 
aggressors moved to another room, there was 
an order to search room no. 2. Additional 
forbidden objects were discovered on this 
occasion, such as metal bars coming from a 
dissembled chair in the room and some bed 
parts, which had been used to attack the </p>

<p>prisoners EML and NL. As for the detainee's 
statement that &quot;12 masked men got into the 
room&quot;, we must mention that although a 
specialized intervention structure is indeed 
foreseen in the organizational chart of the 
prison, this team was never set up at the level 
of the Tichilesti Penitentiary for Minors and 
Young People. Sixteen prison agents under 
the command of an officer were scheduled in 
the guard and surveillance service on the 
evening of April 26, 2010. Six out of the 
sixteen scheduled agents were in guarding 
positions inside the detention area, two in the 
controlling positions and two in the 
surveillance positions of Interior Wing no. 2, 
namely the prison agro-zoo-technical farm, 
which would make it physically impossible 
for them to be present in Detention Wing no. 
1, where room no. 2 is. According to the 
decision taken by the Deputy Director, there 
were 4 agents under the command of the 
Head of the Shift Work (an officer) 
participating to the moving of the prisoners 
who had physically harmed detainees EML 
and NL.  Thus, after the prisoners were 
summoned to obey the instructions they had 
received, the staff members assigned by the 
Deputy weighed down the prisoners by using 
physical force and rubber truncheons. As 
mentioned above, the investigation reached 
the conclusion that the inmates did not 
require medical care after the immobilization 
process. Since his incarceration, Mr. Baba 
Romica has received 7 disciplinary sanctions 
for different cases of misbehaviour. Mr. Baba 
Romica received no compensations while 
serving his prison sentence. During his stay in

<p>sentence in the Tichilesti Penitentiary for 
Minors and Young People, Mr. Baba Romica 
and C.P. WGEIDlayed aggressive behaviour 
both towards other detainees and staff 
members, which led to a progressive change 
in his detention regime to a more severe one. 
The documentation in his disciplinary file 
proves that he continued to have an 
aggressive behaviour in the Galati 
Penitentiary, where he used violence against 
another room mate by tying his arms with a 
belt and beating him in order to gain material 
advantages. Since his incarceration, Mr. 
C.P.received 23 disciplinary sanctions for 
different cases of misbehaviour. Mr. C.P. 
received no compensations during the period 
of executing his sentence. During his stay in

<p>180.  30/09/10 UA TOR On 2 March 2010, at Paunesti-Focsani Village 
Police Station, Vrancea County, Mr. V. F.D, a 
Roma, was reportedly tortured by the Chief of 
Police Station, Munteanu Ionel, and police 
officer Catalin. He was subjected to electric 
shocks to his chest, hands and feet. As a 
resulted, he suffered from headaches, a swollen 
head and neck, dizziness and blurred vision for 
several weeks. There are also still visible signs 
on parts of his body where the electric shocks 
were administered. The victim alleges that he 
was handcuffed at the entrance of the police 
station, where he was mocked and laughed at 
by passersby. Mr. V claims that he has, on 
several occasions been victim to ill-treatment 
from the same police officers. 
</p>
<p>On 20 August 2010, a complaint was made to 
State prosecutor of Focsani; the victim alleges 
that the prosecutor told him the case was

<p>By letter dated 13/11/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. V.F.D, was placed under 
criminal investigation for having committed, 
several first degree theft and violation of 
domicile, in Vrancea county, between 14 
September 2009 and 8 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>Given that the accused, Mr. V., was trying to 
elude the investigations, the prosecutor issued 
a warrant in order to bring him before the 
Prosecutor's Office. On the evening of 26 
February 2010, he was arrested by two police 
officers. Taking into account the late hours, 
the accused was accompanied to his 
residence, before being summoned for 
hearings on 1 March 2010. The accused was 
taken for hearings to the Prosecutor's Office 
attached to the Adjud Courthouse, in the 
presence of his mother and of a lawyer (him 
being a minor). However, the hearing did not </p>

<p>unlikely to succeed as the complaint was made 
too late. It is alleged that the prosecutor 
informed Mr. V that it was normal to be beaten 
by the Police, as Mr. V was guilty of stealing, 
and required him to re-write his complaint by 
deleting sections related to the use of electric 
shock on him.   
</p>
<p>As of 28 September 2010, Mr. V was on 
admission at the Focsani Prison infirmary due 
to being repeatedly beaten by inmates. 
According to a declaration of the prison&#8217;s chief 
of social and medical services, Mr. V suffers 
from an advanced stage of mental illness, 
including paranoia. He is said to fear 
everything around him, particularly, the 
authorities. His condition was worsened 
considerably by the fact that he did not seek 
early medical assistance for his condition. He 
is reported to have lost a lot of weight.

had been called to another case. The accused 
was summoned again on 3 March 2010 and 
the hearing took place at the above mentioned 
Prosecutor's Office. Based on the criminal 
investigation documents, the accused has 
never been questioned by the chief of the 
Paunesti Police Station. The questioned mr. 
V, once, later to the date mentioned by Mr. V. 
and prior to the date of preventive custody (3 
March 2010), in the presence of his mother 
and of his attorney, Mr. Mihai Cost* from the 
Vrancea Bar Association. In conformity to 
the relevant legal provisions in force and to 
the procedural norms applying to minors, all 
hearings of Mr. V. have taken place in the 
presence of a representative of legal 
guardianship, namely his mother and of his 
ex-officio attorney. On 4 March 2010, the 
prosecutor issued a 24 hours retention 
ordinance for Mr. V. The accused was taken 
to the Retention and Detention Facility 
Centre attached to Vrancea County Police 
Inspectorate, by police officers from Adjud 
City Police. He was placed under preventive 
arrest for a period of 29 days. On 25 March 
2010, Mr. V. was transferred to the Focsani 
City Penitentiary. 
</p>
<p>On 11 October 2010, the Adjud Courthouse 
sentenced  Mr. F. V. to one-year term 
imprisonment, to be sewed in detention, for 
having committed, in actual concurrence, 
several crimes of first degree theft and 
violation of domicile. The prosecutor filed an 
appeal against this judgment. 
</p>
<p>The letter mentions that the accused was 
subjected to repeated acts of torture 
consisting of electric shocks to his chest, 
hands and feet'. As a result, the accused 
suffered from, headaches, a swollen head and </p>

<p>neck, dizziness and blurred vision for several 
weeks.&quot;According to the relevant Romanian 
authorities, the Paunesti Police Station and 
the Adjud City Police have never been 
provided with or possessed electric shocks 
devices or electric vault sticks. Moreover, 
whenever a person is being taken in Retention 
and Detention Facility Centres attached to 
County Police Inspectorates, a body search 
report is being issued, in order to attest the 
absence of any kind of body signs which 
would indicate whether violence has been 
used against that person. In the case under 
discussion, the body search carried out when 
the accused was taken in the Retention and 
Detention Facility Centre attached to the 
Vrancea County Police Inspectorate did not 
reveal the presence of any sign of violence. In 
addition, the accused did not declare that he 
had been subjected to violence during his 
arrest. Therefore, he was declared  &#8220;clinically 
healthy&quot; by the physician who provides the 
medical assistance in the detention facility. 
For this reason, a full medical examination 
was not conducted. Throughout his period of 
detention in the Retention and Detention 
Facility Centre, the petitioner has not 
requested medical assistance. The petitioner 
was subjected to another medical examination 
in the context of his transfer to the Focsani 
Penitentiary. The medical report on entering 
the penitentiary (25.03.2010) mentions: &quot;in 
good health, without signs of bodily 
violence&quot;. Similarly, he did not report any 
acts of violence perpetrated against him to the 
probation counselor in charge with his 
hearing for admittance into the Focsani 
Penitentiary. Furthermore, throughout the 
judicial trial, the indicted person did not 
mention that he had been subjected to 
violence, during hearings, by police officers </p>

</p>
<p>On 20 August 2010, the petitioner submitted 
a criminal complaint to the Prosecutor's 
Office attached to the Vrancea county 
Tribunal against  police at the Paunesti Police 
Station, claiming the use of violence and the 
appliance of electric shocks against him. As a 
result of this complaint, an investigation is 
underway. During his hearings of 3 
September and 6 October 2010, Mr. V. 
claimed, before the prosecutor, that he had 
been beaten up by the above-mentioned 
police agents, requesting the questioning of 
other persons who could confirm his claims. 
However, he mentioned different dates when 
the alleged offences were committed. When 
questioned as proposed witnesses, the mother 
of the accused, his grandmother, and Mr. 
Andrei Tinca declared that they had not seen 
signs of violence on his body and have never 
heard him talking about the electric shocks. 
The alleged perpetrators also declared that the 
Paunesti police stations had never possessed 
electric shocks devices or electric vault sticks. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the criminal 
investigation into the alleged offences 
committed by the two police agents is 
ongoing. The application of sanctions or other 
measures would depend on the results of this 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>On 8 April 2010, around 1.30 p.m., the 
persons in custody V. F.-D. and M.C.M 
claimed that they had been physically and 
sexually assaulted by a cellmate, M. R., a 
minor, during the previous night. On the same

commitment to human rights and frequently 
takes on cases related to abductions, torture 
and extrajudicial executions in the Republic of 
Dagestan. Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova has also 
filed four applications with the European Court 
of Human Rights, claiming violations of the 
rights of her clients by the police and the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Khasavyurt. Ms. 
Magomedova had reportedly been previously 
threatened by the prosecutor and by members 
of the investigative committee under the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Khasavyurt.

to visit a client, Ms. Malika Evtomirova, who 
had been arrested earlier that day. Ms. 
Magomedova was denied access to her client 
by a detective, Mr. Zakir Stamulov. 
Subsequently, Mr. Stamulov ordered four 
police officers from a special riot unit (OMON) 
of the Khasavyurt police station to remove her 
from the premises. The four policemen 
reportedly severely beat Ms. Magovedova,

Magomedova&#8217;s lawyer concerning the use of 
force against her on 17 June 2010 by officers 
of the Internal Affairs Department in 
Khasavyurt, Republic of Dagestan, have been

received from your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
on 19 November 2009.(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 
para 219) 
</p>
<p>On 18 August 2010, Mr. Sokolov was 
sentenced on appeal by the Regional Court of 
Sverdlovsk to three years&#8217; imprisonment in a 
high security colony. He will serve one year 
and a half, due to his previous detention on 
remand. Reportedly, Mr. Sokolov intends to 
lodge a second appeal. According to the 
information received, the documents manually 
drafted by Mr. Sokolov in preparation of the 
discussions with his lawyer have been 
consistently confiscated by the prison guards, 
therefore obstructing his right to defend 
himself.   
</p>
<p>Mr. Sokolov was originally arrested on 13 May 
2009 in relation to a robbery in 2004. On 14 
May 2009, the Verkh-Isetsky court in 
Yekaterinburg authorized Mr.  Sokolov&#8217;s arrest 
for a period of ten days. However, he was 
subsequently held in detention until 31 July 
2009 when the court ruled to overturn the 
decision to remand him in custody. New 
charges of robbery under Article 162, Part 4 of 
the Criminal Code were filed on 31 July 2009, 
the same day that Mr. Sokolov was released 
from detention by the Sverdlovsk regional 
court. On 13 May 2010, Sverdlovsk regional 
court found Mr. Sokolov guilty of the robbery 
and he was sentenced to five years in prison. 
On 18 August 2010, during the first court 
appeal, Mr. Sokolov's had his sentence reduced 
from five to three years.  
</p>
<p>On 25 August 2010, the family and legal 
representatives of Mr. Sokolov were informed 
that, at the decision of the Russian Prison 
Service, he had been transferred from </p>

<p>Yekaterinburg to Krasnoyarsk, more than 
2,000 kilometers away from where his family 
lives. Moreover, allegations received indicate 
that Mr. Sokolov was beaten by the police 
during the transfer from Yekaterinburg to 
Krasnoyarsk while he was detained at the FGU 
IZ-54/1 Remand Center in Novisibirsk 
(Western Siberia). Reportedly, on 30 August 
2010, the Prosecutor's office confirmed the 
illegal use of physical force against Mr. 
Sokolov confirming the use of a special device 
&#8220;PR-73 (baton)&#8221; by the prison authorities on 
Mr. Sokolov. This transfer will make it more 
difficult for Mr. Sokolov to communicate with 
his family and lawyers.   
</p>
<p>According to the reports received, since 
January 2010, Mr. Sokolov has suffered 
repeated attacks by his cell mates. On 17 
January 2010, at the Kamychlov detention 
centre, Mr. Sokolov was assaulted by his cell 
mate who threw boiling water at him before 
attacking him. Officials reportedly witnessed 
the scene without intervening. One of them 
finally entered the cell, and shouted to his 
colleagues: &#8220;Sokolov attacked a co-detainee 
and is beating another one&#8221;. Following this 
assault, on 18 January 2010, Mr. Alexei 
Sokolov was reportedly transferred to the 
Soukhoi Log detention centre, where he was 
assaulted by his new cell mate, who hit him in 
the jaw and threatened him as follows: &#8220;We 
already warned you but you still don't 
understand&#8221;. This cell mate is allegedly one of 
those responsible for the re-opening of the 
investigation against Mr. Sokolov on 23 April

release of Mr. Sokolov lodged throughout the

<p>Concerning ill-treatment by police officers of 
Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova, a criminal lawyer in 
Khasavyurt, Dagestan, Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Magomedova is a member of the &#8220;Omarov 
and Partners&#8221; lawyers&#8217; association based in 
Khasavyurt, which is known for its work on 
cases of serious human rights violations 
committed by members of law enforcement 
agencies in Dagestan, including alleged 
enforced disappearances, torture and 
extrajudicial executions. 
</p>
<p>On 17 June 2010, Ms. Magomedova was 
allegedly severely beaten by the police and 
forcibly removed from Khasavyurt town police 
station (GOVD) where she was reportedly 
visiting a detained client. 
</p>
<p>Twice an ambulance was called by Ms. 
Magomedova&#8217;s colleague but was not allowed

<p>to enter the GOVD premises. It had to be 
called a third time and then collected her 
outside the police checkpoint. On 17 June 
2010, Ms. Magomedova was admitted to the 
local hospital in Khasavyurt. Local doctors 
reportedly refused to document Ms. 
Magomedova&#8217;s injuries for fear of reprisals by 
law enforcement officials, and discharged her 
from hospital with only a brief medical referral 
note. On 18 June 2010, Ms. Magomedova was 
transferred to the central hospital in 
Makhachkala.  
</p>
<p>The medical records obtained from the central 
hospital in Makhachkala are available and 
confirm Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s injuries are 
consistent with her allegations. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that since the conditions in the 
central hospital in Makhachkala were 
inadequate, on 21 June, Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s 
family transferred her to a private medical 
center in Makhachkala where she received 
adequate treatment. On 30 June, Ms. 
Magomedova left the medical centre. It is 
reported that while in the medical center, Ms. 
Magomedova became aware of a visit by a 
police inspector who reportedly questioned the 
medical personnel about the need for Ms. 
Magomedova&#8217;s continued hospitalisation at the 
medical centre. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that since Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s 
health conditions continued to remain 
unsatisfactory, she travelled to Moscow to get 
adequate treatment. On 8 July 2010, with the 
help of a local NGO called &#8220;Grazhdanskoe 
Sodeistvie&#8221; (&#8220;Civil Partnership&#8221;), Ms. 
Magomedova was admitted to Moscow City 
Clinical Hospital no. 31. On 31 July 2010, Ms. 
Magomedova completed her treatment.

<p>Magomedova was diagnosed with a tumor in 
her chest and underwent surgery in another 
hospital in Moscow. She remained in Moscow 
to undergo further health examination and 
regular check-up. 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2010, Ms.Magomedova had to 
fly back to Dagestan to visit her mother who 
was unwell. Ms. Magomedova was scheduled 
to visit her doctor in Moscow in October. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that following Ms. 
Magomedova&#8217;s allegations of being severely 
beaten by police, a criminal case was launched 
against her on charges of &#8220;public insult of state 
officials while on duty&#8221;. It is claimed that if 
convicted, Ms. Magomedova would also be 
stripped of her license to practice law as a 
lawyer.  
</p>
<p>On 30 September 2010, travel restrictions were 
issued preventing Ms. Magomedova from 
travelling to Moscow where she was reportedly 
getting medical care and legal support 
regarding the criminal allegations brought 
against her.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that Ms. Magomedova 
may be targeted for her legitimate activities as 
a lawyer. Furthermore, it is reported that 
although a criminal case on police ill-treatment 
has been launched following the attack on Ms. 
Magomedova, there have reportedly been a 
number of serious procedural violations, 
fabrication of false evidence, and political 
pressure on the investigator.  
</p>
<p>Further concerns are expressed regarding the 
physical integrity and safety of Ms. 
Magomedova as the police officers have not 
been suspended from their official duties while 
a criminal investigation of alleged ill-treatment 
has been launched against them.  </p>

<p>  Aleksei Sokolov A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 219 By letter dated 19/11/2009, the Government 
indicated that the investigation department of 
the Internal Affairs Authority for the Verkh-
Isetsk district of Yekaterinburg opened 
criminal case No. 140718 on 28 June 2004 on 
evidence of an offence under article 162, 
paragraph 4(b) of the criminal code of the 
Russian Federation in connection with the 
armed robbery by persons unknown of the 
Uraltermosvar plant warehouse. 
</p>
<p>Aleksei Veniaminovich Sokolov was 
detained on 13 May 2009 on suspicion of 
committing this offence. The Verkh-Isetsk 
district Court in Yekaterinburg ordered his 
remand in custody as a preventative measure 
on 14 May 2009. On 13 July 2009, the same 
court extended the period of remand in 
custody until 23 August 2009. 
</p>
<p>On 31 July 2009, the Sverdlovsk provincial 
court overturned the 13 July 2009 Verkh-
Isetsk district court order prolonging the 
period of remand of Aleksei Sokolov and the 
application of the preventative measure of 
remand in custody, and he was released. 
</p>
<p>The Sverdlovsk provincial court criminal 
chamber made the following findings 
concerning the circumstance of Aleksei 
Sokolov's remand in custody. 
</p>
<p>On 13 May 2009, at 9a.m., Aleksei Sokolov 
was detained on suspicion of committing an 
offence. 
</p>
<p>On 14 May 2009, Aleksei Sokolov was 
remanded in custody as a preventative 
measure. 
</p>
<p>On 22 May 2009, Aleksei Sokolov was 
charged with an offence under article 162

<p>The period of remand in custody of Aleksei 
Sokolov expired at midnight on 12 June 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, at the time that the Verkh-Isetsk 
district court judge reviewed the 
investigator&#8217;s application to extend the period 
of remand in custody of Aleksei Sokolov, I.e. 
on 13 July 2009, Aleksei Sokolov was due for 
release. In light of these circumstances, the 
Verkh-Isetsk district court judge order of 1 
July 2009 was set aside by the court of 
cassation, and Aleksei Sokolov was released 
from custody. 
</p>
<p>The main investigative office of the Central 
Internal Affairs Department for Sverdlovsk 
province is handling case No. 314204, which 
was opened against persons unknown on 
evidence of offences under article 158(Theft) 
paragraph 4(a) and 4(b), article 161 
(Robbery), paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) and 
article 162 (robbery with violence) paragraph 
4(a) and (b), of the Criminal code. 
</p>
<p>During the investigation into the case, 
witnesses were called in and testified that 
they had committed the offence together with 
Aleksei Sokolov 
</p>
<p>In particular, the following was ascertain: in 
early hours of 26 June 2004, E.G. Beyash, SA 
Skvortsov, V.A. Maslov and the Sokolov 
brothers (Aleksandr and Aleksei) entered 
through a window into the office 616, located 
at 24/8 Lenin Av. Yekaterinburg, and stole 
property worth a total  of 2,649,070 roubles 
from I.V Rakityansky, causing him a 
particularly heavy loss. Aleksei Sokolov was 
detained on 31 July 2009 on suspicion of 
having committed robbery with violence and 
theft of property under articles 91 and 92 of 
the code of Criminal Procedure. </p>

<p>The Lenin district court in Yekaterinburg 
ordered his remand in custody as a 
preventative measure. In ordering the 
preventative measure, the lawyer R.E. 
Kachalov made a request to hold the hearing 
in public in accordance with the article 241 of 
the Code of Criminal procedure and on the 
basis of article 123 of the constitution of the 
Russian Federation and to allow the defence 
lawyers V.A. Shaklein and V.V. Shekhardin 
and Aleksei Sokolov&#8217;s relatives and members 
of the news media to attend. The court 
refused the request on the grounds that the 
review of application tor preventative 
measure is a stage in pre-trial proceedings in 
which a specific group of people are allowed 
to participate under article 108 of the Code of 
Criminal procedure. Furthermore, third 
parties are not allowed to attend such 
hearings because of the need to preclude the 
possibility of breaching the secrecy of the 
investigation. The suspect was provided with 
a qualified defence lawyer, and his right to 
counsel was violated. 
</p>
<p>The Sverdlovsk provincial court upheld this 
decision on 2 September 2009 and rejected 
the cassational appeal. There are no grounds 
for raising the issue of supervisory review of 
the above mentioned decision. 
</p>
<p>Aleksei Sokolov was charged on 6 august 
2009 with an offence under article 158. 
Article 4(b) of the Criminal Code in the light 
of the evidence gathered in criminal case No. 
</p><p>314204. 
</p>
<p>Separate proceedings were initiated in 
criminal case No. 621608, opened on 12 
August 2009 against unknown on evidence of 
offences under paragraph 4(a) and 4(b) article

<p>The requirement of Article 217 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure (disclosure of the 
criminal case file to the accused and his or 
her lawyer) are now being fulfilled in case 
No. 314204. The results of the criminal 
investigation are being monitored. 
</p>
<p>It was established that the procuratorial 
bodies did not receive any complaint about 
threats of the use of torture against Aleksei 
Sokolov. The Sverdlovsk province procurator 
led an inspection of the FBU IZ-66/1 remand 
centre of the Central Department of the Penal 
Correction Service for Sverdlovsk province 
on 8 June 2009 in the course of which 
Aleksei Sokolov was questioned; he made 
clear that he was not being subjected to 
unlawful coercive measures in the remand 
centre, the conditions of detention were 
satisfactory and there was no cause for 
complaint about the actions of the remand 
staff. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 20 July 2009, the 
investigation agency for the Kirov district of 
the Yekaterinburg, a unit of the investigation 
department working under the investigative 
committee of the Office of the Procurator of 
the Russian Federation for Sverdlovsk 
province, received material relating to 
Aleksei Sokolov&#8217;s complaint that militia 
officers had acted unlawfully during his 
detention on 13 May 2009 by compressing 
his wrist with handcuffs. 
</p>
<p>Following an investigation, on 20 July 2009 a 
decision not to institute criminal proceedings 
was handed down, which was overturned on 
20 August 2009 by the head of the 
investigative body.

Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband Mr. 
Alik(Umar) Lechayevich Dzhabrailov 
(A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para. 220) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 17/11/2009, the Government 
indicated that on 10 August 2009, a local 
resident, L.K. Dzhabrailov, contacted the 
Lenin district duty section of the Department 
of Internal Affairs in Grozny and reported 
that at 2 p.m. his son A.L. Dzhabrailov and 
his daughter-in-law Z.A. Sadulayeva had 
been abducted from the office of the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) (86, 
Mayakovsky Road, Grozny) by five unknown 
persons armed with automatic firearms. 
</p>
<p>The unknown persons drove the couple away 
in a VAZ 2110, but one of the assailants 
drove off in A.L. Dzhabrailov&#8217;s VAZ 2107, 
which was parked near the office. 
</p>
<p>On 11 August 2009, the Lenin inter-district 
investigative section of the Grozny 
investigative department of the Investigative 
Committee attached to the Procurator&#8217;s 
Office of the Russian Federation responsible 
for the Chechen Republic instituted criminal 
proceedings in connection with this incident 
on the basis of the crime defined in article

<p>at the entrance to the grounds of the

the corpses of Z.A. Sadulayeva and A.L. 
Dzhabrailov were found WGEIDlaying signs 
of a violent death from gunshot wounds. 
</p>
<p>In connection therewith the Zavodsk inter-
district investigative section of the Grozny 
investigative department of the Investigative 
Committee attached to the Procurator&#8217;s 
Office of the Russian Federation responsible 
for the Chechen Republic instituted criminal 
proceedings on the grounds of the crimes 
defined in article 105, paragraph 2 (a) and (g) 
and article 222 of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>On 12 August 2009 the above-mentioned 
criminal cases were joined and referred for 
further investigation to the department for the 
investigation of especially important cases of 
the investigative department of the 
Investigative Committee attached to the 
Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Russian Federation 
responsible for the Chechen Republic. 
</p>
<p>The investigation established that A.L. 
Dzhabrailov had previously belonged to an 
illegal armed gang and that in 2006 he had 
been sentenced to four years&#8217; imprisonment 
for membership of an illegal armed gang and 
for unlawful possession of firearms. He had 
been released early on 8 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>Given whom the victims were and the 
circumstances of the crime, the investigation 
is working on various leads. The version that 
the killing of A.L. Dzhabrailov and Z.A. 
Sadulayeva was linked to her recent 
professional activity has, however, been 
deemed improbable insofar as the 
organization which she headed was a charity 
that operated in accordance with its rules and </p>

<p>political issues were not part of its remit. The 
version connected with A.L. Dzhabrailov&#8217;s 
past (the crime was committed by unknown 
persons out of revenge) is more probable.

<p>Concerning regarding the detention and health 
deterioration of Mr. Nacer Na&#239;f Al Hajiri, 
Kuwaiti national who normally resides with his 
wife and 3 children at Manteqat Al Qusur 
(Kuwait) and who was working as a civil 
servant in the Kuwaiti Administration.   
</p>
<p>Mr. Al Hajiri was arrested on 16 December 
2007, by the General Saudi Intelligence 
Services (Al Mabahit Al Aama) at the Khafdji 
border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  He 
was allegedly arrested without a warrant and 
taken to an unknown location.   
</p>
<p>Five months after his arrest, in May 2008, the 
wife of Mr. Al Hajiri was authorized to see him 
at the Intelligence Services&#8217; detention centre in 
Damman (Eastern Saudi Arabia).  Mr. Al 
Hajiri reportedly informed his wife that during 
this time he was not charged, nor given a 
reason for his arrest, he had not been presented 
before a judge, nor had he been allowed to 
access a lawyer.  To date, no charges have been 
reportedly brought against Mr. Al Hajiri, nor 
has he had access to legal counsel.   
</p>
<p>According to the reports received, Mr. Al 
Hajiri&#8217;s health started deteriorating after his 
arrest as he suffers from diabetes and arterial 
hypertension.  In March 2009, Mr. Al Hajiri 
undertook a hunger strike in protest against his 
detention.   
</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Al Hajiri is currently suffering 
from a brain tumour which, according to a

urgent operation to extract the tumour. On 28 
February 2010, Mr. Al Hajiri was reportedly 
taken to a hospital and examined by a doctor 
who advised immediate medical intervention, 
including specialized exams. However, despite 
the worsening of his physical condition, the 
prison authorities refused the medical advice 
and he was returned to his cell.  Mr. Al Hajiri 
remains in detention. 
</p>
<p>Serious concern is expressed about the physical 
and mental integrity of Mr. Al Hajiri.  Concern 
is expressed about allegations that, despite the 
degradation of Mr. Al Hajiri&#8217;s health, the 
prison authorities have reportedly refused that 
he obtains the necessary medical care as 
repeatedly advised by doctors.  Further concern 
is expressed about reports that Mr. Al Hajiri 
was held incommunicado in an unknown 
location for a period of five months without 
access to a lawyer or contact with his family.  
Concern is also expressed about allegations 
that no charges have been brought against Mr. 
Al Hajiri and that he has not had access to legal 
counsel since the time of his arrest.

demand that action be taken to resolve regular

<p>However, following the protest, Mr. Al-Harbi 
was allegedly summoned by the police, 
interrogated, and charged with instigating 
protests. He was brought before a court in 
Qaseem and, on 26 October, sentenced to two 
months imprisonment and 50 lashes, 25 of 
which would take place in public, in front of 
the local electricity department.

<p>Mr. Al-Harbi has reportedly been assigned a 
lawyer to appeal his sentence.

<p>Given the severity of the corporal punishment 
to which he has allegedly been sentenced, 
concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Fahd Bin Abdu-

<p>Al llegar a Madrid, fueron puestos en 
habitaciones obscuras y cuando los sacaban 
siempre llevaban un antifaz. Durante los 
interrogatorios, todos los detenidos fueron 
amenazados contra sus familiares. Se les aplic&#243; 
la bolsa en varias ocasiones, fueron golpeados, 
obligados a realizar ejercicios f&#237;sicos y 
mantenerse en posturas inc&#243;modas. Asimismo, 
les fue prohibido dormir y pasaban muchas 
horas de pie. En el caso de varios detenidos, 
incluidas las se&#241;oras Iriarte y Bilbao, las 
autoridades simularon descargas el&#233;ctricas, 
aunque estas no fueron aplicadas. Los se&#241;ores 
Compains y Garmendia, as&#237; como la se&#241;ora 
Barrenetxea fueron desnudados y amenazados 
con violaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Varios detenidos, incluida la se&#241;ora 
Ariznabarreta y los se&#241;ores Elizaran y 
Garmendia fueron envueltos con una manta y 
goma espuma, y posteriormente amenazados 
mientras oficiales de la Guardia Civil se 
sentaban sobre ellos. El se&#241;or Garmendia 
tambi&#233;n fue golpeado en los test&#237;culos, cabeza 
y pies.  
</p>
<p>Todos los detenidos denunciaron ante el juez y 
el m&#233;dico forense de los malos tratos sufridos. 
El se&#241;or Compains se neg&#243; a realizar la 
declaraci&#243;n policial, y solicit&#243; un habeas 
corpus por los malos tratos sufridos, pero &#233;ste 
le fue negado por la Audiencia Nacional bajo 
el argumento de que no exist&#237;an elementos 
suficientes que indicaran que hubiera sufrido 
malos tratos, a pesar de la existencia del 
informe del m&#233;dico forense.

<p>Con relaci&#243;n con la posible extradici&#243;n del Sr. 
Ali Aarrass. 
</p>
<p>Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Consejo de 
Ministros de Espa&#241;a habr&#237;a otorgado la 
aprobaci&#243;n final en una petici&#243;n del Reino de 
Marruecos para extraditar al Sr.  Ali Aarrass 
por cargos de terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>El Sr. Ali Aarrass habr&#237;a sido detenido el 28 de 
marzo de 2010, en Melilla con base en una 
orden de detenci&#243;n internacional solicitada por 
el Reino de Marruecos. Se alega que el Sr. 
Aarrass habr&#237;a sido detenido junto con el Sr. 
Mohammed el Bay, quien tambi&#233;n ser&#237;a objeto 
de una orden de b&#250;squeda y captura 
internacional, y que ambos se encontrar&#237;an 
detenidos desde el 1 de abril de 2008. El Sr. 
Ali Aarrass estar&#237;a siendo buscado en 
Marruecos por cargos relacionados con el 
terrorismo y ser&#237;a acusado de pertenecer a una 
red terrorista dirigida por el Sr. Abdelkader 
Belliraj. A ra&#237;z de las decisiones judiciales del 
21 de noviembre 2008 y 23 de enero de 2009, y 
de una garant&#237;a del Gobierno de Marruecos de 
que el Sr. Ali Aarrass no ser&#237;a condenado a la 
pena de muerte o a cadena perpetua sin libertad 
condicional, el Gobierno espa&#241;ol habr&#237;a 
autorizado su extradici&#243;n el 19 de noviembre 
de 2010. El Gobierno espa&#241;ol se habr&#237;a negado 
a la solicitud de extradici&#243;n del Sr. el Bay, 
quien tendr&#237;a doble ciudadan&#237;a espa&#241;ola y 
marroqu&#237;. El 24 de noviembre, la Audiencia 
Nacional habr&#237;a enviado una carta a Interpol y 
al Director del Centro Penitenciario de 
</p>
<p>Por medio de cartas de fecha 08/12/2010, el 
Gobierno indic&#243; que, los representantes del 
Sr. Ali Aarrass han planteado su queja de 
forma simult&#225;nea en tres instancias 
internacionales: procedimientos especiales; 
Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos de Naciones 
Unidas y Tribunal Europeo de Derechos 
Humanos.  
</p>
<p>El Gobierno puso de manifiesto que el Sr. Ali 
Aarrass no fue detenido en la fecha que se 
indica en la carta enviada por ambos 
Relatores Especiales, sino que fue detenido 
con anterioridad, encontr&#225;ndose en situaci&#243;n 
de prisi&#243;n provisional a la espera de 
extradici&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Respecto a la alegaci&#243;n realizada sobre 
posible riesgo de tortura o malos tratos en el 
caso de la entrega del Sr. Ali Aarrass a 
Marruecos, el Gobierno indic&#243; que durante el 
procedimiento de extradici&#243;n, esta alegaci&#243;n 
fue analizada, debatida y resuelta por los 
Tribunales espa&#241;oles. En este sentido, en el 
auto de 21 de noviembre de 2008, la Secci&#243;n 
Segunda de la Sala de lo Penal de la 
Audiencia Nacional rechaz&#243; tales 
alegaciones. Por otro lado, se indic&#243; que el 
Auto de 23 de enero de 2009 del Pleno de la 
misma Sala, que resuelve el recurso 
interpuesto contra el auto referido 
anteriormente, rechaza que exista riesgo de 
violaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos. El 
Gobierno inform&#243; que el Auto del Pleno de la 
Sala estima en parte el recurso, estableciendo </p>

<p>Algeciras solicit&#225;ndoles que faciliten la 
extradici&#243;n del Sr. Aarrass a la mayor brevedad 
posible. 
</p>
<p>Desde el a&#241;o 2006, el Sr. Aarrass habr&#237;a sido 
investigado por la Audiencia Nacional 
espa&#241;ola por cargos relacionados con 
terrorismo. El 16 de marzo de 2009, el tribunal 
habr&#237;a cerrado provisionalmente la 
investigaci&#243;n por falta de pruebas. 
</p>
<p>Se expresa temor por el hecho de que el Sr. Ali 
Aarrass pueda ser sometido a torturas y malos 
tratos en caso de ser extraditado a Marruecos. 
Individuos detenidos en Marruecos y acusados 
de estar vinculados a la &quot;C&#233;lula Belliraj&quot; han 
alegado haber sido sometidos a torturas por 
miembros de la Direcci&#243;n de Vigilancia del 
Territorio (Direction de la surveillance du 
territoire, DST), un organismo de inteligencia, 
durante su detenci&#243;n en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n en el centro de detenci&#243;n de 
T&#233;mara. 
</p>
<p>como garant&#237;a que para determinar la pena 
aplicable se aplique la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola.  
</p>
<p>Respecto a la apreciaci&#243;n por los Tribunales 
espa&#241;oles del riesgo alegado por el Sr. Ali 
Aarrass, el Gobierno precis&#243; que han de 
distinguirse dos aspectos distintos referidos al 
riesgo invocado. Por una parte, el que se 
refiere a las condiciones en las que pueda 
llevarse a cabo la investigaci&#243;n penal en 
Marruecos y la situaci&#243;n personal del 
extraditado en ese periodo. En este sentido, el 
Gobierno indic&#243; que no se ha considerado 
que haya quedado suficientemente acreditado 
dicho riesgo concreto de un potencial 
sometimiento a tortura o tratos inhumanos o 
degradantes.  
</p>
<p>En segundo lugar, se hace referencia a las 
garant&#237;as exigibles, en caso de que el 
extraditado fuera condenado. En este sentido 
el Gobierno se&#241;ala que la Sala de lo Penal de 
la Audiencia Nacional impuso como 
condici&#243;n para la entrega, que la pena a 
imponer sea la prevista para los mismos 
hechos en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola. 
Subrayando que, esta no es una mera 
&#8220;garant&#237;a diplom&#225;tica&#8221; sino que es una 
previsi&#243;n expresa del Convenio bilateral de 
extradici&#243;n de la que han decidieron hacer 
uso las autoridades espa&#241;olas. 
</p>
<p>En cuanto a las aclaraciones sobre el archivo 
de la investigaci&#243;n penal desarrollada en 
Espa&#241;a, el Gobierno manifest&#243; que: 
</p>
<p>1&#176; Lo primero que debe resaltarse es que, 
como se&#241;al&#243; la Sala de lo Penal de la 
Audiencia Nacional, no estamos ante dos 
investigaciones penales por los &#8220;mismos 
hechos&#8221;. En efecto, los hechos que est&#225;n en el 
origen de la demanda de extradici&#243;n 
presentada por Marruecos son los siguientes:  </p>

<p><i>El reclamado fue reclutado para formar 
parte del Movimiento de los Muyaidin de 
Marruecos por Abdelkader BELLIREJ, que 
formaba parte de dicho grupo desde finales 
del a&#241;o 1982. Este, tras una reuni&#243;n en Paris 
con los responsables de la organizaci&#243;n,

Abdelkader BELLIREJ a Argelia con el 
mencionado fin se produjo en 2005.

<p>Por su parte, las diligencias previas seguidas 
ante el Juzgado Central de Instrucci&#243;n n&#176; 5 de

<p>2&#176; En consecuencia, los hechos investigados 
por Espa&#241;a no son los mismos que est&#225;n en el 
fundamento de la petici&#243;n de extradici&#243;n. En 
Espa&#241;a se investig&#243; el posible tr&#225;fico de 
armas por el territorio espa&#241;ol con destino a 
un grupo terrorista en Marruecos. Por su 
parte, los hechos por los que se solicita la 
extradici&#243;n son la pertenencia del reclamado 
a una organizaci&#243;n terrorista, realizando 
actividades de contacto y colaboraci&#243;n con 
diferentes personas en Argelia, con el 
objetivo de coordinar la instalaci&#243;n de un 
campamento yihadi en ese pa&#237;s para los 
voluntarios marroqu&#237;es del Movimiento de 
los Muyahidine de Marruecos bajo las

<p>Se trata, por tanto, de hechos diferentes 
aunque puedan estar relacionados con una 
misma organizaci&#243;n terrorista, de pertenecer a 
la cual es acusado el Sr. Ali Aarrass.

<p>3&#176; El procedimiento seguido ante el Juzgado

Nacional se refiere exclusivamente a los 
hechos relacionados con el tr&#225;fico de armas a 
trav&#233;s de Espa&#241;a. Es sobre tales hechos sobre 
los que se ha dictado Auto de sobreseimiento 
provisional (archivo provisional) del 
procedimiento. 
</p>
<p>Dicho sobreseimiento provisional se acuerda 
al amparo de art&#237;culo 641.2&#176; de la Ley de

<p>del sumario haberse cometido un delito y no 
haya motivos suficientes para acusar a 
determinada o determinadas personas como 
autores, c&#243;mplices o encubridores&#8221;. Por tanto, 
de acuerdo con le LECrim, la resoluci&#243;n 
judicial constata la existencia de un hecho 
delictivo, pero concluye que no hay pruebas 
suficientes para acusar del delito de tr&#225;fico de 
armas con fines terroristas al Sr. Ali Arras. 
Este tipo de sobreseimiento (archivo 
provisional) no produce efecto de cosa 
juzgada, ni excluye que el sospechoso sea 
investigado en otro pa&#237;s por otros hechos o, 
incluso, por los mismos hechos. 
</p>
<p>4&#176; No hay, por tanto, contradicci&#243;n alguna 
entre las decisiones tomadas por las

Espa&#241;a est&#225; justificada por la falta de pruebas 
suficientes para dirigir la acusaci&#243;n de tr&#225;fico 
de armas contra el Sr. Ali Aarrass no excluye 
que los hechos pudieran ser investigados en 
otro Estado en el que pueda existir otro

several villagers outside a shop to search the

police Inspector, police constable and other 
officers, all dressed in civilian clothes. The 
police indicated that he had been detained on 
suspicion of theft at the shop and of a water 
pump, charges which Mr. Kumara denied. 
</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Kumara was subjected to 
the &#8220;Palestinian hanging&#8221;, whereby his shirt 
was removed, his lower arms were wrapped in 
cloth, his hands were forced behind his back 
and tied with a rope which was attached to a 
nylon rope that hung from a bean in the ceiling. 
The other end of the nylon rope was secured to 
a steel bed. Mr. Kumara was then told to stand 
on a box; the rope was pulled tight and the box 
was then kicked from under his feet, leaving 
him hanging. The Inspector gave orders to the 
other officers to leave Mr. Kumara hanging 
until he confessed to the crimes. He was taken 
down approximately two hours later, but the 
procedure was repeated that evening. The 
second time, he was released after 
approximately 30 minutes, but was then beaten 
and kicked for three hours. Although by this 
time the police had allegedly received 
information indicating that Mr. Kumara had 
not been involved in the theft at the shop, he 
was still accused of steeling a water pump.  
</p>
<p>The following day, Mr. Kumara was once 
again hung for approximately two hours. 
Though he needed medical attention, none was 
provided. That evening, the Inspector told Mr. 
Kumara that he could be released the following 
day if he confessed; otherwise, he would be 
presented before the court. When Mr. Kumara 
denied his involvement, he was grabbed by the </p>

was beaten and stripped, and his hands were 
tied. He was then subjected to the &#8220;Dharma 
Chakra&#8221; or wheel of enlightenment, by which 
he was forced to squat and wrap his hands over 
his knees, while a metal pipe was inserted 
through the space between his knees and 
elbows, and was balanced on two tables. While 
in this position, a bottle of petrol was poured in 
his anus. Water was also poured on him to 
relax the muscles.  
</p>
<p>On 28 October, Mr. Kumara&#8217;s cellmate was 
ordered to bathe and dress him, since he could 
not move his arms. They were both taken to the 
criminal division, but a statement was only 
taken from Mr. Kumara&#8217;s cellmate. They were 
then taken to the Out-Patient Department of 
Galgamuwa Hospital, where a Doctor 
completed a Medico-Legal Examination Form 
without examining Mr. Kumara.  
</p>
<p>Afterwards, they were taken to the Magistrate&#8217;s 
Court in Galgamuwa. They were not allowed 
to inform their families or contact a lawyer. 
Mr. Kumara was not questioned or addressed 
by the magistrate, but was remanded. He was 
then transferred to Wariyapola Prison, where 
he informed the guards about his torture and 
signed a statement indicating his experience. 
</p>
<p>The following day, Mr. Kumara was taken to 
Wariyapola Hospital. The accompanying 
officer informed the doctor of the torture, but 
the doctor reportedly accused Mr. Kumara of 
lying and refused to examine him.  
</p>
<p>On 6 November, Mr. Kumara was presented 
before the Galgamuwa Magistrate&#8217;s Court. He 
was released on bail. Three days after, Mr. 
Kumara went to the Galgamuwa Hospital, but

went there the following day, where he 
received adequate treatment and was examined 
by a Judicial Medical Officer. 
</p>
<p>On 17 November, one of the alleged 
perpetrators visited Mr. Kumara at his home to 
inquire into the possible action he was 
intending to take. On 19 November, Mr.

<p>191.  22/09/10 AL TOR Concerning Mr. Hewawasam Sarukkalige 
Rathnasiri Fernando (50) of No: 07 D, 
Warapitiya, Darga Town, a married father of 
four children.  
</p>
<p>On 9 August 2010 around 3.30 p.m., Mr. 
Rathnasiri was at work in Aandawala, 
Parapathkotuwa, when two reportedly drunk 
plain clothed policemen asked to buy some 
toddy. Following the refusal by Mr. Rathnasiri 
to sell it to them, a confrontation ensued 
between the two men and Mr. Rathnasiri. This 
led to one of the policemen being accidentally 
cut on his hand when the officers tried to grab 
a knife being held by Mr. Rathnasiri. It is 
alleged that the officer who received the cut 
then ran a knife down Mr. Rathnasiri's back, 
cutting it deeply. While the wound on 
Rathnasiri's back was bleeding profusely, the 
two officers started to assault him by kicking 
and punching him. They struck him on the 
body, face, chest and stomach. They reportedly 
tore off his clothes and used the rags to tie his 
hands behind his back. He was then forced to 
walk for about 400 meters in front of a crowd 
of people who pleaded with the officers to stop 
the assault. The crowd raised concerns about 
the state of sobriety of the officers and objected 
to the officers forcing Mr. Rathnasiri to walk as

<p>they felt his condition would worsen. Mr. 
Rathnasiri&#8217;s wound was dressed with some 
fabric by a nearby passer-by. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Rathnasiri was then taken to the 
Welippena Police Station by three other police 
officers. After about one-and-a-half hours, two 
officers took Mr. Rathnasiri to the house of a 
doctor of the Government Hospital of 
Watthewa. Following the doctor&#8217;s examination 
of his injuries, the doctor directed them to take 
Mr. Rathnasiri to the Watthewa hospital as 
nine sutures were needed to close the wound. 
He was then taken to the hospital where he was 
admitted for further treatment. After being 
admitted, Mr. Rathnasiri noticed unusual pain 
in his ears. He was examined, found to be 
bleeding in his ears and referred to the General 
Hospital of Nagoda for further treatment. He 
was also treated for pain in the face, eyes and 
chest. The policeman&#8217;s injury was also 
examined by the Doctor and he was discharged 
the same day. At the time of his admission to 
hospital, Mr. Rathnasiri was reportedly forced 
to sign a document written by the police from 
Welippena Police Station. It is claimed that Mr. 
Rathnasiri was not allowed to see the contents 
of the statement; but he signed it out of fear. 
He has subsequently denied the contents of this 
statement. 
</p>
<p>After being discharged from the hospital, he 
was taken to the remand prison at Kaluthara 
where he remained until 17 August 2010. 
While in prison, the authorities took measures 
to treat his injuries. On 17 August 2010, Mr. 
Rathnasiri learned that the police had filed a 
fabricated cased against him accusing him of 
causing grievous hurt, causing minor hurt and 
obstructing the official duties of the police at 
the Magistrate of Matugama. Further, the 
police officers filed another fabricated case </p>

liquor. Mr. Rathnasiri has denied the charges 
and complained about the ill treatment he 
suffered at the hand of the police. Following 
his complaint, the magistrate directed the 
Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of Colombo to 
examine him and send the report to the court. 
He was examined by the Judicial Medical 
Officer (JMO) of Colombo on 19 August 2010 
and by a medical consultant of The Ear Nose 
Throat department on 20 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Rathnasiri has also made several 
complaints to the Inspector General of Police 
(IGP), the Superintendent of Police (SP) of 
Kaluthara, the National Police Commission, 
the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and 
the Secretary of the Judicial Service 
Commission, asking for a prompt, effective,

treatment by the police. He is awaiting

<p>We are informed that there is a pattern of 
police officers killing detained suspects as a 
means of eliminating organized crime. Such 
cases are not being investigated or prosecuted 
before the courts.  
</p>
<p>On 13 August 2010, Mr. Amarasinghe 
Arachchige David was arrested by officers 
from the Kirindiwela Police Station. He was 
placed into a police vehicle and on their way to 
the police station, the vehicle stopped along the

<p>and watched the police officers conduct the 
search. The police officers, after noting that 
Mr. David had stepped out of the vehicle, 
approached him and beat him on his back and 
hip areas. He was then dragged towards the 
vehicle where the officers beat him against the 
rear door shouting &#8220;Are you trying to escape 
from us&#8221;. Mr. David was taken to Kirindiwela 
Police Station and later admitted at the 
Government hospital of Radawana. He was 
transferred to the National Hospital of 
Colombo; however he later died from the 
injuries sustained. On 15 August 2010, a post-
mortem examination indicated that he had died 
as a result of head injuries. It is alleged that the 
police are reluctant to conduct an investigation 
into the death.  
</p>
<p>On 25 August 2010, Mr. Jayasekara, of 
Ranaviru Niwasa, Morakatiara, Beliattha was 
arrested by the Ragama Police Station and 
taken to Kiribathgoda police station. He was 
arrested on suspicion of having stolen a mobile 
phone at Ragama Railway Station. On 26 
August 2010, a police officer brought the body 
of Mr. Jayasekara to Ragama Teaching 
hospital; however he did not wish to be 
registered as the person who brought in the 
body. On 27 August 2010, the police constable 
of the Kiribathgoda Police Station registered as 
the person who delivered the body. A post 
mortem that was conducted by the judicial 
medical officer at the Ragama Teaching 
Hospital revealed marks of numerous blunt 
force trauma injuries.

<p>On 31 August 2010, Mr. Jayakody 
Arachchilage Oman Perera of No. 22, Palle

<p>he was shot. It is alleged that as the vehicle was 
near the Japalawatta Industrial Zone junction in 
Minuwangoda, Mr. Perera attempted to escape. 
He was taken to Minuwangoda Hospital and 
later transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of 
the General Hospital, Gampaha. He died the 
same day from the injuries sustained.  
</p>
<p>On 20 September 2010, Mr. Dhammala 
Arachchige Lakshman was arrested by the 
police and held in custody at the Hanwella 
police station. On 22 September 2010, he was 
taken to a location in Diddeniya in Hanwella 
for an on-sight investigation to uncover 
weapons. It is alleged that he attempted to 
escape from police custody by throwing a 
bomb at the police officers and was shot. He 
sustained injuries and died at the Avissawella 
hospital the same day. During his detention the 
deceased was not brought before a court.

<p>On 22 September 2010, Mr. Prasanna of No.

was arrested by the police officers from the 
Moratuwa Police Station. On 25 September 
2010, he was found in his cell with severe cuts 
to his abdomen and was admitted at the 
Kalubowila Teaching Hospital. On 26 
September 2010, he died from the injuries 
sustained. The police indicated that he had 
attempted to commit suicide with a shard of 
glass found inside his cell. During his detention 
he was not brought before a Magistrate as 
required by the Code of Criminal Procedure 
No.15 of 1979. 
</p>
<p>We are informed that in the recent past, the 
police have increasingly been arresting people

for five months following their arrest (from 
May until October 2005), and that they 
confessed to murder charges under torture. 
Regrettably, we have not received a reply to 
this communication. In the meantime, we have

law binding for your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government. 
</p>
<p>On 11 December 2006, the judge announced 
the verdict in the presence of the families of the 
victims. The families declared that they refused 
to spare the lives of the condemned in return 
for payment of diya and asked for retribution in 
kind, i.e. execution of the death sentences.  
</p>
<p>The trial court&#8217;s judgment was confirmed on 
appeal by the Court of Appeal, with the 
exception of the case of one defendant, Fathi 
Adam Mohammed Ahmad Dahab, who was 
found guilty of involuntary homicide instead of 
murder. His sentence was reduced from death 
to five years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>On 18 July 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed 
the death sentences, as did a review panel of 
the Supreme Court on 27 February 2008. From 
the judgment of the Constitutional Court in this 
case (see below), it would appear that the 
defendants&#8217; lawyers raised the violation of the 
defendants&#8217; constitutional rights before the 
Supreme Court, including that confessions 
were obtained under torture, but the Supreme 
Court declined to deal with these complaints.

<p>On 13 October 2009, the Constitutional Court 
rejected an appeal in the case. The judgment 
notes, without further elaboration, that 
&#8220;allegations of torture were not convincing to 
the lower courts&#8221;.

<p>The Supreme Court then granted a one month

were not successful. The stay of execution </p>

</p>
<p>On 19 January 2010, supporters of Mr. Hamad 
Mohammad Ali from the Amarar ethnic group 
in the Red Sea State, Sudan, an independent 
gubernatorial candidate for the April 2010 
elections, organised a peaceful demonstration 
and rally in support of his candidacy. Mr. 
Hamad Mohammad Ali was a member of the 
National Congress Party (NCP), but started a 
campaign as an independent candidate when he 
was not nominated by his former party.  
</p>
<p>The peaceful protests were soon curbed by 
police forces invoking the failure of the 
organisers to register a permit. Protestors were 
WGEIDersed using tear gas, electrical batons, 
and water hoses. 27 people were arrested, and 
subsequently taken to Al-Awsat police station 
in Port Sudan. 12 of the protestors were 
released at 12:00 pm, among them two minors, 
H.O.A., aged 14, and M.N.A, aged 15. The 
remaining detainees, most of whom are 
members of the Bani Amir tribe including the 
10 individuals mentioned above, face criminal 
charges under the 1991 Criminal Code. The 
case has been docketed as Case No. 311/2010.

<p>During the WGEIDersion, a number of 
protestors, including Messrs. Hamed Mohamed 
Mahmoud Ahmad, Yacgoub Ibrahim Hamed, 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 02/05/2010 the Government 
indicated that a group of 800 supporters of 
the independent candidate for the office of 
Governor, Hamad Mohammad Ali, 
demonstrated in the streets of the city without 
obtaining a permit from the authorities on 19 
January 2010. 
</p>
<p>The police intervened and the chief of the 
force ordered them to WGEIDerse, but they 
ignored the orders issued pursuant to the 
provisions of the 1991 Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 
</p>
<p>Thirty-eight persons were arrested, 
proceedings were instituted against them 
pursuant to articles 67, 68 and 69 of the Code 
and their vehicles were seized. 
</p>
<p>Nine of the accused filed a complaint with the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, claiming that they 
had been injured during the WGEIDersal of 
the demonstration. The Office ordered a 
preliminary investigation pursuant to article 
47 of the 1991 Code of Criminal Procedure. 
On completion of the investigation, the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office dismissed the complaint.

injuries inflicted by police officers and security 
agents. Mr. Ali Mohamed Ibrahim Adam was 
wounded in the leg. The police also damaged a 
number of civilian vehicles belonging to 
protestors. The owners of the vehicles have 
attempted to press charges against the police 
for the damage, which have filed preliminary 
investigations.   
</p>
<p>Fears have been expressed that the conduct of 
the police was discriminatory. Mr. Hamad 
Mohammad Ali asserts that the authorities in 
the Red Sea State denied his supporters a 
permit for the demonstration although 
supporters of the incumbent Governor of the 
National Congress Party (NCP) were permitted 
to hold a rally. Further reports indicate that 
Governor Ella&#8217;s campaign has made use of 
State resources, for example by using 
Government vehicles for demonstrations in 
Port Sudan. The electoral laws of Sudan 
however require that campaigns are to be 
funded by the candidate&#8217;s party, not by the 
State.  
</p>
<p>Concerns are expressed that the arrest and 
detention of the abovementioned persons and 
the WGEIDersion of the reportedly peaceful 
demonstration using WGEIDroportionate 
force, might form part of an attempt to stifle 
freedom of opinion, expression, peaceful 
assembly, and participation in the conduct of 
public affairs, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives, in the country.

<p>  Ms. L.A.H, a Sudanese national By a letter dated 02/10/09, The Government 
indicated that under the Constitution, women 
have full citizenship and enjoy the same 
rights as men, including the right to run for 
the presidency of the Republic without any 
legal or social impediments. Under the 
Elections Act, women are entitled to hold 25 
per cent of all seats in legislative bodies. I 
should also like to draw your kind attention to 
the fact that Sudanese women are members of 
the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court 
and the courts of appeal. The Presidential 
Adviser for Legal Affairs and the chairs of 
the parliamentary legislation committee and 
the parliamentary human rights committee are 
all women. Moreover, women hold positions 
as ministers and as members of parliament at 
both the central and State levels. There are 
also women ambassadors, governors, vice-
ministers and college and university deans, 
women in senior positions in the Armed 
Forces and the police and women working in 
the sphere of investment. 
</p>
<p>As for Ms. H., she was not accused merely of 
wearing trousers or of being an opposition 
political activist. She was charged, based on </p>

<p>prima facie evidence, with violating certain 
articles of the Criminal Code of 1991; it was 
for the court to decide whether she was to be 
acquitted. We should point out that the 
defendant was afforded all her constitutional 
rights, in that she was released on bail and 
was not, as has been claimed, sentenced to 
flogging. The fact that the hearings were 
conducted in public and in open court 
confirms that they were transparent and fair. 
Moreover, a number of diplomats from 
European Union countries attended the court 
hearings, and the defendant exercised her 
constitutional right to legal representation. 
</p>
<p>The court, having held a number of witness 
hearings and having examined the other 
evidence, convicted the defendant under 
article 152 [of the Criminal Code] and issued 
the following opinion: 
</p>
<p>After the court had heard the case for the 
prosecution and the response of the 
defendant, counsel for the defendant filed a 
motion to dismiss, on the ground that the 
evidence presented in the case was 
inconsistent with the police evidence. 
Counsel for the prosecution objected to the 
motion, arguing that the evidence submitted 
was sufficient for a conviction, as it consisted 
of the sworn statements of police officers, 
who were impartial and bore the defendant no 
grudge; consequently, he asked for the 
motion to be refused. 
</p>
<p>The proven facts are that the police were 
despatched to the Kawkab al-Sharq nightclub, 
having received a complaint from a resident 
of the area in which the establishment is 
located. When they entered the premises, they 
found men and women together, dancing to 
live music by an Egyptian singer. Some 12 
women, including the defendant, were </p>

<p>wearing indecent clothing; the police 
therefore escorted them to the station and 
filed reports against them under article 152 of 
the Criminal Code. The defendant, Ms. H., 
was duly charged under article 152 of the 
Criminal Code of 1991, which provides that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. Any person in a public place who does an 
indecent act or conducts himself indecently or 
in a manner that offends public morals or 
wears clothing that is indecent or offensive to 
public morals, thereby causing a public 
annoyance, shall be liable to a penalty of up 
to 40 lashes and/or a fine. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;2. The act shall be deemed offensive to 
public morals if it is considered as such 
according to the religion of the perpetrator or 
the custom of the country in which the act 
occurs.&#8221; There is nothing new about article 
152 of the Criminal Code of 1991. Similar 
articles have been written into Sudanese 
legislation since the enactment of the first 
Criminal Code in 1899 and subsequent codes, 
derived from the Indian and the English 
criminal codes. This much can be inferred 
from Dr. Muhammad Muhi al-Din Awad&#8217;s 
Commentary on the Sudanese Criminal Code 
of 1974, in which he refers to article 234 of 
the Criminal Code of 1974, which provides 
that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any person who commits an indecent act or 
an act that is offensive to public morals, 
thereby causing annoyance to others, shall be 
liable to a penalty of imprisonment for up to 
one year and/or a fine.&#8221; (p. 454). 
</p>
<p>This article corresponds to article 218 of the 
previous code and to article 234 of the 
Criminal Code of 1925, which reads as 
follows:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever, to the annoyance of others, does </p>

<p>any obscene or indecent act in a public place 
shall be punished with imprisonment for a 
term which may extend to one year, or with a 
fine, or with both.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Similarly, article 294 of the Indian Criminal 
Code provides:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who to the annoyance of others [...] does 
any obscene act in any public place [...] shall 
be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to 
three months, or with a fine, or with both.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Moreover, article 152 of the Criminal Code of 
1991 is analogous to article 200 of the 
Criminal Code of Northern Nigeria, article 
104 of the Iraqi Criminal Code of 1969, 
article 350 of the Bahraini Criminal Code, 
article 231 (1) of the Nigerian Criminal Code, 
article 204 of the Somali Criminal Code and 
article 317 of the Qatari Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>In the light of the facts and information 
before it, the court deliberated on the 
elements of article 152 and asked the 
following question:  
</p>
<p>Was the defendant wearing indecent clothing 
in a public place that was offensive to public 
morals? 
</p>
<p>In order to answer that question, it is 
necessary to consider the meaning of the 
word &#8220;indecent&#8221;, the criterion for defining 
indecent clothing and the extent to which it is 
offensive to public morals. According to Abu 
al-Fadl Jamal al-Din&#8217;s Lisan al-`Arab, 
volume II, page 545, the meaning of the word 
fadih (indecent) is derived from the verb 
fadah (to disclose or expose) and the noun al-
fadihah (exposure). Fadihat al-subh (dawn 
light) is the white morning light; it has been 
said that fadha (indecency) is that which is </p>

</b></p>
<p><i>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</i></p>
<p>exposed to the light and to the eyes. 
</p>
<p>In Islamic terminology, al-fadih is an 
indecent material act, as defined in Al-
mu`jam al-wasit, volume II, page 692. 
</p>
<p>In English, the Arabic word fadih means 
&#8220;obscene&#8221;, or &#8220;indecent&#8221;. An act is 
considered obscene if it is repulsive, 
disgusting, improper or offensive to society 
and public morals.  
</p>
<p>The English courts have relied upon the 
criterion used by Lord Cockburn in his 
opinion on the case of Regina v. Hicklin. In 
it, he stated that an act was obscene if it 
would &#8220;deprave and corrupt those whose 
minds are open to such immoral influences&#8221;, 
in particular adolescent girls (see Jara&#8217;im al-
nashr al-sahafi (Press Publication Offences) 
by Dr. Ahmed Abd al-Majid). However, the 
present case is based on the criterion 
established by Islam, the religion embraced 
by the defendant and the majority of 
Sudanese society, that clothing which shows 
women&#8217;s physical charms, apart from the face 
and hands, is considered indecent in the sense 
intended by article 152 of the Criminal Code 
of 1991. As the Almighty God has said 
(Chapter XXIV of the Koran (The Light), 
verse 31): &#8220;And tell Muslim women that they 
should lower their gaze and guard their 
modesty, that they should not reveal their 
adornment except for that which is apparent 
and that they should draw their veils over 
their bosoms ...&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The divinely revealed religions all exhort 
women to be chaste and decent and forbid 
them to make a wanton WGEIDlay of 
themselves and flaunt their charms. 
</p>
<p>Based on these principles, it is clear from the 
evidence that the defendant was wearing </p>

<p>clothing that was indecent and offensive to 
public morals. Indeed, the complainant states 
on page 2 of the transcript that:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant was wearing tight trousers 
with a belt and a tight blouse; her head was 
bare, as she was not wearing a headscarf.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the first witness states on page 6 of 
the transcript that:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant was wearing a tight, revealing 
blouse and trousers through which her thighs 
and the outline of her underwear were visible. 
She was wearing beige underpants, which 
were clearly visible. The blouse had short 
sleeves that reached to the elbows; it was 
lightweight and transparent and everything 
showed through it, such as the straps and 
outline of her brassiere. The blouse, which 
had two vertical slits at the sides, was open 
and showed part of the defendant&#8217;s chest. 
There was an opening at the placket of the 
blouse, through which her navel and 
underwear were visible.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The statement of the second witness, on page 
12 of the transcript, mentions the same 
details:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant was wearing a short, 
transparent green blouse that showed her 
navel and brassiere; the sleeves came to just 
above the elbow. She also wore tight trousers. 
Her underwear was visible and her hair was 
uncovered.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Based on this evidence, the court concluded 
that the defendant was wearing indecent 
clothing that revealed her entire body and 
womanly charms and that her underwear was 
visible and her hair was uncovered as she sat 
in a nightclub in which there was singing and 
dancing and where men and women mingled. </p>

<p>The nightclub is a public place, according to 
Dr. Muhammad Muhi al-Din `Awad&#8217;s 
definition, namely, a public place is one such 
as a public road, a public square, a public 
shop or a public place of entertainment which 
is frequented by people of all kinds. 
</p>
<p>It is clear from the legal precedent established 
in the case of the Government of the Sudan v. 
Abd al-Rahman Ahmad et al. (Journal, 1981, 
p. 142) that annoyance of others means actual 
annoyance.  
</p>
<p>Consequently, the indecent act committed by 
the defendant in a public place constitutes 
actual annoyance of the complainant. 
</p>
<p>The defendant argued that as a United 
Nations employee she enjoyed diplomatic 
immunity from trial proceedings. The 
Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
indicated, in a letter from the Deputy Minister 
for Foreign Affairs dated 9 August 2009 (Ref. 
No. 13/13/14 (UNMIS)), that the defendant 
did not enjoy diplomatic immunity. The court 
therefore continued with the trial of the 
defendant, guided by the principle established 
in the case of Amadila Jilani v. Mustafa 
Hilmi (Journal of Judicial Decisions, 1983, p. 
159) that a statement by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs that a person does not enjoy 
diplomatic immunity is conclusive and 
incontestable evidence, as the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is the sole authority 
responsible for determining such matters. 
</p>
<p>The motion filed by the defence lawyer had 
no legal basis, as the trial was a summary 
proceeding and the grounds put forward in 
the motion were insubstantial and unfounded. 
The court therefore decided that the defendant 
had been in the nightclub, in which there had 
been singing and men and women dancing; </p>

<p>her head had been uncovered and she had 
been wearing a short-sleeved blouse that 
showed her chest, her body and her charms. 
Because her trousers were tight, they had also 
showed the colour and outline of her 
underwear. The court therefore found the 
defendant Ms. H guilty under article 152 of 
the Criminal Code of 1991. 
</p>
<p>In its final order, the court imposed the 
following sentence:  
</p>
<p>1. A fine of 500 Sudanese pounds or 
imprisonment for a term of one month as 
from 7 September 2009 for a violation of 
article 152 of the Criminal Code of 1991.

<p>Concerning Mr. Mustafa Ismail, lawyer, of 
Kurdish origin. Mr. Ismail writes frequently 
about the treatment of Kurds in the Syrian 
Arab Republic and Turkey for a number of 
foreign-based websites. 
</p>
<p>On 12 December 2009, Mr. Mustafa Ismail 
was arrested at the Air Force Security Branch 
in Aleppo, where he went following an order 
from the local security office in Ain Arab.  
</p>
<p>On 17 December 2009, members of his family 
went to the same Air Force Security Branch in 
Aleppo to look for him. However, they were 
told that Mr. Ismail was not there and were 
instead ordered to leave.  
</p>
<p>During the past few months, Mr. Ismail has 
been questioned several times by members of 
different security services such as by the 
Political Security Branch on 3 October, the 
Military Security Branch on 5 October and the 
State Security Branch on 7 and 8 November. 
During those sessions, questions had reportedly 
surrounded his work for the media, particularly 
phone interviews he had given to a European-

<p>By letter dated  29/06/2010, the Government 
indicated that  with regards to the information 
that you have received in respect of Mr. 
Mustafa Isma&#8217;il, we wish to clarify that Mr. 
isma&#8217;il is a Syrian citizen who enjoys his full 
rights as guaranteed by the Syrian 
Constitution and under Syrian law, all Syrian 
citizens are granted their rights to freedom 
and to engage in lawful activities; in return, 
they are sunject to Syrian Laws, which 
impose penalties on any person who commits 
an unlawful act. 
</p>
<p>In view of the above, and in view of the 
unlawful acts commited by Mr. Isma&#8217;il, 
which are punishable under the Syrian 
Criminal Code, he was arrested on 12 
december 2009 by the competent authorities 
for investigation. He was subsequently 
transferred to the Office of the Military 
Public Prosecutor in Aleppo, with the record 
of the investigation into his case case, where 
it was decided to institute public proceedings 
against him on the basis of the documents 
available and the investigation into two,

</p>
<p>On 11 December 2009, Mr. Ismail had posted 
an article on the website of Levant News citing 
the order to report to the Air Force Security 
Branch in Aleppo and pointing to the numerous 
times that he has been summoned for 
questioning to security offices since 2000. 
</p>
<p>So far, the authorities have not acknowledged 
that Mr. Ismail is in detention or provided any 
other explanation.  
</p>
<p>In light of Mr. Ismail&#8217;s prolonged 
incommunicado detention, concern is 
expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. 
</p>
<p>1. Engaging in acts that would harm 
Syrian relations with a foreign State, under 
article 278 of the General Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p>2. Membership of a prohibited political 
party, under article 167 of the General 
Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>The case for prosecution and the preliminary 
investigation file were presented to the 
military investigating officer in Aleppo, who 
conducted a judicial investigation into Mr. 
Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s case and, consequently, decided to 
remand him in custody for the two offences 
that he is alleged to have committed. The case 
remains under consideration. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the assertion in your letter that 
Mr. Isma&#8217;il was held incommunicado and the 
concern that you expressed for his physical 
and psychological health, we wish to reiterate 
our hope that you take into consideration that 
most of the sources upon which you rely for 
information in respect of the Syrian Arab 
republic provide you with false information 
and incorrect facts, and that you attend to 
those sources accordingly. Mr. Isma&#8217;il was 
not held incommunicado but was treated as 
other prisoners in the Syrian Arab republic 
are treated in accordance with all the 
international standards for the treatment of 
prisoners. We also wish to reassure you with 
regard to Mr. Isma&#8217;il&#8217;s physical and 
psychological health that he receives the same 
medical care in prison as he would if he were 
not in prison. In prisons,  fulltime physiciams 
attend to the health of prisoner and provide 
them with health care and psychological care; 
any prisoner with a health condition n treated 
immediately. In this regard, we hope that you 
will notz hesistate to notify us should you 
receive information that any harm has been 
done so that thise responsible can be held to </p>

<p>Lastly, we wish to emphasise that mr. Isma&#8217;il 
is a Syrian citizen and is protected by the 
Syrian Constiotution and Syrian laws. He is 
subject to the judicial procedures set out in 
Syrian crimninal law, which is consistaent 
with al international conventions, charters and 
standards and with common practice of most 
countries of the world. We wish to underscore 
that should an investgating Judge find during 
the investigation that there is sufficient 
evidence to chage him and bring him to trial 
before the criminal court, then Mr. isma&#8217;il 
will be subjetce to a fair trial before  a fair 
and impartial court. In addition , we wish to

cooperation with you and to replying to all

he was detained in a room without food or 
drink and in which a number of torture tools 
were WGEIDlayed. There, he was reportedly 
subject to an inquiry by high ranking officers 
of the General Intelligence, who questioned 
him extensively on an interview he gave to 
Barada TV on 12 October 2009 and articles he 
had written regarding his client Mr. Muhannad 
Al-Hassani, as well as other human rights work

<p>By a letter dated 01/04/2010, the Government

Maleh was arrested by the competent 
authorities for committing unlawful acts 
which are punishable under the Syrian 
General Criminal Code. His arrest had 
nothing to do with his defending Muhannad 
Al-Hassani. According to the Syrian Code of 
Criminal Procedures, the courts may not 
pursue criminal proceedings against any

was transferred to a branch of the Military 
Police in Qaboun, Damascus. On 3 November 
2009, the Military General Prosecutor charged 
him with Articles 374 and 377 of the Criminal 
Law (Contempt of the Head of State&#8221;), Article 
285 of the Criminal Law (Contempt of Public 
Administration), and Article 286 of the 
Criminal Law (Crime of disseminating false 
information affecting the morale of the nation). 
The military prosecution subsequently retained 
the charge under Article 286 of the Criminal 
Law, for which Mr. al Maleh remains in 
detention. According to the information 
received, his trial before the Military Court of 
Damascus is ongoing.  
</p>
<p>Since 21 October 2009, Mr. al Maleh has been 
detained in Adra prison, Damascus. 
Information received suggests that in the first 
few weeks of his detention and again since 11 
February 2010, Mr. al Maleh, who suffers from 
diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland, has 
been refused his medication as prescribed by 
his doctors, causing a serious deterioration of 
his state of health. Reports received suggest 
that during his hearing before the military 
judge on 22 February 2010, Mr. al Maleh was 
so weak that he could hardly speak. In 
addition, he had fainted during hearings earlier 
in February.  
</p>
<p>Mr. al Maleh is detained in a cell with 
approximately 60 people. The cell does not 
contain any beds, simply mattresses on the 
floor, which are shared by several detainees. 
Water in the prison is often cut off, meaning 
the detainees cannot wash for long periods and 
have to use the toilet without any water &#8211; 
leading to serious health risks.  
</p>
<p>have received from your sources. Mr. Al-
Hassani has a number of lawyers acting as his 
legal representatives and defence team. None 
of these persons has been arrested for 
defending Mr. Al-Hassani. The Government 
of the Syrian Arab Republic fully respects the 
legal practice of defending accused persons in 
court and regards the legal profession as one 
of the noblest of all the human professions. In 
this connection, we should like to reiterate 
our views about the sources on which you 
rely for information on issues relating to our 
cooperation with you. Most of these sources 
have no other aim than to damage the good 
name of the Syrian Arab Republic by 
submitting false information and making 
unfounded allegations about us. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Haithem Al-Maleh was arrested for 
committing offences which are punishable 
under the Syrian General Criminal Code, 
namely, incitement and terrorization of others 
by disseminating false information in the 
Syrian Arab Republic and abroad with the 
aim of damaging the reputation of the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic vis-
&#224;-vis Syrian citizens and international 
organizations, undermining national unity in 
Syrian society and stirring up citizens against 
one another and against their Government. He 
was arrested and brought before the 
competent judicial body, namely, the Office 
of the Military Prosecutor in Damascus, 
which investigated the case. The Office 
discovered that, while committing these 
offences, Mr. Al-Maleh had also defamed the 
Syrian judiciary. Therefore, it filed 
proceedings against him for the following 
offences: 
</p>
<p>(a) Defaming the judiciary, which is 
punishable under article 376 of the General </p>

</p>
<p>(b) Disseminating false information likely to 
weaken national sentiment, which is an 
offence under article 286, referring to article 
285 of the General Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p>(c) Disseminating abroad false information 
likely to damage the prestige of the State, 
which is an offence under article 287 of the 
General Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>The case file was then sent to the chief 
military investigating judge in Damascus, 
who interviewed Mr. Al-Maleh about the 
allegations and confronted him with the 
evidence submitted by the Office of the 
Prosecutor. After the interview was 
completed, the investigating judge issued a 
decision, on 1 November 2009, formally 
charging Haithem Al-Maleh with 
disseminating false information likely to 
weaken national sentiment, which is an 
offence under article 286, referring to article 
285 of the General Criminal Code, defaming 
the judiciary, which is an offence under 
article 376 of the General Criminal Code, and 
disseminating abroad false information likely 
to damage the prestige of the State, which is 
an offence under article 287 of the General 
Criminal Code. The investigating judge&#8217;s 
decision was open to appeal at cassation. 
Indeed, Mr. Al-Maleh did appeal the decision 
through his defence lawyers. The appeal was 
lodged with the criminal division of the 
Syrian Court of Cassation, which is the 
highest court in the Syrian Arab Republic and 
has the final say as to whether this person 
should be tried by a criminal court or 
proceedings should be discontinued and he 
should be released.

<p>information in your letter that he suffers from 
diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland and 
is therefore in need of appropriate medical 
treatment and medicine, we should like to 
provide you with a categorical assurance that 
Mr. Al-Maleh is receiving appropriate 
medical treatment and care in prison at the 
hands of the prison doctor. In addition, should 
he, or any other prisoner in a Syrian prison, 
require the assistance of a medical specialist, 
the competent prison administration 
responsible for protecting prisoners&#8217; welfare 
will make sure that he is given a physical 
examination and is taken care of by medical 
specialists in the Syrian Arab Republic. In 
this regard, we should like to assure you that, 
in keeping with our values and our cultural 
and human heritage, we are required to 
provide prisoners with full humanitarian and 
health care, irrespective of the obligations set 
out in the relevant international treaties which 
the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
applies and by which it is bound. We view 
any failing in this regard not only as an 
infringement of international law and human 
rights but also a breach of values and morals. 
We hope that you will always inform us of 
any allegation that you receive about any 
failing in this regard so that we may hold 
those responsible to account, if proven guilty. 
</p>
<p>As for the information in the letter about Mr. 
Al-Maleh&#8217;s right to freedom of expression 
under international instruments, the 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
assures you that, just like other citizens, Mr. 
Al-Maleh exercises his full rights as a 
member of Syrian society, including his right 
to freedom of expression and opinion. We in 
the Syrian Arab Republic are fully committed 
to protecting this right, which is explicitly 
safeguarded under the Syrian Constitution. </p>

<p>However, any citizen who steps over the 
internationally recognized limits on the right 
to freedom of expression by inciting others, 
stirring up fear, undermining national unity 
and the prestige of the State and defaming the 
judiciary shall be deemed to have committed 
a criminal act which is punishable under 
Syrian law and must be prosecuted by the 
courts. 
</p>
<p>With regard to guaranteeing a fair trial before 
an impartial court, we must draw your 
attention to the fact that the laws of the Syrian 
Arab Republic are in conformity with all 
international treaties and norms and are 
entirely in line with the laws in effect in most 
countries of the world. We can also assure 
you that we have a firmly established 
judiciary and judges who are impartial, enjoy 
complete immunity and have full authority in 
the exercise of their functions. Any person 
who infringes the law is subject to the 
authority conferred on the courts by the 
Constitution and the law, which regulate all 
decisions, procedures and judgements of the 
courts with a view to protecting Syrian 
society and safeguarding human rights.

Damascus, who has been reportedly arrested 
and held incommunicado by the Syrian 
Political Security Services.   
</p>
<p>On 18 October 2009, Ms. Ayat ESSAM 
AHMED was arrested after having been 
summoned by the Syrian political security 
services to the building of the Al-Fayhaa unit

<p>On 22 January 2010, the family of Ms. Ayat 
ESSAM AHMED was able, for the first time 
since her arrest, to obtain information on her 
whereabouts from someone who had allegedly 
been detained at the same time as her in the 
building of the Al-Fayhaa unit of the Syrian 
Political Security Services.  According to this 
information, Ms. Ayat ESSAM AHMED has 
suffered severe physical and psychological 
torture, including being attached to an 
automobile tire and beaten (method known as 
dullab) and being attached from hands and feet, 
suspended in the air and beaten with wires all 
over her body (method known as wind carpet 
or bessat reeh).  According to the information 
obtained by the family, Ms. Ayat ESSAM 
AHMED presented numerous wounds and 
scars in her head and face and she had to be 
transferred to the hospital in Ibn Nafees on 
several occasions. 
</p>
<p>The family of Ms. Ayat ESSAM AHMED was 
also able to find out that shortly after her arrest 
she had been transferred to the prison of Al-
Mezze, where she was held for a month, before 
being transferred again to the building of the 
Al-Fayhaa unit. Later on, the family of Ms. 
Ayat ESSAM AHMED could learn from 
another co-detainee that, during the first week 
of May 2010, she had been transferred to a 
detention centre in Damascus named &#8220;Far&#8217;a

<p>Mr. Al-Kubaisi, aged 33, was arrested on 27 
May 2010 in Al-Hamidiyeh Souk in Damascus 
by the criminal security services - Damascus 
branch. He was taken to an unknown location. 
Members of his family inquired from the 
criminal security services of his whereabouts 
and the charges against him, but they refused to 
comment on the situation. On 31 May 2010, 
agents from the criminal security services 
informed the family of Mr. Al-Kubaisi that he 
was unwell. On 1 June 2010, the family of Mr. 
Al-Kubaisi was informed that &#8220;he has fallen on 
the floor and was transferred to Al-Mojathed 
hospital but it was too late&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>When the members of his family went to the 
hospital, they noted that Mr. Al-Kubaisi had 
been tortured. People who were arrested 
together with the deceased reported that he had 
been beaten on his chest and head by five 
members of the criminal security services. Mr. 
Al-Kubaisi&#8217;s family lodged a complaint with 
the Prosecutor general in Damascus, who 
ordered an investigation and an autopsy to

gone to the criminal security services -Aleppo 
branch in the Al-Ashrafiya region- to provide 
documents for the release of his son who was 
in custody on allegations of evading 
compulsory military services. Mr. Sha&#8217;bouk 
was brutally beaten and suffered a heart attack. 
Hours later he was taken to the hospital and he 
died the same day. Reportedly a member of the 
criminal security forces attempted to pressure 
the family of the deceased into signing a 
document attesting that he was healthy when 
he was presented to the criminal security

a lawyer and member of the board of trustees 
of the Committees for the Defence of 
Democracy Freedoms and Human Rights in 
Syria (CDDFHRS), and has written numerous 
articles concerning the situation of human 
rights in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>On 23 August 2010, Mr. Abdi was arrested by 
members of the Amn al Dawla (State Security 
Forces) in Aleppo Airport, Syrian Arab 
Republic, as he attempted to return from the 
Syrian Arab Republic to his residence in 
Germany, along with his wife and three of his 
children. Since his arrest, Mr. Abdi's family 
and colleagues have received no information 
regarding neither his location nor his fate. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that while in the airport, Mr. Abdi 
was taken aside by members of the Amn al 
Dawla for a security check, before being taken 
away by the security agents without being able 
to communicate further with his family.  
</p>
<p>By letter dated 1/12/2010, The Government 
of the Syrian Arab Republic indicated that in 
respect of Mr. Isma`il Abdi, a lawyer, we 
hereby inform you that Mr. Abdi was 
lawfully arrested on 23 August 2010 for 
publishing inflammatory articles that seek to 
undermine respect for the State, national 
sentiment and national unity, for bringing the 
country into disrepute abroad, for attacking 
the system of Government in Syria and for 
communicating with Al-Mustaqillah and Al 
Jazeera satellite channels and making 
statements on the so-called persecution of the 
Kurds in the Syrian Arab Republic that would 
encourage the spread of sectarianism. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdi was duly transferred to the Syrian 
courts, where the required legal action will be 
taken against him by means of an impartial 
and fair trial </p>

Mr. Abdi would be taken, Mr. Abdi's family 
members were reportedly informed by a 
member of the Amn al Dawla that he would 
probably be taken to the State Security 
headquarters in Qamishli. However, when 
asked, officials at said headquarters denied 
holding anyone by the name of Ismail Abdi. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdi's family has expressed concern that 
the arrest and alleged disappearance are related 
to his work on CDDFHRS' publication, in 
February 2010, of a list of some 600 names of 
individuals who had allegedly been tortured 
and killed in Syrian prisons between 2008 and 
</p><p>2010.

peaceful and legitimate activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular with respect to the 
aforementioned publication.  Furthermore, 
mindful of the fact that the location of Mr.

fairness of Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s trial before a

no military status, and the crime of which he 
was found guilty was not of a military nature. 
Furthermore, the Code of Military Procedures, 
in accordance with which Mr. Al-Maleh was 
sentenced, allegedly fails to offer many of the 
fair trial guarantees stipulated in the

Rights and the Syrian Code of Criminal 
Procedures.

<p>Given Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s age, state of health and

is also expressed that the rejection of the

December 2009; and a Joint Urgent Appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers dated 6 July 2010. In these 
communications concern was raised that the 
disbarment, charges, trial and sentencing of 
Mr. Al-Hassani were related to his peaceful 
and legitimate activities in defence of human 
rights, including as a lawyer. The response of 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government to the 
communication dated 10 December 2009, was 
received on 29 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>On 28 October 2010, Mr. Muhannad Al-
Hassani, who reportedly shares a cell with at 
least 30 convicted criminals, was attacked and 
severely beaten by a cell-mate, whose name is 
known to us. The attack reportedly caused a 
wound in his forehead which required ten 
stitches, as well as swelling of his left eye and 
cheek. The alleged attacker is reported to be 
serving a prison sentence for rape, armed 
robbery and forming a criminal gang. As he 
assaulted Mr. Al-Hassani, the perpetrator 
allegedly accused him of being an agent for a 
foreign entity and not being a Syrian 
nationalist.  
</p>
<p>It is reported that the prison authorities 
subsequently launched an investigation into the 
assault. However, it is alleged that in the 
process of the said investigation, comments 
made by the alleged attacker before the </p>

to kill Mr. Al-Hassani were not recorded in the 
charge sheet. It is further alleged that despite 
making a request to transfer the alleged 
perpetrator to another cell, Mr. Al-Hassani 
remains imprisoned in the same cell along with 
his attacker. 
</p>
<p>On 29 October 2010, the day following the 
attack, the Penal Chamber at the Court of 
Cassation reportedly rejected Mr. Al-Hassani&#8217;s 
appeal, confirming the three-year sentence 
passed by the Second Damascus Criminal 
Court on 23 June 2010, and leaving Mr. Al-
Hassani with no further legal recourse within 
the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>Given the serious risk that Mr. Al-Hassani may 
be subjected to further attacks, grave concern is 
expressed for his life, and physical and 
psychological integrity. Further concern is 
expressed that both the attack against Mr. Al-
Hassani and subsequent rejection of his appeal 
before the Court of Cassation may be related to 
his legitimate and peaceful activities in defence 
of human rights, particularly as a lawyer.

<p>one occasion, Mr. Al Naqari had forced Ms. Al 
Saleh to sleep with his debtor in order to defray 
a debt he owed them. It is also alleged that Mr. 
Al Naqari would humiliate her by stripping her 
naked and ordering her to get things for him by 
carrying them in her mouth. On another 
occasion Mr. Al Naqari brought another 
woman home and, when Ms. Al Saleh 
disapproved of this, he slapped her and ordered 
her to crawl around the house in front of the 
other woman. It is also reported that Mr. Al 
Naqari raped and frequently beat her, with 
various items including a knife, which resulted 
in a tear in her mouth, a broken rib and broken 
shoulder.  
</p>
<p>During interrogation it is alleged that she 
confessed to the charge that she had acted as an 
accomplice to her husband&#8217;s killing even 
though she subsequently denied the charge 
during trial. In any case, the court did not 
examine the circumstances of the offense,

<p>Malih, Mr. Hasan Abd al-'Azim and Mr. 
Radif Mustafa. The hearing was held 
pursuant to the Chairman of the Bar's 
decision to initiate disciplinary action against 
Mr. Al-Hasani and transfer him to the 
Disciplinary Committee of the Damascus 
Branch of the Bar Association. Annexed to 
that decision were 17 statements published on 
the Internet and attributed to the &quot;Syrian 
Organization for Human Rights&quot;, an 
organization of which Mr. Al-Hasani presided 
without having obtained the necessary legal 
authorizations, in violation of Act No. 39 
regulating the legal profession and its rules of 
procedure. The said Act prohibits any lawyer 
from founding an association or forum 
without having first notified his branch of the 
Bar Association and obtained formal 
authorization from the competent authorities. 
Mr. Al-Hasani was invited to appear before 
the lawyer assigned to investigate his case, 
but failed to attend. We wish to underscore 
that the Disciplinary Committee initiated 
purely disciplinary action against Mr. Al-
Hasani, not criminal proceedings. The above 
confirms that the alleged information 
contained in the case file is inaccurate. A 
formal complaint was brought against Mr. Al-
Hasani not because he was monitoring open 
trials and documenting trial proceedings 
without being mandated to do so or without 
being involved in those trials; that is a matter 
for the courts, not the Bar Association. It was 
decided, in the presence of his lawyers, to 
disbar Mr. Al-Hasani for professional 
misconduct in accordance with the Bar 
Association Regulatory Act, which is broadly 
consistent with international norms and 
standards having been drafted by leading 
Syrian lawyers in line with the legislation 
regulating the legal profession in most </p>

Committee, which is established in 
accordance with that Act, cannot therefore be 
subject to any political or personal 
considerations. In the course of its history, the 
Bar Association has taken numerous 
decisions to disbar lawyers for professional 
misconduct under the Bar Association 
Regulatory Act. It should be noted that if it is 
ascertained that Mr. Al-Hasani has been in 
any way wronged, he is fully entitled to 
appeal to the Committee, which serves as a 
supreme court and would certainly redress 
any injustice.

Mr. Botakuziev had been hiding in Kyrgyzstan

by the authorities of organizing the protest in 
Nookat, Kyrgyzstan, on 1 October 2008, and 
wanted him on criminal charges. Mr.

that Mr. Bokatuziev is allegedly detained by 
the State Committee on National Security of 
the Republic of Tajikistan and is under threat 
of being extradited to the Kyrgyz Republic. On 
13 March 2010, the Director of an NGO was 
informed that Mr. Bokatuziev was being held 
in a detention facility on Molodaya Gvardia 
street in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

<p>Mr. Botakuziev has allegedly suffered repeated 
beatings while in detention and his state of

<p>On 17 March, Mr. Bokatuziev&#8217;s lawyer 
attempted to get access to him but was refused 
to see his client.

<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Nematillo Botakuziev may be 
related to his legitimate activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular his denunciation of 
the repression of the Nookat demonstration by 
Kyrgyz security forces. Further serious concern 
is expressed regarding the physical and

<p>The lawyer was told to request permission

Information received further suggests that the 
extradition papers are being prepared by the

to the Kyrgyz Republic prior to 1 April 2010. 
In addition, Mr. Botakuziev was already 
questioned with the participation of Kyrgyz 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>If returned to the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. 
Botakuziev faces a serious risk of being ill-
treated and not to be afforded a fair trial. He 
has been accused by the Kyrgyz authorities of 
organizing the protest in Nookat, Kyrgyz 
Republic, on 1 October 2008, and is therefore 
wanted on criminal charges. At the trial of 32 
persons allegedly involved in the events at 
Nookat, several testified that they had been 
tortured and ill-treated (see urgent appeal of 11 
December 2009 by the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment). However, the court neither 
ordered an investigation of the allegations nor 
dismissed the evidence defendants said had 
been obtained under torture. In May 2009, the 
Kyrgyz Republic&#8217;s Supreme Court reviewed 
the case and upheld the verdicts. It did not 
investigate the defendants&#8217; torture allegations.

</p>
<p>realistic and durable solution to this long-
standing issue. Recent developments on the 
part of the Lao Government seem to confirm 
that Laos is determined to uphold the 
assurances it has made. We therefore believe 
that we have put in place a process that 
should benefit all sides concerned, by 
enabling the Laotian Hmong returnees to 
regain their normal livelihood while keeping 
the door open for possible resettlement in 
third countries. 
</p>
<p>In concluding, I wish to assure you that our 
effort to resolve the situation surrounding the 
Laotian Hmongs will take into account the 
best interest of all concerned. Thailand stands 
ready to continue to engage and cooperate 
with you on this very important matter. &#8230; 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;]Preliminary Clarification on the return of 
the Loatian Hmong from Thailand to the Lao 
People&#8217;s Democratic Republic on 28 
December 2009 
</p>
<p>- Over the years, Thailand has worked closely 
with the international community to provide 
resettlement opportunities for the Laotian 
Hmongs in Thailand. However, after the last 
large scale resettlement of the Laotian 
Hmongs from Tam Krabok in 2003, there 
was a general recognition that the situation in 
the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had 
changed significantly taking into account 
Laos&#8217; accession to several core UN 
Conventions on human rights and the 
ratification of the ASEAN Charter. Therefore, 
resettlement opportunities for large groups of 
Laotian Hmongs from Thailand were no 
longer available. 
</p>
<p>- Since then, however, there were still 
continued influxes of Laotian Hmongs into 
Thailand. It should be stressed that such </p>

<p>persons had entered Thailand illegally in 
search of economic opportunities or with the 
hope of being able to further their livelihoods 
in third countries. It was therefore imperative 
for Thailand to find a long term solution to 
this problem based on Thai law while at the 
same time upholding humanitarian principles. 
</p>
<p>- In spite of the irregular status of the Laotian 
Hmongs under Thai law, Thailand has done 
its utmost to provide basic needs and care for 
such persons based on humanitarian grounds. 
</p>
<p>- Since 2007, Thailand has provided shelter 
for the Laotian Hmongs at Huay Nam Khao 
in Petchaboon Province, and has cooperated 
with international organizations and nov-
Governmental organizations to conduct 
humanitarian activities in the temporary 
shelter. 
- Due to the large number of this group of 
persons and the fact that third countries no 
longer have any resettlement plans for a large 
group as previously was the case with those 
at Tam Krabok, Thailand has been obliged to 
seek cooperation from the Government of the 
Lao PDR to jointly find a solution to this 
issue. Ultimately, both sides agreed on the 
return of the Laotian Hmongs by the end of 
2009 under the Thai-Lao bilateral framework, 
with the Sub-General Border Committee as 
the main mechanism. 
</p>
<p>- It should be noted that during the course of 
2008 and 2009, the Thai authorities have 
facilitated 19 returns of over 3,200 Laotian 
Hmongs who expressed their whish to return 
to the Lao PDR. To date, there has been no 
report of any difficulties or persecution faced 
by such returnees, which is confirmed by 
various international organizations and 
diplomatic missions in Vientiane. 
Furthermore, the Laotian authority has </p>

<p>invited representatives of the international 
organizations and diplomatic missions to visit 
the Laotian Hmong returnees several times. 
</p>
<p>- On 28 December 2009, the Thai authorities 
oversaw the return of 4,350 Laotian Hmongs 
at Huay Nam Khao in Petchaboon Province 
and 158 Laotian Hmongs in the IDC in Nong 
Khai Province to Lao PDR in a safe and 
orderly manner, in accordance with the Thai 
Immigration Act and with due regard to 
human rights and humanitarian principles. 
The returnees were provided with adequate 
food and medical services throughout the 
return process. Special considerations were 
given to the needs of women and children. 
The Thai Government also took great care to 
uphold the principle of family unity for all 
those concerned. 
</p>
<p>- The return followed assurances given by the 
Government of the Lao PDR to the Thai 
Government at all levels, from the leadership 
to the working level, that legal proceedings 
will not be undertaken against returning 
Laotian Hmongs and requests for onward 
travel by them will be facilitated. Moreover, 
third countries wishing to resettle some 
Laotian Hmong returnees would be able 
directly discuss details with the Government 
of the Lao PDR. 
</p>
<p>- The Government of the Lao PDR has also 
given assurances that it will facilitate those 
Laotian Hmongs wishing to return to their 
home communities with transportation and 
initial financial assistance, while housing and 
other assistance will be provided to those 
wishing to move to a development village.

<p>Courts of First Instance are immediately 
shackled, despite the fact that the Corrections 
Department Act of 1936 only refers to the 
temporary use of shackles, on an individual 
basis, and in exceptional circumstances. 
Different sized chains are used to the shackles 
to the prisoners&#8217; waists, ranging from five to 20 
kilograms. The shackles prevent proper 
exercise for the prisoners, and the friction 
caused by the metal rings can cause lesions that 
are prone to become infected. It is reported that 
there are 868 prisoners awaiting execution, and 
the great majority remain shackled.  
</p>
<p>On 2 March 2005, Mr. Malcolm Denis Lim, a 
Malaysian citizen, was taken to Klong Prem 
Central Prison, after being sentenced to death 
on a charge of possession of drugs for sale. His 
case is currently before the Appeals Court. 
Upon arrival in prison, he was shackled with 
approximately 10 kilogram chains, allegedly 
due to the possibility that he would attempt to 
escape. Nevertheless, he was detained in 
Building 2, which was specially constructed for 
persons sentenced to death, and from where it 
was not possible to escape.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Lim filed a complaint against the 
Corrections Department, protesting the 
illegality of the use of shackles on him. On 25 
July 2007, the Administrative Court ordered 
that the shackles of the plaintiff be removed 
while the Court deliberated its decision. The 
shackles were subsequently removed, but the 
prisoner was no longer allowed to go to the 
yard with other prisoners, in response to a 
request by the Corrections Department that the 
shackles were necessary to prevent his escape. 
The prisoner was later transferred to Bang 
Kwang maximum security prison, where he 
was once again shackled, despite his 
complaints regarding the Court&#8217;s order. 
</p>
<p>concerned authorities in Thailand for further 
examination. 
</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to 
reaffirm Thailand&#8217;s commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights in 
accordance with our international obligations. 
With regard to the use of shackles on death 
row prisoners, your are correct in noting that 
Thai law (Corrections Department Act of 
1936) does permit the use of shackling, but in 
very exceptional instances, such as to prevent 
harm or escape. Therefore, it must be 
determined under what circumstances the 
shackles were used. 
</p>
<p>By another letter dated  23/07/2010, The 
Government responded to the allegation letter 
of 17/02/2010: 
</p>
<p>On 2 March 2005, Mr. Malcolm Dennis Li, a 
Malaysian citizen, was taken to Klong Prem 
Central Prison, after being sentenced to death 
on a charge of possession of drugs for sale. 
His case is currently before the Court of 
Appeal. Upon arrival at prison, he was 
shackled with approximately 10 kg chains 
allegedly due to the possibility that he would 
attempt to escape. Mr. Lim them filed a 
complaint against Department of Corrections 
to have his shackles removed, which the 
Administrative Court ordered that his 
shackles be removed on 16 September 2009. 
However, when Mr. Lim was moved to 
another prison, he was put on shackles again 
while de Department of Corrections appealed 
the decision of the Administrative Court. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is seeking clarification regarding 
the circumstances of Mr. Lim. </p>

</i></p>
<p>On 16 September 2009, the Court emitted its 
final decision, stating that the shackling of the 
prisoner was illegal and ordered the 
Corrections Department to remove the shackles 
within 30 days. The Corrections Department 
appealed the decision, noting that there were 
problems with the level of security; that other 
prisoners would make the same plea as the 
plaintiff if his shackles were removed, and that 
the international standards referred to in the 
judgment of the Administrative Court had not 
been integrated in Thai domestic legislation, 
and were therefore not binding on the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>Clarification 
</p>
<p>Thailand Corrections Department Act of 1936 
article 14 stipulates that the use of shackles 
on prisoners is permitted on 5 conditions, 
namely: 
</p>
<p>1. That the prisoner is likely to cause harm to 
himself or others; 
</p>
<p>2. That the prisoner is mentally ill or unstable 
that might cause harm to others; 
</p>
<p>3. That the prisoner is likely to escape; 
</p>
<p>4. Under the warden&#8217;s discretion when 
transferred outside of prison; or 
</p>
<p>5. Under the Minister of Justice&#8217;s order 
according to prison&#8217;s conditions or local 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mr. Malcolm Dennis Lim, while in 
detention at the Special Central Prison, was 
charged with the disciplinary offense of 
possessing a type 2 drug. This behaviour 
showed the propensity to re-offend, disobey 
of prison rules, and possibly attempt escape. 
Mr. Lim has since 2 March 2006 been 
detained in Klong Prem prison, whose 
regulations states that for security reasons, all 
prisoners sentenced to death must wear 
shackles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; While Building 2 of Klong Prem prison is 
specially designed for the confinement of 
prisoners with serious crimes, problems with 
security of the facility still exist both in terms 
of physical condition and the ratio of wardens 
to prisoners. The number of persons detained 
there es 787 (as of 17 August 2009). From 
08.30 to 16.30 hours there is one warden per 
41 prisoners. If wardens are called to other 
duties such as accompanying prisoners to 
hospitals, meeting with lawyers or embassy </p>

<p><i>Para Country Date Type Mandate Allegations transmitted Government response 
</i></p>
<p>representatives, the ratio will be greater. Form 
16.30 to 8.30 hours, the ratio is further 
increased to one warden per 196 prisoners. 
By UN standards the ratio of warders should 
be 1per only 5 prisoners. Therefore, thus 
circumstances call for these of shackles 
permitted in Section 14(1) and  14 (39 of the 
Corrections Department Act. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, if shackles are removed for one 
prisoner, others will make the same request, 
causing great difficulties for the work of the 
Department of Corrections and prison 
wardens. If other prisoners are released form 
shackles, they can join together in causing 
trouble, join in protest, attack wardens, and 
cause damage to prison property, as is 
regularly reported. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Department of Corrections has always 
administered the use of shackles with extreme 
care and reserves their use only in those cases 
that are deemed necessary. In accordance 
with the Standard Minimum rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, the International 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment to which Thailand is a party, the 
Department of Corrections has enacted the 11 
rules since 2004 as standard for the use of 
shackles. The rules state the use of shackles 
as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. All use of shackles must comply with law 
and regulations of Thailand such as the 
Corrections Department Act and other 
decrees; 
</p>
<p>2. All use of shackles must be administered 
with utmost deliberation and adequate 
grounds for use, in accordance with human 
rights and with respect to human dignity; 
</p>
<p>3. Under no circumstances can shackles be </p>

<p>used as punishment for prisoner; 
</p>
<p>4. For transfer of prisoners, appropriate size 
of shackles can be ordered in conjunction 
with the physical limitations of places to 
which the prisoners are transferred to as well 
as the prisoners&#8217; behaviour; 
</p>
<p>5. The smallest size of shackles must be 
considered first in case there is a need for use, 
except in certain circumstance such as felony 
offenders or suspicion that the prisoner may 
cause harm to himself or other, 
</p>
<p>6. Shackles cannot be used for female 
prisoner or male prisoner over 60 years of 
age, except when prisoner is violent or 
mentally ill that might cause harm to others; 
</p>
<p>7. Physical limitations of prisons and the 
ration warden per prisoners must be carefully 
considered before administering the use of 
shackles; 
</p>
<p>8. Shackles must be checked and repaired at 
least once a year; and 
</p>
<p>9. Always bear in mind that the use of 
shackles by law is only to prevent escape or 
harm against oneself or the others. The 
appropriate use of shackles must always 
prevail; 
</p>
<p>10. All prisons must keep a record of the use 
of shackles and their rationale for every 
prisoner; and 
</p>
<p>11. The continued use of shackles must be 
reviewed every 15 days. 
</p>
<p>At present, Mr. Lim&#8217;s criminal case awaits 
deliberation of the Court of Appeal, while the 
case about his shackles awaits deliberation of 
the Supreme Administrative Court. </p>

<p>Concerning the death in custody of Mr. 
Sulaiman Naesa.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Sulaiman Naesa, aged 25, was arrested on 
22 May 2010 on security-related charges. He 
was taken to Ingkhayuth army base in Pattani, 
where he was visited by his family on 23, 24, 
25 and 26 May. On 27 and 28 May, the family 
of Mr. Naesa was not allowed to see him. On 
29 May, Mr. Naesa looked tired, walked 
slowly and unevenly, and told his family that 
&#8220;it was too hard and he could not bear it&#8221;. On 
that day, his family was neither allowed to talk 
closely with him nor touch him.  
</p>
<p>On 30 May 2010, the authorities informed Mr. 
Naesa&#8217;s family that he had been found dead in 
his cell. According to the prison officers, he 
hanged himself with a towel tied to the 
window, while his feet touched the floor and 
his knees were bent. When the autopsy was 
carried out, the doctor found a wound on the 
left side of his neck, wounds on his face and 
forehead, two fresh small wounds on his lower 
back, small wounds on the testicles and blood 
around the genitals. When inquiries were made 
into the wounds, the authorities indicated that 
they were insect bites. Later that day, a second, 
unofficial autopsy was carried out by a doctor 
from Yuparaj Saibur Hospital. He also found 
bleeding spots, particularly on the lower back 
and genitals, possibly due to electric shock. 
The small holes on the back were believed to 
be from stabbing with a sharp object. His neck 
was broken and his teeth were loose. Another 
detainee who was arrested on the same day as 
Mr. Naesa informed his family that Mr. Naesa 
had been suffocated with a black bag. 
However, he did not provide additional 
information due to fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 12/01/2011, the Government 
indicated that the case is currently under the 
judicial process where the Court of Pattani 
Province is required to conduct a legal 
inquiry into the cause and circumstances of 
Mr. Naesa&#8217;s death. Mr. Naesa&#8217;s parent has 
also lodged an appeal for justice with the 
National Human Rights Commission 
(NHRC). The result of this inquiry has not yet 
been released. Nevertheless, preliminary 
remedies have been provided to Mr. Naesa&#8217;s 
family by the Internal Security Operations 
Command. 
</p>
<p>In this light, I wish to reaffirm Thailand&#8217;s 
commitment to upholding basic human rights 
in accordance with the Thai Constitution and 
the country&#8217;s obligations under international 
human rights instruments to which it is a 
party. The Thai Government and the security 
forces are acutely aware that any 
mistreatment and abuse of people will defeat 
the main policy objectives to build trust and 
confidence with the local Muslim population 
in Thailand&#8217;s Southern Border Provinces 
(SBPs). Strict orders have therefore been 
issued to all ranks to uphold the law and 
always treat the people, whether they are 
suspected perpetrators of violence or 
otherwise, with dignity and justice.

<p>verification (&#8220;NV&#8221;) process and the Prime 
Minister&#8217;s order of 2 June 2010 (No.125/1223) 
on the human rights of migrants in the country. 
</p>
<p>We would like to inform your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government that we continue to receive 
increasing reports on the negative impact of the 
NV process on the human rights of migrants in 
Thailand. Further, we have also received 
information concerning arbitrary arrest of 
migrants accompanied by excessive use of 
force by law enforcement authorities, poor 
conditions of detention, and mass deportation 
of migrants. We are particularly concerned 
about reports indicating that migrants from 
Myanmar may be especially vulnerable to 
serious violations of human rights if returned to 
their country of origin.  
</p>
<p>There are approximately 300,000 reported 
migrant workers who failed to enter the NV 
process by the extended deadline of 31 March 
2010 and an estimated 1 million unregistered 
migrant workers who were ineligible for the 
NV process. These migrant workers are 
deemed as migrants with irregular status and 
particularly vulnerable to arbitrary arrest, 
violence, abuse, discrimination and 
exploitation by the police, military and 
immigration officers. The police reportedly 
stop migrants randomly to check their migrant 
workers&#8217; card and arbitrarily arrest them if they 
are unable to produce it. They may be asked to 
pay money ranging from 200 to 8&#8217;000 baht or 
more to the police in exchange for their 
freedom, either when they are stopped by the 
police or when they are in police custody. It 
has been reported that even migrants who are 
registered and hold a valid migrant workers&#8217; 
card are often arrested for failing to carry their 
cards with them at all times, despite the fact 
that many employers commonly withhold these </p>

<p>cards. 
</p>
<p>It is also alleged that migrants who attempt to 
flee arrest are often subjected to severe 
physical assault by the police. For instance, it 
has been reported that Maung Kyi, an irregular 
migrant worker from Myanmar who was 
arrested by the Border Patrol Police on 5 
August 2008, was severely beaten by the police 
officers after he attempted to escape from the 
Police&#8217;s moving truck. Further, the fear 
induced by the threat of being arrested and 
subjected to violence has allegedly resulted in a 
number of cases where migrants drowned to 
death as they tried to flee from police officers. 
On 8 March 2010, two young sisters from 
Myanmar, Nyo Nyo San, 20 years old, and 
Myint Myint San, 12 years old, drowned while 
trying to escape a police raid of their living 
quarters near Klong Cork Mu, Tambon Patong, 
Amphur Kathu, Phuket Province. The police 
officers at the scene reportedly did not offer 
any assistance to the victims and used guns to 
threaten other migrants who tried to save them.  
</p>
<p>It has further been reported that this pattern of 
arbitrary arrest, violence, abuse and 
exploitation of migrants has been exacerbated 
by the Prime Minister&#8217;s order of 2 June 2010 
issued to set up a Special Centre to Suppress, 
Arrest and Prosecute Alien Workers Who Are 
Working Underground (No.125/1223). The 
Centre is mandated to suppress, arrest and 
prosecute &#8220;alien workers who illegally entered 
the Kingdom of Thailand and are working 
underground&#8221;. The Centre&#8217;s mandate is 
implemented through five regional working 
committees, which consist of police, army, 
navy and other Government officials who may 
carry out raids, arrests and detention of migrant 
workers. This order, allegedly aimed at 
arresting, detaining and deporting the </p>

intensive domestic and international media 
interest and intervention from Thailand&#8217;s 
National Human Rights Commission in March 
and April 2010, expressing strong concerns and 
a need to reconsider the NV policy from a 
human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>Pursuant to this order, approximately 830 
migrant workers (346 Myanmarese, 172 
Laotian, 307 Cambodian, 2 Vietnamese, 1 
Nigerian, 2 Iranian and 1 Indian) were 
reportedly arrested between 16 and 19 June 
2010 in Metropolitan Police Regions 1-9 alone. 
The information received also indicates that 
hundreds of migrants have been arrested in the

2010: 
</p>
<p>-135 migrants (103 Myanmarese, 20

<p>-99 Cambodian migrants in Sai Kaew

detention at some IDCs are believed to be poor 
and not meeting adequate sanitary and hygienic 
standards. Given the increasing number of 
arrest of migrants subject to deportation, some 
IDCs have reportedly become particularly 
overcrowded and lack sufficient sanitary 
facilities for the detainees. Further, it is alleged 
that female migrants are often subject to sexual 
abuse and harassment by law enforcement 
officers during detention.  
</p>
<p>Further, it has been reported that, in Ranong 
for instance, there have recently been an 
increasing number of cases where irregular 
migrants have been detained by the police at 
their work sites and/or transferred to local 
police stations, and later being released by the 
police once the irregular migrants&#8217; employers 
have paid police officials approximately 2&#8217;500 
baht. These reports suggest a systematic abuse 
of official powers, including the &#8220;sale&#8221; of 
irregular migrants to various brokers who then 
transfer the migrants back to their worksites for 
fees or who &#8220;resell&#8221; or traffic the individuals to 
various employers in the fishing and domestic 
services industries. 
</p>
<p>Many of the arrested migrant workers have 
been reportedly deported to their countries of 
origin. In this connection, it is particularly 
concerning that the arrested migrant workers 
from Myanmar are deported to their country of 
origin by boat through informal checkpoints 
controlled by the Democratic Karen Buddhist 
Army (&#8220;DKBA&#8221;). The information received 
suggests that DKBA demands fees from the 
deportees at the checkpoints in exchange of </p>

<p>&#8226; Il y a d'abord un contr&#244;le judiciaire assur&#233;

indignation face aux all&#233;gations mensong&#232;res 
de torture et de mauvais traitements qui 
auraient &#233;t&#233; inflig&#233;s &#224; Ramzi Romdhani. A cet

qu'il a tent&#233; de monter croyant trouver l&#224; un 
moyen de pression pour amener les autorit&#233;s

<p>En effet, d&#232;s que les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes ont 
&#233;t&#233; alert&#233;es des all&#233;gations de mauvais 
traitements en question, une mission

prison de la Mornaguia, lieu de d&#233;tention de 
M. Ramzi Romdhani. C'est dans ce cadre 
qu'un magistrat haut responsable du Minist&#232;re 
de la justice et des droits de l'Homme a &#233;t&#233; 
d&#233;p&#234;ch&#233; sur les lieux en vue de constater les

victime et r&#233;diger un rapport qui serait un 
pr&#233;alable au d&#233;clenchement des poursuites 
judiciaires n&#233;cessaires. En s'entretenant avec 
M. Ramzi Romdhani, le magistrat charg&#233; de 
l'enqu&#234;te a constat&#233; qu'il ne porte aucun signe 
apparent de mauvais traitements. Interrog&#233; 
sur les all&#233;gations de mauvais traitements 
v&#233;hicul&#233;s &#224; son sujet, l'int&#233;ress&#233; a affirm&#233; 
n'avoir jamais subi aucune forme de mauvais 
traitement. Quant &#224; l'all&#233;gation de son

jamais &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233; en dehors du lieu de sa 
d&#233;tention.

<p>de mauvais traitements v&#233;hicul&#233;es son sujet, 
M. Ramzi Romdhani a affirm&#233; qu'il avait 
imagin&#233; ce genre de man&#339;uvre dans l'espoir 
de voir la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, &#224; l'&#233;chelle aussi bien 
interne qu'internationale, se mobiliser pour 
mettre la pression sur les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes 
en vue de le lib&#233;rer. 
</p>
<p> Il y a lieu &#233;galement de souligner que dans le 
cadre des manoeuvres que M. Rarnzi 
Romdhani a imagin&#233; pouvoir monter, 
l'int&#233;ress&#233; a tent&#233; d'exploiter certaines 
maladies dont il souffre pour faire croire &#224; des 
signes de mauvais traitements. Ainsi, le 
m&#233;decin de l'unit&#233; p&#233;nitentiaire a 
diagnostiqu&#233; chez l'int&#233;ress&#233; une uv&#233;ite 
granulomateuse bilat&#233;rale et l'a transf&#233;r&#233; &#224; un 
m&#233;decin sp&#233;cialiste qui lui a ordonn&#233; les 
traitements n&#233;cessaires. L'int&#233;ress&#233; a 
malheureusement tent&#233; d'exploiter les signes 
de cette maladie pour faire croire qu'ils 
avaient pour origine des actes de mauvais 
traitements qui lui ont &#233;t&#233; inflig&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>Il convient, en outre, de rappeler que la loi du 
14 mai 2001 relative &#224; l'organisation des 
prisons garantit au d&#233;tenu Ramzi Romdhani 
le droit de recevoir la visite r&#233;guli&#232;re des 
membres de sa famille. 
</p>
<p>L'int&#233;ress&#233; a, cependant, d&#233;tourn&#233; ce droit 
croyant pouvoir l'utiliser comme moyen de 
pression pour essayer d'obtenir des privil&#232;ges 
injustifi&#233;s au d&#233;triment des autres d&#233;tenus. 
</p>
<p>C'est ainsi que M. Ramzi Romdhani a, A 
maintes reprises, refus&#233; de recevoir la visite 
de membres de sa famille au motif que 
l'administration p&#233;nitentiaire refuse de le 
transf&#233;rer A une autre unit&#233; de d&#233;tention alors 
que le transfert des d&#233;tenus d'une unit&#233; et une

<p>Tout en r&#233;it&#233;rant leur indignation du 
comportement de M. Ramzi Romdhani qui 
use de man&#339;uvres et d'insinuations dans le 
but de manipuler les instances de d&#233;fense des 
droits de l'Homme, il y a lieu de rappeler que 
les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes n'h&#233;sitent pas A 
enqu&#234;ter sur toutes les all&#233;gations de torture 
chaque fois qu'il y aurait motifs raisonnables 
laissant croire qu'un acte de mauvais 
traitements a &#233;t&#233; commis. On citera, &#224; titre 
d'exemple, les cas suivants : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Le premier concerne quatre agents de l'ordre

condamn&#233;s chacun A 20 ans 
d'emprisonnement pour coups et blessures 
volontaires ayant caus&#233; la mort sans intention 
de la donner, les deux autres ont &#233;t&#233; 
condamn&#233;s respectivement &#224; 15 et 10 ans

coups et blessures volontaires ayant caus&#233; la 
mort sans intention de la donner (arr&#234;t rendu 
par la Cour d'appel de Tunis le 2 avril 2002) ; 
</p>
<p> &#8226; Le troisi&#232;me concerne trois agents de

voie de fait sur un d&#233;tenu. La proc&#233;dure 
diligent&#233;e A cet effet a abouti A la

<p>Ces quatre cas d&#233;montrent que les autorit&#233;s 
tunisiennes ne tol&#232;rent aucun mauvais 
traitement et n'h&#233;sitent pas &#224; engager les 
poursuites n&#233;cessaires contre les agents 
charg&#233;s de l'application de la loi chaque fois 
qu'il y a des motifs raisonnables laissant 
croire que des actes de telle nature ont &#233;t&#233; 
commis. 
</p>
<p>Il y a lieu d'indiquer enfin que M. Ramzi 
Romdhani fait l'objet d'un suivi m&#233;dical 
r&#233;gulier &#224; l'instar de tous les autres d&#233;tenus et 
qu'aucun des m&#233;decins qui l'ont examin&#233; n'a 
relev&#233; chez l'int&#233;ress&#233; aucune trace de 
mauvais traitements quelle qu'en soit la forme 
physique ou psychologique. 
</p>
<p>En conclusion, l'int&#233;ress&#233; jouit de tous ses 
droits fondamentaux conform&#233;ment A la 
l&#233;gislation en vigueur. Les investigations ont 
&#233;tabli que les all&#233;gations de torture et de 
mauvais traitements sont d&#233;nu&#233;es de tout 
fondement. Ce cas illustre d'ailleurs 
parfaitement les risques de manipulation des 
droits de l'Homme par les individus 
poursuivis et condamn&#233;s pour infractions 
terroristes.

<p>Le 6 juillet 2010, la Cour d&#8217;appel de Gafsa 
aurait confirm&#233; la peine d&#8217;emprisonnement de 
quatre ans prononc&#233;e en premi&#232;re instance par 
la Chambre criminelle du Tribunal de premi&#232;re 
instance de Gafsa &#224; l&#8217;encontre de M. 
Boukaddous, pour &#171; participation &#224; une entente

contre des personnes et des biens &#187;. M. 
Boukaddous n&#8217;aurait pu assister au prononc&#233; 
du verdict en raison de son hospitalisation dans 
la ville de Sousse pour des probl&#232;mes 
respiratoires. Un nombre d&#8217;avocats, 
journalistes et activistes des droits de l&#8217;homme 
auraient &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233;s, de mani&#232;re semble-t-il

<p>  Mr. Lotfi Dassi., A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 261 Par lettre dat&#233;e 31/03/2010, le Gouvernement 
a indiqu&#233; Monsieur Lotfi Dassi, ancien 
condamn&#233; pour adh&#233;sion &#224; un groupe 
int&#233;griste salafiste pr&#244;nant le Jihad comme 
moyen d'action politique, a fait l'objet de 
poursuites judiciaires pour collecte de fonds 
sans autorisation, conform&#233;ment aux 
WGEIDositions du d&#233;cret du 21 d&#233;cembre 
1944 selon lequel &#171; est puni de 15 jours &#224; 3 
mois d'emprisonnement quiconque proc&#232;de 
sans autorisation &#224; la collecte de fonds&#187;. Les 
investigations effectu&#233;es ont, en effet, r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; 
que l'int&#233;ress&#233; s'&#233;tait concert&#233; avec des 
partisans, r&#233;sidant &#224; l'&#233;tranger, du m&#234;me 
groupe int&#233;griste en vue de monter un r&#233;seau 
ayant pour objectif de drainer 
clandestinement des sommes d'argent pour les 
consacrer au d&#233;veloppement des activit&#233;s du 
groupe en question. En concr&#233;tisation de ce 
projet et dans le but de d&#233;jouer toute tentative 
de mettre en lumi&#232;re les activit&#233;s clandestines 
et prohib&#233;es du r&#233;seau de collecte ill&#233;gale des

profit le r&#244;le de pr&#234;te-noms en proc&#233;dant, en 
leurs noms, &#224; l'ouverture de comptes 
bancaires qui lui serviront &#224; recevoir les 
sommes d'argent envoy&#233;es de l'&#233;tranger. Le 
syst&#232;me mis en place a, effectivement, permis 
&#224; Monsieur Lotfi Dassi de recueillir de </p>

<p>cons&#233;quentes sommes d'argent qui lui ont &#233;t&#233; 
envoy&#233;es par des partisans du m&#234;me groupe 
int&#233;griste r&#233;sidant dans certains pays 
europ&#233;ens. Il y a lieu de noter que le pr&#233;venu 
a avou&#233;, dans le proc&#232;s-verbal de son 
interrogatoire ainsi qu'&#224; l'audience tenue lors 
de son proc&#232;s, les faits qui lui sont reproch&#233;s 
d&#233;crivant dans le d&#233;tail le mode op&#233;ratoire 
mont&#233; en vue de recueillir clandestinement 
des fonds au profit de membres et partisans 
du groupe int&#233;griste auquel il adh&#232;re. 
</p>
<p>Outre cet aveu, les investigations ont permis 
la saisie, au domicile du pr&#233;venu, d'une 
somme d'argent que le pr&#233;venu a reconnu 
avoir pour origine les fonds ill&#233;galement 
collect&#233;s au profit du groupe int&#233;griste. De 
surcro&#238;t, les investigations effectu&#233;es aupr&#232;s 
des divers &#233;tablissements bancaires tunisiens 
ont permis l'identification des comptes 
bancaires utilis&#233;s par le pr&#233;venu pour la 
r&#233;ception des fonds envoy&#233;s de l'&#233;tranger. 
L'analyse des mouvements de fonds ayant 
transit&#233; par ce compte a, &#233;galement, permis 
de confirmer leur utilisation pour drainer des 
sommes d'argent provenant de l'&#233;tranger aux 
fins sus-indiqu&#233;es. Le solde de ses comptes a

<p>II- Fondement juridique de la d&#233;tention du 
pr&#233;venu et sa compatibilit&#233; avec les 
instruments internationaux de protection des 
droits de l'homme 
</p>
<p>Comme sus-indiqu&#233;, les poursuites judiciaires 
dont Monsieur Lotfi Dassi a fait l'objet 
trouvent leur fondement dans les 
WGEIDositions du d&#233;cret du 21 d&#233;cembre 
1944 selon lesquelles &#171; est puni de 15 jours &#224; 
3 mois d'emprisonnement quiconque proc&#232;de 
sans autorisation &#224; la collecte de fonds &#187;. 
S'agissant de la garde &#224; vue dont le pr&#233;venu a 
fait l'objet, elle trouve son fondement dans 
l'article 13 bis du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale 
qui habilite les officiers de la police judiciaire 
&#224; garder &#224; vue le suspect si les n&#233;cessit&#233;s de 
l'enqu&#234;te l'exigent.  
</p>
<p>Il convient de souligner que la garde &#224; vue est 
soumise au contr&#244;le judiciaire en application 
de l'article 12 de la Constitution qui interdit 
tout usage arbitraire de cette mesure. C'est 
dans ce cadre que la mesure de garde &#224; vue 
dont le pr&#233;venu a fait l'objet a &#233;t&#233; entour&#233;e 
des garanties l&#233;gales suivantes : 
</p>
<p>- La dur&#233;e de la garde &#224; vue : 
</p>
<p>L'all&#233;gation selon laquelle le pr&#233;venu aurait 
&#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le 23 novembre 2009 &#224; Gafsa est 
d&#233;nu&#233;e de tout fondement. En effet, le proc&#232;s-
verbal de garde &#224; vue pr&#233;cise que le pr&#233;venu a 
&#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; &#224; Tunis et non, comme all&#233;gu&#233;, &#224; 
Gafsa et porte clairement la date de cette 
mesure qui a d&#233;but&#233; le 11 d&#233;cembre 2009 
pour prendre fin 5 jours apr&#232;s, l'int&#233;ress&#233; 
ayant &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au parquet de Tunis le 16

<p>&#233;gard que le droit tunisien soumet les d&#233;lais 
de garde &#224; vue &#224; un contr&#244;le strict de la part 
de l'autorit&#233; judiciaire. C'est dans ce sens que 
les officiers de police judiciaire sont dans 
l'obligation de tenir un registre sp&#233;cial cot&#233; et 
sign&#233; par le procureur de la R&#233;publique et 
portant obligatoirement toutes les 
informations relatives &#224; chaque placement en 
garde &#224; vue notamment le jour et l'heure 
exacts du d&#233;but et de la fin de chaque garde &#224; 
vue. Les investigations effectu&#233;es n'ont r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; 
aucun d&#233;passement des d&#233;lais de garde &#224; vue 
dont le pr&#233;venu avait fait l'objet. 
</p>
<p>- Le droit d'informer le pr&#233;venu de la mesure 
de garde &#224; vue : 
</p>
<p>L'officier de police judiciaire est dans 
l'obligation d'informer le pr&#233;venu de la 
mesure de garde &#224; vue prise &#224; son encontre, 
de ses motifs, de sa dur&#233;e et des garanties qui 
lui sont offertes par la loi. Cette garantie a &#233;t&#233; 
pleinement respect&#233;e en l'esp&#232;ce comme 
l'indique le contr&#244;le du proc&#232;s-verbal de 
garde &#224; vue qui pr&#233;cise clairement que le 
pr&#233;venu a &#233;t&#233; inform&#233; des motifs de la mesure 
prise &#224; son encontre, de sa dur&#233;e ainsi que de 
l'ensemble des garanties qui lui sont offertes 
par la loi. La signature par l'int&#233;ress&#233; du 
proc&#232;s-verbal constitue la preuve qu'il n'avait 
exprim&#233; aucune r&#233;serve ni soulev&#233; aucune 
contestation quant &#224; la l&#233;galit&#233; de sa garde &#224; 
vue. 
</p>
<p>- Le droit d'informer la famille du pr&#233;venu de 
la mesure de garde &#224; vue : 
</p>
<p>L'officier de police judiciaire est tenu 
d'informer la famille du pr&#233;venu de la mesure 
de garde &#224; vue. Cette garantie a &#233;t&#233;, 
&#233;galement, respect&#233;e puisque la consultation 
du proc&#232;s-verbal de garde &#224; vue d&#233;montre que 
l'&#233;pouse du pr&#233;venu a &#233;t&#233; imm&#233;diatement </p>

proc&#232;s-verbal porte m&#234;me le num&#233;ro de 
t&#233;l&#233;phone de l'&#233;pouse du pr&#233;venu, num&#233;ro 
contact&#233; aux fins de l'informer que son &#233;poux 
a &#233;t&#233; plac&#233; en garde &#224; vue. 
</p>
<p>-Le droit du gard&#233; &#224; vue &#224; examen m&#233;dical : 
</p>
<p>Toute personne gard&#233;e &#224; vue a le droit de 
demander, au cours du d&#233;lai de la garde &#224; vue 
ou &#224; son expiration, d'&#234;tre soumise &#224; examen 
m&#233;dical. Ce droit peut &#234;tre exerc&#233;, le cas 
&#233;ch&#233;ant, par les membres de sa famille. C'est 
dans ce cadre que Monsieur Lotfi Dassi a &#233;t&#233; 
inform&#233; de son droit de demander d'&#234;tre 
soumis &#224; examen m&#233;dical. L'int&#233;ress&#233; a, 
cependant, d&#233;clar&#233; ne pas en avoir besoin. 
Aucun des membres de la famille de 
l'int&#233;ress&#233; n'a &#233;galement pr&#233;sent&#233; de demande 
en ce sens. Il ressort, donc, de ce qui pr&#233;c&#232;de 
que la d&#233;tention du pr&#233;venu avait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233;e 
dans le cadre d'une enqu&#234;te judiciaire ouverte 
&#224; son encontre pour ses activit&#233;s d&#233;lictuelles 
en rapport avec la collecte ill&#233;gale de fonds. 
</p>
<p> Impos&#233;e par les n&#233;cessit&#233;s de l'enqu&#234;te, la 
mesure de garde &#224; vue &#233;tait entour&#233;e de toutes 
les garanties l&#233;gales pr&#233;vues par le droit 
tunisien. Ces garanties, relatives notamment &#224; 
la limitation de la dur&#233;e de la garde &#224; vue, &#224; 
sa soumission au contr&#244;le judiciaire, au droit 
de l'int&#233;ress&#233; d'&#234;tre soumis &#224; examen m&#233;dical 
et au devoir des autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes 
d'informer imm&#233;diatement les membres de sa 
famille de la mesure prise &#224; son encontre, 
ob&#233;issent aux standards internationaux en la 
mati&#232;re ce qui &#233;carte tout soup&#231;on de 
violation des instruments internationaux de 
protection des droits de l'Homme.

ou en son nom, pour d&#233;tention abusive,

</p>
<p>IV- Garantie de l'int&#233;grit&#233; physique et morale 
du pr&#233;venu 
</p>
<p>Il y a lieu de souligner que tout pr&#233;venu 
b&#233;n&#233;ficie, &#224; l'instar de tout citoyen tunisien, et 
sur le m&#234;me pied d'&#233;galit&#233;, de tous les droits 
qui lui sont reconnus par la Constitution 
tunisienne notamment le droit &#224; l'int&#233;grit&#233; 
physique et morale consacr&#233; par les articles 5 
et 6 qui WGEIDosent respectivement que &#171; la 
R&#233;publique tunisienne garantit l'inviolabilit&#233; 
de la personne humaine &#187; et que &#171; tous les 
citoyens ont les m&#234;mes droits et les m&#234;mes 
devoirs. Ils sont &#233;gaux devant la loi &#187;. Il est &#224; 
pr&#233;ciser que le respect de l'int&#233;grit&#233; physique 
et morale du pr&#233;venu durant la p&#233;riode de sa 
d&#233;tention est garanti par la loi et ce, 
conform&#233;ment aux WGEIDositions de 
l'article 13 (alin&#233;a 2) de la Constitution 
tunisienne selon lequel &#171; tout individu ayant 
perdu sa libert&#233; est trait&#233; humainement &#187; et de 
l'article premier de la loi du 14 mai 2001 
relative &#224; l'organisation des prisons qui 
WGEIDose que les conditions de d&#233;tention 
dans les prisons doivent assurer &#171; l'int&#233;grit&#233; 
physique et morale du d&#233;tenu &#187;. 
</p>
<p>C'est dans ce cadre que l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; b&#233;n&#233;fice, 
durant la p&#233;riode de sa d&#233;tention, de tous les 
soins m&#233;dicaux n&#233;cessaires. D&#232;s son

&#233;tat de sant&#233; et d&#233;terminer, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, s'il 
avait des besoins de soins sp&#233;cifiques. Cette

<p>222.     Concernant la situation des 38 membres du 
mouvement de protestation sociale dans la 
r&#233;gion de Gafsa, (A/HRC/13/39/Add.1 para 
259) 
</p>
<p>Par lettr&#233; dat&#233;e le 25 janvier 2010, le 
Gouvernement tunisien a pr&#233;cise que selon 
les &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire 
diligent&#233;e par le procureur de la R&#233;publique 
de Gafsa, les pr&#233;venus vises dans la 
communication ont constitu&#233; une entente, sur 
fond de certains troubles enregistr&#233;s dans la 
r&#233;gion de Gafsa, sud de la Tunisie, afin 
d&#8217;appeler &#224; la d&#233;sob&#233;issance publique, 
transformant ainsi le mouvement de 
contestation pacifique en une v&#233;ritable 
r&#233;bellion comme l&#8217;indique notamment la 
diffusion de tracts d&#8217;incitation &#224; la 
commission d&#8217;actes d&#8217;agression et des voies 
de fait contre les forces de l&#8217;ordre. 
</p>
<p> Les pr&#233;venus avaient effectivement mis leur 
plan &#224; ex&#233;cution se mettant &#224; la t&#234;te d&#8217;une 
manifestation de plusieurs dizaines de 
personnes au cours de laquelle les agents de 
l&#8217;ordre public &#233;taient la cible de cocktails 
Molotov et de jets de pierre provoquant ainsi 
des l&#233;sions corporelles &#224; plusieurs d&#8217;entre 
eux. Les &#233;difices publics et priv&#233;s, voitures et 
vitrines de commerce n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; &#233;pargn&#233;s

<p>est suivi un &#233;tat de panique parmi les 
populations de la r&#233;gion de Gafsa dont la 
s&#233;curit&#233; &#233;tait bel et bien menac&#233;e. 
</p>
<p>Dans le cadre de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire, le 
juge d&#8217;instruction en charge du dossier, a 
proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; plusieurs auditions et notamment 
celle de 7 agents de l&#8217;ordre ayant pr&#233;sent&#233; 
chacun des expertises m&#233;dicales faisant &#233;tat 
de blessures et de traces de violence 
occasionn&#233;es par des jets de pierre et des 
coups de b&#226;ton. Par ailleurs, un rapport 
d&#233;taill&#233; des dommages aux &#233;difices publics et 
priv&#233;s, appuy&#233; par des expertises techniques 
et illustr&#233; par des photos des &#233;difices 
saccag&#233;s, est inclus dans le dossier de 
l&#8217;instruction.

<p>L&#8217;all&#233;gation selon laquelle la Cour d&#8217;appel de 
Gafsa avait rendu son jugement &#171; sans statuer 
sur les all&#233;gations de torture et les 
irr&#233;gularit&#233;s du dossier soulev&#233; par les 
avocats de la d&#233;fense depuis le d&#233;but du 
proc&#232;s &#187; est, en fait, une all&#233;gation d&#233;pourvue 
de tout fondement. En effet, la cour a 
consign&#233; ces all&#233;gations dans les proc&#232;s-
verbaux d&#8217;audience. Quant &#224; l&#8217;examen des 
all&#233;gations de mauvais traitements et

<p>&#171; n&#8217;&#233;taient refl&#233;t&#233;es dans aucune des pi&#232;ces 
du dossier d&#232;s lors que les traces d&#8217;&#233;corchures 
et de l&#233;gers h&#233;matomes, constat&#233;es sur 
certains d&#8217;entre eux, &#233;voquaient plut&#244;t 
qu&#8217;elles &#233;taient caus&#233;es par l&#8217;affrontement 
des pr&#233;venus aux forces de l&#8217;ordre et ne sont 
nullement en rapport avec les officiers de 
police judiciaire charges quant &#224; eux de 
diligenter l&#8217;enqu&#234;te &#187; et &#224; la Cour de 
cassation de conclure qu&#8217; &#171; aucun acte 
d&#8217;agression ne pouvait &#234;tre imput&#233; aux 
officiers en charge de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire 
ce qui est de nature &#224; &#233;carter toute 
contestation de l&#233;galit&#233; relative aux actes par 
eux accomplis &#187;. 
</p>
<p> Ainsi, l&#8217;all&#233;gation de mauvais traitements a 
&#233;t&#233; examin&#233;e et tranch&#233;e par la Cour de 
cassation, juridiction dot&#233;e du pouvoir de 
contr&#244;ler la r&#233;gularit&#233; des actes d&#8217;instruction, 
laquelle a rendu une d&#233;cision de rejet, pass&#233;e 
en force de chose jug&#233;e sur ce grief. En outre 
l&#8217;affrontement violent des pr&#233;venus aux 
forces de l&#8217;ordre est certainement de nature &#224; 
causer des blessures aux deux parties. C&#8217;est 
dans ce cadre que le juge d&#8217;instruction a, 
d&#8217;une part, constat&#233; des &#233;corchures et de 
l&#233;gers h&#233;matomes sur certains des pr&#233;venus et 
a vers&#233;, d&#8217;autre part, au dossier des expertises 
m&#233;dicales dont 7 agents de l&#8217;ordre &#233;taient 
concernes, expertises faisant &#233;tat de blessures 
et de traces de violence occasionn&#233;es par des 
jets de pierre et des coups de b&#226;ton. La 
qualification &#171; d&#8217;actes de mauvais traitements 
&#187; ne pouvait &#234;tre retenue pour les l&#233;gers 
&#233;corchures et h&#233;matomes des lors qu&#8217;ils 
&#233;taient dus aux affrontements que les 
pr&#233;venus ont eux m&#234;mes provoqu&#233;s. Il est &#224; 
pr&#233;ciser qu&#8217;aucun des pr&#233;venus ou des

<p>mauvais traitements. 
</p>
<p>En l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes n&#8217;ont 
constat&#233; aucun motif raisonnable laissant 
croire qu&#8217;un acte de mauvais traitement ait 
&#233;t&#233; commis. En l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, les autorit&#233;s 
tunisiennes n&#8217;ont constate aucun &#171; motif 
raisonnable &#187; laissant croire qu&#8217;un acte de 
mauvais traitement ait &#233;t&#233; commis. En effet, 
chacun des pr&#233;venus &#233;taient en droit, durant 
sa garde &#224; vue, de demander, conform&#233;ment &#224; 
l&#8217;article 13 bis du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, 
qu&#8217;il soit soumis &#224; examen m&#233;dical. Cette

de leurs familles qui peuvent demander 
l&#8217;examen m&#233;dical pour leurs proches m&#234;me si 
ceux-ci ne l&#8217;ont pas fait. Un tel droit a pour 
objectif de permettre aux d&#233;tenus de faire 
constater les traces, physique ou 
psychologique, de mauvais traitements subis 
lors de la garde &#224; vue. Les proc&#232;s-verbaux de 
la garde &#224; vue font &#233;tat de l&#8217;information 
donn&#233;e aux pr&#233;venus de leur droit de

m&#233;dical, ceux-ci avaient d&#233;clar&#233; ne pas en

dans ce sens ce qui r&#233;v&#232;le le caract&#232;re infond&#233;

<p>Concernant les bases l&#233;gales de l&#8217;arr&#234;t de la 
Cour de cassation du 21 aout 2009, il y a lieu 
de pr&#233;ciser que le rejet du pourvoi de B&#233;chir

<p>&#224; des contestations pacifiques ou d&#233;fense des 
droits de l&#8217;homme. La l&#233;gislation tunisienne 
et notamment la loi du 24 janvier 1969 
r&#233;glemente les r&#233;unions publiques, cort&#232;ges, 
d&#233;fil&#233;s, manifestations et attroupements. Le 
r&#233;gime institu&#233; par cette loi est tr&#232;s favorable 
&#224; l&#8217;exercice de la libert&#233; de r&#233;union et de 
manifestation puisqu&#8217;il ne les soumet &#224; 
aucune autorisation pr&#233;alable. C&#8217;est dans ce 
cadre l&#233;gal que plusieurs des habitants de la 
r&#233;gion de Gafsa ont exerc&#233; leur libert&#233; de 
manifester pacifiquement. Il est toutefois 
regrettable que certains individus, dont les

sein des manifestants pour appeler &#224; la

violation de la loi p&#233;nale et non exercice de la

&#233;gard, il y a lieu de rappeler que la 
Constitution tunisienne et le Pacte

politiques insistent sur le respect de la 
s&#233;curit&#233; et l&#8217;ordre public lors de l&#8217;exercice du 
droit de r&#233;union et de contestation. L&#8217;article

garanti est le droit de r&#233;union &#171; pacifique &#187;. Il 
est n&#233;cessaire de distinguer les activit&#233;s de

<p>Akincilar was arrested by police in Istanbul, 
where he wanted to visit his sick mother. He 
was held and interrogated at length numerous 
times in a police lock-up in Istanbul until 4 
October 2009. He was then transferred to 
Metris Prison (Istanbul) and later to Edurne 
Prison, 300 km north of Istanbul, where he is 
currently being detained without charges. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Murad Akincilar has not been provided 
with any information on the crime he is 
suspected of, nor has he received an official 
indictment. This situation renders it difficult 
for him to defend himself or challenge his 
detention. It appears that his detention may be 
based on political motives, since he has 
published two articles in a journal critical of 
the Government (&quot;Demokratik D&#246;n&#252;s&#252;m&quot;), and 
has been politically active in an organisation 
named &quot;Devrimci Karag&#226;t&quot;. 
</p>
<p>In the course of the interrogations at the police 
in the beginning of October 2009, he was 
allegedly deprived of sleep on numerous 
occasions and was a number of times forced to 
look into extremely bright lights. Due to this 
treatment, it is reported that Mr. Murad 
Akincilar is loosing his eyesight because of 
retinal detachment. He started encountering 
problems with his eyesight on 11 October, 
while detained in Metris Prison. However, the 
responsible officials allegedly refused to grant 
him medical care. During his transfer from 
Metris to Edurne Prison over a distance of 300 
km he was reportedly shackled with chains; a 
week after the transfer, his wife could still 
observe that his legs were swollen and that he 
bore serious haematoma. On 16 October 2009, 
Mr. Murad Akincilar went on hunger strike, 
demanding urgent medical consultation for his 
eyes, which was eventually granted the same 
evening. Despite two belated operations on his </p>

<p>eyes, he has lost already 65% of his eyesight of 
his right eye. On 26 March 2010, a further 
retinal detachment in his left eye was 
diagnosed and he again underwent surgery. 
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed regarding the physical 
and psychological integrity of Mr. Murad. 
With a view to his rapidly deteriorating 
eyesight, particular concern is expressed at the 
conditions of detention and the lack of medical 
care.

<p>Concerning Mr. Mohammad Hassan Haji, a 
Somali national and asylum-seeker in Uganda 
who is due to be forcibly returned to Somalia 
after 31 May 2010.  
</p>
<p>Subsequent to his conversion to Christianity, 
Mr. Mohammad Hassan Haji was threatened in 
Somalia by the armed opposition group al-
Shabab and was forced by them to stop 
working as a cameraman for a Muslim 
company. Mr. Haji fled from Somalia in 2008, 
going first to his uncle in Nairobi and then in 
April 2009 to Uganda in order to seek asylum. 
In December 2009, he was arrested in Katuna 
and charged with illegal entry into Uganda. He 
was convicted and the court in Kabale ordered 
on 10 March 2010 that he should be deported 
back to Somalia. Mr. Haji is currently in police 
custody in Kampala and the Ugandan 
authorities indicated that his deportation will 
take place any time after 31 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>Concerns have been voiced that converts to 
Christianity face great risk of serious human 
rights abuses such as torture and other ill-
treatment or extrajudicial execution in Somalia.

Ukraine for personal reasons. He is currently 
being held in a pre-trial detention centre in 
Uzhhorod.  
</p>
<p>The Russian authorities are seeking his 
extradition based on terrorism charges. In 
2000, during fighting between Russian forces 
and Chechen separatists in the town of Urus 
Martan in the Chechen Republic, Mr. Chataev 
was reportedly wounded in the arm and 
stomach. Before he was taken to hospital he 
was kept by Russian forces. During that period, 
he was reportedly tortured, including with 
electric shocks. His arm was subsequently 
amputated.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Chataev and his family subsequently fled 
to Austria via Azerbaijan. On 24 November 
2003, the Federal Asylum Office granted him 
refugee status in Austria, where he lives with 
his wife and three children. 
</p>
<p>of 1975, and the Second Additional Protocol, 
of 1978, to the Convention, the Ukrainian 
bodies authorized to consider the extradition 
of offenders are the Ministry of Justice 
(requests by courts) and the Office of the 
Procurator-General (requests by bodies 
conducting pretrial investigations).

<p>The extradition of Akhmed Razhapovich 
Chataev was considered by the Office of the 
Procurator-General.

<p>Issue of Mr. Chataev&#8217;s extradition to the 
Russian Federation 
</p>
<p>Mr. Chataev, born on 4 July 1980 and a 
native of the village of Vedeno in the Vedeno 
district of the Chechen Republic of the 
Russian Federation, was arrested on 4 
January 2010, near the Zakarpatska Hotel in 
Kirill and Mefodii Square in the town of 
Uzhhorod in Zakarpatska province, by 
officers of the Department for Combating 
Organized Crime, a unit of the Central 
Administration of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Ukraine, acting under article 106 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure. According 
to information from the General Secretariat of 
the International Criminal Police 
Organization (INTERPOL), the internal 
affairs agencies of the Chechen Republic of 
the Russian Federation had issued an 
international warrant for Mr. Chataev&#8217;s arrest 
on terrorism charges. 
</p>
<p>On the same day, he was placed in the 
holding facility operated by the Uzhhorod 
local office of the Central Administration of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, 
where he was detained until 6 January 2010.

</p>
<p>The Office of the Procurator-General of 
Ukraine, in letter No. 14/3-38062-10 dated 3 
February 2010, informed the Office of the 
Procurator-General of the Russian Federation 
that Mr. Chataev&#8217;s extradition would be 
inconsistent with the legislation in force in 
Ukraine and that, in accordance with article 
19 of the Convention on Judicial Assistance, 
the Russian side&#8217;s request for his extradition 
could not be fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>Issue of Mr. Chataev&#8217;s extradition to Georgia 
</p>
<p>On 9 January 2010, the Office of the 
Procurator-General received from the 
competent Georgian authorities a package of 
extradition documents and an application for 
the extradition of Mr. Chataev, who was 
charged with committing offences under 
articles 108 (Murder) and 344, paragraph 2 
(Illegal crossing of the State border), of the 
Criminal Code of Georgia. As required by 
article 58 of the Convention on Judicial 
Assistance, the extradition application was 
accompanied by the texts of the decision to 
bring criminal charges against Mr. Chataev, 
the decision to issue an international warrant 
for his arrest and the decision of the Tbilisi 
city court to remand him in custody, as well 
as information on the criminal case against 
him. 
</p>
<p>On 28 January 2010, the Uzhhorod court 
decided to remand Mr. Chataev in custody 
until the issue of his extradition to Georgia 
was resolved.

<p>On 3 February 2010, the Office of the 
Procurator-General decided, on the basis of 
the checks carried out, to extradite Mr. 
Chataev to Georgia. 
</p>
<p>The Georgian side provided assurances that, 
if Mr. Chataev was extradited to Georgia, he 
would be prosecuted only for the offences 
envisaged under articles 108 and 344, 
paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of 
Georgia; that he would not be deported, 
transferred or extradited to a third State 
without the consent of Ukraine; and that, after 
he had been tried and had served his sentence, 
he would be free to leave the territory of 
Georgia. 
</p>
<p>Grounds for Mr. Chataev&#8217;s extradition 
</p>
<p>On 24 November 2003, the Austrian Federal 
Asylum Office issued a decision granting Mr. 
Chataev refugee status. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with article 32, paragraph 1, of 
the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees, the Contracting States must not 
expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save 
on grounds of national security or public 
order. 
</p>
<p>Article 33 of the Convention states that the 
Contracting States must not expel or return

whatsoever to the frontiers of territories 
where his life or freedom would be threatened 
on account of his race, religion, nationality, 
membership of a particular social group or 
political opinion. 
</p>

that provision may not be claimed by a 
refugee whom there are reasonable grounds

notification from the Court of the application 
in respect of Mr. Chataev, pursuant to rule 39 
of the Rules of Court, of an interim measure, 
namely, the prohibition of his extradition to

<p>Mr. Ashakhanov was serving his sentence in 
Orekhovskaya penal colony No. 88, when he 
fell sick the first time in September 2009. He 
approached the medical unit where he 
allegedly received two injections of unknown 
drugs. Subsequent to this treatment, Mr. 
Ashakhanov was permanently ill, lost appetite 
and often vomited after meals. Mr. 
Ashakhanov reportedly repeatedly complained 
to the medical unit with the request to conduct 
an examination and administer proper 
treatment. However, no examination was held 
and no treatment was administered.  
</p>
<p>Since November 2009, Mr. Ashahanov&#8217;s health 
condition had severely deteriorated. He was 
unable to leave his bed as he was severely 
weak and suffered from nausea and vomiting. 
His temperature rose above 40 degrees. In two

<p>months, Mr. Ashahanov lost about 20 kg of 
weight. On those days, when he was able to 
walk, he turned with complaints to the medical 
unit. He was given pills (analginum or 
diphenhydramine), which decreased his 
temperature for a very short time. Several 
times he was placed in the medical unit, 
however, each time for a period not exceeding 
5 days. There was no medical examination and 
no permanent treatment administered. When 
Mr. Ashakhanov could not get out of the bed 
and turn to the medical attendant for help, he 
did not obtain medical aid at all, because the 
warders did not respond to his complaints.  
</p>
<p>In mid-January 2010, Mr. Ashakhanov was 
again placed in the medical unit for several 
days. In the morning of 19 January 2010, he 
was suddenly transported away from the 
colony in an unknown direction. On 20 January 
2010, Mr. Ashahanov&#8217;s cellmates were told 
that he had died.  
</p>
<p>Information received indicates that Mr. 
Ashahanov has submitted a complaint to the 
European Court of Human Rights (application 
no. 35930/06). Reports further suggest that 
prison officials more than once intimidated Mr. 
Ashahanov in connection with this complaint. 
His correspondence was allegedly intercepted.  
</p>
<p>Reports further indicate a high mortality rate 
among prisoners at penal colony ? 88 due to 
the absence of medical aid. Only in the event 
of exceptionally severe health deterioration, 
prisoners are taken away from the colony. 
Information further suggests that neither family 
members nor other relevant persons are 
informed to which hospital they are 
transported.

colony No. 88 in order to receive information </p>

<p>Mr. Utkir Akramov, Mr. Kosim Dadakhanov, 
Mr. Umid Khamroev and Mr. Shodilbek 
Soibjonov were detained between 15 June and 
8 July 2010 by Ukrainian law enforcement 
officials. Their detention was based on the fact 
that they face charges in Uzbekistan of 
membership of illegal religious or extremist 
organizations, dissemination of materials 
containing a threat to public security, or 
attempts to overthrow the constitutional order. 
The four men applied for asylum in Ukraine, 
which was refused. However, their asylum 
appeals are pending in the courts. 
</p>
<p>On 26 July, the European Court of Human 
Rights applied Rule 39, which prevents 
Ukraine from extraditing Mr. Akramov, Mr. 
Dadakhanov and Mr. Khamroev. Nevertheless, 
since extradition requests have been received 
for Mr. Akramov, Mr. Dadakhanov and Mr. 
Khamroev, their detention has been prolonged. 
With regard to Mr. Soibjonov, he was released 
on 5 August due to the fact that the period of 
temporary detention had expired and no 
extradition documents were received from the 
Uzbek authorities. However, he is afraid that 
he may be re-arrested. 
</p>
<p>The families of the four men have been 
threatened by Ukrainian law enforcement 
officials and asked to provide information 
about the charges. Additionally, after Mr. 
Khamroev&#8217;s arrest, one of his family members 
was reportedly arrested in Uzbekistan.

<p>By letter dated 15/10/2010 the Government 
indicated that the extradition of offenders 
between Ukraine and Uzbekistan is governed 
by the 1993 Convention on Legal Assistance 
and Legal Relations on Civil, Family and 
Criminal Matters and its 1997 Protocol. 
</p>
<p>Under article 80 of the Convention, 
communications concerning extradition of 
offenders between Ukraine and Uzbekistan 
are conducted through the Ukrainian 
Procurator-General&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>In connection with an application made by 
the complainants on 26 July 2010 to the 
European Court of Human Rights, the 
Ukrainian Government&#8217;s representative to the 
Court received an urgent communication, 
based on Rule 39 of the Court&#8217;s Rules, 
prohibiting the complainants&#8217; extradition to 
Uzbekistan. Further, under Rule 54, 
paragraph 2 (a), the Government was required 
to submit, by 3 August 2010, comments on 
whether the procedure for appealing against a 
refusal to grant refugee status and for 
judgement on extradition in a national court 
halts the actual extradition of the individuals 
concerned.  
</p>
<p>The same day, the Ukrainian Government&#8217;s 
representative to the Court informed the 
Procurator-General of Ukraine of the interim 
measures adopted by the Court in respect of 
the case, Khamroev et al. v. Ukraine, 
pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court 
regarding non-refoulement of the 
complainants to Uzbekistan.

<p>Azerbaijan that the extradition of Shaig 
Garayev from Azerbaijan to Uzbekistan would 
be in violation of the prohibition of torture 
found in article 3 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights. On 29 July 2010, in the case 
of Karimov v. Russia, the Court found that 
torture is &#8220;pervasive and enduring&#8221; in 
Uzbekistan and that Russia was in violation of 
the European Convention on Human Rights 
when it detained an Uzbek asylum-seeker with 
the intention of returning him to Uzbekistan.

<p>presence or otherwise, in orders of the 
Procurator-General&#8217;s office, of requests from 
the relevant bodies in Uzbekistan for 
extradition of the complainants at the 
&#8220;extradition check&#8221; stage, and a guarantee 
was given that the complainants would not be 
extradited before the Court issued its 
subsequent guidance. Ukraine also submitted 
to the Court its comments on the procedure 
and the outcome of the appeal to the national 
court against the refusal to grant refugee 
status and the judgement on extradition, 
taking account of the amendments concerning 
extradition introduced into the Code of 
Criminal Procedure by an act of 17 June 
</p><p>2010. The Government representative 
affirmed that, under the amendments to the 
Code, a ruling on extradition can be appealed 
against in a court of first instance or a court of 
appeal, which, in its turn, halts the entry into 
force and implementation of the ruling. 
</p>
<p>On 9 August 2010, the European Court of 
Human Rights informed the Ukrainian 
Government&#8217;s representative that the interim 
measures had been extended to 23 August 
</p><p>2010. It also asked the Government to 
comment on the application by the 
complainants&#8217; representative concerning the 
ineffectiveness of the procedure for appealing 
against extradition rulings laid out in the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>On 21 August 2010, the Ukrainian 
Government&#8217;s representative submitted to the 
Court comments on the opinion expressed by 
the complainants&#8217; representative. 
</p>
<p>Taking account of that information and of the 
introduction into national legislation of a 
guarantee of the possibility of appealing 
against extradition rulings to the national 
courts, the Court informed the Ukrainian </p>

<p>As indicated by the State Committee on 
Ethnic Communities and Religion under 
article 1 of the Refugees Act, refugees are 
individuals who are not citizens of Ukraine, 
and who, owing to a well-founded fear of 
persecution on the grounds of race, religion, 
ethnic origin, citizenship (nationality), 
membership of a certain social group or 
political convictions, are outside the country 
of their citizenship and are unable or 
unwilling to avail themselves of the 
protection of that country because of the said 
fear, or, having no citizenship (nationality) 
and being outside of the country of their 
previous permanent residence, are unable or 
unwilling to return there because of the said 
fear.

not refugees, in that the Kyiv municipal and

<p>On 22 July 2009, Mr. Mostafa was arrested at a 
friend&#8217;s house in Ras al Khayma by members 
of the State Security forces without an arrest 
warrant. His family was not informed of the 
reasons for his arrest. He had then been held 
incommunicado until 15 December 2009, 
during which time he was allegedly severely 
tortured by State Security agents and forced to 
sign confessions.  
</p>
<p>In December 2009, Mr. Mohamed Mostafa 
denied the evidence given in his forced 
confession before the State Security Prosecutor 
and stated that he had been tortured to force 
him to sign it. On 25 January 2010, Mr. 
Mostafa was presented before the State 
Security Court. Reports suggest that his forced 
confessions are being used as sole evidence in 
the trial. During the trial he denied again the 
evidence against him drawn from his 
confessions and informed the court that he had 
been tortured. No investigation has so far been 
initiated by the prosecutor or the judge.

<p>Concerning Mr. Amir Sharifi, a national of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and resident of 
Bolton, United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Amir Sharifi, a national of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and resident of Bolton since 
September 2008, is currently detained in the 
immigration removal centre Harmondsworth 
and due to be forcibly removed from the 
United Kingdom on flight BA7531/BD931 to 
Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, on 21 March 
</p><p>2010. Mr. Sharifi used to be a Muslim and 
learned about Christianity through an 
underground church in Tehran. He came to the 
United Kingdom on a student visa in 2007 and 
applied for asylum in August 2008, before 
expiry of his visa, as he had converted to 
Christianity. His asylum application has been 
refused, reportedly on the grounds that his 
Christian faith was not genuine but a 
contrivance in order to gain asylum in the 
United Kingdom. However, Mr. Sharifi is 
reported to be a young man with a deep and 
genuine Christian faith and he has been a 
covenant member of the Jesus Fellowship 
Church since August 2009. Concerns have 
been voiced that converts from Shia Islam to 
Christianity face great risk of ill-treatment in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and are not free to 
practise their faith openly without fear of 
persecution and even threat of death as an 
apostate. 
</p>
<p>By a letter dated 14/04/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Sharifi sought judicial 
review of the decision to remove him from 
the UK, claiming breaches of Articles 3 and 8 
of the European Convention of Human Rights 
as well as the Refugee Convention. In the 
course of his application he had an 
opportunity to set out his reasons for 
challenging the decision before an 
independent judge of the High Court, with the 
benefit of legal representation. 
</p>
<p>The issue of his conversion to Christianity 
had already been substantively considered, 
and rejected, in his Asylum and Immigration 
Tribunal appeal in January 2009. The Judge 
refused the judicial review claim on paper on 
17 February 2010, ordering that the claim 
was unarguable, lacked any merit and that the 
removal action could take place even if Mr. 
Sharifi wished to take further court 
proceedings. Mr. Sharifi - through his 
representatives -renewed his application on 
01 March but in light of the observations 
from the court it was not deemed to be a 
barrier to removal. It was open to Mr. Sharifi 
to apply to the court for an injunction to 
prevent removal action from being taken. 
Consequently the Claimant was removed 
from the UK on 21 March.

additional fresh claim for review of her case 
was submitted by her solicitor on 20 April 
</p><p>2010. The judicial review of the fresh claim 
submitted is scheduled to take place on 21 July 
2010. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Bita Ghaedi is a national of Iran born on 
10 September 1974. She allegedly fled Iran 
escaping from a forced marriage.  She 
allegedly arrived in the United Kingdom on 2 
October 2006. Upon her arrival in the United 
Kingdom, she claimed asylum on grounds of 
forced marriage in Iran. She had reportedly 
been forced into the marriage by her father in 
2004 and remained in the forced marriage for 
approximately 2 years until she fled Iran.  In 
addition, she allegedly faced physical and 
psychological maltreatment by her father, 
brother and uncle because she was having an 
extramarital affair with Mr. Hamid Saedi. After 
filing her asylum claim, Ms. Ghaedi was 
reportedly taken to Holloway prison for 45 
days after which she was released for the 
consideration of her asylum claim. The reason 
for her detention was never clarified.  
</p>
<p>In November 2006, Ms. Ghaedi reportedly met 
Mr. Mohsen Zadshir, a British national with 
whom she began an informal domestic 
partnership in October 2008. As a result of her 
relationship with Mr. Zadshir, in 2007, Ms. 
Ghaedi become involved in political activities 
and began working as a political activist with 
Anglo-Iranian women in the United Kingdom. 
She also became a supporter of the British 
Peoples Mojehadin Organization of Iran 
(PMOI) and the National Council for the 
Resistance of Iran (NCRI). Ms. Ghaedi 
campaigned on behalf of the PMOI in the

in Iran during a recent unrest.  
</p>
<p>On 16 August 2007, Ms. Bita Ghaedi's asylum 
claim was rejected by the Home Office and by 
the Court on 16 October 2007. As a 
consequence, on 4 December 2007, she 
attempted to commit suicide by taking an 
overdose, and was hospitalized. She was 
allegedly unconscious for three days and was 
discharged from the hospital on 2 January 
</p><p>2008. Her solicitor requested a revision of the 
case. 
</p>
<p>On 29 April 2009, she was allegedly detained 
and removal directions were set for 4 May on 
the grounds of her immigration status. On 3 
May, Ms. Bita Gaedhi's solicitor submitted an 
application for a leave to remain and she was 
released on 17 June 2009 as her case was 
accepted for judicial review. She was allegedly 
detained again on 11 November 2009 and 
removal directions were set for 16 November. 
On the same date she reportedly began a 
hunger strike. On 16 November 2009 she was 
taken to Heathrow airport for deportation, but 
the deportation was canceled by judicial order 
allegedly on the grounds of the need for further 
time to review the case.  On 2 December 2009 
she was allegedly released on bail, conditional 
upon her presentation twice a week before the 
United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA).   
</p>
<p>In January 2010, the UKBA authorities 
allegedly fixed 16 April 2010 as the date for 
the review of the conditions of her release. On 
27 January 2010, she allegedly commenced 
another hunger strike after she was informed 
by Home Office solicitors that her claim has 
been rejected.

hunger strikes, she was allegedly unable to </p>

<p>comply with the condition of her release. Mr. 
Mohsen Zadshir periodically provided medical 
certificates to the UKBA to justify that it was 
impossible for Ms. Ghaedi to comply with the 
condition of her release. The most recent 
medical certificate is dated 23 March 2010 and 
justifies one month of sick leave. Her physical 
and mental health was weakened considerably 
to the point that she was unable to walk. 
Following friends&#8217; and medical practitioners&#8217; 
advice, she allegedly ended her hunger strike 
on 20 March 2010.  
</p>
<p>On 25 March 2010 Ms. Ghaedi's solicitor 
submitted a fresh claim, as the United 
Kingdom asylum procedure permits rejected 
asylum applicants to lodge a fresh claim and 
give the Government the prerogative of 
deciding whether or not the fresh submission is 
to be considered.  
</p>
<p>On 12 April 2010, Mr. Zadshir brought Ms. 
Ghaedi to UKBA authorities in a wheelchair, 
in order to bring her health condition to their 
attention, and present a request for the renewal 
of her release on bail, which was to be 
reviewed by 16 April 2010.  UKBA authorities 
requested Mr. Zadshir and Ms. Ghaedi to 
return in the afternoon of 16 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>On 16 April 2010 around 6:30 a.m., Home 
Office authorities allegedly arrived at Ms. 
Ghaedi's place of residence with an ambulance, 
arrested her and detained her at Yarl's Wood. 
Mr. Zadshir reported that her health remains  a 
concern while she is in detention.   
</p>
<p>Additional documentation was submitted to the 
Home Office by Ms. Bita Ghaedi's solicitor on 
20 April 2010, who according to Mr. Zadshir  
will submit an application for urgent injunction 
to request to suspend Ms. Ghaedi's removal 
from the United Kingdom scheduled on 5 May </p>

</p>
<p>Her forcible removal from the United Kingdom 
was initially planned for 20 April 2010, but 
was postponed due to flight cancellations. Her 
deportation has been rescheduled to take place 
on 5 May 2010 at 19.00 hrs by flight BD931.  
</p>
<p>Information received indicates, if returned to 
Iran, M. Ghaedi might be subjected to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment as a result of 
having abandoned a forced marriage and 
because of the resulting implications on family 
honour. Information received also suggests, if 
returned to Iran, Ms. Ghaedi might encounter 
harassment, arrest or detention because of her 
political involvement with the PMOI while in 
the United Kingdom. Furthermore, her health 
might be at risk as her physical and 
psychological condition has considerably 
deteriorated, at least partly due to the 
possibility of being deported to Iran. 
Additionally, she considers that her rights to 
family and private life with her partner Mr. 
Zadshir, who is a British national, might also 
be infringed.

<p>and had openly supported the opposition party 
running for the 2004 presidential elections.   
</p>
<p>Mr. Khelifa arrived to the U.K. in 2003.  On 27 
February 2007, Mr. Khelifa was arrested in the 
U.K. on charges of money-laundering. On the 
same day of his arrest, he claimed asylum in 
the U.K. arguing fear of persecution due to his 
political opinions.    Mr. Khelifa has reportedly 
been in detention since that date.   
</p>
<p>On 22 March 2007, Mr. Khelifa was allegedly 
sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment by 
the Criminal Court of Blida in Algeria, for 
what has become known as &#8220;the mortgage 
fraud&#8221; and the &#8220;desalination plant fraud&#8221;.  The 
conduct alleged in this case would constitute an 
offence in the U.K..  In November 2007, the 
Algerian Government produced the extradition 
request before U.K. authorities. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Khelifa has reportedly received a number 
of death threats.  On 13 August 2008, British 
police officers visited Mr. Khelifa in prison 
and allegedly warned him that, according to 
their intelligence sources, his life may be in 
danger due to threats originating in Algeria.  
He was then required to sign an &#8220;Osman letter&#8221; 
indicating the existence of a concern in the 
British police about these allegations.

Magistrates&#8217;Court in the U.K. considered Mr. 
Khelifa&#8217;s extradition case and found no 
evidence that the extradition request had been 
made with the purpose of prosecuting him for 
his political opinions.  However, the domestic 
court determined that were Mr. Khelifa to be 
extradited to Algeria he would face a real risk 
of being ill-treated.  Notwithstanding this the 
domestic court indicated it would be satisfied 
by the diplomatic assurances provided by the 
Republic of Algeria in this case and reached </p>

<p>the conclusion that the extradition of Mr. 
Khelifa would be compatible with articles 2, 3 
and 6 of the European Convention of Human 
Rights. The U.K. Secretary of State would 
have until 30 April 2010 to decide on whether 
to sign the extradition order.   
</p>
<p>On 5 March 2010, the U.K. Border Agency, on 
behalf of the Secretary of State, refused Mr. 
Khelifa&#8217;s asylum claim on the basis that it 
found no evidence that his life would be at risk 
or that he would suffer any kind of ill-
treatment from the authorities on return to 
Algeria.  The Secretary of State referred to the 
diplomatic assurances provided by the Algerian 
authorities in this extradition case guaranteeing 
the fair treatment of Mr. Khelifa upon his 
return to Algeria and reportedly deemed such 
assurances as reliable and serious.  Further, the 
Secretary of State referred to the experience of 
the Special Immigration Appeals Commission 
(SIAC) with previous removals and assurances 
received by the Algerian authorities as well as 
to the fact that the House of Lords upheld 
SIAC&#8217;s judgment in respect of Algerian 
assurances in February 2009. 
</p>
<p>On 23 March 2010, Mr. Khelifa&#8217;s lodged an 
asylum appeal before the Immigration and 
Asylum Chamber of the First-Tier Tribunal.  
On 25 March 2010, Mr. Khelifa was notified 
that although his asylum appeal was pending 
with this tribunal, the Secretary of State would 
be considering that his case be heard by the 
Special Immigration Appeals Commission 
(SIAC).  The SIAC deals with appeals against 
decisions made by the Home Office to deport, 
or exclude, someone from the U.K. on national 
security grounds, or for other public interest 
reasons. It also hears appeals against decisions 
to deprive persons of citizenship status.

Mr. Khelifa&#8217;s asylum request before its final

<p>01/03/10 UA TOR Concerning R.P.K., male, eighteen years old. 
</p>
<p>Mr.R.P.K. has been imprisoned by the State of 
Montana following his conviction on 20 
September 2007 on two counts of assault on a 
peace officer while incarcerated in a state 
juvenile facility. At the time of the conviction, 
Mr.R.P.K. was fifteen years old.  
</p>
<p>Mr.R.P.K. was convicted to the Montana 
Department of Corrections for five years, with 
a recommendation that he be placed in a three-
month &#8220;boot camp&#8221; programme before being 
paroled for the remainder of his sentence. 
Mr.R.P.K. was sent to the Department&#8217;s 
assessment centre. However, after he was 
involved in a verbal and physical altercation 
with a supervisor in February 2008, he was 
transferred to the Montana State Prison, which 
is an adult detention facility. 
</p>
<p>Mr.R.P.K. has been diagnosed as suffering 
from mental illness, including Post-traumatic 
Stress Disorder, Major Depression, and 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 3/5/2010, the Government of 
United States of America indicated that it had 
contacted Montana state authorities and their 
representatives, who have provided the 
following information. We note that Mr. K 
has a case pending in state court against the 
State of Montana and the Montana 
Department of Corrections alleging, inter alia, 
that his treatment in Montana State Prison 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in 
violation of Montana&#8217;s constitution. In this 
case, Mr. K is also seeking a preliminary 
injunction to enjoin the State of Montana 
from, inter alia, confining Mr. K in the High 
Side or using the Behavior Management 
Program. The parties have scheduling 
conference in this case on May 4, 2010 to set 
a briefing schedule. Generally, the State of 
Montana denies the allegations raised in the 
lawsuit and asserts Mr. K&#8217;s rights are being 
safeguarded. For your information, we attach

<p>Conduct Disorder. Despite his child status and 
known history of mental illness, he has been 
incarcerated in an adult facility and placed in 
the general prison population. After his 
involvement in a series of incidents at Montana 
State Prison for which he received disciplinary 
sanctions, in February 2009, Mr.R.P.K. was 
transferred to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) 
facility of the prison and has been held there 
ever since, nearly twelve months now. In 
addition, he has been placed six times on 
Behaviour Management Plans (&#8220;BMPs&#8221;) while 
in the SHU.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, the 
SHU, which is also known as Restricted 
Administrative Segregation, is a minimum of 
two-year punitive segregation, where inmates 
are housed in solitary confinement for 23-hours 
a day, five days a week. Inmates placed in the 
SHU are not permitted visits or phone calls 
until achieving one year of clear conduct.  
</p>
<p>Reports which were received suggest that 
while in the SHU, Mr.R.P.K. has been 
subjected to prolonged periods of isolated 
confinement and sensory deprivation. He is 
unable to receive phone calls or visits from 
family or friends. In accordance with policies 
implemented by the Montana Department of 
Corrections, only after he maintains one year 
of clear conduct will Mr.R.P.K. be permitted 
contact with the outside world; one visit per 
month and one 15-minute phone call per month 
to immediate family members. As a 
consequence, to date, Mr.R.P.K. has spent 
almost ten months in isolation, deprived of 
normal, social interactions with his family and 
even other inmates. Mr.R.P.K. is mostly 
confined to his cell. His limited recreation time 
consists of walking alone in a small caged pen, 
with only a small area open to the outside for 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s answer (the exhibits to these 
documents are also attached). 
</p>
<p>The State of Montana notes it cannot provide 
copies of medical evaluations due to privacy 
interests, but these records are available to 
Mr. K and his attorneys, subject to the 
applicable rules of civil procedure. The State 
of Montana notes that Mr. K has had 
numerous evaluations by mental health 
professionals, is seen weekly by mental 
health staff, and has been given one-on-one 
therapy by a professional counselor within 
the prison. The mental health professionals 
employed by the State of Montana have 
determined in their professional judgment 
that Mr. K is not seriously mentally ill and is 
unsuitable for placement in a mental health 
treatment facility. These professionals have 
offered treatment and are attempting to work 
with Mr. K to take advantage of programs 
available in the facility and to help him 
modify his behavior so that he may be in a 
less restrictive environment in the prison. The 
State of Montana is also seeking independent 
mental examination in the context of the 
litigation. 
</p>
<p>We note generally that the Stat of Montana&#8217;s 
prison system went through litigation, and 
subsequently reform, of its medical and 
mental health programs in the mid- 1990s. 
The settlement of the litigation required 
specific changes to the programs, which were 
reviewed over a several year period by 
independent court-appointed monitors. By 
stipulation of the parties, the mental health 
and medical care provisions of the settlements 
have been approved by the federal court. 
</p>
<p>As noted in the State of Montana&#8217;s answer to 
Mr. K&#8217;s amended complaint, the state 
disagrees that Mr. K is denied educational </p>

<p>fresh air and sunlight. 
</p>
<p>While in SHU, Mr.R.P.K. is provided with 
only the minimum of canteen items and every 
meal is delivered to his cell and he has to eat 
on his own. He is reportedly not permitted to 
apply for prison jobs or to engage in hobbies. 
He is also denied access to educational and 
recreational opportunities that other inmates 
enjoy. It appears that while detained in 
Montana State Prison, Mr.R.P.K. has been 
subjected to conditions of imprisonment that 
have caused him to relive his childhood 
trauma. As a result, Mr.R.P.K. has twice 
attempted suicide by biting through the skin on 
his wrist, puncturing a vein with his teeth and 
then spraying his blood on the window and 
walls of his cell. Despite these recent suicide 
attempts and the overall fragile state of his 
mental health, he appears not to be provided 
with adequate mental health treatment. The 
current treatment consists of a mental health 
staff member walking through the unit once a 
week. During these rounds, the staff member 
knocks on each cell door and asks if the inmate 
has any mental health concerns. If he believes 
he does, he is forced to relay his mental health 
concerns by shouting from behind the cell 
door, within hearing range of other inmates and 
no allowance for confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>When placed in BMP, which according to 
information received aims at changing 
dangerous or assaultive behaviour that is not 
associated with a mental illness, as a first step, 
which lasts at least 48 hours,Mr.R.P.K. is 
virtually stripped naked, except for a short 
gown which provides minimal coverage and 
warmth. He is then placed in a bare, padded 
cell that is constantly illuminated. There is no 
running water in the cell and a hole in the floor 
serves as a toilet. Mr.R.P.K. is provided with a 
</p>
<p>opportunity and notes that he was enrolled 
and actively participated in cell study towards 
his General Educational Development test 
until his continued detention status for 
disruptive behavior resulted in his termination 
for the program. The State of Montana also 
notes that Mr. K has not been on an activated 
Behavior Management Plan for nearly eight 
months. 
</p>
<p>We are happy to provide you with an update 
on how Mr. K&#8217;s court case is ultimately 
resolved.

which seems almost impossible given the 
brightness of the cell. Mr.R.P.K. receives 
minimal water and is only allowed to eat 
NutraLoaf, a food substitute comprised of 
different ingredients mixed together. If he 
maintains what prison staff consider good 
behaviour over this initial 48-hour period he 
&#8216;progresses&#8217; to the second phase of the 
programme. Although housed in isolation in 
the same illuminated cell, during this phase, 
Mr.R.P.K. is given regular prison clothing and 
a pillow. If he maintains good conduct for a 
further 24 hour period, Mr.R.P.K. then 
'progresses' to phase three; water is turned on 
in his cell and he is given regular meals and 
regular bedding materials. While the BMP is in 
effect, if Mr.R.P.K. breaks any of the 
prescribed rules during these three phases or 
even after returning to solitary confinement, 
the BMP is implemented commencing at phase 
1 until he maintains the requisite period of 
good conduct. 
</p>
<p>Mr.R.P.K. has a long and well documented 
history of severe physical and emotional abuse 
and neglect. For several years during his early 
childhood, his father beat him with belt buckles 
and wire clothes hangers and encouraged his 
half&#8211;siblings to beat him with bats. Several 
times, Mr.R.P.K.'s father locked him in a room 
for days or a week at a time, and would 
verbally abuse him.

<p>Concerning the treatment suffered by children 
and young adults enrolled in the residential 
programme of the Judge Rotenberg Centre 
(JRC).  The JCR, located in Canton, 
Massachusetts, is an educational centre 
providing treatment to children and young 
adults with mental disabilities.   
</p>
<p>According to the information received, the JRC

<p>would be supplementing its educational 
programme with a type of therapy known as 
&#8220;aversive therapy&#8221;, which would include 
electric shocks, physical means of restraint and 
food rewards as measures to punish students 
and encourage change in behaviour.    
</p>
<p>Electric shocks would be administered by a 
remote-controlled device manufactured by the 
Centre, referred to as Graduated Electronic 
Decelerator, and it would be carried by 
students in a backpack with electrodes attached 
to the skin.  The electric shocks will be 
reportedly applied on the legs, arms, soles of 
their feet, finger tips and torsos.  The intensity 
of the shocks would be such that they would 
produce blisters on the skin.   
</p>
<p>The JRC would also use physical means of 
restraint, also referred to as &#8220;limitation of 
movement&#8221;, including shackles and isolation 
rooms.  Physical restraint would reportedly be 
used in combination with electric shocks.  In 
such instances, children and young adults 
would be tied down while receiving the electric 
shocks.  Moreover, it has been reported that 
JRC&#8217;s staff practice mock assaults on students 
to provoke unacceptable behaviour which 
would then justify the use of electric shock 
treatment.   
</p>
<p>According to the information received, food 
&#8220;rewards&#8221; would also be used by the JRC to 
encourage behavioural change.  The 
&#8220;Contingent and Specialized Food 
Programmes&#8221; would imply the administration 
of the main meals of the day into small 
portions of food that would be earned with the 
positive behaviour of the student during the 
meal.  Foods portions would be denied if 
students failed to behave during the meal.  
Students under the &#8220;contingent&#8221; food 
programme are offered the possibility to make 
</p>
<p>violations of civil rights laws at the Judge

those under the &#8220;specialized&#8221; food programme

may have missed.

<p>The JRC&#8217;s use of such methods as part of the

and young adults with mental disabilities.  In 
this connection, serious concern is expressed 
about the use of electric shock therapy and 
physical means of restraint as part of the 
educational programme of the Centre and the 
fact that they can sometimes used in 
combination.  Moreover, grave concern is 
expressed about the practice of food rewards to

<p>235.  16/07/10 UA TOR Concerning the situation of six men of 
Algerian nationality currently being held at the 
U.S. Military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.   
</p>
<p>If repatriated to Algeria, these six individuals 
would reportedly face a real and serious risk of 
being subject to torture or ill-treatment.   
</p>
<p>On 8 July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia overturned a decision 
of the U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler 
which ruled that the fear of one of these men of 
being subject to torture and/ or ill-treatment if 
returned to Algeria were of great concern.  This 
individual had reportedly expressed fear of 
torture by the Algerian security services as well 
as by terrorist groups in the country which 
could allegedly kill him if he refuses to join 
them.   
</p>
<p>By a letter dated 13/8/2010, the United States 
reteirated its committed to ensuring that 
transfers from Guantanamo conform to our 
post-transfer humane treatment policies and 
welcomes this opportunity to respond. On his 
second full day in office, President Obama 
ordered Guantanamo closed. His commitment 
to doing so has not wavered, even as closing 
Guantanamo has proven to be an arduous and 
painstaking process. A task force comprised 
of representatives from six federal agencies 
scrupulously considered each Guantanamo 
detainee&#8217;s case to assess whether the detainee 
could be transferred or repatriated consistent 
with U.S. national security, the interests of 
justice, and our policy not to transfer 
individuals to countries where they would 
more likely than not face torture or, in 
appropriate cases, where the individual has a </p>

<p>Moreover, Judge Kessler reportedly indicated 
in her ruling that any diplomatic assurances 
obtained by the Government on such cases 
should ensure that detainees repatriated are not 
subject to torture or ill-treatment. The decision 
of the Appeals Court of Columbia has granted 
the emergency appeal of the U.S. Government 
where it upheld the executive&#8217;s branch&#8217;s 
prerogative to decide on the transfer of 
detainees.   
</p>
<p>According to the information received, the U.S. 
Government has been preparing the imminent 
repatriation of these men to Algeria.  If theses 
repatriations take place it would reportedly be 
the first involuntary transfers of a detainee out 
of Guantanamo by the current administration.   
</p>
<p>In connection with the information referred to 
above, concern is expressed about the physical 
and psychological integrity of the six 
individuals of Algerian nationality if they are 
transferred to Algeria.  Concern is further 
expressed about the allegations of the use of 
diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against 
the risk of torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>well-founded fear of persecution. The United 
States considers detainee transfers on a case-
by-case basis, taking into account a wide 
variety of information from a range of 
sources &#8211;including submissions received 
from the detainee and/or his counsel&#8212; 
regarding the particular circumstances of the 
transfer, the proposed receiving country 
(including both its general human rights 
record and its record in handling previously &#8211;
transferred detainees), the individual 
concerned and any concerns about serious 
mistreatment that may arise in the context of 
the transfer, whether form Governmental or 
private actors. 
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Obama 
Administration, the United States has 
transferred 64 detainees to 25 different 
destinations. More than half of these 64 
detainees were resettled in third  countries 
because the U.S. Department of State, 
working together with the other five agencies, 
determined that they could not be returned to 
their country of origin due to humane 
treatment concerns. We are not aware of any 
credible reports of mistreatment occurring in 
the aftermath of any of these transfers. 
</p>
<p>The United States has applied the 
aforementioned policies and practices in 
determining whether particular Algerian 
detainees held at Guantanamo could be 
appropriately repatriated to Algeria. Due to 
restrictions related to litigation involving 
some of these individuals, we limit our 
discussion here to the cases of Abdul Aziz 
Naji and Saiid Farhi. Both individuals alleged 
generalized fears of mistreatment by either 
the Government of Algeria or terrorist groups 
in Algeria. In considering whether these fears 
were credible, the United States considered </p>

<p>not only the claims asserted by these two 
individuals, but also whether there were any 
credible allegations of serious mistreatment 
related to past transfers to Algeria. In 
particular, we considered the fact that ten 
detainees previously have been repatriated 
from Guantanamo to Algeria without any 
credible allegations brought to our attention 
of post-transfer mistreatment, and that neither 
Mr. Naji nor Mr. Farhi presented treatment 
concerns in a manner that suggested any 
particularized likelihood of harm that would 
set their cases apart from the previously 
repatriated Algerian detainees. Upon 
reviewing and considering all of the concerns 
they raised in this context, the United States 
concluded that both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi 
could be repatriated consistent with the 
aforementioned policies on post-transfer 
humane treatment. 
</p>
<p>Both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi filed several 
motions in U.S. federal courts to stop their 
transfer to Algeria. Mr. Naji&#8217;s motions were 
considered and denied by two U.S. federal 
district court judges, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
(D.C. Circuit), and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Mr. Farhi, sought and obtained fro the district 
court an injunction barring his transfer to 
Algeria, but the D.C. Circuit reversed that 
decision, and the U.S. Supreme court 
declined to block his transfer. In reaching 
these decisions, the courts have relied upon 
the policy of the United States not to transfer 
detainees where it determines that they are 
more likely than not to be tortured, and the 
determination of the Department of State that 
Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi can be repatriated to 
Algeria consistent with that policy.

<p>The United States has and will continue to 
apply its post-transfer humane treatment 
policies to all detainee transfers, including 
any future transfers to Algeria. In the event 
we determine that a particular Algerian 
national cannot be appropriately repatriated to 
Algeria consistent with these policies, either 
because of information that comes to light 
about the general treatment of transferred

<p>If repatriated to Algeria, Mr. Abdul Aziz Naji 
</p>
<p>By a letter dated 13/8/2010, the United States 
reteirated its committed to ensuring that 
transfers from Guantanamo conform to our 
post-transfer humane treatment policies and 
welcomes this opportunity to respond. On his 
second full day in office, President Obama 
ordered Guantanamo closed. His commitment 
to doing so has not wavered, even as closing 
Guantanamo has proven to be an arduous and </p>

<p>would reportedly face a real and serious risk of 
being subject to torture or ill-treatment.  The 
risk would reportedly originate from the 
Algerian security services as well as from non-
State actors operating in the country.  
According to reports received, the U.S. 
Government would have obtained diplomatic 
assurances from the Algerian authorities with 
regard to this case.   
</p>
<p>If this repatriation has taken place it would 
reportedly be the first involuntary transfers of a 
detainee out of Guantanamo by the current 
administration.   
</p>
<p>In connection with the information referred to 
above, concern is expressed about the physical 
and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdul Aziz 
Naji if repatriated to Algeria.  Concern is 
further expressed about the allegations of the 
use of diplomatic assurances as a safeguard 
against the risk of torture and ill-treatment.   
</p>
<p>painstaking process. A task force comprised 
of representatives from six federal agencies 
scrupulously considered each Guantanamo 
detainee&#8217;s case to assess whether the detainee 
could be transferred or repatriated consistent 
with U.S. national security, the interests of 
justice, and our policy not to transfer 
individuals to countries where they would 
more likely than not face torture or, in 
appropriate cases, where the individual has a 
well-founded fear of persecution. The United 
States considers detainee transfers on a case-
by-case basis, taking into account a wide 
variety of information from a range of 
sources &#8211;including submissions received 
from the detainee and/or his counsel&#8212; 
regarding the particular circumstances of the 
transfer, the proposed receiving country 
(including both its general human rights 
record and its record in handling previously &#8211;
transferred detainees), the individual 
concerned and any concerns about serious 
mistreatment that may arise in the context of 
the transfer, whether form Governmental or 
private actors. 
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Obama 
Administration, the United States has 
transferred 64 detainees to 25 different 
destinations. More than half of these 64 
detainees were resettled in third  countries 
because the U.S. Department of State, 
working together with the other five agencies, 
determined that they could not be returned to 
their country of origin due to humane 
treatment concerns. We are not aware of any 
credible reports of mistreatment occurring in 
the aftermath of any of these transfers. 
</p>
<p>The United States has applied the 
aforementioned policies and practices in 
determining whether particular Algerian </p>

<p>detainees held at Guantanamo could be 
appropriately repatriated to Algeria. Due to 
restrictions related to litigation involving 
some of these individuals, we limit our 
discussion here to the cases of Abdul Aziz 
Naji and Saiid Farhi. Both individuals alleged 
generalized fears of mistreatment by either 
the Government of Algeria or terrorist groups 
in Algeria. In considering whether these fears 
were credible, the United States considered 
not only the claims asserted by these two 
individuals, but also whether there were any 
credible allegations of serious mistreatment 
related to past transfers to Algeria. In 
particular, we considered the fact that ten 
detainees previously have been repatriated 
from Guantanamo to Algeria without any 
credible allegations brought to our attention 
of post-transfer mistreatment, and that neither 
Mr. Naji nor Mr. Farhi presented treatment 
concerns in a manner that suggested any 
particularized likelihood of harm that would 
set their cases apart from the previously 
repatriated Algerian detainees. Upon 
reviewing and considering all of the concerns 
they raised in this context, the United States 
concluded that both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi 
could be repatriated consistent with the 
aforementioned policies on post-transfer 
humane treatment. 
</p>
<p>Both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi filed several 
motions in U.S. federal courts to stop their 
transfer to Algeria. Mr. Naji&#8217;s motions were 
considered and denied by two U.S. federal 
district court judges, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
(D.C. Circuit), and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Mr. Farhi, sought and obtained fro the district 
court an injunction barring his transfer to 
Algeria, but the D.C. Circuit reversed that 
decision, and the U.S. Supreme court </p>

<p>declined to block his transfer. In reaching 
these decisions, the courts have relied upon 
the policy of the United States not to transfer 
detainees where it determines that they are 
more likely than not to be tortured, and the 
determination of the Department of State that 
Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi can be repatriated to 
Algeria consistent with that policy. 
</p>
<p>The United States transferred Mr. Naji to the 
custody of the Government of Algeria on July 
18, 2010 . He was held for questioning in 
accordance with Algerian law, which allows 
terrorism suspects to be held in detention for 
up to twelve days before appearing in court. 
Reports that Mr. Naji has been indicated are 
inaccurate. He was released on July 25 after 
appearing before a magistrate, who opened 
criminal proceedings against Mr. Naji and 
ordered that the report to the local police 
station on a weekly basis pending further 
investigation of this case. As indicated in 
numerous press reports, as well as a statement 
issued by his lawyers, Mr. Naji is at home 
with his family. He has indicated that he was 
treated well by the Government of Algeria 
during the initial period of detention. Mr. 
Farhi currently remains at Guantanamo. 
</p>
<p>The United States has and will continue to 
apply its post-transfer humane treatment 
policies to all detainee transfers, including 
any future transfers to Algeria. In the event 
we determine that a particular Algerian 
national cannot be appropriately repatriated to 
Algeria consistent with these policies, either 
because of information that comes to light 
about the general treatment of transferred 
Guantanamo detainees, or because of 
particularized concerns, then the repatriation 
will not occur until such concerns are 
addressed. </p>

<p>237.  08/09/10 AL TOR Concerning the physical and mental integrity 
of Mr. Mahmoud Hekmat Rashid Al-Khayat, a 
Palestinian refugee who lived in Al Badawi 
Camp in Tripoli, Lebanon. Mr. Al-Khayat 
spent the last 20 years in Karrada, a district of 
Baghdad, Iraq, where he worked as a general 
trader in Iraq. He is currently living in Syria 
with his wife and children. 
</p>
<p>On 15 February 2005, Mr. Al-Khayat was 
arrested in the Karrada District of Baghdad by 
Multinational Forces, American Battalion 101, 
who were reportedly wearing uniforms at the 
time of the arrest.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Khayat was reportedly initially 
detained in the Saddam Hussein International 
airport for a week, from 15 to 22 February 
2005, and was then transferred to the Abu 
Ghraib prison where he allegedly remained for 
a period of five months, from the end of 
February to the end of July 2005. According to 
reports received, Mr. Al-Khayat was then 
transferred to the Bouka Prison in Basra where 
he was detained for a period of one year, until 
the end of July 2006. During this time, he was 
visited for the first time by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on 17 
October 2005. Mr. Al-Khayat was then 
reportedly transferred back to the Abu Ghraib 
prison for two months, until the end of 
September 2006. His detention then allegedly 
continued at the Saddam Hussein International 
airport for a period of 7 months, until April 
</p><p>2007. It has been reported that during the time 
that Mr. Al-Khayat was under the custody of 
the American Battalion 101, he was held in 
secret detention for a period of three months, 
between 15 February and 15 May 2005.  
</p>
<p>According to the information received, on 24 
April 2007, Mr. Al-Khayat was handed over to 
the Iraqi authorities. Following his transfer,

<p>Mr. Al-Khayat was detained in the Badush 
prison in Mosul city for 8 months, during 
which he was tried. In November 2007, he was 
reportedly transferred to the Soussa Castle 
where he remained for a period of sixteenth 
months, during which time he was again 
visited by the ICRC on 3 June 2008. In April 
2009, he was transferred to the Al Rasafa 
prison. Mr. Al-Khayat was finally released, 
having been considered to have completed his 
sentence, on 18 October 2009, after 4 years and 
8 months of detention, and repatriated to the 
Syria Arab Republic under the auspices of the 
ICRC that same day. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, Mr. Al-
Khayat suffered torture and ill-treatment while 
in detention both in the hands of the American 
Battalion 101 and the Iraqi authorities. Under 
the custody of the American Battalion 101, in 
addition to being severly beaten, Mr. Al-
Khayat was reportedly tortured with an electric 
gun, had pepper spray sprayed in his eyes, his 
front teeth were broken, and a vein on his wrist 
was cut allegedly as a result of being shot by a 
U.S. soldier. It has been reported that, while in 
the hands of the Iraqi authorities, Mr. Al-
Khayat was forced to stand in the sun for 
extended periods of time and was severely 
beaten. It is alleged that the aim of this torture 
was to force Mr. Al-Khayat to make 
confessions, which he did. He was not allowed 
to read these confessions, which were later 
used in his trial.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Khayat was tried in 2006 by the Iraqi 
authorities reportedly without being allowed to 
appoint a lawyer. It is alleged that during the 
trial, he informed the court that these 
confessions had been taken under torture but 
the court reportedly did not take this into 
account. He was sentenced to three years, on </p>

<p>238.  26/11/10 JAL TOR; 
TERR 
</p>
<p>Concerning information which originates from 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s own files, 
and has become publicly dubbed &#8220;the Wiki 
leaks Iraq War logs&#8221; relating to the alleged 
complicity in the torture and ill-treatment of 
Iraqi citizens by forces of United States of 
America in Iraq. We wish to inform your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government that we have 
addressed a similar letter to the Government of 
Iraq. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received, there 
was extensive abuse of detainees by Iraqi 
security forces over a five-year period between 
2004 and 2009. United States authorities had 
knowledge of the systematic use of torture and 
other ill-treatment by Coalition, Iraqi and 
private security officials; and, in most cases, 
failed to intervene to prevent and/or investigate 
hundreds of reports of systematic abuse and 
torture. The information also suggests that such 
acts were conducted with impunity and appear 
to go normally unpunished. The information 
contains allegations that US forces acting 
under &#8220;fragmentary orders,&#8221; &#8220;Frago 242&#8221; and 
&#8220;Frago 039&#8221; were required to make no 
intervention in cases of abuse and/or torture 
involving Iraqis if the US troops were not 
initially involved. The orders also required US 
forces to report abuse to the US command but 
not to conduct any further investigation or take 
any further action to stop abuse or torture 
unless instructed to do so by higher order.  
</p>
<p>We wish to draw your attention to three 
examples from &#8220;the war logs&#8221; as illustrations 
of several hundred allegations of systematic 
torture and ill-treatment recorded by US 
personnel.

<p>In addition, we have received information that 
thousands of Iraqi nationals who had been 
detained by US forces were handed over from 
US to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and 
July 2010 under a November 2008 US-Iraq 
agreement that contains no provisions for 
safeguarding the detainees&#8217; physical and 
mental integrity after the transfer. Article 4(3) 
of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), 
taking effect at midnight on 31 December 
2008, only states in broad terms that: &#8220;It is the 
duty of the United States Forces to respect the 
laws, customs, and traditions of Iraq and 
applicable international law.&#8221; Many of the 
detainees transferred into Iraqi custody are 
suspected of terrorism-related offences on the 
basis of the 2005 Iraqi Anti-Terrorism Law.

<p>During the second full day in Office, 
President Obama issued Three Executive 
Orders providing for comprehensive review 
and reform of U.S. detention, interrogation 
and transfer policies. These Executive Orders 
reaffirmed that all persons in U.S. custody 
must eb treated humanely as a matter of law. 
For example, it is required that the 
International Committee of the red 
Cross(ICRC) be given notice and timely 
access to any individual detained in any 
armed conflict in the custody or under the 
effective control of the United States 
Government, consistent with Department of 
Defense regulations and policies. 
</p>
<p>One of the orders, Executive order 13491, 
created a special task force on Interrogation 
and Transfer Policies. Following a review of 
u.S. transfer policies, on August 24, 2009, the 
Task Force made a number of 
recommendations to the President on order to 
ensure that U.S. transfer pracitices comply 
with the domestic laws, international 
obligations, and policies of the United States 
and do not result in the transfer of individuals 
to other nations to fact torture or otherwise to 
undermine or circumvent the obligations of 
the United States to ensure the humane 
treatment of individuals in its custody or 
control. These recommendations have been 
accepted by the President. 
</p>
<p>As President Obama reteirated to the General 
Assembly in September, &#8220;living our values 
doesn&#8217;t make us weaker, it makes us safer 
and it makes us stronger.&#8221; We look forward 
to continuing to work closely with U.N 
Member States and to remaining in an open 
dialogie with the Special Procedures mandate 
holders to advance this collective goal. </p>

<p>240.     Mr. William  Coleman (A/HRC/13/39/Add.1, 
para.,279) 
</p>
<p>By a letter dated 9/3/2010, the Government of 
the United States of America indicated that 
Mr. Coleman was transferred from 
MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution 
to Corrigan-Radgowski correctional 
Institution on October 6, 2009. Your 
December 11, 2009 letter alleges that since 
April 2009, Mr. Coleman has been force-fed 
at least six times. Unfortunately, without a 
medical release details of his medical 
treatment to the Department of States or the 
United Nations, the Department of 
Corrections is unable to respond to these 
allegations in any detail. Please note that the 
Connecticut Department of Corrections 
continues to treat Mr. Coleman in a humane 
manner, consistent with medical necessity 
and the court order currently in effect. 
</p>
<p>In your letter, you also assert that Mr. 
Coleman was placed in a &#8220;restrictive 
suicide/observation cell,&#8221; even though he was 
allegedly not suicidal. The Connecticut 
Department of Corrections states that inmate 
observation cells within Connecticut&#8217;s 
prisons can be and are used for purposes other 
than housing suicidal inmates. The cells are 
used when an inmate needs to be closely 
observed, which may occur for a variety of 
r4easons. The cells are not used for punitive 
reasons.

para.,278) 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 14/01/2010, the Government 
indicated that 35 other states and the Federal 
Government, Ohio has chosen to impose 
capital punishment for certain crimes. 
Virtually all states, as well as the Federal 
Government, use lethal injection as an 
exclusive or alternate method for the 
execution of condemned prisoners. Lethal 
injection generally involves a so-called 
&quot;three-drug protocol&quot; employing the </p>

<p>intravenous (IV) administration of a massive 
dose of sodium thiopental, an anesthetic 
which renders the prisoner unconscious, 
followed by intravenous administration of 
pancuronium bromide, a paralytic agent, and 
potassium chloride, a drug that stops the 
heart. The process for obtaining IV sites is 
identical to the process used by hospitals to 
administer drugs or fluids to patients. It 
involves inserting a needle (catheter) into a 
vein. Lethal injection has been regarded by 
the courts of the United States as the most 
modern and humane method for the execution 
of prisoners sentenced to death. Nevertheless, 
during the past five years, prisoners in 
virtually every state have brought suits 
claiming that the lethal injection process 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in 
violation of the U.S. Constitution. In April of 
2008, the Supreme Court of the United States 
substantially laid this issue to rest when it 
upheld Kentucky's lethal injection procedure 
and &quot;three-drug protocol&quot; for the execution of 
condemned prisoners. 
</p>
<p>The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and 
Correction (ODRC) is the Ohio state agency 
with the responsibility for carrying out 
executions. Executions generally commence 
at 10:00 a.m. on the date specified by the 
warrant issued by the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
However, it is the policy of ODRC to delay 
the commencement of an execution when a 
request for a stay of execution or other legal 
action by the prisoner remains pending before 
the courts. Until its formal modification on 
November 30, 2009, the ODRC written 
directive for the conduct of executions 
required the use of the so-called &quot;three-drug 
protocol&quot; for carrying out court-ordered 
executions. Ohio's &quot;three-drug protocol&quot; is 
substantially similar to the &quot;three-drug </p>

<p>protocol&quot; used by Kentucky and the other 
states. The directive provided that in the   
event of difficulties in obtaining viable sites 
for the intravenous administration of the three 
drugs, the Warden of Southern Ohio 
Correctional Facility (SOCF), in consultation 
with the Director of the ODRC and other 
state officials, would determine whether or 
how long to continue efforts to obtain 
intravenous (IV) access.

<p>On October 22, 1985, Mr. Broom was 
sentenced to death for the aggravated murder 
of 14-year-old Tryna Middleton. On June 25, 
2007, Broom, along with several other 
convicted prisoners in Ohio, joined in a 
lawsuit filed by another condemned prisoner 
under Title 42, Section 1983 of the United 
States Code, which permits prisoners to seek 
redress in the federal courts for alleged 
violations of their constitutional rights. Like 
the prisoners in Kentucky and other states, 
Mr. Broom and all of the Ohio prisoners 
claimed that Ohio's use of a so-called &quot;three-
drug protocol&quot; to execute them would violate 
their constitutional right to be free from cruel 
and unusual punishment. Mr. Broom and 
several other prisoners subsequently were 
permitted to join the original suit as 
intervenors, alleging the same or similar 
claims with the assurance that the judge 
presiding over that suit would also preside 
over their complaints. However, the district 
court held that Mr. Broom and several other 
prisoners had waited too long to bring suit 
and that therefore their suits were untimely. 
On September 1, 2009, that judgment was 
upheld by the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Sixth Circuit.

<p>September 15, 2009, at SOCF in Lucasville, 
Ohio. On the morning of September 15, 2009, 
the commencement of Mr. Broom's execution 
was delayed approximately three and a half 
hours to permit the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Sixth Circuit to consider Mr. Broom's 
final request for a stay of execution. At about 
12:50 p.m., the prison officials received 
notification that the Sixth Circuit had denied 
Mr. Broom's request, and the execution was 
set to commence at 1:30 p.m. 
</p>
<p>At about 2:00 p.m., the medical team 
members of Ohio State's execution team 
entered Mr. Broom's cell to insert IV 
catheters in his arms, for the purpose of 
intravenously administering the drugs used in 
Ohio's execution process. The medical team 
included persons certified as Emergency 
Medical Technicians. The medical team made 
periodic efforts to insert IV catheters 
(needles) until about 3:48 p.m. During that 
time, a physician employed by the prison also 
attempted to insert an IV catheter. Eighteen 
total attempts were made to insert IV 
catheters, all of which were unsuccessful. It is 
believed that Mr. Broom's prior illegal drug 
use may have caused his veins to have 
become degraded, thus making vein access 
more difficult. As is standard practice, 
witnesses to the execution, which included 
victim representatives, media representatives, 
and counsel for Broom, were able to observe 
by means of a video monitor the efforts to 
gain vein access. 
</p>
<p>At about 4:07 p.m., the Director of the ODRC 
contacted the Office of the Governor of Ohio 
and requested that the execution be 
postponed, due to the inability to insert IV 
catheters capable of administering the drugs 
to be used in the execution. This action was </p>

<p>consistent with the Department's written 
policy governing the conduct of executions. 
At about 4:24 p.m., the ODRC Director was 
informed that the Governor of Ohio had 
issued a reprieve postponing Mr. Broom's 
execution. 
</p>
<p>After the postponement of Mr. Broom's 
execution, the district court permitted the 
other prisoners remaining in the suit to 
depose under oath the members of the 
execution team who participated in Mr. 
Broom's attempted execution, their 
supervisors, and Mr. Broom himself. Mr. 
Broom testified that he cried during the 
attempted execution as the result of severe 
pain he claimed that he suffered during the 
unsuccessful attempts to insert IV catheters in 
his arm and foot. Mr. Edwin Voorhies, an 
Ohio Department of Corrections Official who 
was present during the attempted execution, 
testified that after several initial attempts to 
insert IV catheters were unsuccessful, Mr. 
Broom held one of his arms over his face and 
appeared to be crying. 
</p>
<p>Following the postponement of Mr. Broom's 
execution, attorneys for Mr. Broom filed with 
the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Ohio a new complaint on 
his behalf alleging violations of his rights 
under the Constitution of the United States. In 
the complaint, Mr. Broom alleged that the 
attempted execution (and the state's failure to 
effectively insert IV catheters) had violated 
his right to be free from cruel and unusual 
punishment. Without objection by the state 
government of Ohio, the federal district court 
temporarily enjoined Mr. Broom's execution 
and set a hearing for November 30, 2009. 
Without objection by the state, the federal 
district court delayed the hearing until </p>

<p>December 9, 2009. 
</p>
<p>In the meantime, on November 13, 2009, 
Ohio announced that it has modified its 
execution procedures to require the use of a 
single drug to be administered intravenously. 
The &quot;one drug procedure&quot; involves a single, 
fatal dose of sodium thiopental intravenously 
administered. An alternative procedure is also 
now provided, to be used where the state 
encounters difficulties in inserting IV 
catheters. In such cases, the state will 
administer intramuscularly a lethal dose of a 
combination of hydromorphone and 
midazolam, drugs commonly used in hospital 
settings for pain and anxiety relief. These 
drugs, which are used in the clinical setting as 
anti-pain and anti-anxiety medications, are 
administered for the purpose of execution in 
dosage amounts which bring about death 
painlessly by rendering the prisoner 
unconscious and causing the prisoner to stop 
breathing. The advantage of using these drugs 
is that they can be administered via an 
injection into the muscles of the arm, a 
relatively uncomplicated process that causes 
an extremely low degree of pain comparable 
to the pain experienced in receiving an 
influenza vaccine or an antibiotic shot. On 
November 25, 2009, the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that 
Ohio's changes to its execution procedures, 
specifically, its discontinued use of the so-
called &quot;three drug protocol,&quot; rendered moot 
the question of whether Ohio's previous 
procedures were unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p>After the modification of Ohio's procedures 
and the postponement of Mr. Broom's 
execution, another convicted prisoner, 
Kenneth Biros, filed a new suit in which he 
claimed that Mr. Broom suffered severe pain </p>

<p>and that, as a result, the state's procedures for 
inserting IV catheters posed a substantial risk 
that he (Mr. Biros) would also suffer severe 
pain in violation of his rights under the 
Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and 
unusual punishment. In a hearing held on 
December 4, 2009, the district court found 
that Mr. Biros could not substantiate his 
claims. This decision was affirmed by the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit on December 7, 2009. In rejecting Mr. 
Biros' argument, and permitting his execution 
to go forward, the Sixth Circuit concluded 
that Mr. Biros had not effectively 
demonstrated that the attempted execution of 
Mr. Broom had violated his Eighth 
Amendment rights to be free from cruel and 
unusual punishment. Specifically, the Court 
found &quot;[t]he extensive depositions of Broom, 
members of his execution team, and other 
corrections personnel were part of the record 
before the district court and before us. We 
have reviewed those depositions and 
conclude that further discovery regarding the 
Broom incident-including deposing Governor 
Strickland, who has declined questioning-
would not bring to light evidence sufficient to 
enable Biros to demonstrate a likelihood of 
success on the merits of his Eighth 
Amendment claim based on the new 
protocol.&quot; 
</p>
<p>On December 9, 2009, the district court 
convened the hearing on Mr. Broom's new 
complaint. The district court found that Mr. 
Broom's complaint concerned the previous 
&quot;three- drug protocol&quot; and that, therefore, his 
suit was mooted by the change to the new 
&quot;one drug&quot; procedure. The district court, 
therefore, ordered Mr. Broom to file by 
January 8, 2010, an amended complaint to 
present any challenges he may have to the </p>

<p>Ohio's &quot;one drug&quot; procedure. The district 
court also ordered several other prisoners, 
whose complaints remain pending, to amend 
their complaints by the latter deadline. In so 
ruling, the district court did not rule on any of 
Mr. Broom's claims. However, the district 
court noted that many of Mr. Broom's claims 
appeared foreclosed by the December 7, 2009 
decision of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
</p>
<p>As indicated above, the attempted execution 
of Mr. Broom on September 15, 2009, has 
been reviewed thoroughly by the federal 
courts, in conjunction with legal challenges to 
Ohio's execution procedures by Mr. Broom 
and other prisoners, and Mr. Broom's 
challenge to the new procedure continues to

<p>242. Uzbekistan 22/01/10 AL TOR Concerning the rape of several men and 
women by the police while in custody. 
</p>
<p>On 9 May 2009, three sisters, K., R., aged 26 
and N.S., aged 21 were detained and taken to 
the Mirzo Ulughbek district police station in 
Tashkent, where they were allegedly raped by 
several police officers and investigators. 
Subsequently, Ms. K. and R. S. were charged 
for hooliganism and robbery and sentenced to 
seven and a half years in prison. Ms. N.S. was 
released on bail and is currently at a mental 
hospital. She is in a poor state of health, 
reportedly as a result of the violence she was 
subjected to while in police custody. On 17 
December, R. S. gave birth to a premature baby 
at a hospital near the prison. Her relatives were 
not allowed to visit her. It is believed that the 
Tashkent city Prosecutor&#8217;s Office began an 
investigation, but no information has been 
provided to the relatives and other interested 
parties. 
</p>
<p>By letter dated 10/03/2010, the Government 
indicated that on 9 May 2009, the 
investigative unit of the Internal Affairs 
Office for the Mirzo-Ulugbek district of 
Tashkent instituted criminal proceedings 
against sisters Ms. N. S., Ms. R. S. and Ms. 
K. S. under article 164, paragraph 3 (b) 
(Large-scale robbery involving unlawful 
entry of a dwelling, storehouse or other 
premises), of the Criminal Code of 
Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The criminal case was opened on the basis of 
a statement given by Ms. N. Ashirmetova on 
9 May 2009 to the effect that, on 8 May 2009, 
Ms. N. S., Ms. R. S. and Ms. K. S. had 
entered her home unlawfully, attacked her, 
bound her hands and feet, cut off her hair to 
the roots and inflicted bodily harm on her. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the S. sisters had caused 
material damage totalling 2 million sum and </p>

<p>In Yunusobod District in Tashkent, four 16 and 
17 year-old boys were detained for theft, and 
were raped by the police. One of the boys 
obtained a medical certificate confirming the 
rape. The boys were sentenced to long prison 
terms, and the perpetrators have not been 
punished.  
</p>
<p>In a separate case, a woman was allegedly 
raped by several men at the Sabir Rahimov 
district police office in Tashkent. Her husband 
threatened to divorce her if she publicized the 
case. Ms. D.S, whose two sons were sentenced 
to death for terrorism was taken into police 
custody. She was undressed in front of her sons 
and threatened with rape. In yet another case, a 
woman suspected of being the leader of Hizb 
Uz Tahrir, an Islamic group, was detained and 
raped by the police in the Kashkadarva region 
in 2009. She did not file a complaint due to the 
shame it would produce to her family.

<p>taken cash in an amount of 2 million sum, 
gold items worth a total of 1,950,000 sum and 
a Nokia-6300 mobile telephone worth 
280,000 sum. 
</p>
<p>In the course of the investigation, Ms. 
Ashirmetova was interviewed and declared 
the victim in the case. During the interview, 
she was shown photographs of the suspects, 
Ms. N. S.,  
</p>
<p>Ms. R. S. and Ms. K. S., whom she identified 
as the persons who had robbed and assaulted 
her. 
</p>
<p>When the scene of the incident was 
examined, a knife, a pair of scissors, strands 
of female hair, a shampoo bottle and other 
items were removed as material evidence. 
</p>
<p>A fingerprint expert concluded that the prints 
found on the shampoo bottle removed from 
the scene were those of Ms. R. S.. 
</p>
<p>On 9 May 2009, a search was conducted of 
the S. sisters&#8217; home, during which gold items 
and a Nokia-6300 mobile telephone were 
found and removed. 
</p>
<p>On 16 May 2009, Ms. N. S., Ms. R. S. and 
Ms. K. S. were declared suspects in the 
criminal case and arrested on the basis of 
article 221 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
of Uzbekistan. From the time of their arrest, 
they were fully informed of their rights and 
duties under article 48 of the Code, and they 
were guaranteed State protection. 
</p>
<p>A confrontation between the victim, Ms. 
Ashirmetova, and the suspects, Ms. N. S., 
Ms. R. S. and Ms. K. S., took place.

remanded in custody by a decision of the 
Mirzo-Ulugbek district criminal court. Given 
that she was a student and had not played an 
active part in the offence, Ms. K. S. was 
released on a recognizance. 
</p>
<p>According to the findings of the forensic 
medical examination conducted on 21 May 
2009, Ms. Ashirmetova had suffered minor 
bodily harm resulting in short-term damage to 
health. 
</p>
<p>As required by criminal procedure legislation, 
on 21 May 2009 the gold items and mobile 
telephone removed during the search of the 
home of the accused persons were shown to 
the victim, Ms. Ashirmetova, for 
identification; among other items, she picked 
out a gold chain, a wedding ring and a Nokia-
6300 mobile telephone as belonging to her. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Ashirmetova&#8217;s neighbours and Mr. O. 
Isakhodzhaev, husband of Ms. N. S., were 
questioned as witnesses in the case. 
</p>
<p>In the course of the investigation, the alibis 
and claims put forward by the accused 
persons were fully verified, but the witness 
statements of Ms. P. Prosyankova, Mr. S. 
Zakirov, Mr. G. Daminov and others did not 
corroborate their claims.

<p>Pursuant to an application by her lawyer, Ms. 
K. S. underwent a forensic psychiatric 
examination and was found to be in good

Samarkand Regional Criminal Court to ten 
years&#8217; imprisonment on 18 October 2005 and 
has been detained in the Ou/la 64/49 colony in 
Karshi.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Kholjigitov and Mr. Akbulatov were the 
subjects of an allegation letter sent on 25 July 
2005, by the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. The 
response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
was received on 28 November 2005. A further 
urgent appeal regarding Mr. Kholjigitov was 
sent on 27 October 2008, by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. No response has yet 
been received to that communication from your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government. 
</p>
<p>The health condition of Mr. Kholjigitov and 
Mr. Akbulatov has deteriorated significantly 
over the past year. Mr. Kholjigitov has diabetes 
and his blood sugar levels have become very 
high. As a result of his untreated condition, 
gangrenes have appeared on his left leg, hands 
and face and he has now lost all his teeth. Mr. 
Kholjigitov has also contracted bronchial 
asthma at the end of last year. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Akbulatov lost a significant amount of 
weight and now weighs only 55 kilograms His 
eyes have been infected and his right leg has 
almost completely lost sensitivity. Moreover, it 
was reported that Mr. Akbulatov was being

the Samarkand provincial criminal court of 22 
November 2005. Mr. Okpulatov is serving his 
sentence in institution UY 64/45 in Tashkent 
province. Mr. Okpulatov has been disciplined 
on several occasions for failing to comply 
with the lawful demands of the prison 
administration and breaching internal 
regulations. In this connection, criminal 
proceedings were instituted against him, and 
he was convicted by a judgement of the 
Navoi criminal court of 30 September 2009 
under article 221, paragraph 2 (b), of the 
Criminal Code and sentenced to 
imprisonment for a term of three years and 
eight days, to be served in a strict regime 
colony. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with standard procedure, 
convicted person Mr. Okpulatov underwent a 
full medical examination on entering prison 
and was registered as a clinic patient with a 
diagnosis of post-traumatic cataract of the left 
eye (the injury was sustained in childhood). 
He has not recently complained of any 
deterioration in his health. At present, the 
state of health of the convicted person is 
satisfactory, and his weight is within normal

<p>Uzbekistan. By a decision of the criminal 
chamber of the Supreme Court of 17 July 
2000, the length of the penalty was reduced to 
18 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>While serving his sentence in places of 
detention, the convict N. Z. continued his 
criminal activity, for which criminal action 
was again brought against him. By a 
judgement of 14 May 2004 of the Navoi 
provincial criminal court N. Z. was found 
guilty under article 159, paragraph 3 (a) and 
(b) (infringement of the constitutional order 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan), of the 
Criminal Code and sentenced to 15 years&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty to be served in a strict 
regime colony. 
</p>
<p>As from 14 April 2009 the convict N. Z 
served his sentence in institution UYA-64/48 
(in Zarafshan, Novoi province). While 
serving his sentence N. Z. incurred a 
disciplinary penalty 13 times for admitted 
breaches of the rules governing the serving of 
his sentence. 
</p>
<p>On 3 June 2009 the convict N. Z. was granted 
a long meeting with his parents. The 
administration did not receive any complaints 
or representations thereafter from his parents. 
</p>
<p>On 15 June 2009 the convict N. Z. committed 
suicide by hanging himself. Forensic report 
No. ZA 31 of 15 June 2009 came to the 
conclusion that N. Z.&#8217;s death was caused by 
mechanical asphyxiation. 
</p>
<p>A further investigation did not show that N. 
Z. had been subjected to any violence by the 
staff of the colony or other persons. Hence 
the decision of 25 June 2009 of the 
investigator of the Navoi Procurator&#8217;s Office 
responsible for the supervision of compliance 
with the law in places of detention to initiate </p>

</p>
<p>The senior managers of the colony K. 
Nuraliev, S. Boimuratov and Inspector T. 
Safarov were disciplined for failure to 
exercise due supervision of the conduct and 
actions of N. Z., who committed suicide. 
</p>
<p>It must be noted in response to the unfounded 
accusations in the complaint from the special 
procedures of the United Nations that, in all 
penal institutions, all the conditions allowing 
convicts to observe religious rites have been 
created in accordance with penal enforcement 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>Convicts are allowed to perform religious 
rites and to use religious articles and religious 
literature. The performance of religious rites 
is voluntary and must not &#8220;breach the 
regulations of the penal institution or 
prejudice the rights and lawful interests of 
other persons&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>In UYA-64/48, as in all other penal 
institutions, convicts are not punished for the 
performance of religious rites, they are not 
tortured in any way and they are not put in the 
disciplinary section.

<p>2. S.Z., born in 1968, is a citizen of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan with a criminal 
record. He worked as a conductor before his 
arrest. 
</p>
<p>By a judgement of 22 June 2000 of the

<p>The convict S. Z., who is serving his sentence 
in institution UYA-64/3, situated in the 
Bostanlyk district of the Tashkent region, has 
incurred a disciplinary penalty eight times, 
including on one occasion one month in the 
punishment cell, for failure to comply with 
the lawful demands of the prison 
administration and breach of the prison 
regulations. In connection therewith he has 
been prosecuted and by a judgement of 11 
January 2008 of the Bostanlyk district 
criminal court he was found guilty under 
article 221, paragraph 2 (b) (failure to comply 
with the lawful demands of the administration 
of a penal institution), of the Criminal Code 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan and sentenced 
to three years and six months&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty to be served in a strict regime colony. 
</p>
<p>The convict S. Z. has been serving his 
sentence in institution UYA-64/46 (in Navoi) 
since 3 February 2008. During this period he 
has had three disciplinary penalties. 
According to the prison administration&#8217;s 
records, S. Z. shuns participation in 
educational measures and work, he does not 
attend educational talks, he does not 
understand the essence of the crime which he 
committed and he does not regret its 
commission. 
</p>
<p>On entering the penal institution he 
underwent a full medical examination and his 
medical record shows him as having been 
diagnosed with &#8220;osteochondrosis of the

<p>Concerning Mr. Le Cong Dinh, a prominent 
human rights lawyer. Mr. Dinh is well known 
for his defense of human rights advocates, 
bloggers, labor rights and democracy activists, 
and for his activities to promote democracy and 
the rule of law in Viet Nam. He is also known 
for expressing his views and criticisms 
regarding the policies of the Government of 
Viet Nam.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Dinh was the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 23 June 2009. We 
acknowledge receipt of your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government&#8217;s response dated 6 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>On 13 June 2009, Mr. Le Cong Dinh was 
arrested in his law office by the Investigation 
Agency of Viet Nam and detained in Ho Chi 
Minh City.  
</p>
<p>Although it has been first stated that Mr. Dinh 
</p>
<p>In a letter dated 7 April 2010, the 
Government indicated that Mr. Le Cong Dinh 
was arrested on 13 June 2009 and accused of 
activities violating Vietnamese laws.  On 20 
January 2010, the People&#8217;s Court of Ho Chi 
Minh City sentenced him to 5 years in prison 
and 3 years of probation according to article 
79 of the Penal Code which reads &#8220;those who 
carry out activities, establish or join an 
organization with intent to overthrow the 
people&#8217;s administration shall be subject to 
between five and fifteen years 
imprisonment&#8221;.  Investigations results show 
that Mr. Le Cong Dinh directly contacted and 
colluded with hostile forces and exile 
Vietnamese organizations and groups abroad, 
including those listed by the Vietnamese 
Government as terrorist groups in an attempt 
to prepare for riots and social instability and 
public disorder with the ultimate goal of 
overthrowing the State of Viet Nam.  Mr. 
Dinh also attended a training on rioting and 
violence operations organized in Thailand.  
During the period of provisional detention for 
investigation and trial, Mr. Le Cong Dinh is

<p>was arrested on the basis of Article 88 of Viet 
Nam&#8217;s Penal Code (&#8220;conducting propaganda 
against the Government&#8221;), he had been 
formally charged under Article 79 of the Penal 
Code, which punishes conspiring or planning 
to overthrow the Government. The trial has 
been set for 25 December 2009, and the 
charges against Mr. Le Cong Dinh carry a 
penalty of life imprisonment or the death 
penalty.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Le Cong Dinh has been held 
incommunicado since his arrest, except for two 
short visits by his wife. Although a legal 
counsel was appointed, Mr. Dinh has not been 
allowed to meet his attorney and in fact refused 
the appointed attorney as his legal counsel.  
</p>
<p>As a result of his arrest, Mr. Le Cong Dinh has 
been disbarred by the Ho Chi Minh City Bar 
Association, and the Ministry of Justice has 
revoked his license to practice law. 
</p>
<p>On 18 July 2009, a statement by Mr. Le Cong 
Dinh was broadcast on Viet Nam State 
Television, in which Mr. Dinh read a prepared 
statement confessing to the unofficial charges 
against him and denouncing democracy, the 
United States of America, and stating that the 
Viet Nam Reform Party was a terrorist 
organization.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the arrest and 
detention of, and subsequent charges against, 
Mr. Le Cong Dinh may be related to his 
peaceful activities in defense of human rights, 
democracy and the rule of law in Viet Nam. 
Further serious concern is expressed regarding 
the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Le Cong Dinh in light of his incommunicado 
detention. We would also wish to register their 
concern that the public statement and 
confession of Mr. Dinh may have been 
</p>
<p>offender without discrimination or ill-
treatment, including the rights to be assisted 
by a lawyer of his own choosing and to be 
visited by his family.  However, he refused 
the lawyer&#8217;s assistance and wanted to be 
defended by himself.  His personal decision, 
confirmed by his family, was respected.  The 
decision of the Ho Chi Minh City Bar 
Association disbarring Mr. Dinh resulted 
from his activities violating the rules and 
regulations of the Bar Association, such as 
article 2 of the Rules of the Ho Chi Minh Bar 
Association, which in parts reads &#8220;the lawyer 
has to respect and obey the law&#8221; and the 
article 7 (on the rights and obligations of a 
lawyer) of the Vietnamese Bar Association.  
According to the 2006 Law of Lawyer (article 
18), the Ministry of Justice has revoked the 
license to practice law of Mr. Dinh.  All these 
decisions, made by the Ho Chi Minh Bar 
Association and the Ministry of Justice, are 
strictly in accordance with the existing laws 
of Viet Nam. </p>

already the subject of the Working Group on

Detention, the Special Rapporteur on freedom

freedom of opinion and expression dated 23 
February 2007. We acknowledge receipt of 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response 
dated 18 May 2007. The Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief has previously 
sent two communications to the Government of 
Viet Nam regarding Father Thadeus Nguyen 
Van Ly (see E/CN.4/1993/62, para. 68 and 
A/56/253, para. 77) to which your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government replied (see E/CN.4/1994/79, 
para. 80 and E/CN.4/2002/73, para. 114). 
</p>
<p>On 11 December 2009 Father Nguyen Van Ly 
was transferred back to Ba Sao prison, where 
he is currently serving an eight-year prison 
sentence for &#8220;carrying out propaganda against 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,&#8221; (Article 88 
of the Vietnamese Criminal Code). He was 
arrested on 18 or 19 February 2007 and 
sentenced on 30 March 2007 following a trial 
that lasted approximately four hours. He was 
denied access to counsel before and during the 
trial. 
</p>
<p>At Prison Hospital 198, which is run by the 
Ministry of Public Security in Hanoi, Father Ly 
had been recovering from a second stroke 
suffered in detention on 14 November 2009. 
Father Ly remains partially paralyzed on the 
right side of his body.  
</p>
<p>By letter dated 19/03/2010, the Government 
indicated that Mr. Nguyen Van Ly was 
accused of activities violating Vietnamese 
laws and sentenced to 8 years in prison by the 
People&#8217;s Court of Thua Thien Hue Province 
on 30 March 2007 according to the article 88 
of the Penal Code. He was allowed to have 
counsel but he refused to do so. The arrest, 
provisional detention and trial against Mr. Ly 
have been carried out in strict compliance 
with the sequence and procedures stipulated 
in existing Vietnamese laws, particularly the 
Criminal Procedures Code and also in line 
with international standards on human rights, 
particularly the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights and the International 
Convention on Civil and Political Rights. 
Many foreign diplomats and journalists, 
including those who came from the US and 
some European countries, were allowed to 
attend the court. There is no complaint lodged 
by and on behalf of Mr. Ly. 
</p>
<p>2. In the mid-year of 2009, when serving his 
eight-years prison sentence in Nam Ha 
prison, Mr. Ly had high blood pressure 
symptoms and was provided adequate 
medical treatment by the health care service 
of Nam Ha prison.  On 25 May 2009, Mr. Ly 
suffered a stroke which caused temporary 
paralysis of his arms and legs and some brain 
injuries, but was later recovered. Speaking 
with visitors, including the US Ambassador 
in Vietnam (on October 2009), Mr. Ly 
recognized that he has been provided 
adequate health care. On 14 November 2009, 
Mr. Ly again found paralysis on his right arm 
and leg. He was immediately moved to 
hospital for better medical treatment.

<p>During his detention, Father Ly has been 
mainly held in solitary confinement. He has 
suffered from high blood pressure and other 
health problems. In the seven months before 
the stroke, he had several bouts of ill-health for 
which the prison authorities neither provided a 
proper diagnosis nor adequate medical 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>Father Ly was first imprisoned for his criticism 
of the policies of the Vietnamese Government 
on religion in the late 1970s, and has already 
spent approximately 17 years in prison in 
relation to his activities promoting respect for 
human rights, including freedom of opinion, 
expression and religion. He is one of the 
founders of the internet-based movement &#8220;Bloc 
8406&#8221; which supports democracy, and has 
helped to set up other political groups which 
have subsequently been banned in Viet Nam. 
He also secretly published a journal entitled 
&#8220;To Do Ngon Luan&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Grave concerns are expressed in respect of 
Father Nguyen Van Ly&#8217;s state of health, 
particularly in view of reports that he has been 
transferred back to the prison despite not 
having fully recovered from a stroke. 
</p>
<p>was caused rather by brain injuries he 
suffered from last strike than by a new stroke. 
His health situation has been also informed to 
his family and the Hue Bishop. His family 
was allowed to look after him when he was at 
the hospital. A group of priests of Hue&#8217;s 
diocese lead by Archbishop Nguyen Nhu The 
also came to visit him. When his arm and leg 
were recovered and his health situation 
became better, he was moved back to the 
prison for the continuation of his sentence 
</p>
<p>3. Given Mr.Ly&#8217;s health situation and the 
risks of stroke are high and in the spirit of 
amnesty, on 12 March 2010 the People&#8217;s 
Court of Ha Nam Province had decided to 
postpone his imprisonment for a period of 12 
months, beginning from 15 march 2010, 
according to the article 61 of the Penal Code 
and allowed him to come back to Thua Thien 
Hue Province for health treatment. He is now 
residing at Hue&#8217;s Bishop.

<p>Allegations that Mr. Ly was denied access to 
counsel, not provided adequate medical

</p>
<p>On 21 May 2010, police officers from the 
Criminal Investigations Department (CID) 
raided GALZ offices in Milton Park, Harare, 
reportedly searching for dangerous narcotics 
and pornographic material. The police had a 
warrant to search for dangerous drugs and 
pornographic material citing contravention of 
Section 157 (1) of the Criminal Law 
(Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 
and Section 32 (1) of the Censorship and 
Entertainment Control Act Chapter 10:04.

to GALZ offices claiming that they were 
notified that the office had been raided. They 
requested entry into the office, but the guard 
did not have the keys. They left a message that 
they were to return on Monday 24 May 2010 to 
carry out another search.

further alleged that GALZ staff members have 
been asked to report to the police to appear as 
witnesses the case against their colleagues Ms. 
Chademana and Mr. Muhamba.

<p>Furthermore, is is reported that Ms. 
Chademana and Mr. Muhamba were subjected

position without a chair or any other tool for a 
prolonged period. They were allegedly 
subjected to assaults all over their bodies.

sentenced to death by a military court in Gaza, 
to which we are yet to receive a response. In 
that communication we expressed concern 
regarding imposition of the death penalty on 
grounds of treason and the provisions of 
Article 131 of the Revolutionary Penal Code 
which permits the imposition of the death 
sentence for conduct which does not involve 
intentional killing, as required by international 
law which restricts imposition of the death 
penalty to the most serious crimes.

<p>Concerning the situation of Mr. Mohanad 
Salahat, a representative of the Palestinian 
Human Rights Foundation (Monitor) in Jordan. 
The Monitor is a Palestinian human rights 
organization with its headquarters in Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>On 28 March 2010, Mr. Salahat was allegedly 
arrested by Palestinian Intelligence officers at 
the Allenby Border Terminal while travelling 
from Jordan to the West Bank. His belongings 
and laptop were confiscated. It is reported that 
he was transferred to the central interrogation 
headquarters of the Palestinian Intelligence 
office in Ariha city (Jericho) and held in 
solitary confinement for fifteen days.  
</p>
<p>He was allegedly interrogated daily by 
Intelligence officers between 11.30 pm and 5 
am, threatened and forced to open his email 
account. He is reportedly accused of working

Qatar, and campaigning against funding for 
Palestinian institutions. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Salahat was released on 
11 April 2010 but his laptop was not handed 
over to him. Furthermore, Mr. Salahat was 
allegedly requested to return to the Palestinian 
Intelligence office for further questioning on 
13 and 15 April 2010 and threatened to be re-
arrested should he fail to do so. 
</p>
<p>On 19 April 2010, Mr. Salahat was allegedly 
re-arrested by the Palestinian Intelligence at the 
&#8220;Karama&#8221; border while crossing on his way to 
Jordan. It is alleged that he was detained at this 
checkpoint for six hours and had his 
identification papers confiscated before being 
released.  
</p>
<p>Following his release from the checkpoint, Mr. 
Salahat went to the Jordanian border where he 
was prevented from entering Jordan by the 
Jordanian authorities. He was allegedly given a 
document signed by the Director of the 
Jordanian Intelligence ordering the competent 
security authorities in Jordan to send him back 
to the Palestinian territories. It is reported that 
Mr. Salahat was told by the Jordanian forces 
that this travel ban was due to a request from 
the Palestinian Intelligence to the Jordanian 
authorities which banned him from travelling 
and forced him to return to the Palestinian 
territories.   
</p>
<p>On 26 April 2010, Mr. Salahat, who was 
staying in Palestine following his travel ban, 
allegedly received a summons from the 
Palestinian Intelligence demanding his 
presence at the headquarters of the Intelligence 
department in Nablus on 1 May, with a 
warning that he would be re-arrested if he 
failed to show up.  </p>

<p>On 1 May 2010, Mr. Salahat presented himself 
at the Intelligence Department and was 
allegedly re-arrested by members of the 
Palestinian Intelligence in Nablus. It is alleged 
that his current fate and whereabouts are 
unknown.  
</p>
<p>Concern is expressed that the summons, arrests 
and current incommunicado detention of Mr. 
Salahat might be directly related to his 
legitimate work in defense of human rights. 
Given the fact that his current fate and 
whereabouts of Mr. Salahat are unknown, 
further concern is expressed about his physical 
and psychological integrity.
