Oyu Tolgoi
2014 Technical Report
October 2014
Job No. 14003


This notice is an integral component of the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report (2014 OTTR) and should be read in its entirety and must 
accompany every copy made of the 2014 OTTR. The 2014 OTTR has been prepared using the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.
The 2014 OTTR has been prepared for Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) by OreWin Pty Ltd (OreWin). The 2014 OTTR is based on 
information and data supplied to the authors by TRQ and Oyu Tolgoi LLC (OT LLC). The quality of information, conclusions, and 
estimates contained herein are consistent with the level of effort involved in the services of the authors, based on: i) information 
available at the time of preparation, ii) data supplied by outside sources, and iii) the assumptions, conditions, and qualifications set 
forth in the 2014 OTTR. Each portion of the report is intended for use by TRQ subject to the terms and conditions of its contract with 
the authors. Except for the purposes legislated under Canadian provincial and territorial securities law, any other uses of the report, 
by any third party, is at that party’s sole risk. The 2014 OTTR is intended to be used by TRQ, subject to the terms and conditions of its 
contract with the authors. Recognizing that TRQ has legal and regulatory obligations, the authors have consented to the filing of the 
2014 OTTR with Canadian Securities Administrators and its System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR).
Readers are cautioned that actual results may vary from those presented. The factors and assumptions used to develop the 
forward-looking information, and the risks that could cause the actual results to differ materially are presented in the body of this 
report under each relevant section. The conclusions and estimates stated in the 2014 OTTR are to the accuracy stated in the 
2014 OTTR only and rely on assumptions stated in the 2014 OTTR. The results of further work may indicate that the conclusions, 
estimates and assumptions in the 2014 OTTR need to be revised or reviewed.
The authors have used their experience and industry expertise to produce the estimates and approximations in the 2014 OTTR. 
Where the authors have made those estimates and approximations, they are subject to qualifications and assumptions and it should 
also be noted that all estimates and approximations contained in the 2014 OTTR will be prone to fluctuations with time and 
changing industry circumstances. The 2014 OTTR should be construed in light of the methodology, procedures and techniques used 
to prepare the 2014 OTTR. Sections or parts of the 2014 OTTR should not be read or removed from their original context.
Except for statements of historical fact relating to TRQ, certain statements contained in the 2014 OTTR constitute forward-looking 
information, future oriented financial information, or financial outlooks (collectively “forward-looking information”) within the 
meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbour” 
provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements and information may be 
contained in this document and other public filings of TRQ. Forward-looking information and statements relate to future events or 
future performance, reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events and are typically identified by words such as 
“anticipate”, “could”, “should”, “expect”, “seek”, “may”, “intend”, “likely”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “believe” and similar 
expressions suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. These include, but are not limited to, statements 
respecting anticipated business activities; planned expenditures; corporate strategies; and other statements that are not historical 
facts.
Forward-looking statements and information includes statements concerning, among other things, cost reporting in the 2014 OTTR, 
production, cost and capital expenditure guidance; development plans for processing resources; the generation of cash flow; 
matters relating to proposed exploration and expansion; communications with local stakeholders and community relations; 
negotiation and completion of transactions; commodity prices; mineral resources, mineral reserves, realization of mineral reserves, 
existence or realization of mineral resource estimates; the development approach, the timing and amount of future production; 
timing of studies, announcements and analyses, the timing of construction and development of proposed additional mines and 
process facilities; capital and operating expenditures; economic conditions; availability of project financing on terms reasonably 
acceptable to OT LLC, Rio Tinto and TRQ; exploration plans and any and all other timing, exploration, development, operational, 
financial, budgetary, economic, legal, social, regulatory and political matters that may influence or be influenced by future events 
or conditions. Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to risks 
and uncertainties disclosed in other TRQ filings at www.sedar.com.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements. By their nature, forward-looking 
statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, which contribute to the 
possibility that the predicted outcomes will not occur. Events or circumstances could cause TRQ’s actual results to differ materially 
from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could 
cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the “Risk Factors” section in the Company’s 
Annual Information Form dated as of March 26, 2014 in respect of the year ended December 31, 2013 (the “AIF”).
Readers are further cautioned that the list of factors enumerated in the “Risk Factors” section of the AIF that may affect future results 
is not exhaustive. When relying on TRQ’s forward-looking information and statements to make decisions with respect to TRQ, investors 
and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Furthermore, the forward-
looking information and statements herein are made as of the date hereof and TRQ does not undertake any obligation to update 
or to revise any of the included forward-looking information or statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
otherwise, except as required by applicable law. The forward-looking information and statements contained herein are expressly 
qualified by the cautionary statement.

The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project (Oyu Tolgoi) is located in the Southern Gobi region 
of Mongolia and is being developed by Oyu Tolgoi LLC (OT LLC). Oyu Tolgoi consists of a 
series of deposits containing copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum. The deposits lie in a 
structural corridor where mineralisation has been discovered over 26 km strike length. The Oyu 
Tolgoi deposits stretch over 12 km, from the Hugo North deposit in the north through the 
adjacent Hugo South, down to the Southern Oyu Tolgoi (SOT) deposit and extending to the 
Heruga deposit in the south as shown in Figure 1.1.
The series of deposits contain an estimated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 
46.8 billion pounds of contained copper and 25.3 million ounces of contained gold and an 
estimated Inferred Mineral Resource of 51.5 billion pounds of contained copper and 
36.0 million ounces of contained gold. The Oyu Tolgoi trend is still open to the north and south 
and the deposits have not been closed off at depth.
OT LLC is 66% owned by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ) and 34% owned by Erdenes OT LLC. 
Rio Tinto plc (Rio Tinto) owns 51% of TRQ and Erdenes OT LLC is owned by the Government of 
Mongolia (GOM). Rio Tinto is also the appointed manager of Oyu Tolgoi.
This report, the 2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report (2014 OTTR), was prepared by Independent 
Qualified Persons (QPs), acting on behalf of TRQ and is a summary of the Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility 
Study 2014, July 2014 (OTFS14) prepared by OT LLC. OTFS14 has been presented to the board 
of directors of OT LLC and submission to the Minerals Council of Mongolia remains subject to 
approval by the OT LLC board. The 2014 OTTR is based on a review of the latest technical, 
production and cost information prepared by OT LLC and is based on feasibility level study 
work complying with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects (NI 43-101). The 2014 OTTR meets the standards of US SEC Industry Guide 7 
requirements for reporting Mineral Reserves.

The 2014 Reserve Case assumes processing of 1.5 billion tonnes of ore, mined from the 
SOT Open Pit and the first Lift in the Hugo North underground block cave. The mining areas 
included in the 2014 Reserve Case are shown schematically in Figure 1.2.
Over time, there is expected to be multiple investment decisions made for Oyu Tolgoi and an 
evaluation of each development option, as and when it is required, ensuring that the 
commitments it makes represent the optimum use of capital to develop Oyu Tolgoi for 
Mongolia.
The initial investment decision was made in 2010 to construct the SOT Open Pit mine, a 
100 ktpd concentrator and supporting infrastructure. These facilities are complete and the 
operation has commenced commercial production. Processing operations have been in 
production since December 2012, commercial production was achieved in September 2013, 
and first concentrate exported in October 2013.
Part of the initial investment decision included continued investment into the development of 
the Hugo North underground mine in parallel with mining the open pit. Lift 1 of Hugo North is 
the most significant value driver for the project and plans for its further development are now 
at a feasibility stage. The current investment decision for OT LLC is the continued 
development of the underground mine in parallel with initial open pit operations.
To support the continued underground development programme, OT LLC in conjunction with 
Rio Tinto and TRQ, has been advancing a project financing package with a group of 
international banks. The different ore types at Oyu Tolgoi have different throughput rates in 
the concentrator and 100 ktpd is the nominal capacity based on average processing rates.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 2 of 519
In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed to allow matters with the 
GOM to be resolved. Further underground development is subject to resolution of 
shareholder issues including the tax dispute , approval of OTFS14 by Oyu Tolgoi’s shareholders 
and acceptance by the Mongolian Minerals Council, agreement of a comprehensive 
funding plan including project finance, and receipt of all necessary permits. The project 
financing is subject to the unanimous approval of the OT LLC Board of Directors, which 
includes representatives from the GOM.
This delay has in turn postponed the timing of decisions relating to any expansions of the 
operations. The 2014 OTTR production estimates assumed early works recommenced in 
Q3’14, this has been delayed. This has yet to occur as of the date of the 2014 OTTR.
The project scope for the 2014 OTTR and evaluation of Mineral Reserves matches that of the 
project financing. A summary of the production and financial results for the 2014 Reserve 
Case are shown in Table 1.1

1.  NPV8% is Net Present Value (NPV) at a rate of 8.0%.
2.
IRR is Internal Rate of Return.
3.  Metal prices used for calculating the financial analysis are as follows:
long-term copper at $3.08/lb; gold at $1,304/oz; and silver at $21.46/oz. 
The analysis has been calculated with assumptions for smelter refining 
and treatment charges, deductions and payment terms, concentrate 
transport, metallurgical recoveries and royalties.

6.
For mine planning the metal prices used to calculate block model Net 
Smelter Returns were copper at $3.01/lb; gold at $1,250/oz; and silver at 
$20.37/oz. For the open pit processing and general administration, the 
following operating costs have been used to determine cut-off grades: 
Southwest at $8.37/t, Central Chalcocite, Central Covellite, and Central 
Chalcopyrite at $7.25/t and the underground costs are based on 
$15.34/t.
For the underground block cave, all Mineral Resources within the shell 
have been converted to Mineral Reserves. This includes low grade 
Indicated Mineral Resources. It also includes Inferred Mineral Resources, 
which have been assigned a zero grade and treated as dilution. The SOT 
Open Pit Mineral Reserves are Mineral Reserves in the pit at 
1 January 2014. It does not include stockpiles.
For SOT only Measured Mineral Resources were used to report Proven 
Mineral Reserves and only Indicated Mineral Resources were used to 
report Probable Mineral Reserves. For Hugo North Measured and 
Indicated Mineral Resources were used to report Probable Mineral 
Reserves.
7.
The Mineral Reserves reported above are not additive to the Mineral 
Resources.
8.  Economic analysis has been calculated from the start of 2015 and
exclude 2014. Costs shown are real costs not nominal costs. Expansion 
capital includes only direct project costs and does not include non-cash 
shareholder interest, management payments, tax pre-payments, forex 
adjustments, or exploration phase expenditure.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Major updates to the project status since the 2013 OTTR was completed and plans for Q4’14 
include:
  An updated Mineral Resource model and estimate for the Hugo North deposit. The 
updated Mineral Resource estimate is similar to and confirms the previous estimates 
contained in the 2013 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report dated as of March 25, 2013 
(2013 OTTR). Mineral resource models for the other Oyu Tolgoi deposits have remained 
the same.
  Updated Mineral Reserves estimates are broadly in line with previous estimates. The open
pit allows for depletion during 2013 and modified underground dilution and mining loss 
assumptions resulting in lower grades and mining recovery.
  Underground ore handling will now be conveyed to surface via decline, which opens
Oyu Tolgoi to additional production flexibility and future optionality for increased 
production. The new mine plan will make use of the existing shafts and the planned 
shafts that were defined in the 2013 OTTR. OT LLC have indicated that the primary 
advantage of the decline is that it will provide an upside opportunity to take advantage 
of potential improved productivity and increased production from Lift 1, or early access 
to a block cave on Hugo South.
  Although Project NPV has been reduced the primary causes were the delay (NPV8%
US$0.8 billion) and more cautious cave performance assumptions, which led to a 
reduction in recovered metal and a slowing of ramp-up of the cave (NPV8% 
US$1.5 billion).
  Underground block cave mine production remains at 95 ktpd.
  The plant rate for both cases is the current nominal 100 ktpd.
  Expansion capital of US$4.9 billion for the underground project, which is in line with the
US$5.1 billion estimate contained in the 2013 OTTR (excludes US$0.5 billion of capital 
spent in 2013 and 2014).
  Signing of a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM in August 2014 
has reset the timing obligation under the Investment Agreement (IA), which required that 
power sources from within Mongolia be secured within four years, while the opportunity 
for the establishment of an independent power provider (IPP) at Tavan Tolgoi is studied. 
OT LLC has retained the right to construct a power station at Oyu Tolgoi.
  Oyu Tolgoi has a large Mineral Resource providing management with flexibility in
studying alternative paths for mine development to match future economic conditions. 
Ongoing planning work using Inferred resources has identified the potential for further 
expansions.
The 2014 OTTR uses updated Mineral Resources for the Hugo North deposit and the Mineral 
Resources for SOT, Hugo South and Heruga remain the same as previously published. The 
overall strategy for the development of Oyu Tolgoi remains the same as it has been in 
previous studies.
The 2014 OTTR includes Mineral Resources from the Oyu Tolgoi project (wholly owned by 
OT LLC) and Entrée Joint Venture (EJV) licence areas. The Shivee Tolgoi Licence and the 
Javkhlant Licence are held by Entrée Gold Inc. (Entrée). The Shivee Tolgoi Licence and the 
Javkhlant Licence are planned to be operated by OT LLC. OT LLC will receive 80% of cash 
flows after capital and operating costs for material originating below 560 m, and 70% above 
this depth.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 5 of 519
Four deposits have been identified in the Mineral Resources at Oyu Tolgoi; they are SOT, Hugo 
South, Hugo North, and Heruga. Hugo South and Hugo North comprise the Hugo Dummett 
deposit. Heruga is a separate deposit south of the SOT deposit. The mine planning work to 
date suggests the following relative ranking for overall return from each deposit, from highest 
value to lowest:
  Hugo North
  SOT
-
Southwest Zone
-  Central Zone
  Hugo South
  Heruga
Currently and in the initial years the predominant source of ore is the SOT Open Pit. In parallel 
to this surface works, underground infrastructure, and mine development is ongoing for the 
Hugo North underground block cave. Stockpiling allows the higher grade ore from Hugo 
North to gradually displace the open pit ore as the underground production ramps-up to 
reach 95 ktpd.
Ore is processed through the existing concentrator using conventional crushing, grinding, and 
flotation circuits. The concentrate produced is trucked to smelters and traders in China.
Oyu Tolgoi is a remote greenfields project and extensive infrastructure has been constructed 
in addition to the concentrating facilities. The major initial infrastructure elements include:
  Water Borefields;
  Water Treatment;
  Housing;
  Airstrip;
  Supporting Facilities, and
  Power.
Development of the entire resource is the objective of all stakeholders and over the life of 
Oyu Tolgoi, OT LLC will continue to progress their understanding of these resources and 
ultimately make decisions on development of the entire resource. The overall strategy for the 
development of Oyu Tolgoi remains the same as it has been in previous studies.
Oyu Tolgoi’s large resource base represents outstanding opportunities for production 
expansion. Figure 1.3 shows an example of the decision tree for the possible development 
options at Oyu Tolgoi. This has been updated to include options that take advantage of 
productivity improvements in plant throughput that have begun to be recognised in the 
process plant. The decision tree shows options assuming that continuous improvements in 
plant productivity are achieved over the next five years. Then there would be key decision 
points for plant expansion and the development of new mines at Hugo North Lift 2, Hugo 
South, and eventually Heruga. This provides an opportunity as OT LLC will have the benefit of 
incorporating actual performance of the operating mine into the study before the next 
investment decisions are required. OT LLC plans to continue to evaluate alternative
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 6 of 519
production cases in order to define the relative ranking and timing requirements for overall 
development options.
The following Qualified Persons (QPs) were responsible for the preparation of the 2014 OTTR:
  Bernard Peters, BEng (Mining), FAusIMM (201743), employed by OreWin Pty Ltd as
Technical Director – Mining, was responsible for the overall preparation of the report and 
the Mineral Reserve estimates.
  Sharron Sylvester, BSc (Geol), RPGeo AIG (10125), employed by OreWin Pty Ltd as
Technical Director – Geology, was responsible for the preparation of the 
Mineral Resources.
The majority of the identified mineralisation at Oyu Tolgoi occurs within the Oyu Tolgoi Licence 
at the Hugo Dummett and SOT deposits. OT LLC holds its rights to the Oyu Tolgoi through 
mining licence 6709A (OT Licence), comprising approximately 8,496 ha of property. The GOM 
granted the OT Licence to IMMI (now OT LLC) in 2003 along with mining licences for three 
properties identified as mining licences 6708A, 6710A, and 6711A. Subsequently, 
licence 6711A has been relinquished.
The OT Licence includes the right to explore, develop mining infrastructure and facilities, and 
conduct mining operations on Oyu Tolgoi. In 2006, the Mongolian Parliament passed new 
mining legislation and changed the term of mining licences to a 30-year term with two  
20-year extensions. Figure 1.4 shows the location of Oyu Tolgoi regionally relative to the 
Mongolian-Chinese border. Figure 1.5 shows the deposits and licence boundaries.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

OT LLC has an economic interest in ML 15225A (Javkhlant) and 15226A (Shivee Tolgoi) 
pursuant to an Equity Participation and Earn-in Agreement with Entrée (as amended in 2005). 
This agreement contemplates the establishment of a joint venture between the parties that 
provides for OT LLC to hold legal title in ML 15225A and 15226A, subject to the terms of the 
agreement, and to OT LLC meeting prescribed earn-in expenditures. While a JV has not been 
formed, the earn-in requirements have been met, and OT LLC’s participating interest in the 
joint venture (including the licences) will be:

In respect of the proceeds from mining from the surface to 560 m below the surface, 
70%, and

In respect of the proceeds from mining from depths beneath 560 m, 80%.
The vast majority of the identified mineralisation for the project occurs at the Hugo Dummett 
and SOT deposits within Oyu Tolgoi Licence. The northernmost extension of the 
Hugo Dummett deposit (Hugo North) crosses onto the Shivee Tolgoi Property. The Heruga 
deposit lies, almost entirely within the Javkhlant Property, with only the northern extreme 
passing into ML 6709A. There are numerous exploration targets across ML 6708A, 6709A, 
6710A, 15225A, and 15226A.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The OT Licence property was surveyed by an independent consultant in 2002 and by a 
qualified Mongolian Land Surveyor in 2004 to establish the legal boundaries of the OT Licence 
concession.
On 8 June 2011, the GOM passed Resolution 175, the purpose of which is to authorise the 
designation of certain land areas for “State special needs” within certain defined areas in 
proximity to Oyu Tolgoi. These State special needs areas are to be used for infrastructure 
facilities necessary in order to implement the development and construction of major mineral 
projects, including Oyu Tolgoi.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 9 of 519
Most of the areas designated for special needs are already subject to existing mineral 
exploration and mining licences issued by the GOM to third parties and, in certain cases, a 
Mineral Resource has been declared and registered with the applicable governmental 
authorities in respect of such licenses. OT LLC has entered into certain consensual 
arrangements with some of the affected third parties; however, such arrangements have not 
been completed with all affected third parties. If OT LLC cannot enter into consensual 
arrangements with an affected third party and such third party’s rights to use and access the 
subject land area are adversely affected by application of Resolution 175, the GOM will be 
responsible for compensating such third parties in accordance with the mandate of 
Resolution 175.
It is not clear at this time whether the GOM will expect some of the compensation necessary 
to be paid to such third parties to be borne by OT LLC or if it will assume that obligation alone. 
It is also expected, but not yet formally confirmed by the GOM, that any consensual 
arrangements effected with affected third parties by OT LLC will make the application of 
Resolution 175 unnecessary.
To the extent that consensual arrangements are not entered into with affected third parties 
and the GOM seeks contribution or reimbursement from OT LLC for compensation it provides 
such third parties, the amount of such contribution or reimbursement is not presently 
quantifiable and may be significant. The description of Resolution 175 has been provided by 
OT LLC and has been relied on under Item 3 of NI 43-101 Reliance on Other Experts.
The total Mineral Resources for Oyu Tolgoi are shown in Table 1.7. A profile of Oyu Tolgoi 
deposits are shown in Figure 1.6.
Mongolia has its own system for reporting Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources. OT LLC 
registered a Mineral Reserve with the GOM in 2009. A key difference between the two 
standards is the classification of material contained in Hugo North Lift 2, Hugo South, and 
Heruga under Mongolian standards as reserves. This contrasts to the Canadian National 
Instrument (NI) 43-101 definitions, which include only SOT and Hugo North Lift 1 in the Mineral 
Reserve category.
The base case copper equivalent (CuEq) cut-off grade assumptions for each deposit were 
determined using cut-off grades applicable to mining operations exploiting similar deposits. 
The CuEq cut-off applied for the underground was 0.37% CuEq and the CuEq cut-off applied 
to the open pit was 0.22% CuEq.
In order to assess the value of the total suite of minerals of economic interest in the mineral 
inventory, formulae have been developed to calculate copper equivalency (CuEq) based 
on given prices and metallurgical recovery factors.
The initial formula used to calculate the copper equivalent (CuEq) grade was developed in 
2003 for Hugo North and SOT. There have been numerous variants on the formulae used since 
that time.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 10 of 519
The 2014 copper equivalence formulae incorporate copper, gold, and silver, and also 
molybdenum for Heruga. The assumed metal prices are $3.01/lb for copper, $1,250/oz for 
gold, $20.37/oz for silver, and $11.90/lb for molybdenum.
Copper estimates are expressed in the form of percentages (%), gold and silver are 
expressed in grams per tonne (g/t), and molybdenum is expressed in parts per million (ppm).
Metallurgical recovery for gold, silver, and molybdenum are expressed as a percentage 
relative to copper recovery.
The unit conversions used in the calculation are as follows:
g/t to oz/t = 31.103477
lb/kg = 2.20462
tonne to lb = 2204.62
g/t to tonne = 1x10–6
This leads to a base formula of:
CuEq14 = Cu + ((Au x AuRev) + (Ag x AgRev) + (Mo x MoRev)†) / CuRev
† Mo and MoRev are only incorporated into CuEq calculations for Heruga
Where:
CuRev = (3.01 x 22.0462)
AuRev = (1,250 / 31.103477 x RecAu)
AgRev = (20.37 / 31.103477 x RecAg)
MoRev = (11.90 x 0.00220462 x RecMo)
RecAu = Au Recovery / Cu Recovery
RecAg = Ag Recovery / Cu Recovery
RecMo = Mo Recovery / Cu Recovery
Different metallurgical recovery assumptions lead to slightly different copper equivalent 
formulas for each of the deposits; these are outlined in the following tables for SOT, Hugo 
North, Hugo North Extension, Hugo South, and Heruga. In all cases, the metallurgical recovery 
assumptions are based on metallurgical testwork. For SOT, actual mill performance has been 
used to further refine the recovery assumptions over the life-of-mine. Recoveries are relative 
to copper because copper contributes the most to the equivalence calculation.
All elements included in the copper equivalent calculation have a reasonable potential to 
be recovered and sold, except for molybdenum. Molybdenum grades are only considered 
high enough to support construction of a molybdenum recovery circuit for Heruga 
mineralisation; hence the recoveries of molybdenum are assumed to be zero for the other 
deposits.
Copper equivalence assumptions and calculations for the various deposits are shown in 
Table 1.2 to Table 1.6.

The Mineral Reserves for the project have been estimated using the SOT and Hugo North 
Mineral Resources. Total Mineral Reserves for the project, and the OT LLC and EJV Mineral 
Reserves for the open pit and underground components of the project are shown in 
Table 1.8. The Mineral Reserves for the 2014 OTTR are based on mine planning work prepared 
by OT LLC. Mine designs were prepared using industry-standard mining software, assumed 
metal prices as described in the notes to the Mineral Reserves, and smelter terms as set forth 
in Section 22. The report only considers Mineral Resources in the Measured and Indicated 
categories, and engineering that has been carried out to a feasibility level or better to 
estimate the open pit and underground Mineral Reserve.
In order to estimate the Mineral Reserves, OreWin relied on the study work prepared by 
OT LLC. Pit designs were prepared using industry standard methods, assumed metal prices as 
described above, and smelter terms as set forth in the 2014 OTTR. The estimate was prepared 
on a simplified project analysis on a pre-tax basis. Key variables noted by OreWin include: 
marketing matters, water supply and management, and power supply. The report only 
considers Mineral Resources in the Measured and Indicated categories, and engineering that 
has been carried out to a feasibility level or better to estimate the open pit Mineral Reserve.
Mine planning work by OT LLC has continued since the previous Mineral Reserve estimate in 
2013. The underground Mineral Reserve has increased by approximately 8 Mt.
The Hugo Dummett underground deposit will be mined by block caving; a safe, highly 
productive, cost-effective method. The deposit is comparable in dimension and tonnage to 
other deposits currently operating by block cave mining elsewhere in the world. The mine 
planning work has been prepared using industry standard mining software, assumed metal 
prices as noted in the tables.
For Hugo North Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were used to report Probable 
Mineral Reserves. There is approximately 60 Mt of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource 
that has been converted to Probable Mineral Reserve. The engineering has been carried out 
to a feasibility level or better to estimate the underground Mineral Reserve. To ensure that 
Inferred Resources do not become included in the reserve estimate, copper and gold grades 
on Inferred Resources within the block cave shell were set to zero and such material was 
assumed to be dilution. The block cave shell was defined by a $15/t Net Smelter Return (NSR).
Further mine planning will examine lower shut-offs. The Hugo North Mineral Reserve is on both 
the Oyu Tolgoi Licence and the EJV Shivee Tolgoi Licence.

$1,304/oz; and silver at $21.46/oz. The analysis has been calculated with assumptions for smelter refining and 
treatment charges, deductions and payment terms, concentrate transport, metallurgical recoveries and 
royalties.

For mine planning the metal prices used to calculate block model Net Smelter Returns were copper at 
$3.01/lb; gold at $1,250/oz; and silver at $20.37/oz.
For the open pit processing and general administration, the following operating costs have been used to 
determine cut-off grades: Southwest at $8.37/t, Central Chalcocite, Central Covellite, and Central 
Chalcopyrite at $7.25/t and the underground (including some mining costs) costs are based on $15.34/t.
For the underground block cave, all Mineral Resources within the shell have been converted to Mineral 
Reserves. This includes Indicated Mineral Resources below the resource cut-off grade. It also includes Inferred 
Mineral Resources, which have been assigned a zero grade and treated as dilution.
The SOT Open Pit Mineral Reserves are Mineral Reserves in the pit at 1 January 2014. It does not include 
stockpiles.
For SOT only Measured Mineral Resources were used to report Proven Mineral Reserves and only Indicated 
Mineral Resources were used to report Probable Mineral Reserves.

1.  2013 OTTR Mineral Reserves have the effective date 25 March 2013.
2.  2014 Oyu Tolgoi Technical Report Mineral Reserves have the effective date 20 September 2014.
3.  Metal prices used for calculating the SOT Open Pit Net Smelter Return (NSR) and the Hugo North underground 
NSR are as follows: copper at $3.01/lb; gold at $1,250/oz; and silver at $20.37/oz, all based on long-term metal 
price forecasts at the beginning of the Mineral Reserves work. The analysis indicates that the Mineral Reserves 
are still valid at these metal prices.

The NSR has been calculated with assumptions for smelter refining and treatment charges, deductions and 
payment terms, concentrate transport, metallurgical recoveries and royalties.
For the open pit processing and general administration, the following operating costs have been used to 
determine cut-off grades: Southwest at $8.37/t, Central Chalcocite, Central Covellite, and Central 
Chalcopyrite at $7.25/t.
For the underground block cave, all Mineral Resources within the shell have been converted to Mineral 
Reserves. This includes Indicated Mineral Resources below the resource cut-off grade. It also includes Inferred 
Mineral Resources, which have been assigned a zero grade and treated as dilution.
For SOT only Measured Mineral Resources were used to report Proven Mineral Reserves and only Indicated 
Mineral Resources were used to report Probable Mineral Reserves.
The SOT Open Pit Mineral Reserves are Mineral Reserves in the pit at 1 January 2014. It does not include 
stockpiles.
For Hugo North Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were used to report Probable Mineral Reserves 
(no Measured Mineral Resource for Hugo North in 2013 OTTR).
10.  The base case financial analysis has been prepared using the following current long term metal price
estimates: copper at $2.87/lb; gold at $1,350/oz; and silver at $23.50/oz. Metal prices are assumed to fall from 
current prices to the long term average over five years.
11.  The Mineral Reserves reported above are not additive to the Mineral Resources.

The 2014 OTTR is an update of the Reserve Case previously presented in the 2013 Oyu Tolgoi 
Technical Report (2013 OTTR). The results of the 2014 Reserve Case show an after tax NPV8% 
of $7.4 billion. The case exhibits an after tax IRR of around 29% and a payback period of 
around nine years.
Key economic assumptions in the analyses are shown in Table 1.10.

Both the process of negotiation and the final agreement in October 2009 of the 
Investment Agreement (IA) with the GOM, presented an opportunity to confirm how the Laws 
of Mongolia should be interpreted in their application to Oyu Tolgoi and provided for some 
specific terms to apply to Oyu Tolgoi. For OT LLC, the agreement has provided the 
confidence in the stability of the terms Oyu Tolgoi will operate under and reliably assess its 
intended investment. The agreement itself is effective for an initial term of 30 years and an 
extension of a further 20 years.
In accordance with the requirements outlined in the 2006 Minerals Law of Mongolia, upon 
execution of the IA and the fulfilment of all conditions precedent, the GOM has become a 
34% shareholder in OT LLC through the immediate issue of OT LLC’s common shares to a 
shareholding company owned by the GOM. Upon a successful renewal of the IA after the 
initial 30-year term, the GOM also has the option to increase its shareholding to 50%, under 
terms to be agreed with TRQ at the time.
A number of conditions precedents were set down in October 2009 and were required to be 
met before the IA terms came into effect. These were met and confirmed by the GOM in 
March 2010, triggering the issuing of the GOM’s equity share in Oyu Tolgoi and bringing the IA 
into full effect.
In the case of shareholder debt, loans (including existing shareholder loans at the time of the 
agreement) initially attracted an interest rate of 9.9% (real) per annum with corresponding 
adjustments to be made to the outstanding balance to reflect increases in US CPI during
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 22 of 519
each period. The coupon rate applicable to redeemable preference shares was to be 9.9% 
(real) and carry the same escalation terms. All principal and interest outstanding on 
shareholder debt, outstanding coupon payments on redeemable preference shares, and the 
face value of those redeemable preference shares must be paid in full prior to any dividends 
on common shares being paid.
In 2011, an Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement was concluded, which 
reduced the applicable rate from 9.9% to LIBOR plus 6.5%. In addition, an in principle 
agreement was reached to convert the balance of preference shares into ordinary shares.
Under the authority of the Shareholders Agreement, TRQ has the right to act as, or appoint, a 
management team to oversee the construction and operation of Oyu Tolgoi.
OT LLC met the IA requirement to achieve commencement of production within seven years 
of the effective date of the IA, 1 September 2013.
Under the terms of the IA, a range of key taxes has been identified as stabilised for the term of 
the agreement at the rates and base currently applied. The following taxes comprise the 
majority of taxes and fees payable to the GOM under Mongolian law and are shown with 
their stabilised rates:
  Corporate income tax
  Mineral royalties
  Value added tax
  Customs duties
  Withholding tax
25%
5.0% (gross sales value)
10%
5.0%
20% (subject to applicable double taxation treaty 
reduced rates)
OT LLC is also only subject to those taxes currently listed in the General Taxation Law and not 
taxes introduced at any future date. These taxes are collectively noted as non-discriminatory 
taxes and as such cannot be imposed on OT LLC in any manner other than that applied to all 
taxpayers.
OT LLC may also apply to take advantage of any future law or treaty that comes into force 
and that would apply any rates lower than those specified in the IA.
In 2009, the GOM enacted amendments to the legislation governing the carry forward of 
income tax losses. The loss carry forward period has been extended to eight years and if 
sufficient, can be applied to offset 100% of taxable income. This was incorporated into the IA 
tax stability terms. This contrasts with the previous law, in which losses carried forward for two 
years were subject to a 50% limit.
The agreement also provides OT LLC with the benefit of a 10% tax credit for all capital 
investment made during the construction period. The amount of this credit can be carried 
forward and credited in the three subsequent profitable tax years. It is noted in the 
agreement that if Mongolian Value Added Tax (VAT) payments, which are currently non-
refundable, become refundable in the future, the availability of the investment tax credit will 
cease from that point. In that event, past earned investment tax credits will still be applied.

Although it has a requirement to make its self-discovered water resources available to be 
used for household purposes, it is confirmed in the IA that OT LLC holds the sole rights to use 
these water resources for the Project. OT LLC has the right under the IA for a water use right 
for the period of its mining licence.
The supply of power has been recognised as being critical to the project execution of 
Oyu Tolgoi in the IA. OT LLC has been given the right to import power initially but must secure 
power from sources within Mongolia from the fourth year of operation. Signing of a PSCA with 
the GOM in August 2014 has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the 
establishment of an IPP at Tavan Tolgoi is studied. OT LLC has retained the right to construct a 
power station at Oyu Tolgoi.
OT LLC also has the right to construct roads for the transport of its product and airport facilities 
for Oyu Tolgoi. A gravel road has been constructed to the town of Khanbogd and is being 
maintained. A 105 km sealed road is being constructed to the Chinese border crossing at 
Gashuun Sukhait. The remaining 23 km is expected to be completed in 2015. On the Chinese 
side of the border a provincial road connects the border town of Ganqimaodao with the 
Jingzang Expressway via the towns of Hailiutu and Wuyuan.
A permanent domestic airport, capable of servicing Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, has been 
constructed at Oyu Tolgoi to support the transportation of people and goods to the site from 
Ulaanbaatar. It further serves as the regional airport for Khanbogd soum.
The GOM has committed to providing OT LLC with non-discriminatory access to any railway 
constructed between Mongolia and China. Energy Resources is currently constructing a 
single-track heavy-haul rail from its UHG coal mine (approximately 120 km to the north-west of 
Oyu Tolgoi) to Gashuun Sukhait, ultimately to be interconnected with the Chinese rail network 
at Ganqimaodao on the Chinese side of the border. Once constructed, the South Gobi Rail 
alignment would pass within 10 km of the Oyu Tolgoi lease area and therefore represents an 
opportunity for eventual connection of the mine to the rail network.
A summary of the 2014 Reserve Case project financial results is shown in Table 1.11. The 
estimates of cash flows have been prepared on a real basis based at 1 January 2015 and 
discounted back to a current day NPV at a rate of 8.0% (NPV8%). Long-term metal prices 
used for the analysis are copper $3.08/lb, gold $1,304/oz, and silver $21.46/oz. The NPV results 
have been calculated starting from January 2015 as this matches the assumptions for the 
recommencement of the ramp-up of activity on Hugo North Lift 1. Results of the LOM Case 
are shown in Section 22.

In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed to allow matters with the 
GOM to be resolved. Further underground development is subject to resolution of 
shareholder issues including the tax dispute, approval of OTFS14 by Oyu Tolgoi’s shareholders 
and acceptance by the Mongolian Minerals Council, agreement of a comprehensive 
funding plan including project finance, and receipt of all necessary permits. The project 
financing is subject to the unanimous approval of the OT LLC Board of Directors, which 
includes representatives from the GOM.
The project financing facility targeted is approximately $4 billion. The overall terms and 
conditions for project financing have been agreed with lenders. In addition to the core 
lending group, the companies invited a wider selection of international banks to participate 
in the project finance consortium. In 2014, the agreements with the financiers have been 
subject to extension.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 29 of 519
Most of the infrastructure facilities required for Oyu Tolgoi were completed during Phase 1. 
Certain infrastructure buildings and services will be expanded or added during Phase 2 and 
these are identified as part of the facility descriptions.
OT LLC has a Power Purchase Agreement with the Inner Mongolia Power Corporation to 
supply power to Oyu Tolgoi. The term of this agreement covers the commissioning of the 
business, plus the initial four years of commercial operations.
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM 
for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-based independent power provider (IPP). The aim of the 
PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the GOM and 
OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. Participation in the PSCA 
meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power supply within Mongolia four 
years from the commencement of commercial production. Signing of a PSCA has reset the 
four years obligation while the opportunity for the establishment of an IPP at Tavan Tolgoi is 
studied. Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an IPP 
to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with 
Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
OT LLC has completed a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
for Oyu Tolgoi. The ESIA undertaken as part of the project finance process was publically 
disclosed in August 2012. The culmination of nearly 10 years of independent work and 
research carried out by both international and Mongolian experts, the ESIA identifies and 
assesses the potential environmental and social impacts of the project, including cumulative 
impacts, focusing on key areas such as biodiversity, water resources, cultural heritage, and 
resettlement.
The ESIA also sets out measures through all project phases to avoid, minimise, mitigate, and 
manage potential adverse impacts to acceptable levels established by Mongolian 
regulatory requirements and good international industry practice, as defined by the 
requirements of the Equator Principles, and the standards and policies of the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and 
other financing institutions.
Corporate commitment to sound environmental and social planning for the project is based 
on two important policies: TRQ's Statement of Values and Responsibilities, which declares its 
support for human rights, social justice, and sound environmental management, including the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 30 of 519
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948); and The Way We Work 2009, 
Rio Tinto’s Global Code of Business Conduct that defines the way Rio Tinto manages the 
economic, social, and environmental challenges of its global operations.
OT LLC has implemented and audited an environmental management system (EMS) that 
conforms to the requirements of ISO 14001:2004. Implementation of the EMS during the 
construction phases to focus on the environmental policy; significant environmental aspects 
and impacts and their risk prioritisation; legal and other requirements; environmental 
performance objectives and targets; environmental management programmes; and 
environmental incident reporting.
The EMS for operations consists of detailed plans to control the environmental and social 
management aspects of all project activities following the commencement of commercial 
production in 2013. The Oyu Tolgoi ESIA builds upon an extensive body of studies and reports, 
and Detailed Environmental Impact Assessments (DEIA’s) that have been prepared for 
project design and development purposes, and for Mongolian approvals under the following 
laws:
  The Environmental Protection Law (1995);
  The Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (1998, amended in 2001); and
  The Minerals Law (2006).
These initial studies, reports, and DEIA’s were prepared over a six-year period between 2002 
and 2008, primarily by the Mongolian company Eco-Trade LLC, with input from Aquaterra on 
water issues.
The original DEIA’s provided baseline information for both social and environmental issues. 
These DEIA’s covered impact assessments for different project areas, and were prepared as 
separate components to facilitate technical review as requested by the GOM.
The original DEIA’s were in accordance with Mongolian standards and while they 
incorporated World Bank and IFC guidelines, they were not intended to comprehensively 
address overarching IFC policies such as the IFC Policy on Social and Environmental 
Sustainability, or the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy.
Following submission and approval of the initial DEIA’s, the GOM requested that OT LLC 
prepare an updated, comprehensive ESIA whereby the discussion of impacts and mitigation 
measures was project-wide and based on the latest project design. The ESIA was also to 
address social issues, meet GOM (legal) requirements, and comply with current IFC good 
practice.
For the ESIA, the baseline information from the original DEIA’s was updated with recent 
monitoring and survey data. In addition, a social analysis was completed through the 
commissioning of a Socio-Economic Baseline Study and the preparation of a Social Impact 
Assessment (SIA) for the project.
The requested ESIA, completed in 2012, combines the DEIA’s, the project SIA, and other 
studies and activities that have been prepared and undertaken by and for OT LLC.

Due to low average annual precipitation in the project area, water management and 
conservation are given the highest priority in all aspects of project design.
The development of a borefield to access groundwater reserves within the Gunii Hooloi 
aquifer basin has been established as the most cost-effective option to meet the raw water 
demand for the project. Water from the borefield is used for process water supply, dust 
suppression in the mining areas, and potable use. Another major component of the water 
management plan is the diversion of the Undai River to accommodate project facilities. 
Undai River water is not used by the mine, the diversion is to preserve this water in the 
environment.
OT LLC has affirmed it is committed to water conservation and has benchmarked its water 
conservation efforts against other mines by assessing factors such as quantified water 
consumption per tonne of concentrate produced. The current water budget is based on the 
use of 550 L/t and operating performance of the concentrator suggests this is a reasonable 
estimate. The water consumption compares favourably with other large operations in similar 
arid conditions.
Based on the first two hydrogeological investigation programmes, the Gunii Hooloi aquifer 
has been demonstrated and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Green 
Development to be capable of providing 870 L/s, based on usage over 40 years and with 
limitations on drawdown that ensure that the main body of the aquifer remains in confined 
conditions.
Updated hydrogeological modelling, completed in 2013, and based on all three 
hydrogeological investigation programmes, demonstrates that the Gunii Hooloi aquifer is 
capable of providing 1,475 L/s, based on the same time and drawdown conditions.
Hydrogeological analytical study and reporting, to Mongolian norms, remains to be 
completed in order to demonstrate and gain approval from the Ministry of Environment and 
Green Development of updated approved water reserve for the Gunii Hooloi aquifer.
Mining is in progress at the SOT Open Pit. Pit designs were not revised and the ten phases 
used for the previous study have not been updated. The Reserve was re-estimated using the 
updated Base Data Template (BDT31) prices, costs, recoveries, and other parameters. A plan 
view of the ten pit phases is shown in Figure 1.9.

The Hugo North orebody is planned to be mined by underground panel caving. The detailed 
design of the first three panels (Panels 0–2) of the Hugo North Lift 1 mine has been completed 
in OTFS14. Underground development activities were suspended by OT LLC in 2013 and 
recommencement of the development is subject to the successful outcome of discussions 
between TRQ, Rio Tinto and GOM. The 2014 OTTR production estimates assumed early works 
recommenced in Q3’14, this has been delayed. The major milestone dates based on this 
restart assumption are shown in Table 1.16.
Hugo North Lift 1 will commence production in 2019 and ramp-up to produce an average of 
95 ktpd. To support mining of Hugo North Lift 1, two declines included in 203 km of lateral 
development, five shafts, 6.8 km of vertical raise-boring, and 137,000 m3 of mass excavations 
will be undertaken.
A significant change from the previous underground designs is that OT LLC has determined 
that a conveyor decline will be developed as the primary materials handling method. OT LLC 
determined that the change was NPV neutral, capital costs were in line with the shaft 
haulage option and operating costs would be slightly lower. The total conveying and hoisting 
capacity from the underground is planned to be approximately 140 ktpd. OT LLC have 
indicated that the primary advantage of the decline is that it will provide an upside 
opportunity to take advantage of potential improved productivity and increased production 
from Lift 1 or early access to a block cave on Hugo South or a future Hugo North Lift 2. Figure 
1.10 illustrates the planned mine development projected onto the site layout showing the 
location of the twin declines relative to the processing plant and block cave. Figure 1.11 
illustrates an isometric of the underground mine design.

OT LLC plans to continue exploration on the Oyu Tolgoi Project mining licences. The focus will 
be on resources that will increase the life-of-mine schedule and potentially defer 
development of deeper and lower grade resources. Smaller, incremental additions to the 
resource base are to be sought as greater knowledge of the orebodies at the known 
deposits, specifically geotechnical considerations, through infill drilling as part of a longer-
term goal to convert resources into reserves.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 35 of 519
Key targets identified from the exploration programmes to date that may warrant drill testing 
include shallow targets at Hugo West and deep targets west and north of the West Bat Fault.
In addition to exploration drilling, further work will be conducted to improve confidence in 
inferred level resources at the Hugo Dummett deposit, especially around Lift 1 Panels 3–5, 
Lift 2, and Hugo South.
OT LLC has stated that its human resource and training strategy is key to a corporate vision of 
ensuring that all Oyu Tolgoi staff and contractors meet and exceed international best 
practice standards. The Human Resources strategy provides a framework of policies, 
procedures, and processes that are well defined and aligned to support the achievement of 
the overall business objectives of the company. OT LLC is working in partnership with relevant 
Mongolian government agencies and non-government agencies (NGOs) to ensure that a 
suitably qualified workforce is available to meet the requirements of the Oyu Tolgoi Project. 
OT LLC’s policies and procedures for human resources and training meet all applicable 
Mongolian Labour and Social Security Laws and regulations, including those contained within 
the Labour Law of Mongolia (July 1999). International conventions and standards, including 
applicable International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), guide the human resources and training strategy and activities.
OT LLC prioritises employment of local residents from the soums within the Project Area of 
Influence—Khanbogd, Manlai, Bayan Ovoo, and Dalanzadgad—as well as from other areas 
in the South Gobi region. OT LLC has a requirement that not less than 90% of the total 
Oyu Tolgoi Project workforce consists of citizens of Mongolia. The OT LLC policies and 
procedures are in place to meet this training requirement.
OT LLC’s HSE management system (HSE MS) has been implemented and been audited as 
compliant against AS/NZS ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System and 
OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health and Safety management system. The HSE MS was 
developed to provide management with clear direction on HSE management, means to 
ensure compliance, and a basis for driving improvements. The Oyu Tolgoi HSE MS applies to 
all persons working for or on behalf of OT LLC, including contractors, suppliers, the general 
public, special interest groups, and government representatives, and covers the health, 
safety, and environmental management of all OT LLC’s activities, assets, products, and 
services. Oyu Tolgoi had an All Injury Frequency Rate of 0.51 per 200 kh (thousand hours) 
worked and no fatalities for the first half of 2014.
The HSE policy has been developed and is regularly reviewed in consultation with key 
stakeholders. The policy is intended to reflect a best practice approach to health, safety, and 
environment with the underlying principle that all people are accountable for health and 
safety.
The HSE policy is seen as an enabler for the entire HSE MS. It provides high-level principles that 
are intended to be implemented through the application of all parts of the HSE MS. The 
policy is endorsed by the CEO of OT LLC to ensure the appropriate priority is placed on 
implementation and compliance.

Oyu Tolgoi employs a conventional SAG mill / ball mill / grinding circuit (SABC) followed by 
flotation, as shown in the basic flowsheet (Figure 1.12).
Phase 1, which commenced production in 2013, uses two grinding lines, each consisting of a 
SAG mill, two parallel ball mills, and associated downstream equipment to treat up to 
100 ktpd of ore from the Southwest zone pit. Softer ore from the Central zone pit will be 
processed from 2020 through 2050. Combined with Hugo North underground ore, 
concentrator feed rates will be as high as 121 ktpd, which represents the tailings handling 
capacity of the plant. The Phase 2 concentrator development programme optimises the 
concentrator circuit to enable it to maximise recovery from the higher grade Hugo North ore.
Concentrate is sold in-bond free-on-board at a bonded yard on the Chinese side of the 
border in Ganqimaodao. Sales contracts have been signed for 100% of Oyu Tolgoi’s 
expected 2014 concentrate production and 92% of 2015 planned production; 84% of 
concentrate production has been contracted for up to eight years.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

In August 2013, development of the underground mine was delayed to allow matters with the 
GOM to be resolved. Further underground development is subject to resolution of 
shareholder issues including the tax dispute , approval of OTFS14 by Oyu Tolgoi’s shareholders 
and acceptance by the Mongolian Minerals Council, agreement of a comprehensive 
funding plan including project finance, and receipt of all necessary permits. The project 
financing is subject to the unanimous approval of the OT LLC Board of Directors, which 
includes representatives from the GOM.
This delay has in turn postponed the timing of decisions relating to any expansions of the 
operations. The 2014 OTTR production estimates assumed early works recommenced in 
Q3’14, this has been delayed. This has yet to occur as of the effective date of the 2014 OTTR.
To achieve the ramp-up of activities detailed in the Project Critical Path schedule, a 
considerable amount of preparatory work will need to be carried out. OT LLC has been 
preparing for the restart and is currently well placed to commence the work.
OT LLC has a programme of studies to optimise the tailings storage facility (TSF) design. These 
include bringing forward the Cell 2 operation to create larger tailings deposition areas that 
will result in higher in-place tailing densities and greater storage capacity. Optimisation of the 
TSF is also expected to improve tailings solids content at deposition, which is currently is lower 
than the design assumptions but it is expected that this can be brought up to the design 
assumption through optimisation of the operation of the TSF. This optimisation of the TSF will 
potentially provide cost savings over the assumptions in OTFS14.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an 
independent power provider to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to 
supply electricity, with Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer. Full evaluation of the IPP option is 
expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi.
OT LLC plans to investigate and implement projects in these areas: project monitoring, 
process technology, and underground technology. The innovations and possible applications 
outlined below are not exhaustive, nor definitive, but rather are currently viewed as having 
the most significant potential impact for Oyu Tolgoi.
OT LLC plans a longer-term view to developing its operations management capability to
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 38 of 519
maximise performance through evaluation and implementation of advanced technologies. 
This approach would involve the strategic evaluation and collaboration with technology 
partners before further developing and implementing system capabilities in a phased and 
prioritised manner. Experience from a variety of industries has shown this approach to be 
crucial in achieving an integrated system that maximises the potential of the various 
technologies and the benefit to Oyu Tolgoi. The innovation and technology opportunities that 
Rio Tinto is currently examining are:
  Project Monitoring and Optimisation
  Process Technology
  Underground Technology
  Operating Systems and Technologies
  Data Management
  Geotechnical Research
  Extraction Level Construction
  Cave Production
  Cave Monitoring
OT LLC’s strategy is to obtain approval for increases to the currently approved water reserve 
ahead of any mine expansion plans. The objective of the study will be to assess the impact if 
any on the concentrator expansion on water demand and to determine the need for 
obtaining GOM approval for any substantial increase in the approved water demand from 
the Gunii Hooloi aquifer.
The current estimate of average water demand for a concentrator expansion to 160 ktpd is 
918 L/s, which is only marginally above the rate of 870 L/s that has already been approved by 
the GOM.
The extensive resources at Oyu Tolgoi provide an opportunity to continually evaluate 
investment decisions as the mines progress, deposit knowledge increases and economic 
conditions change.
As part of that process, although outside of the scope of Mineral Reserve reporting, OT LLC 
continues to examine alternative production cases to better define future work plans and 
prepare for investment decision points. There is no certainty that the alternative production 
cases will be realised. Under the NI 43-101 guidelines, Inferred Mineral Resources are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to 
them that would allow them to be categorised as Mineral Reserves.

These cases are part of the strategic planning that is being undertaken by OT LLC. The cases 
have been analysed by OT LLC since 2005 and represent the long-term strategy for the 
development of Oyu Tolgoi. This work examines the plant capacity for expansions. Figure 1.3 
shows an example of the decision tree for the possible development options at Oyu Tolgoi. 
This has been updated to include options that take advantage of productivity improvements 
in plant throughput that have begun to be recognised in the process plant. The decision tree 
shows options assuming that continuous improvements in plant productivity are achieved 
over the next five years. Then there would be key decision points for plant expansion and the 
development of new mines at Hugo North Lift 2, Hugo South and eventually Heruga. This 
provides an opportunity as OT LLC will have the benefit of incorporating actual performance 
of the operating mine into the study before the next investment decisions are required. 
OT LLC plans to continue to evaluate alternative production cases in order to define the 
relative ranking and timing requirements for overall development options.

This report is titled the 2014 Technical Report (2014 OTTR) and has been prepared for TRQ.
The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project (Oyu Tolgoi) is located in the Southern Gobi region 
of Mongolia and is being developed by OT LLC. Oyu Tolgoi consists of a series of deposits 
containing copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum. The deposits lie in a structural corridor 
where mineralisation has been discovered over 26 km strike length. The deposits stretch over 
12 km, from the Hugo North deposit in the north through the adjacent Hugo South, down to 
the SOT deposit and extending to the Heruga deposit in the south. This report, the 2014 OTTR, 
was prepared for TRQ. The 2014 OTTR is based on the most current technical, production and 
cost information prepared by OT LLC to support project financing.
Independent Qualified Persons (QP), acting on behalf of TRQ, reviewed the available studies 
as part of the preparation for the 2014 OTTR and in conjunction with TRQ prepared the 
2014 OTTR with costs to the end of 2013 as reported to TRQ by OT LLC. The 2014 OTTR used 
only Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources and is a complete study of all aspects of the 
Project. The 2014 OTTR presents a reserve case (2014 Reserve Case) and is based on a 
feasibility quality level study complying with NI 43-101, although some parts of Oyu Tolgoi are 
further advanced and are in the execution phase. The work of the 2014 OTTR meets the 
standards of US SEC Industry Guide 7 requirements for reporting Reserves.
Throughout this Report, measurements are in metric units and currency in United States dollars 
unless otherwise stated.
This report was compiled by the Qualified Persons listed on the Title Page. Original authors 
and companies are listed throughout the text. The primary source of information for 2014 OTTR 
is the study Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study 2014 (OTFS14), which was prepared by OT LLC.
The following site visits were carried out by the Qualified Persons:
  Bernard Peters visited the property in March 2003, July 2003, April 2006, April 2009,
July 2010, October 2011, November 2012, and 28–31 January 2013, and  
2–14 December 2013. Meetings were also attended in Ulaanbaatar with OT LLC (formerly 
IMMI) and Mongolian authorities to discuss the Project from 2003–2011. Some of these 
meetings did not include site visits. Other visits were made to OT LLC offices in Mongolia, 
Australia, and China as part of work on Oyu Tolgoi.
  Sharron Sylvester visited the property from 28–31 January 2013, and 2–14 December 2013.
Other visits were made to OT LLC offices in Mongolia and Australia as part of work on

The project area comprises five contiguous properties, as listed in Table 4.1. In 2011, all mining 
licences in Mongolia were subject to a review in accordance with a change in the geodesic 
projection maintained by the GOM. As a result, the licences held by OT LLC were re-surveyed 
and a slight reduction in total area is reported. This has been ratified by the GOM and new 
licence certificates have been issued to reflect the changes. Table 4.1 shows both the 
original and updated names and areas of the five properties. In general the information in 
this section refers to the original licence numbers.

OT LLC has an economic interest in ML 15225A and 15226A pursuant to an Equity 
Participation and Earn-in Agreement with Entrée (as amended). This agreement 
contemplates the establishment of a joint venture between the parties that provides for 
OT LLC to hold legal title in ML 15225A and 15226A, subject to the terms of the agreement 
and to OT LLC meeting prescribed earn-in expenditures. While a JV has not been formed, the 
earn-in requirements have been met, and OT LLC’s participating interest in the joint venture 
(including the licences) will be:

In respect of the proceeds from mining from the surface to 560 m below the surface, 70% 
,and

In respect of the proceeds from mining from depths beneath 560 m, 80%.
The vast majority of the identified mineralisation for the project occurs at the Hugo Dummett 
and SOT deposits within Oyu Tolgoi Licence. The northernmost extension of the 
Hugo Dummett deposit (Hugo North) crosses onto the Shivee Tolgoi Property. The Heruga 
deposit lies, almost entirely within the Javkhlant Property, with only the northern extreme 
passing into ML 6709A. There are numerous exploration targets across ML 6708A, 6709A, 
6710A, 15225A, and 15226A.

In October 2009, Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (Ivanhoe) (subsequently renamed Turquoise Hill 
Resources Ltd, TRQ), OT LLC, and Rio Tinto International Holdings Limited signed an Investment 
Agreement (IA) with the GOM. The IA defines the fiscal and regulatory environment under 
which the project will operate and stipulates that the GOM own 34% equity of OT LLC, with 
the option to increase its equity holding by a further 16% after the IA is extended beyond its 
initial 30-year term, providing the shareholders of OT LLC can reach agreement on the 
arrangement at that time.
At the time of signing the IA, there remained a number of conditions precedent to it 
becoming effective. On 31 March 2010, it was announced that these conditions had been 
met or waived, and this was confirmed by the GOM. The main conditions that were met or 
waived were as follows:
  The 2009 Mongolian feasibility study of Oyu Tolgoi was considered and submitted in
accordance with the laws and regulations of Mongolia.
  The balance of existing income tax losses, capitalised expenses, and outstanding tax
liabilities or credits was confirmed by the tax office. This condition was waived prior to the 
Effective Date of the IA.
  The balance of existing shareholder loans were agreed upon.
  Company restructuring required to execute the agreement was completed.
  A standing working committee was established with members of the GOM and OT LLC to
provide a means to expedite permits, customs clearance, or general GOM 
administration.

Ivanhoe’s interests in mining licences 15225A and 15226A (referred to in the IA as 
exploration licences 3148X and 3150X) held by Entrée Gold LLC were transferred to 
OT LLC. Although the licences themselves have yet to be transferred to OT LLC, the 
condition precedent is fully satisfied as it only required the transfer of economic interests 
in the licence.
Ivanhoe acquired 100% interest in the mineral exploration rights to the area now covered by 
ML 6709A pursuant to an earn-in agreement dated 5 May 2000 (and subsequently amended 
13 March 2002) with BHP on an exploration licence (MEL) covering 1,120 km2 (112,000 ha) 
(BHP Earn-in Agreement). The MEL, named ’210’ was originally issued to BHP on 
17 February 1997 and was later re-named MEL 66X. In September 2000, the licence was 
reduced in size and converted to four non-contiguous MELs, one of which represented 
ML 6709A. The boundaries of ML 6709A, along with the surface projection of the main 
deposits and proposed open pit outlines, are shown in Figure 4.1.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 44 of 519
The terms of the Earn-in Agreement called for Ivanhoe to spend a total of US$6 million on 
exploration over seven years and to pay US$5 million to BHP. In return for receiving the transfer 
of the MEL, Ivanhoe agreed to pay a 2.0% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty to BHP. Ivanhoe 
met the terms of the BHP agreement in April 2002, giving it 100% interest in the Oyu Tolgoi 
Licence. Ivanhoe subsequently acquired the 2.0% NSR in November 2003 in two payments 
totalling US$37 million, thereby removing any future obligations to BHP (now BHP Billiton).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

On 23 December 2003, OT LLC was granted 100% registered title to ML 6709A in accordance 
with the Minerals Law of Mongolia for a term of 60 years, with an option to extend the licence 
for an additional term of up to 40 years. In 2006, the Mongolian Parliament passed a new 
mining legislation that changed the term of mining licences to 30 years with two 20-year 
extensions.

Payments to maintain mining and exploration licences in Mongolia are payable in advance 
on an annual basis according to the schedule shown on Table 4.3. An exploration licence is 
valid for a three-year period with two three-year extensions for a total of nine years. Prior to 
expiry of the exploration licence, application can be made for conversion to a mining 
licence. The current licences can be maintained for another three-year extension, referred to 
as the pre-mining period, by making application and by paying annual fees of $1.50/ha 
during this extension period as defined in Article 32.2.

The approximate annual payments are US$127,000 for the Oyu Tolgoi Mining Licence 
(8,496 ha), and $292,000 for the Shivee Tolgoi JV Mining Licence (39,864 ha). OT LLC is also 
contractually obliged to meet payments on the Javkhlant JV Mining licence (20,237 ha; 
$304,900) as well as ML 6708 (4,533 ha; $68,000) and ML 6710 (1,763; $26,441) for a total

$818,870. OT LLC advises that all payments have been made to keep the licence in good 
standing at the effective date of the Technical Report.
In the negotiations to conclude the IA, the parties agreed that the IA should conform with the 
current 2006 Minerals Law terms: the term of the mining licences covered by the IA should be 
30 years with two 20-year extensions.
The Oyu Tolgoi Licence was legally surveyed in August 2002 by Surtech International Ltd. using 
the internationally recognised survey datum WGS-84 Zone 48N. In September 2004, 
Geomaster Co. Ltd. (Geomaster), a licensed Mongolian land survey company, re-surveyed 
the mining concession’s corner points based on the official Mongolian survey datum ‘MSK42’, 
and marked the corners with concrete and steel pylons. In November 2004, Geomaster also 
surveyed the northern boundary between the Oyu Tolgoi Licence and the adjacent 
Shivee Tolgoi JV Property and marked it with wooden posts on 250–500 m intervals. The 
differences between these two surveys are considered insignificant.
In early 2011, the GOM changed its official survey datum to WGS-84 Zone 48N. In 
accordance with the requirements of the change, Geomaster resurveyed the licences, and 
new licence certificates reflecting the slight change were issued to OT LLC.
On 17 May 2006, an expert group established by the GOM recommended registration of the 
project’s open pit reserves under Mongolian guidelines; as part of its conclusions, the expert 
group confirmed that IMMI (now OT LLC) had title to the Oyu Tolgoi Licence 6709A.
On 1 July 2009, a new experts group, the current Minerals Council, recommended to the 
Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy and the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia 
that the Oyu Tolgoi Commercial Minerals be registered. Commercial Minerals include 
Mongolian Mineral Resources and Mongolian Mineral Reserves and can only be reported in 
Mongolia by registration by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. The Minerals 
Council recommended that the IMMI licences be acknowledged and that the 
Shivee Tolgoi 3148X and Javkhlant 3150X exploration licences should be converted to mining 
licences.
This has now been done; the new licence numbers are Shivee Tolgoi 15226A and 
Javkhlant 15225A. The IA describes the exploration and mining licences relating to Oyu Tolgoi 
and confirms OT LLC’s interest in these licences.
The 2006 Minerals Law provides for a mining licence holder investing US$50 million or more in 
the first five years of a project to enter into an investment agreement with the GOM that 
regulates aspects of the investment environment, particularly stabilisation of rates for 
taxation.
In the case of Oyu Tolgoi, both the process of negotiation and the final agreement (the IA) 
presented an opportunity to confirm how the Laws of Mongolia should be interpreted in their 
application to the project and to provide some specific terms for the project. The IA gives 
OT LLC confidence in the stability of the terms the project will operate under. The agreement
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 47 of 519
has an initial term of 30 years with the right to be extended for a further 20 years provided 
certain conditions are satisfied, including a provision that OT LLC makes capital cost 
expenditures of at least US$9 billion within the first 29 years.
In conjunction with the IA, a Shareholders’ Agreement was entered into between OT LLC, 
subsidiaries of Ivanhoe, and the GOM shareholder, Erdenes MGL LLC, on 6 October 2009, 
which was subsequently amended and restated (the Amended and Restated Shareholders’ 
Agreement, or ARSHA), outlines the rights and obligations between the shareholders of 
OT LLC, including obligations to provide funding to OT LLC to develop the project.
The IA was entered into by the GOM pursuant to, and in order to fulfil, Resolution Number 57 
of the State Great Khural dated 16 July 2009. Under Resolution Number 57, the GOM is 
charged to “agree and resolve with the investor the matter of increasing the amount of 
State-owned shares to no less than 50% after compensating1 for the initial investment by 
establishing in place the legal environment.” The GOM has the right to increase its 
shareholding in OT LLC to 50% on terms to be agreed with the other shareholders. This right is 
set out in Article 1.6 of the IA, which provides that:
1.
The State will own 34% of the shares in Oyu Tolgoi.
2.  After the IA is extended for a further 20 years, the State will have an option to acquire a
further 16% interest (bringing its total ownership interest to 50%) on terms governed by 
the process set out in clause 16.10 of the ARSHA.
Under clause 16.10 of the ARSHA, the GOM may only increase its shareholding if:
1.
2.
The term of the IA is extended in accordance with Article 15.11.
The terms of the increase in the GOM’s shareholding are agreed between the GOM 
and the non-GOM shareholders.
Accordingly, the GOM is only enabled to increase the GOM’s stake in Oyu Tolgoi after having 
(first) established the value attributable to the initial investment and then compensating / 
reimbursing that amount.
The combined effect of Resolution 57 and clause 16.10 of the ARSHA is that OT LLC is entitled 
to negotiate the value to which it is entitled before the GOM may increase its stake in 
Oyu Tolgoi.
In accordance with the IA, 34% of OT LLC’s equity was issued to Erdenes MGL LLC, an entity 
wholly owned by the GOM. This 34% interest has now been transferred to a different entity 
owned by GOM, Erdenes OT LLC.
During the Funding Period—a period ending three years after the commencement of 
commercial production—the Ivanhoe subsidiaries are obliged to provide 100% of OT LLC’s 
funding needs unless other funding, such as project financing is available. The GOM has the 
right but not the obligation to contribute up to 34% of OT LLC’s funding requirements. After 
the Funding Period the OT LLC shareholders are required to fund OT LLC in proportion to their 
66/34% shareholdings. During the Funding Period, the Ivanhoe shareholders have the right to
1 The alternative translation for this term is reimbursing.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 48 of 519
determine whether funding provided to OT LLC is made in the form of debt or equity. 
However, Mongolian ‘thin capitalisation’ laws create adverse tax consequences if OT LLC’s 
debt-to-equity ratio exceeds 3:1. The ARSHA also imposes restrictions upon the amount of 
equity that is issued during the Funding Period, defined in the ARSHA to mean the period 
commencing 21 days after the Effective Date under the IA and ending three years after the 
commencement of production (September 2013).
The aggregate of all Funding Equity (defined in the ARHSA to mean common equity issued by 
OT LLC from 1 January 2012 to the end of the Funding Period) must not exceed 60% of the 
Total Capital (defined in the ARSHA to mean the aggregate funding requirements) of OT LLC.
The 34% of funding provided to OT LLC by Ivanhoe shareholders during the Funding Period 
constitutes an Outstanding Balance, which will be repaid by the GOM shareholder, together 
with interest accruing at an effective annual interest rate of LIBOR (for the relevant quarter) 
plus 6.5%, via the GOM shareholder’s entitlement to 34% of OT LLC dividends.
In the case of shareholder debt, loans (including existing shareholder loans that were in place 
on 31 March 2010) made to OT LLC by shareholders attract an effective annual interest rate 
of LIBOR (for the relevant quarter) plus 6.5%.
Under the Shareholders’ Agreement, OT LLC was entitled to issue preference shares to 
shareholders in return for funding provided to OT LLC. Under the amendments effected by 
the ARSHA, existing preference shares (Funding Shares) were deemed to have been 
converted into common shares with effect from 31 January 2011.
The GOM shareholder remains undiluted by the conversion of preference shares and 
continues to hold 34% of OT LLC’s common equity.
Under the ARSHA, the Ivanhoe shareholders may appoint members from the Ivanhoe group 
(which includes Rio Tinto group members) to provide services and support to OT LLC. This 
group of entities providing services and support to OT LLC is defined as the Management 
Team.
A Management Services Payment equal to 3.0% of total operating and capital costs prior to 
commencement of production and 6.0% of operating and capital costs during production is 
payable to (the companies serving as) the Management Team. This payment is included in 
the economic analysis as a project expense and under the IA is tax-deductible by OT LLC. 
Pursuant to arrangements agreed between Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe, these parties have agreed 
that Rio Tinto will be the provider of services support to OT LLC through the Executive 
Committee for the construction and operation of Oyu Tolgoi. OT LLC achieved commercial 
production in September 2013.
Under the terms of the IA, OT LLC is required to pay a 5.0% royalty on the net revenue earned 
by OT LLC on the sale of copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum extracted from the 
project area.
Under the terms of the IA, a range of key taxes has been identified as stabilised for the term of 
the agreement at the rates and base currently applied.

In accordance with the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT) invalidating Law, as from 1 January 2011, 
OT LLC will not be subject to the WPT.
OT LLC is also only subject to those taxes listed in the General Taxation Law at the time of 
signing the IA and not taxes introduced at any future date. These taxes are collectively noted 
as non-discriminatory taxes and as such cannot be imposed on OT LLC in any manner other 
than that applied to all taxpayers. Taxes to be withheld are calculated at the rates specified 
as in force at the signing of the IA, which includes in accordance with any applicable double 
tax treaties and which rates will be stabilised. OT LLC may also apply to take advantage of 
any future law or treaty that comes into force and that would apply any rates lower than 
those specified in the IA.
The GOM in 2009 enacted amendments to the legislation governing the carry forward of 
income tax losses. These terms are incorporated into the IA. The loss carry forward period has 
been extended to eight years and, if sufficient, can be applied to offset 100% of taxable 
income. This contrasts with the previous law, in which losses were carried forward for two 
years and were subject to a 50% limit.
The IA also provides OT LLC with the benefit of a 10% tax credit for all capital investment 
made during the construction period. The amount of this credit can be carried forward and 
credited in the three subsequent profitable tax years. At present, VAT payments are non-
refundable because OT LLC is a mining company that is not producing a finished product.
It is noted in the agreement that if VAT payments become refundable in the future, then the 
availability of the investment tax credit will cease from that point. In that event, past earned 
investment tax credits will still be applied.
Although OT LLC is required to make its self-discovered water resources available to be used 
for household purposes, the IA confirms that OT LLC holds the sole rights to use these water 
resources for Oyu Tolgoi. The contract for the utilisation of water with the GOM water 
authority may be executed for 30 years with subsequent 20-year periods of renewal.
OT LLC has a Power Purchase Agreement with the Inner Mongolia Power Corporation to 
supply power to Oyu Tolgoi. The term of this agreement covers the commissioning of the 
business plus the initial four years of commercial operations.
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM 
for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-based independent power producer (IPP). The aim of 
the PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the GOM 
and OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. Participation in the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 50 of 519
PSCA meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power supply within 
Mongolia within four years from the commencement of commercial production. Signing of a 
PSCA has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the establishment of an IPP 
at Tavan Tolgoi is studied.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an IPP 
to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with 
Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
OT LLC has the right to construct roads for the transport of its product and airport facilities to 
suit project needs. The GOM has committed to providing OT LLC with non-discriminatory 
access to any railway constructed between Mongolia and China, if such a railway is 
constructed. The GOM has also resolved to resume land (under Government Resolution 175 
dated 8 June 2011) for the benefit of Oyu Tolgoi (in particular, to support the infrastructure 
needs of the project).
Many of the environmental provisions contained in the IA track the requirements of the Air 
Pollution, Energy and Water Law, and OT LLC gives a contractual commitment to comply 
with these laws. The environmental provisions in the IA can be summarised as follows:
  OT LLC agrees to comply with the international environmental law treaties to which
Mongolia is a party, and to Articles 35 (General Obligation of Mine Licence Holder) and 
37 (Environmental Protection) of the Minerals Law, and agrees to obtain detailed 
environmental impact assessment reports (the DEIA Reports) in accordance with the Law 
on Environmental Impact Assessment.
  OT LLC has the right to review and comment on the DEIA Reports prior to the DEIA 
Reports being submitted to the State central administrative authority in charge of 
environment.
  OT LLC agrees to obtain permits and licences for the Mine Project as required under
environmental laws, and the GOM agrees to process applications for permits in 
accordance with Mongolian Law.
  OT LLC agrees to implement an environmental protection plan (EPP), and environmental 
monitoring and analysis programme, and to procure an independent report for the State 
central administrative authority in charge of environment every three years. Such report 
must address OT LLC’s implementation of the EPP.
  OT LLC agrees to make the EPP and independent reports available to the public, provide
local communities with sufficient relevant information, and regularly consult with local 
communities on the impact of its operations on the local environment.
  OT LLC agrees to deposit funds equivalent to 50% of its environmental protection cost for
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 51 of 519
the particular year, prior to the start of that year, into a bank account established by the 
State central administrative authority in charge of environment.
  Each deposit will be refunded annually to OT LLC upon full implementation of each EPP
for that year in all material respects.

If OT LLC fails to fully implement in all material respects the measures specified in an EPP 
for that year, then the deposit will be used for the implementation of the EPP. If the 
deposit is insufficient, then experts shall be appointed to determine the additional 
actions and funds required by OT LLC.
  OT LLC agrees to submit an annual report detailing its comprehensive environmental
monitoring and analysis programme associated with Core Operations to the State 
central administrative authority in charge of environment.

If any material adverse impact is found by the environmental monitoring and analysis 
programme, then OT LLC will take necessary measures to eliminate such material 
adverse impact at OT LLC’s expense.
  OT LLC agrees to pay compensation for unanticipated and irreversible ecological
damage directly caused by the operations of the Mine Project based on the ecological 
and economic value for the permanently damaged natural resources, to the extent 
prescribed by the Law on the Environmental Protection, and other relevant laws and 
regulations.
  Compensation referred to above will be determined by an independent group of
environmental experts appointed by the State central administrative authority in charge 
of environment, taking into consideration the views of OT LLC, and OT LLC will cooperate 
with the experts in such determination.
  OT LLC has the right to access and use its self-discovered water resources (including the
water resources the subject of the Water Approval) for purposes connected with the 
Mine Project during the life of the Mine Project, including: to construct, commission, 
operate, and rehabilitate the Mine Project. The following provisions apply to self-
discovered water:
-  The approved volume of self-discovered water resources (as specified in the Water 
Approval) is only sufficient to meet the Mine Project’s water requirements, and the 
rights to use such self-discovered water resources will not be granted to other 
economic entities.
-
In respect of self-discovered water resources discovered or approved after the date 
of the IA, and where these water resources fully satisfy and exceed the requirements 
of the Mine Project, the State central administrative authority in charge of water 
matters may provide the portion of such excess water resources for use of other 
economic entities on terms to be agreed with the OT LLC, and OT LLC will be 
compensated for its exploration costs in proportion to the volume of water made 
available to the other economic entities.
-  OT LLC will make its self-discovered water resources available to be used for
household purposes, herder families, and agricultural activities of the local soum 
communities.
  OT LLC will pay fees to the GOM for surface and underground water removed and 
consumed for the purpose of mine development and mining of minerals at the rate 
specified in the Law on Water, 2012, and Law on Water Pollution Fee, 2012, effective at
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 52 of 519
that time, and these fees will be treated as a deductible expense from the taxable 
income of OT LLC; however, such fees, and the terms upon which the OT LLC may use 
such water, will be no less favourable than those applicable from time to time to other 
domestic and international users, and will take into account whether the water is suitable 
for industrial or household use. Fees for use of water have not been stabilised by the IA. 
The Law on Fees for Use of Water and Mineral Water has been consolidated with other 
laws on the use of natural resources and has been replaced with the Law on Natural 
Resources Use Fee, dated 17 May 2012. The rates under the Law on Natural Resources 
Use Fee will apply to OT LLC.
  OT LLC will support the GOM in the establishment of safe drinking water for the local
soum centre directly affected by the Mine Project as identified in the DEIA Reports.
  Recognising that the quality of self-discovered water may vary considerably, OT LLC will 
support the GOM to upgrade or treat these water resources for household purposes and 
agricultural activities of the local soum communities, or provide infrastructure for water 
transportation for local household use only.
  The GOM will ensure that a contract on water utilisation is awarded upon request of
OT LLC (including in relation to the water resources the subject of the Water Approval) in 
accordance with the Law on Water, the Law on the Natural Resources Fees, and the 
Government Resolution 326 and 327 of 2013. As the Oyu Tolgoi project is classified as a 
mineral deposit of strategic importance, the contract with OT LLC on water utilisation will 
have a term of 30 years in accordance with the Law on Water, and may be extended 
for periods of 20 years each time in accordance with the Law on Water.
  The GOM will grant to OT LLC within 30 days after its request all necessary contracts on
water utilisation and other water permits to ensure that sufficient water is available at all 
times for the Mine Project.
  OT LLC` has the following obligations with regard to water utilisation:
-  Comply in all material respects with the conditions and requirements set forth in
Article 30 of the Law on Water, the contract on water utilisation, and the 
DEIA Reports. Compliance with such conditions and requirements will be audited by 
an independent, competent, professional firm, and the audit outcome will be 
provided to the State central administrative authority in charge of environment with a 
copy to OT LLC.
-  Not reduce from the current level the quality and quantity of the existing potable and
livestock water supplies used by existing users at the date of the IA within the water 
resources area defined in the DEIA Reports.
-  Apply modern technology and procedures to minimise the volume of water used by
the Mine Project, maximise the efficiency of water usage, and recycle used water 
where reasonably practicable to do so having regard to technology and procedures 
used in similar operations.
-  Rehabilitate the environment damaged by Core Operations in accordance with
Mongolian and international standards and codes in effect when the mine is closed 
in whole or in part.
The Power Plant Project will implement the environmental protection provisions of the IA as 
described in the ESIA (July 2012). A Supplemental ESIA specifically for the Power Plant Project 
is forthcoming.

On 18 October 2006, Ivanhoe entered into a Private Placement Agreement with Rio Tinto 
International Holdings Limited (Rio Tinto), a wholly owned member of the Rio Tinto Group. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Rio Tinto agreed to acquire 19.7% of the issued and 
outstanding common shares of Ivanhoe in two tranches. Through a series of other 
agreements with Ivanhoe, Mr Robert Friedland, and others; through its exercise of warrants; 
and through purchases, Rio Tinto has since increased its shareholding in Ivanhoe to 
approximately 51%. Under the terms of the Private Placement Agreement, Rio Tinto and 
Ivanhoe established a joint Technical Committee to oversee and approve all aspects of the 
engineering, construction, development, and operation of Oyu Tolgoi. Rio Tinto also acquired 
a right of first refusal in the event of Ivanhoe proposing to dispose of any interest, direct or 
indirect, in Oyu Tolgoi to a third party, other than the GOM.
On 8 December 2010, Ivanhoe entered into a Heads of Agreement with Rio Tinto. The terms 
of this agreement include but are not limited to:
  Rio Tinto agreed to make available to Ivanhoe a non-revolving interim funding facility of
up to US$1.8 billion to be used to fund expenditures in respect of Oyu Tolgoi, while the 
parties agreed to work together to complete the project financing.
  Pursuant to the terms of a governance agreement, Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe established a
joint Operating Committee, through which decisions concerning the exercise of 
Ivanhoe’s indirect voting rights in OT LLC are made at both the board of directors’ level 
and the shareholder level.
  Pursuant to the terms of a Management Agreement, a Rio Tinto affiliate could be
appointed to manage, supervise, and conduct all matters and activities related to 
Oyu Tolgoi.
On 17 April 2012, Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, under 
which Rio Tinto agreed to support and provide certain elements of a comprehensive funding 
package for Ivanhoe to underpin the development of Oyu Tolgoi. The parties also agreed to 
make changes to Ivanhoe’s board and management. More specifically, under the 
Memorandum of Agreement, among other terms:
  Rio Tinto agreed to provide a standby commitment for the full amount of a US$1.8 billion
rights offering by Ivanhoe. Rio Tinto also agreed to provide US$1.5 billion of bridge 
financing to Ivanhoe. The proceeds from the rights offering and the bridge financing 
funding are to be used by Ivanhoe only to fund expenditure in respect of Oyu Tolgoi.
  Rio Tinto restated its commitment to work with Ivanhoe to secure the project financing
and agreed to provide completion support by way of a guarantee of certain obligations 
of Ivanhoe under the project financing. Once project financing is in place, both the 
US$1.8 billion interim funding facility made available under the 2010 Heads of Agreement 
and any amounts drawn down under the US$1.5 billion bridge financing are required to 
be repaid to Rio Tinto in full.

It was agreed that a new 13-member Ivanhoe board would be formed, the majority of 
whom were to be independent directors, comprising:
-  Eleven Rio Tinto-nominated directors, six of whom would be independent until at least
18 January 2014.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 54 of 519
-  Two directors nominated by Robert Friedland, one of whom was to be independent,
for so long as Mr Friedland retains an interest in Ivanhoe of at least 10%.
It was agreed that Rio Tinto would be entitled to nominate, and the Ivanhoe board 
would approve, the CEO and CFO of Ivanhoe.
Ivanhoe issued to Rio Tinto a new anti-dilution subscription right to enable it to maintain its 
proportional interest in Ivanhoe and approximately 74.2 million additional fixed price 
Series D share warrants.


Following the Ivanhoe rights offering, which expired on 19 July 2012 (in which approximately 
99.2% of the shares were taken up in the initial subscriptions of the offering rights), Rio Tinto 
together with 7999674 Canada Inc., also a wholly owned member of the Rio Tinto Group, 
increased its shareholding in Ivanhoe from approximately 50.9% to approximately 51%.
Copies of the Private Placement Agreement, the Heads of Agreement, and the 
Memorandum of Agreement have been filed on SEDAR and can be accessed at 
www.sedar.com.
On 9 November 2004, the Shivee Tolgoi Effective Date, an Earn-In and Equity Participation 
Agreement was finalised between Ivanhoe and Entrée Gold Inc., giving Ivanhoe the right to 
earn an interest in a portion of the overall area of Entrée’s Shivee Tolgoi Property, initially 
referred to as the Shivee Tolgoi Earn-in Property (see Figure 4.1). On 11 March 2008, Ivanhoe 
notified Entrée that it had incurred sufficient expenditures (>$27.5 million) to earn a 
60% interest, as was outlined in the initial agreement. At the end of June 2008, Ivanhoe 
notified Entrée that it had incurred sufficient expenditures (>$35 million) to earn an 80% 
participating interest and thereby form a joint venture. The property is now referred to as the 
Shivee Tolgoi Joint Venture. Details of the EJV licences are provided in Table 4.4.

The JV property is adjacent to the north, east, and south of the Oyu Tolgoi Licence and 
includes Entrée’s Javkhlant Mining Licence (15225A) and the eastern portion of the Shivee 
Tolgoi Mining Licence (15226A). The boundaries of the mining licences are defined by latitude 
and longitude coordinates and by UTM coordinates with datum set to  
WGS-84 Zone 48N.
In October 2009, Entrée received notice that its application for conversion of the 
Shivee Tolgoi and Javkhlant exploration concessions to mining licences had been approved 
by the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia. Successful conversion of these exploration 
licences to mining licences was a condition precedent to the IA signed in October 2009 by
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 55 of 519
Ivanhoe Mines (now TQR), the parent company of OT LLC, and Rio Tinto plc, minority partner 
in the project, with the GOM. It was a condition of the IA that the rights held by Ivanhoe 
Mines in respect of ML 15225A and 15226A were to be transferred to OT LLC; this had been 
effected by an assignment agreement dated 1 March 2005 executed by Ivanhoe Mines in 
favour of OT LLC.
Under the terms of the Entrée-Ivanhoe Mines Joint Venture, Entrée retains either a 20% or 30% 
carried interest in the Shivee Tolgoi and Javkhlant mining licences, depending on the depth 
of mineralisation. The duration and financial obligations to the GOM for the mining licences 
are described in Section 4.1.
Major changes have been recently made into foreign investment regulations of Mongolia. 
On 3 October 2013, the Mongolian Parliament passed the new Investment Law, which 
provides a complex regulatory regime on foreign and local investments in Mongolia.
Key features of the Investment Law include:
  Foreign investors may invest in Mongolia upon being registered at the State Registration
of Legal Entities.
  A foreign State-owned legal entity is only required to obtain permission where a
proposed investment in Mongolia involves the acquisition of one-third or more of the 
shares in an entity involved in a “sector of strategic importance”, which is the minerals, 
banking and finance and media and communication sectors.
  The Investment Law grants a land possession right to foreign investors and it will only be 
enforceable once the 2003 Land Law is amended or revised, which is yet to be done.
  A foreign investor may be entitled to a tax stabilisation, if its investment in Mongolia is 
more than MNT30 billion. Types of taxes that may be covered in tax stabilisations are: 
corporate income tax, customs duty, value-added tax, and payment for use of minerals 
resources (royalty). It applies to an investment agreement.
  A period of tax stabilisation is different depending on an amount of investment and a
region or province in which the investment is made. The maximum period of tax 
stabilisation in a mining sector is 18 years. A period of investment agreement may be 
longer than the period of tax stabilisation.
  A foreign investor who is investing more than MNT500 billion may enter into an investment
agreement with the Minister in charge of investment issues.
The Regulation on Establishing Investment Agreement was adopted by the GOM on 
21 February 2014 in accordance with Article 20.6 of the Investment Law. Foreign investors 
submit an application to enter into an investment agreement and the Ministry of Economic 
Development decides whether or not to enter into the agreement. The Ministry of Economic 
Development may reject to enter into the agreement. It is also stated that the GOM does 
have the right to suspend or terminate an investment agreement if an investor fails to perform 
obligations under the agreement.

In recognition that several environmental and social baseline studies and impact assessment 
reports have been prepared for the various components of Oyu Tolgoi since 2003, OT LLC 
commissioned a consolidated ESIA in 2010 that is intended to pull together all of the 
environmental and social baseline and impact assessment work done to date into one report 
for lender review. The ESIA is a living document that has been updated and expanded with 
the latest available data. It was circulated for public disclosure in the Project Area of 
Influence in 2012. The public feedback was obtained. Currently, the management plans are 
under implementation.
The 2010 ESIA and the 2009 SIA Final Report that preceded it are intended to align with 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Performance Requirements, Rio Tinto’s Communities 
Standard, and Ivanhoe Mines’ ‘Statement of Values and Responsibilities’.
The Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP) applies to the construction, operational, 
decommissioning, and post-closure phases of Oyu Tolgoi. It is designed to ensure that the 
project avoids, minimises, mitigates, or compensates any impact on cultural heritage and 
archaeological items in the Project Area of Influence. It covers all project activities that have 
the potential to result in impacts to tangible or intangible heritage related to:
  Mining and quarrying of materials.
  Road construction (access roads, main road) and associated borrow pit excavation.
  Site preparation and infrastructure installation.
  Staging areas used for construction.
  Excavation and protection of dykes, culverts, and diversion channels.
  Waste rock storage and waste management activities.

Increased human presence, including driving, consultation activities, and monitoring 
activities.
  Construction of worker housing.

Increased presence of foreigners in the workforce with different ideologies, values, and 
cultural traditions who interact with the local population.
  Site rehabilitation and reclamation.
The CHMP describes methods to effectively identify, map, document, and protect any 
archaeological resources that may be encountered during the project. The objectives of this 
management plan are to:
  Outline the legal obligations/project standards with regard to the protection of cultural
heritage.

Identify the actual and potential sources of impact on both tangible and intangible 
heritage.
  Establish effective plans, programmes, and procedures for managing archaeological
sites and cultural assets, including potential chance finds during construction and 
operations.
  Define roles and responsibilities.
  Define monitoring and reporting procedures.
  Define training requirements.
The building and maintenance of enduring relationships with communities, Government, non-
government organisations, and civil society in the Project Area of Influence, based on trust, 
openness, and the pursuit of mutual interests, is the foundation of the Oyu Tolgoi Community 
Relations Policy. This policy is in accordance with Rio Tinto’s community standards. Elements 
of the policy are listed below.
  Multi-year community plan,
  Baseline communities’ assessment,
  Community and regional investment, cooperation,
  Cultural heritage,
  Resettlement of families and/or communities,
  Legally binding agreements with communities,
  Proposed compensation payments.
To maintain ongoing dialogue with local communities, OT LLC operates five local offices—the 
site administration office, Khanbogd soum centre, and Dalanzadgad, Bayan Ovoo, and 
Manlai soums—in addition to its head office in Ulaanbaatar. These offices are staffed by 
trained personnel who conduct regular informal and formal information sessions with local 
residents to keep them apprised of project developments, to identify any potential impacts 
or community grievances, and to jointly collaborate on mitigation measures.
The plan will be reviewed regularly, at least every three months during construction, to ensure 
that it remains valid and meets the needs of OT LLC, local communities, and other relevant 
stakeholders.

The topography of the project area largely consists of gravel-covered plains, with low hills 
along the northern and western lease borders. Small, scattered rock outcrops and colluvial 
talus are widespread within the northern, western, and southern parts of the property.
The Project is centred at approximately latitude 43°00'45"N, longitude 106°51'15"E or UTM 
coordinates 4,764,000 mN and 651,000 mE with datum set to WGS-84, Zone 48N. The SOT and 
Hugo Dummett deposits are the principal zones of mineralisation defined on the Project and 
these occur within a north–north-east trending, 8.0 km long and 1.0 km wide mineralised 
corridor in the central portion of the Project at elevations ranging from approximately 
1,140–1,215 masl.
Access to the property from the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, is possible either by an 
unpaved road, via Mandalgovi, a 12 hour drive under good conditions, or by air.
A permanent domestic airport has been constructed at Oyu Tolgoi to support the 
transportation of people and goods to the site from Ulaanbaatar. It further serves as the 
regional airport for Khanbogd soum.
The permanent airport is 13 km north of the Oyu Tolgoi camp area. It is a non-precision 
approach, visual flight rules (VFR) facility. The runway surface is concrete 3,250 m long x 45 m 
wide, with a concrete apron at the terminal building. The runway has been aligned to the 
prevailing north-west–south-east wind direction to minimise cross-wind conditions and 
facilitate optimal landing and take-off conditions. The design is set to service commercial 
aircraft up to the Boeing 737-800 series aircraft.
The Trans-Mongolian Railway crosses the Mongolia-China border approximately 420 km east 
of the property, traversing the country from south-east to north-west through Ulaanbaatar to 
the border with Russia. At the Mongolian-Chinese border the rail gauge changes from the 
Russian standard to the Chinese standard. The Chinese Government has upgraded 226 km of 
road from Ganqimaodao to Wuyuan, providing a direct road link between the Mongolian 
border crossing at Gashuun Sukhait, 80 km south of Oyu Tolgoi, and the Trans-China Railway 
system. A 105 km sealed road is being constructed to the Mongolian-Chinese border crossing 
at Gashuun Sukhait. The remaining 23 km is expected to be completed in 2015.
Ulaanbaatar has an international airport, and Mandalgovi and Dalanzadgad have regional 
airports. There is currently charter air service between the site and Ulaanbaatar. The closest 
regional airport in China is at Hohhot. There are no airport facilities at Wuyuan or Bayan Ovoo.

The Small Gobi Strictly Protected Area (SGSPA) is approximately 80 km south of the mine 
licence area, on the Mongolia-China border. The access road corridor traverses through 
13 km of the protected area. With the acceptance of the EIA for the corridor in June 2004, 
OT LLC has received approval to cross through this area.
There are a number of communities in the South Gobi (Omnogovi) relatively near the project 
site. The most prominent is Dalanzadgad, population 21,581 (as of the end of 2013), which is 
the centre of the Omnogovi aimag and is 220 km north-west of the Oyu Tolgoi property. 
Facilities at Dalanzadgad include a regional hospital, tertiary technical colleges, a domestic 
airport, and a 6 MW capacity coal-fired power station. OT LLC sees Dalanzadgad as a 
suitable centre for regional recruiting and training and in 2010 signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science that included the 
conduction of a new mining-focused professional and technical training centre there.
In addition to new vocational centres at Dalanzadgad and Ulaanbaatar, OT LLC is investing 
in facilities and equipment upgrades at five vocational educational establishments in the 
country, and the Rio Tinto Group (including OT LLC) is entering partnerships with universities for 
specific programmes. In particular, the Rio Tinto Group will provide the National University of 
Mongolia (NUM) with educational resource materials, scholarships, and internships. In turn, 
NUM will support the company’s public education and awareness initiatives and deliver short-
term courses.
Other Omnogovi aimag communities near Oyu Tolgoi include Khanbogd, the centre of the 
Khanbogd soum, 45 km to the north-east and closest to the site, with a population of 
approximately 4,712 (as of the end of 2013); Bayan Ovoo (population 1,600), 65 km to the 
west; and Manlai (population 2,400), 150 km to the north. These communities could all 
conceivable increase in size as a result of the Oyu Tolgoi Project. Farther north, Mandalgovi 
(population 13,500), the capital of the Dundgovi aimag, 310 km north of the project on the 
road to Ulaanbaatar, could also be subject to project-related effects.
The South Gobi region has a continental, semi-desert climate. The spring and autumn seasons 
are cool, summers are hot, and winters are cold. Typical of desert climates, the site has low 
average humidity and significant variations in daily temperatures.
Knight Piésold conducted an extensive evaluation of the available climatic information for 
the Project area using regional data from bibliographical sources and local data from nearby 
climate stations.
The climatic conditions are such that the operating season for the Project will cover the entire 
year on a continuous shift basis. Minor disruptions are expected and have been allowed for in 
the Project operating hours estimates.

Data were derived primarily from climatic records for Bayan Ovoo, approximately 65 km west 
of Oyu Tolgoi, and from two years of available Oyu Tolgoi site data. Although these data 
have some limitations, they are considered adequate for use in design. Data were also 
obtained from Khanbogd, approximately 45 km north-east of the site, Dalanzadgad, 220 km 
north-west, and Hailiutu, 200 km south-west, but the information from Bayan Ovoo was 
deemed the most representative of conditions at Oyu Tolgoi.
Temperatures range from an extreme maximum of about 50°C to an extreme minimum of 
about –34°C. The typical air temperature in winter fluctuates between +6°C and –21°C. In the 
coldest month, January, the average temperature is –13°C. Data from Bayan Ovoo are 
shown in Table 5.1.

The average relative humidity ranges from 18.7% in May to 53.3% in January. Daily relative 
humidity is dependent on current temperature and varies considerably.
Table 5.2 shows monthly relative humidity statistics using the calculated hourly averages from 
the site weather station. The design relative humidity for summer is based on an analysis of the 
July 2002 and 2003 hourly temperatures and corresponding relative humidity values. The 
design relative humidity for a 1 July temperature of 34.5°C is 15.1%.

Solar radiation data have been collected at the Oyu Tolgoi site station since 2002. Solar 
radiation is measured in watts per square metre (W/m2) and fluctuates during the day, 
ranging from 0 W/m2 at night and peaking soon after mid-day. The average daily maximum 
for the two years of data available is 655 W/m2, the highest daily maximum is 1,030 W/m2, and 
the lowest daily maximum is 76 W/m2.
Maximum levels of solar radiation are lower during the winter. The average daily maximum is 
429 W/m2 for January and 859 W/m2 for July.
Average annual precipitation is 57 mmpa, 90% of which falls as rain and the rest as snow. 
Snowfall accumulations rarely exceed 50 mm. Maximum rainfall events of up to 44 mmph for 
a 1-in-10 year, 10-minute storm event have been recorded. In an average year, rainfalls 
occur on only 19 days, and snow falls on 10–15 days. The ground snow load is 0.1 kPa. 
Monthly rainfall data are shown in Table 5.4 and Table 5.5. Both tables are derived from 
Bayan Ovoo data for 1975–2002.

Local records indicate that thunderstorms are likely to occur from 2–8 days each year at 
Oyu Tolgoi. Electrical activity generally totals about 29 hours each year. An average storm will 
have up to 83 lightning flashes a minute.
Given the importance of this variable for determining project water requirements, a number 
of different methods were used to generate and analyse evaporation data to determine 
design levels. The results are summarised in Table 5.6. It should be noted that site 
measurements are ongoing to confirm these results.

Wind is usually present at the site, predominantly from the north. Very high winds are 
accompanied by sandstorms that often severely reduce visibility for several hours at a time. 
At present, site-specific wind monitoring data are available for only a short period of time, less 
than a year. Based on regional information, windstorms can have gusts up to 50 m/s. 
Snowstorms and blizzards with winds up to 40 m/s occur in the Gobi region for five to eight 
days each winter. Spring dust storms are far more frequent and can continue through June 
and July. The average storm duration is six to seven hours. An average of 120 hours of dust 
storm activity and 220 hours of drifting dust are recorded each year.
Based on the Mongolian Code, the Basic Wind Speed is 34 m/s. Maximum one hour speeds 
recorded at Bayan Ovoo are shown in Table 5.7. The number of dust storms per month is 
shown in Table 5.8.

OT LLC has a Power Purchase Agreement with the Inner Mongolia Power Corporation to 
supply power to Oyu Tolgoi. The term of this agreement covers the commissioning of the 
business plus the initial four years of commercial operations.
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM 
for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-based independent power producer (IPP). The aim of 
the PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the GOM 
and OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. Participation in the 
PSCA meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power supply within 
Mongolia within four years from the commencement of commercial production. Signing of a 
PSCA has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the establishment of an IPP 
at Tavan Tolgoi is studied.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an IPP 
to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with 
Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 64 of 519
Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
The locations of power providers in Northern China is shown in Figure 5.1.
The Project area is located within the closed Central Asian drainage basin and has no 
outflow to the ocean. Most riverbeds in this drainage basin are ephemeral creeks that remain 
dry most times of the year. The Undai River is the most significant hydrological feature of the 
Project area. A tributary of the river passes through the site.
Flows after heavy summer rainstorms often result in very turbulent, high-velocity mud flows, 
locally termed ‘Gobian wild floods’. These floods have been known to destroy road crossings 
and to carry away vehicles caught in the riverbeds. No surface flow data are available for 
these isolated and episodic flood events. During exploration, only two such events were 
experienced from 2002–2009. Further discussions with locals indicate these events can occur 
yearly (excluding current drought conditions).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Shallow springs are used by wildlife and livestock as drinking water sources. Migratory wildlife 
movements during summer months in the Gobi are likely to be dictated by the presence of 
surface water in natural springs.
Water quality baseline data for surface waters throughout the Project area, access road 
corridor, and aquifer areas are being collected through current monitoring programmes.
Potential impacts on surface water systems in the Project area include local changes to 
natural flow paths and depletion of springs, ephemeral wetlands, and salt-marshes from 
project development and operation activities. The mitigation and design work with regard to 
surface water focused on the potential impacts to surface water quality include increased 
sedimentation and risk of pollution of springs, ephemeral wetlands, and salt-marshes from 
increased erosion, contaminated dust fallout, contaminant spills, and accidents associated 
with project construction and operational activities.
Fugitive dust control management plans and spill management systems are being used to 
avoid and mitigate potential impacts to air and surface water quality. These studies are used 
to mitigate impacts that may result in loss of wildlife habitat, decrease in wildlife health, and 
decrease in wildlife population because of higher mortality rates.
On and off-site infrastructure associated with the upgrading of road facilities at the site and 
along the corridor include the formation of dedicated stream crossings, which may reduce 
the number of undefined and informal crossings that now exist along tracks within the 
corridor.
Detailed groundwater investigations to date have been concentrated in the Gunii Hooloi, 
Galbyn Gobi, and Nariin Zag aquifer areas to assess the potential to meet Oyu Tolgoi’s 
estimated water demand. Groundwater investigations conducted in the mine licence area 
focused on assessment of required dewatering rates for mine works and the potential to 
meet the Project’s camp and construction water demands.
Process water supply has been registered and will be piped from the Gunii Hooloi basin to the 
north-west of the Project area. Current studies are ongoing at site to confirm groundwater 
model predictions with respect to dewatering of the pit and underground and groundwater 
environmental impacts.
Oyu Tolgoi is a remote greenfields project and extensive infrastructure has been constructed 
in addition to the concentrating facilities. The major initial infrastructure elements include:
  Water Borefields
Water is supplied from the Gunii Hooloi basin, which extends 35–75 km north of 
Oyu Tolgoi. Bores were developed in the south-west and the north-east areas of the 
Gunii Hooloi borefield with storage lagoons along the pipeline designed to provide for 
emergency use without impacting site water needs.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 66 of 519
  Water Treatment
A permanent water treatment facility and bottling plant has been constructed to treat 
raw water from the Gunii Hooloi borefield to drinking (potable) and domestic water 
standards.
  Housing
Accommodation facilities have been constructed to support the operations phase of the 
Project. Temporary facilities will also be constructed throughout the Project to support 
additional manpower requirements for construction and expansion demands.
  Airstrip
The airport is located approximately 7.0 km north of Oyu Tolgoi and facilitates for the 
transport of people and goods to the site from Ulaanbaatar and other points of 
departure.
  Supporting Facilities
Administration, training, mine equipment maintenance, gatehouse, medical centre, fire 
station, heating plant, fuel storage, and warehouse facilities, among others were 
constructed to support operational requirements over the life-of-mine.
  Railroads
Initially, the transport of bulk supplies and the delivery of copper concentrate to China is 
by access road to the railhead. However, direct rail transport is considered a long-term 
transportation solution after this initial development period.
The land surrounding the mine licence area is predominantly used for nomadic herding of 
goats, camels, and sheep by small family units. Use is based on informal traditional Mongolian 
principles of shared grazing rights with limited land tenure for semi-permanent winter shelters 
and other improvements. Initiation of the herder support programme has reduced the 
incidence of land use conflict between current mineral exploration and grazing practices. 
The Project intends to maintain co-existence of traditional grazing practices and mineral 
development except where there is a risk to public safety or livestock.
The Law of Mongolia on Environmental Impact Assessment (2001) and the guidelines issued 
for the IMMI EIA (2001) require the inclusion of a risk assessment in project documentation. 
‘Risk assessment’ means identification and prediction of the possible emergencies and 
accidents that could occur during the production process or natural disasters, and 
elimination and mitigation of their consequences.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

A complete list of outstanding work to be completed at various stages of development, and 
current status, is included in the report. Key work includes baseline studies and assessment of 
project-related impacts along the access road corridor from Mongolia-China border to 
Wuyuan, China; wildlife population dynamics, habitat use, ecology and migratory habits of 
key species within the region; trans-boundary issues, cumulative effects, human health risks, 
and noise effects; and continued evaluation of acid mine drainage and metal leachate 
potential, hydrology, water quality of surface water occurrences, groundwater resources, air 
quality, soil chemistry; and projected impacts. Completion of this work will aid in customising 
and improving existing environmental management and monitoring plans as part of an 
Adaptive Environmental Management System.
As part of overall project planning, OT LLC has prepared a preliminary reclamation and 
closure plan. Certain features of the mine, such as the open pit, waste dumps, and tailings 
impoundment, will create permanent changes to the current landscape that cannot be 
completely remedied through reclamation. The closure plan will; however, ensure that these 
disturbed areas are seismically and chemically stable as to limit the ecological impacts to the 
surrounding water, air, and land.
The closure plan for the Project will address the socio-economic impacts of mine closure 
considering that the existence and economic survival of some communities may have 
become dependent on the Project. Issues include ongoing environmental management 
during and after reclamation, loss of jobs, and socio-economic impact to the region.
The primary reclamation objective is to develop the mine in a manner that prevents leaving 
an unsustainable environmental legacy and that considers community input and values. 
Other key objectives are as follows:
  Protect public health and safety during all stages of project development.
  Prevent or mitigate environmental degradation caused by mining-related activities.
  Return the maximum amount of disturbed land to pre-mining conditions suitable for
nomadic herdsmen and their grazing animals.
  Secure the open pit areas, subsidence zones, waste dumps, and tailings storage facilities
to ensure public and environmental safety.
  Plan and implement reclamation techniques that eliminate the need for long-term
maintenance presence on-site and permit OT LLC to ‘walk away’ from the reclaimed 
mine with no environmental or social encumbrances.
OT LLC is and will continue to develop environmental monitoring plans, including proposed 
activities and schedules, to ensure that environmental parameters meet the criteria, 
standards, and limits laid out in the EIA and Environmental Protection Plan. In accordance 
with Mongolian Law, OT LLC will undertake monitoring at its own expense using approved 
methods and accredited facilities. The monitoring permits procedures and activities to be 
adjusted and/or modified as necessary to ensure optimal environmental protection.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Parameters to be monitored during the closure and post-closure phases of the mine include 
the following:
  Surface water and groundwater quality.
  Physical stability of tailings deposits.
  Physical stability of the river water diversion dike, waste rock dumps, drainage ditches,
and concrete shaft/raise caps.

Isolation of open pit voids and unfilled subsidence zones, including status of open water 
and erosion controls.
  Success of indigenous revegetation, including remediation as required until proven to be
self-sustaining.
  Condition of groundwater monitoring wells, piezometers, survey monuments, and other
instrumentation.
  Effectiveness of dust control measures on waste rock, tailings storage facility, and other
waste areas with specific attention to potential wind-blown contaminant sources.
OT LLC reported in IDOP that a seismic hazard assessment of Oyu Tolgoi was completed. The 
seismicity of Oyu Tolgoi was determined to be low, and the seismicity of eastern Mongolia is 
generally low. However, to the west of Oyu Tolgoi lies the Mongolian Altai – a tectonically 
active mountain range stretching 1,700 km from south-west Siberia to the Gobi Desert. The 
easternmost extension of the Mongolian Altai is known as the Gobi Altai, which dies out 
approximately 50–100 km west of Oyu Tolgoi.
The Research Centre for Astronomy and Geophysics of Academy of Science (Seismology 
Centre) is responsible for assessing seismology in Mongolia. OT LLC appointed the Seismology 
Centre to perform a seismic assessment for the project.

The existence of copper in the Oyu Tolgoi area has been recognised since the Bronze Age, 
but contemporary exploration for Mineral Resources did not begin until the 1980s, when a 
joint Mongolian and Russian geochemical survey team identified a molybdenum anomaly 
over the Central zone. Evidence of alteration and copper mineralisation at the South zone 
was first noted by Garamjav in 1983, during a regional reconnaissance of the area. In 
September 1996, Garamjav guided geologists from Magma Copper Company (Magma) to 
the area. These geologists identified a porphyry-copper leached cap over Central zone and 
quickly moved to secure exploration tenements. Magma was subsequently acquired by BHP 
(BHP), later BHP-Billiton. The target at Oyu Tolgoi was a large supergene-enriched porphyry.
Geophysical surveying at Oyu Tolgoi was first initiated by BHP in 1997. An airborne 
magnetometer survey was flown at a height of approximately 100 m on 300 m spaced, east-
west oriented lines over approximately 1,120 km2 of BHP’s mineral concession. The survey 
provided good resolution of the magnetic features to facilitate geological and structural 
interpretation across the concession areas. BHP also undertook an induced polarisation (IP) 
survey using a single gradient array with a 2,000 m AB electrode spacing and a ground 
magnetometer survey. The first survey was conducted on north-south oriented lines and 
produced data that were difficult to reconcile to the then-known geology. A later survey by 
Ivanhoe Mines Ltd (Ivanhoe) in 2001 was conducted on east-west oriented lines and 
therefore perpendicular to the structural trend. This immediately showed the close correlation 
between mineralisation and chargeable response, which has proven to be highly successful 
in further exploration. Both IP datasets were surveyed by a local Mongolian surveying team at 
250 m line spacing. The surveys covered the Southern, Southwest, Central, and North 
exploration targets but did not extend into the Far North region that ultimately became the 
Hugo Dummett deposit.
BHP carried out geological, geochemical (stream sediment and soil), and geophysical 
surveys and diamond drilling programmes (23 drillholes total) in the Central and South zones 
in 1997 and 1998. Copper and gold values were encountered at depths from 20–70 m below 
surface, and a supergene-enriched, chalcocite blanket was encountered in one drillhole 
(OT-3). Based on the results of this drilling, BHP performed a Mineral Resources estimate in 
1998, but the resulting tonnage and grade estimate was considered too small to meet BHP 
corporate objectives, and BHP elected to offer the property for joint venture. Ivanhoe visited 
Oyu Tolgoi in May 1999 and agreed to acquire 100% interest in the property, subject to a 2.0% 
net smelter return royalty. In 2000, Ivanhoe completed 8,000 m of reverse circulation (RC) 
drilling, mainly at the Central zone, to explore the chalcocite blanket discovered earlier by 
BHP. Based on this drilling, Ivanhoe updated the Mineral Resources estimates.
In 2001, Ivanhoe continued RC drilling, mostly in the South zone area, to test for additional 
supergene copper mineralisation, and then drilled three core holes to test the deep 
hypogene copper–gold potential. One of these holes, OTRCD150, drilled over 
Southwest zone, intersected 508 m of chalcopyrite mineralisation from a depth of 70 m, 
grading 0.81% Cu and 1.17 g/t Au. This marked the discovery of the SOT deposit.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 70 of 519
These results encouraged Ivanhoe to mount a major follow-up drill programme. In late 2002, 
drilling in the far northern section of the property intersected 638 m of bornite–chalcopyrite-
rich mineralisation in drillhole OTD270, starting at a depth of 222 m. This hole marked the 
discovery of the Hugo Dummett deposit. A first-time Mineral Resources estimate for the 
deposit was prepared in 2004, and the Mineral Resources were updated in 2005 and again in 
2007.
In 2004, a scoping study was prepared to evaluate the economics of mining the SOT deposit 
by open pit methods. In 2005, the first integrated development plan (IDP05) for the Project 
was prepared, which envisaged the SOT deposit being mined as an open pit and the 
Hugo North deposit being developed as an underground block cave mine.
Ivanhoe initiated a 6.7 m diameter exploration shaft (Shaft 1) into the Hugo North deposit. The 
Shaft 1 headframe, hoisting plant, and associated infrastructure were completed in 
January 2006. The shaft had been sunk to a depth of 1,385 m by January 2008. Shaft 1 is 
designed to provide access to the Hugo North and Hugo South deposits. Development from 
the shaft has enabled additional delineation drilling and rock characterisation for proposed 
mining operations. Lateral development is currently in progress.
In 2010, the integrated development plan (IDP) was updated as a development and 
operating plan (IDOP) within the framework of a signed and effective IA with the GOM. The 
2010 integrated development plan (IDP10) assumed that the mining operation would still 
comprise open pit mining of the SOT deposit and block caving of an initial part of the Hugo 
North deposit.
The initial Hugo North Lift 1 with several open pit mine phases, is the subject of the feasibility 
study submission. The potential development of the Hugo North Lift 2 (with a Lift 1 low-grade 
panel extension) and Hugo South underground mining will continue to be studied.
During 20112012, a detailed integrated development and operating plan was prepared 
(DIDOP) but not submitted as a report update of IDOP and IDP10. The latter has been 
superseded by the 2013–2014 Oyu Tolgoi submission to the Minerals Council of Mongolia for 
approval.
Ivanhoe Mines initiated exploration work on the Shivee Tolgoi and Javkhlant licences in 
November 2004, following the signing of an earn-in agreement with Entrée Gold.
Before that time, Entrée had undertaken soil geochemical surveys, ground magnetics, 
Bouguer gravity and pole-dipole geophysical surveying, and geological mapping, but had 
failed to locate any mineralisation of significance.
Starting at the northern boundary of the Oyu Tolgoi Mining Licence, an IP survey was run on 
100 m spaced lines oriented east-west to trace the northern projection of the Hugo North 
deposit. This initial IP survey used gradient array with 11,000 m AB electrode spacing and 
covered an area extending 5.6 km north of the boundary and 10 km in width. Subsequent IP 
surveys covering smaller areas within the larger area were carried out with gradient arrays.
The IP surveys resulted in the delineation of a significant chargeability feature being traced
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 71 of 519
for approximately 4.0 km north along strike of the Hugo North deposit. Additional IP 
chargeability targets were also revealed 2.5–3.0 km west of the Hugo North trend and are 
referred to as the Eagle anomalies.
Ivanhoe commenced drilling northward from the northern boundary of the Oyu Tolgoi Mining 
Licence in 2005. A first-time resource estimate for the Hugo North Extension deposit was 
completed in 2006. Underground mining plans for Hugo North Extension were included in a 
Sensitivity Analysis Addendum to the DIDOP report.
In 2005 and 2006, Ivanhoe Mines (Mongolia) Inc. (now OT LLC) conducted IP surveying on 
100 m spaced, east-west lines across Entrée Gold’s Javkhlant licence to the south of the SOT 
Mineral Resource area. This resulted in the discovery of three significant chargeability IP 
anomalies subsequently named the Sparrow South, Castle Rock, and Southwest Magnetic 
anomalies. Core drilling was initiated to test these IP anomalies in early 2007. A series of 
successful drillholes in the area supported a first-time Mineral Resources estimate over what is 
now known as the Heruga deposit (formerly the Sparrow South anomaly) in 2008.
The negotiation and execution of mining agreements between the GOM and investors is a 
relatively recent phenomenon. The renegotiation of mining agreements is even less common 
and appears to have been influenced by political considerations as well as the relative 
commercial leverage exercised by the investor. Accordingly, there really is no '“general 
market practice” as such with respect to this topic.
In the interim between passage of the 1997 Minerals Law and the 2006 Minerals Law, the 
international commodity market improved greatly in comparison with the 1990s, and 
Mongolia’s political, economic, and legal environment underwent a major transition. This is 
reflected in amendments to the regulatory environment and changes to the fiscal regime of 
the mining sector. Among other changes, the royalty rate was increased from 2.5%–5.0%; a 
so-called windfall profit tax was introduced on certain mineral products such as gold and 
copper at the rate of 68%; and a revised version of tax legislation was enacted, including the 
Law of Mongolia on Corporate Income Tax dated 29 June 2006 (the Corporate Income Tax 
Law). The 2006 Minerals Law also introduced State participation requirements in so-called 
deposits of strategic importance.
The Law of Mongolia on Investment came into effect on 1 November 2013 (Investment Law) 
and replaces the Law of Mongolia on Foreign Investment, enacted on 10 May 1993 and the 
Law of Mongolia on the Regulation of Foreign Investment in Business Entities Operating in 
Sectors of Strategic Importance, enacted on 17 May 2012.
In accordance with the Investment Law, investors may enter into an investment agreement 
with the Government, if the proposed investment exceeds MNT 500 billion. The Investment 
Law is very much a framework law and the Government only recently issued the relevant 
regulations in relation to entering into such investment agreements. As of today's date, it is 
hard to locate any information as to whether any investors have entered into investment 
agreements under the new regime.

In 2007, the GOM renegotiated tax terms of the Tsairt Mineral Stability Agreement and the 
Boroo Gold Stability Agreement as follows.
  Tsairt Minerals Stability Agreement – The GOM and Tsairt Minerals LLC entered into an 
amendment agreement to the Tsairt Minerals Stability Agreement on 23 August 2007, 
pursuant to which the terms relating to corporate income tax and royalties were 
amended.
  Boroo Gold Stability Agreement – Under the amended stability agreement, Boroo Gold 
was required to pay corporate income tax applicable under the Corporate Income Tax 
Law and royalties at increased rate of 5.0%.
Both amendments were signed by representatives of the GOM and the mining companies. 
The Finance Minister entered into the amendment agreements on behalf of the GOM in 
accordance with the terms of the 1997 Minerals Law. The amendments modified the tax 
terms of the relevant mineral projects, which were stabilised for the agreed period to make 
them consistent with changes to the fiscal regime made by the GOM after 1998.
Limited information is publicly available in respect of the renegotiation process for these two 
agreements, but it is understood that, even after renegotiation, they were significantly less 
favourable to the GOM than the current Oyu Tolgoi IA.
In September 2011, a faction of 20 members of the Parliament of Mongolia (MPs) submitted a 
petition to the Prime Minister demanding a renegotiation of the Oyu Tolgoi IA.
The GOM sent a letter to Ivanhoe Mines and Rio Tinto inviting them to renegotiate the IA. The 
changes related to the GOM acquiring an additional 16% interest in the project and the 
application of a sliding-scale royalty to the project. In response, the companies delivered 
letters to the GOM and the National Security Council noting that the IA had been presented 
to the Parliament of Mongolia for review, and was signed by the GOM in full compliance with 
all applicable Mongolian Laws, regulations, and parliamentary resolutions, and will deliver a 
fair distribution of values from the project to all stakeholders.
Subsequently, the GOM reaffirmed that the IA was signed in full compliance with all laws and 
regulations of Mongolia, and on 6 October 2011 issued a joint statement, together with 
Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe, in which all parties reaffirmed their commitment to the existing terms of 
the IA.
In September 2012, a faction of 24 MPs again submitted a petition to the Prime Minister 
calling for the enforcement of a Parliamentary Resolution that the GOM should own 50% of 
the project once investors recoup their initial investment. That demand was also dropped.

The information in this section is collated from geological and technical reports completed on 
the project during the period 2003–2011, the PhD thesis completed by Alan Wainwright on the 
Oyu Tolgoi deposit setting in 2008, and other sources as noted.
The Oyu Tolgoi deposits display copper–gold porphyry and related high-sulfidation copper–
gold deposit styles.
The following discussion of the typical nature of porphyry-copper deposits is sourced from 
Sillitoe (2010), Singer et al. (2008), and Sinclair (2006).
Porphyry-copper systems commonly define linear belts, some many hundreds of kilometres 
long, and some occurring less commonly in apparent isolation. The systems are closely 
related to underlying composite plutons, at paleo-depths of 5–15 km’s, which represent the 
supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate (>3 km) 
stocks or dyke swarms and associated mineralisation.
Commonly, several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones, 
resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry-copper systems. The 
rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size, grade, and type 
of mineralisation generated in porphyry-copper systems. Individual systems have life spans of 
circa 100,000 years to several million years, whereas deposit clusters or alignments, as well as 
entire belts, may remain active for 10 million years or longer.
Deposits are typically semicircular to elliptical in plan view. In cross-section, ore-grade 
material in a deposit typically has the shape of an inverted cone with the altered, but low 
grade, interior of the cone referred to as the ‘barren’ core. In some systems, the barren core 
may be a late-stage intrusion.
The alteration and mineralisation in porphyry-copper systems are zoned outward from the 
stocks or dyke swarms, which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic 
porphyry intrusions. Porphyry copper–gold–molybdenum deposits are centred on the 
intrusions, whereas carbonate wall rocks commonly host proximal copper–gold skarns and 
less commonly, distal base metal and gold skarn deposits. Beyond the skarn front, carbonate-
replacement copper and/or base metal–gold deposits, and/or sediment-hosted (distal-
disseminated) gold deposits can form. Peripheral mineralisation is less conspicuous in non-
carbonate wall rocks, but may include base metal or gold-bearing veins and mantos. Data 
compiled by Singer et al. (2008) indicate that the median size of the longest axis of alteration 
surrounding a porphyry copper deposit is 4–5 km, while the median size area of alteration is  
7–8 km2.
High-sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry-copper deposits, 
where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in their deeper feeder structures, and precious 
metal-rich, disseminated deposits form within the uppermost 500 m.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 74 of 519
Figure 7.1 shows a schematic section of a porphyry-copper deposit, illustrating the 
relationships of the lithocap to the porphyry body and associated mineralisation styles.
Note: Figure from Sillitoe (2010).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 75 of 519
Porphyry-copper mineralisation occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz-bearing veinlets as 
well as in disseminated forms in the altered rock between them. Magmatic-hydrothermal 
breccias may form during porphyry intrusion, with some breccias containing high-grade 
mineralisation because of their intrinsic permeability. In contrast, most phreatomagmatic 
breccias, constituting maar–diatreme systems, are poorly mineralised at both the porphyry 
copper and lithocap levels, mainly because many such phreatomagmatic breccias formed 
late in the evolution of systems, and the explosive nature of their emplacement fails to trap 
mineralising solutions.
Copper mineral assemblages are a function of the chemical composition of the fluid phase 
and the pressure and temperature conditions affecting the fluid. In primary, unoxidised or 
non-supergene-enriched ores, the most common sulfide assemblage is chalcopyrite ± 
bornite, with pyrite and minor amounts of molybdenite. In supergene-enriched ores, a typical 
assemblage can comprise chalcocite + covellite ± bornite, whereas in oxide ores a typical 
assemblage could include malachite + azurite + cuprite + chrysocolla, with minor amounts of 
minerals such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, and silicates. Typically, the principal 
copper sulfides consist of millimetre scale grains, but may be as large as 1–2 cm in diameter 
and, rarely, pegmatitic (larger than 2 cm).
Alteration zones in porphyry-copper deposits are typically classified on the basis of mineral 
assemblages. In silicate-rich rocks, the most common alteration minerals are K-feldspar, 
biotite, muscovite (sericite), albite, anhydrite, chlorite, calcite, epidote, and kaolinite. In 
silicate-rich rocks that have been altered to advanced argillic assemblages, the most 
common minerals are quartz, alunite, pyrophyllite, dickite, diaspore, and zunyite. In 
carbonate rocks, the most common minerals are garnet, pyroxene, epidote, quartz, 
actinolite, chlorite, biotite, calcite, dolomite, K-feldspar, and wollastonite. Other alteration 
minerals commonly found in porphyry-copper deposits are tourmaline, andalusite, and 
actinolite. Figure 7.2 shows the typical alteration assemblage of a porphyry-copper system.
Porphyry-copper systems are initiated by injection of oxidised magma saturated with sulfur- 
and metal-rich, aqueous fluids from cupolas on the tops of the subjacent parental plutons. 
The sequence of alteration and mineralisation events is principally a consequence of 
progressive rock and fluid cooling, from >700°C to <250°C, caused by solidification of the 
underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic–hydrostatic 
transition. Once the plutonic magmas stagnate, the high temperature, generally two phase 
hyper-saline liquid and vapour responsible for the potassic alteration and contained 
mineralisation at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration, respectively, gives 
way, at <350°C, to a single-phase, low to-moderate-salinity liquid that causes the sericite–
chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralisation. This same liquid also is a source 
for mineralisation of the peripheral parts of systems, including the overlying lithocaps.
The progressive thermal decline of the systems combined with syn-mineral paleo-surface 
degradation results in the characteristic overprinting (telescoping) and partial to total 
reconstitution of older by younger alteration and mineralisation types. Meteoric water is not 
required for formation of this alteration and mineralisation sequence, although its late ingress 
is commonplace.

Features that classify the Oyu Tolgoi deposits as porphyry-copper-type deposits include:
  Mineralisation is in or adjoining porphyritic intrusions of quartz-monzodiorite composition.
  Multiple emplacements of successive intrusive phases and a variety of breccias are
present.
  Mineralisation is spatially, temporally, and genetically associated with hydrothermal
alteration of the intrusive bodies and host rocks.
  Large zones of veining and stockwork mineralisation, together with minor disseminated
and replacement mineralisation, occur throughout large areas of hydrothermally altered 
rock, commonly coincident wholly or in part with hydrothermal or intrusion breccias.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 77 of 519
  Hydrothermal alteration is extensive and zoned, which is common to porphyry-copper 
deposits. Major alteration minerals in the biotite–chlorite, intermediate argillic, sericite, 
and K-feldspar alteration zones include quartz, chlorite, sericite, epidote, albite, biotite, 
hematite–magnetite, pyrophyllite, illite, and carbonate. Advanced argillic alteration 
zones can contain minerals such as kaolinite, zunyite, pyrophyllite, muscovite, illite, topaz, 
diaspore, andalusite, alunite, montmorillonite, dickite, tourmaline, and fluorite. In the 
leached cap, smectite and kaosmectite can also occur. The alteration assemblages are 
consistent with the physio-chemical conditions of a porphyry environment.
  Pyrite is the dominant sulfide, reflecting the typical high-sulfur content of porphyry-
copper deposits. The major ore minerals include chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, 
covellite, and enargite. In some zones, minerals such as tennantite, tenorite, cubanite, 
and molybdenite have been identified. Gold typically occurs as inclusions in the sulfide 
minerals.
  Copper grades are typical of the range of porphyry-copper grades (0.2% to >1.0% Cu).
The Oyu Tolgoi porphyry-copper deposits display a range of mineralisation styles, alteration 
characteristics, and deposit morphologies that are likely to reflect differences in structural 
controls, host rock lithology, and depth of formation. For the most part, structural influences 
account for the differences in shape and distribution of mineralisation within the deposits. The 
more typical copper–gold porphyry style alteration and mineralisation tend to occur at 
deeper levels, predominantly within basalt and quartz-monzodiorite.
High-sulfidation mineralisation and associated advanced argillic alteration are most common 
within the wall rocks (basaltic tuffs and fragmental rocks) to the quartz-monzodiorite, where it 
intrudes to levels high in the stratigraphic succession and in narrow structurally controlled 
zones. High-sulfidation mineralisation often forms in steam condensate zones and then 
collapses back into the hypogene zone, causing overprinting and textural destruction.
The Hugo Dummett deposits have several features that are unusual when compared with 
typical porphyry-copper systems, including:
  Anomalously high copper and gold grades, particularly in the northern part.
  An unusually weakly altered pre-mineral volcano-sedimentary cover sequence that lies
just above the porphyry system.
  Quartz + sulfide vein contents commonly exceeding 15%, and locally in excess of 90%, in
the high-grade part of the deposit.
  A highly elongate, gently plunging tabular shape to the high-grade stockwork system.
The formation of the known, 800 m extent, high-grade portion of the Hugo Dummett deposits 
as a tabular, intensely veined, sub-vertical body contrasts markedly with most porphyry-
copper deposits, which tend to have steep, roughly cylindrical, or elongate forms. The 
unusual form of the Hugo Dummett deposits could be the result of emplacement within a 
structurally restricted zone. The lack of alteration in the overlying sequence is likely a reflection 
of the chemical inertness of the siltstone sequences.
The Heruga deposit is also slightly unusual in that, unlike the other Oyu Tolgoi deposits, it has 
distinctly higher grades of molybdenum, which form a molybdenum-rich carapace at higher 
elevations overlying gold–copper-rich mineralisation at depth.

The Oyu Tolgoi porphyry deposits are hosted within the Gurvansaikhan Terrane, part of the 
Central Asian Orogenic Belt, rocks of which now comprise the South Gobi region of Mongolia 
(Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4).
Development of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt consisted of Palaeozoic age accretionary 
episodes that assembled a number of island and continental margin magmatic arcs, rifted 
basins, accretionary wedges, and continental margins. Arc development ceased by about 
the Permian. During the Late Jurassic to Cretaceous, north-south extension occurred, 
accompanied by the intrusion of granitoid bodies, unroofing of metamorphic core 
complexes, and formation of extensional and transpressional sedimentary basins. North-east–
south-west shortening is superimposed on the earlier units and is associated with major strike-
slip faulting and folding within the Mesozoic sedimentary basins.
The Gurvansaikhan Terrane is interpreted to be a juvenile island arc assemblage that consists 
of highly deformed accretionary complexes and volcanic arc assemblages dominated by 
imbricate thrust sheets, dismembered blocks, mélanges, and high-strain zones. Lithologies 
identified to date in the Gurvansaikhan Terrane include Silurian to Carboniferous terrigenous 
sediments, volcanic-rich sediments, carbonates, and intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks. 
Sedimentary and volcanic units have been intruded by Devonian granitoids and Permo-
Carboniferous diorite, monzodiorite, granite, granodiorite, and syenite bodies, which can 
range size from dykes to batholiths.
Major structures to the west of the Gurvansaikhan Terrane include the Gobi-Tien Shan sinistral 
strike-slip fault system that splits eastward into a number of splays in the Oyu Tolgoi area, and 
the Gobi Altai Fault system, which forms a complex zone of sedimentary basins over-thrust by 
basement blocks to the north and north-west of Oyu Tolgoi (refer to Figure 7.4). To the east of 
the Gurvansaikhan Terrane, regional structures are dominated by the north-east striking East 
Mongolian Fault Zone, which forms the south-east boundary of the terrane. This regional fault 
may have formed as a major suture during Late Palaeozoic terrane assembly, with Mesozoic 
reactivation leading to the formation of north-east elongate sedimentary basins along the 
fault trace.

The Oyu Tolgoi copper–gold porphyry deposits are situated in a poorly exposed inlier of 
Devonian mafic to intermediate volcanic, volcaniclastic, and sedimentary rocks that have 
been intruded by Devonian to Permian felsic plutons. These rocks are unconformably overlain 
by poorly consolidated Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and younger unconsolidated 
sedimentary deposits. A district-wide stratigraphic column that shows the relative thicknesses 
of the various lithologies is presented in Figure 7.5.
Two major stratigraphic sequences are recognised in the project area:
  Tuffs, basaltic rocks, and sedimentary strata of probable island-arc affinity, assigned to
the Upper Devonian Alagbayan Group.
  An overlying succession containing conglomerates, fossiliferous marine siltstones,
sandstones, water-lain tuffs, and basaltic to andesitic flows and volcaniclastic rocks, 
assigned to the Carboniferous Sainshandhudag Formation. The two sequences are 
separated by a regional unconformity that, in the Oyu Tolgoi area, is associated with a 
time gap of about 10–15 Ma.
The volcanic and sedimentary rocks are cut by several phases of intrusive rocks ranging from 
batholithic intrusions to narrow discontinuous dykes and sills. Compositional and textural 
characteristics vary.
A thin covering of gently dipping to horizontal Cretaceous stratified clay and clay-rich gravel 
overlies the Palaeozoic sequence, infilling paleo-channels and small fault-controlled basins.
The Oyu Tolgoi area is underlain by complex networks of poorly exposed faults, folds, and 
shear zones. These structures influence the distribution of mineralisation by both controlling 
the original position and form of mineralised bodies, and modifying them during post-mineral 
deformation events. The district geology is shown in Figure 7.6.

The Oyu Tolgoi copper–gold deposits currently comprise, from north to south:
  Hugo Dummett (includes the Hugo North Extension zone, which is the extension of the
Hugo North deposit onto the joint venture ground).
  Hugo South.
  SOT (includes the Southwest, South, Wedge, Central, Bridge, Western, and Far South
zones).
  Heruga.
The surface traces and surface projection of the distinct porphyry centres define a north–
north-east trending mineralised corridor underlain by east dipping panels of Upper Devonian 
or older layered sequences intruded by quartz-monzodiorite and granodiorite stocks and 
dykes (refer to Figure 7.5).
Four major lithological divisions are present within the Alagbayan Group, and each of these 
divisions consists of two or more mappable subunits (Table 7.1).
The two lower units are commonly strongly altered and form important mineralisation hosts, 
while the two upper units lack significant alteration and mineralisation. Unit DA4 is separated 
from the underlying Alagbayan Group units by a contact-parallel fault, known as the 
Contact Fault.
The Sainshandhudag Formation is divided into three major units at Oyu Tolgoi: a lowermost 
tuffaceous sequence, an intermediate clastic package, and an uppermost 
volcanic/volcaniclastic sequence (Table 7.2). The unit post-dates porphyry mineralisation and 
is separated from the underlying Devonian rocks by a regional unconformity.
Intrusive rocks are widely distributed through the Oyu Tolgoi area and range from large 
batholithic intrusions to narrow discontinuous dykes and sills. At least seven classes of intrusive 
rocks can be defined on the basis of compositional and textural characteristics (Table 7.3).
Copper–gold porphyry mineralisation is related to the oldest recognised intrusive suite, 
consisting of large Devonian quartz-monzodiorite intrusions that occur in all of the deposit 
areas.

of the early faults during later deformational events. Major fault structural elements are 
summarised in Table 7.4.

Description
West–north-west striking, moderately north 
dipping structure that lies between the Hugo 
South deposit and the Central zone of the SOT 
deposit.
Fault consists of several splays and may have experienced multiple periods of 
displacement. Early fault displacement resulted in north side down apparent 
offset, followed by a later apparent reverse displacement of lesser magnitude. 
Visible as linear magnetic feature cutting the overlying Sainshandhudag 
Formation.
Low-angle thrust fault generally parallel to 
bedding; occurs from Heruga deposit in the 
south to the Hugo Dummett deposits in the 
north.
Places overturned upper Devonian sedimentary and volcanic rocks belonging to 
the DA4 unit over upright Devonian sediments of unit DA3b. Does not truncate 
mineralisation.

Boundary between Hugo North and Hugo South
Hypothetical, based on alignment of the

Dummett deposits, and the elongate form of 
the Hugo Dummett deposit.
Alignments suggest an underlying north–north-east striking fault or fault zone 
controlled emplacement of porphyry intrusions and related hydrothermal 
activity.

Dummett deposit.
East Bounding and West 
Bounding Faults

bounding the Southwest zone.
Control the structural high, which hosts Hugo Dummett. Offsets of post-mineral 
stratigraphic contacts measure at least 1.0 km (east side up) for the West Bat 
Fault, and 200–300 m (west side up) for the East Bat Fault.
Form a primary control on the distribution of copper and gold mineralisation. 
Presence of mineralised clasts within the fault zones implies faults were active 
post-mineralisation.
East bounding fault is a gently listric, steeply west dipping fault zone in the order 
of >50 m wide. The fault has been modelled as a series of segments displaced 
across newly interpreted north-west–south-east trending faults.

Variations in bedding attitude recorded in both oriented drill core and surface outcrops 
define two orientations of folds at Oyu Tolgoi: a dominant set of north-east trending folds, and 
a less-developed set of north-west trending folds. These folds are well defined in bedded 
strata of both the Sainshandhudag Formation and Alagbayan Group. They may be present in 
stratified rocks throughout the property, but outcrop and drillhole data are insufficient to 
define them in many areas. There is no evidence of a penetrative fabric (e.g., cleavage) 
associated with folding.
Together, the two orientations of folds form a dome-and-basin interference pattern, but it is 
not possible to determine their relative ages. Both of the dominant fold orientations occur in 
Lower Carboniferous strata, indicating that both folding events post-date mineralisation.
Sedimentary facing direction indicators, including grading, scour and fill structures, load 
casts, and cross-bedding, are sporadically observed in drill core by Oyu Tolgoi geologists 
along the east flank of the Hugo Dummett deposit. These suggest that parts of the 
Alagbayan Group are overturned. However, no large isoclinal folds have been mapped from 
drill core. These folds are cut by dykes of the 366 Ma biotite-granodiorite suite and therefore 
were formed within the Late Devonian. Such folds and geopetal features are difficult to 
ascribe to regional tectonic events, and may simply be localised features of rapid facies 
changes in a proximal submarine volcanic environment.
When completed, a structural mapping programme currently underway at OT LLC may result 
in the revision of some elements of the interpretations. Preliminary results of this work are 
discussed in Section 9.4.

The deposits that are incorporated in the current mine plan are the SOT and Hugo North 
(Lift 1). The Hugo North (Lift 2), Hugo South, and Heruga deposits are currently outside the 
mine plan but are included in the Life-of-Mine Case outlined in Section 1.
Figure 8.1 is a schematic long section showing the open pit and underground mineralised 
areas. Figure 8.2 shows the locations of the major deposit areas in relation to the Oyu Tolgoi 
and Joint Venture licence boundaries. The figure also indicates the drill collars and clearly 
outlines the major deposit and prospect areas.
The SOT deposit has historically been treated as a number of separate zones; however, for 
mining purposes, the one pit (or potential future underground beneath the pit) will extract all 
SOT mineralisation, and therefore the descriptors in this section have taken the approach that 
the orebody comprises a number of mineralised zones within an overall single deposit 
framework.

The SOT deposit includes the main Southwest, South, Wedge, and Central zones (Figure 8.3) 
and a number of smaller, fault-bounded zones, described in the following subsections. The 
planned open pit will incorporate the majority of these zones.
The zones form contiguous sectors of mineralisation representing multiple mineralising centres, 
each with distinct styles of mineralisation, alteration, and host rock lithology. The boundaries 
between the individual deposits and zones coincide with major faults. Faulting has resulted in 
different erosional histories for the zones, depending on the depth to which a zone has been 
down-faulted or uplifted relative to neighbouring zones. A level plan showing the simplified 
geology of the SOT area is included as Figure 8.4.

The Southwest zone is a gold-rich porphyry system characterised by a south-west plunging, 
pipe-like geometry that has a vertical extent of up to 700 m. The high-grade core of the zone 
is about 250 m diameter; the low-grade shell (0.3% Cu) surrounding the core may extend for 
distances as much as 600 m x 2 km.
Over 80% of the deposit is hosted by massive to fragmental porphyritic augite basalt of the 
Upper Devonian Alagbayan Group, with the remainder hosted by intra-mineral, 
Late- Devonian, quartz-monzodiorite (Qmd) intrusions.
The quartz-monzodiorite intrusions form irregular plugs and dykes related to several distinct 
phases:
  Early, strongly altered quartz-veined dykes mainly limited to the high-grade Central zone
core (informally referred to as OT–Qmd).
  Superimposed younger fragmental dykes entraining early quartz vein clasts but lacking
strong sulfide mineralisation (informally referred to as xQmd).
  Voluminous massive Qmd containing weaker mineralisation, flanking and underlying the
high-grade core.
Several phases of post-mineral dykes cut the Southwest zone. Most of the dykes belong to the 
rhyolite (Rhy), hornblende–biotite andesite (And), or biotite-granodiorite (BiGd) intrusive 
phases. Dykes commonly have steep dips and many are localised along faults. The rhyolite 
dykes tend to strike west to west‒north-west in the deposit core and north-east when 
emplaced along major faults. Hornblende–biotite andesite dykes strike east–north-east 
except where they intrude along the major north-east trending faults.

Most of the Southwest zone, including the entire high-grade, gold-rich core of the zone, lies 
between two north-east striking faults, termed the West Bounding Fault and the East Bounding 
Fault. Both faults are clearly defined on ground-magnetic geophysical images, and their 
positions and orientations are well constrained by numerous drillhole intersections.
The bounding faults consist of foliated cataclasite, gouge/breccia, and mylonitic bands that 
occur in zones ranging from a few metres to a few tens of metres wide. The cataclasite within 
the fault zones contains abundant quartz, quartz sulfide, and sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, 
sphalerite, and galena) clasts in a comminuted matrix that is locally overprinted by fine-
grained pyrite and chalcopyrite. These relationships imply that at least some of the fault 
movement was contemporaneous with mineralisation. Kinematic indicators within the fault 
zones imply dominantly sub-horizontal, sinistral movement on the bounding faults. Both faults 
have local sub-parallel splays. Correlation of drillhole intersections constrains an average fault 
dip of 80° towards 310° for both faults.
The East Bounding Fault juxtaposes younger rocks to the south-east against the Alagbayan 
Group rocks (augite basalt) hosting the deposit, while the West Bounding Fault is mainly intra-
formational within the augite basalt. The West Bounding Fault is commonly intruded by 
hornblende–biotite andesite dykes, whereas rhyolite dykes are more common along the 
East Bounding Fault.
Fault geometry and kinematics, vein orientations, and overall geometry at Southwest support 
a structural model invoking formation of a dilational fault transfer zone. This zone is delineated 
by the West Bounding Fault on the north-west and the East Bounding Fault on the south-east. 
The preferred vein orientation within the core of the zone reflects the local stress geometry 
within this zone of dilation. The Southwest zone probably formed as a sub-vertical cylindrical 
body and attained its present west–south-west plunge during post-mineral regional 
deformation. This post-mineral rotation is consistent with the easterly stratigraphic dips of both 
pre and post-mineral rocks in the area.
Quartz-dominant veins with variable amounts of sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and bornite), 
K-feldspar, chlorite, and carbonate are ubiquitous in the Southwest zone, and there is a 
general correlation between vein density and copper and gold grades. Most veins are 
several millimetres to several centimetres wide, although veins within the core of the zone can 
be up to a metre thick or more. Vein contacts can be either planar or variably deformed, 
and folded and/or faulted veins are common. Veins within the high-grade core display sub-
parallel to sheeted forms with a preferred south-west dipping orientation. These pass into 
more irregularly oriented stockwork veins in peripheral mineralised zones, where sub-vertical 
north to north-west striking orientations are most common.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 96 of 519
Alteration within the basaltic rocks at Southwest zone consists of moderate chlorite, biotite, 
hematite–magnetite, weak sericite, and pink albite fracture and vein selvages. Hematite 
overprints magnetite. Quartz-monzodiorite is typically pervasively altered with quartz, sericite, 
and pyrite, as well as albite within vein selvages, small radiating clusters of tourmaline, and 
fluorite in quartz veins. Advanced argillic alteration, consisting of quartz, sericite, and kaolinite 
with late dickite veins, is associated with the high-sulfidation mineralisation in the quartz-
monzodiorite breccia.
The Far South is considered to be an extension of the Southwest zone, and is separated from it 
by a major north-west–south-east trending fault. The zone is approximately 100 m x 250 m in 
area.
The South zone is developed mainly in basaltic volcanics and related to small, strongly-sericite 
altered quartz-monzodiorite dykes. Zone dimensions are about 400 m x 300 m in area, and 
mineralisation extends to depths of more than 500 m.
The South zone occurs within an east to north-east dipping sequence of Alagbayan Group 
strata (basalt and basaltic tuff units), intruded on the south-west by an irregular quartz-
monzodiorite body. Much of the basalt sequence contains fragmental textures with juvenile 
pyroclasts and is texturally similar to the overlying basalt tuff sequence, which was previously 
interpreted to be dacitic in composition. However, whole-rock geochemistry has shown that 
the basaltic tuff sequence is similar in composition to the underlying basalt and to have been 
affected by advanced argillic alteration to give it the appearance of a dacitic tuff.
To the north-east, the altered and mineralised rocks are overlain by mudstones and 
conglomerates of the upper Alagbayan Group, which pass up-section into the overlying 
basalt and sediment sequence and ultimately into rocks of the Sainshandhudag Formation.
The zone is cut by numerous barren dykes, most of which belong to the post-mineral rhyolite 
and basalt intrusive suites. These dykes are typically only a few metres wide, with the 
exception of a major, east-west rhyolite dyke that cuts through the middle of the South zone 
and attains widths of up to a few tens of metres. This wide dyke commonly balloons into 
larger intrusive masses where it intersects the South and Solongo faults. Although irregular in 
form, the rhyolite dykes have approximate west to west–north-west strikes and steep dips. In 
contrast, the basalt dykes have moderate north-east dips, which are sub-parallel to contacts 
within the stratified host rocks.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 97 of 519
The South zone lies within a faulted block that is bounded on the north-west by the north-east 
striking South Fault and on the south by the east–north-east striking Solongo Fault. The South 
Fault forms a zone with several strands over a width of up to 90 m, which juxtapose 
progressively younger strata on the north-west against older strata to the south-east. Drillhole 
intersections of these faults typically consist of gouge and breccia zones up to several metres 
wide. To the west, the faults strike into a large quartz-monzodiorite intrusion. The faults are 
difficult to trace through the intrusion, and offset of the intrusive contact is minimal, implying 
that most movement pre-dated emplacement of the quartz-monzodiorite.
The Solongo Fault truncates the southern edge of the South zone. It forms a wide, strongly 
tectonised zone. Stratigraphic offset on the Solongo Fault is at least 1,600 m (south block 
down). Consequently, no significant mineralisation has been identified on the south side of 
the fault at shallow (<1,000 m) levels.
Copper mineralisation in the South zone is associated with stockworks of thin (usually <10 cm) 
quartz–sulfide veins. In surface exploration pits and trenches, veins occur as steep, north-west 
striking, strongly sheeted sets. However, veins intersected in drillholes have a stockwork style 
and lack the strong preferred orientation visible in surface exposures.
In the South zone, mineralisation is hosted dominantly in quartz-monzodiorite in the south-
western part of the zone, in basalt throughout the central part, and in a minor zone of 
basaltic tuff and breccia on the northern margin. Contorted quartz veins are present, but 
there is no clearly defined zone of high quartz vein density such as at the Southwest zone. As 
a result, fracture-controlled sulfide veins are minor, and sulfides are present dominantly as 
disseminated chalcopyrite, bornite, and molybdenite. Chalcopyrite is the principal copper 
sulfide, but in higher grade areas bornite locally exceeds chalcopyrite in abundance. 
Magnetite occurs as disseminations and as veins; small zones with elevated gold values are 
found locally.
A small zone of high-sulfidation mineralisation lies within a quartz-monzodiorite breccia in the 
western part of the zone, adjacent to the South Fault. Mineralisation here consists of pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, and primary chalcocite in quartz–sericite–kaolinite alteration, 
with late dickite veins.
An oxide zone approximately 60 m thick overlies the South zone and consists of malachite, 
azurite, cuprite, chrysocolla, neotocite and tenorite, hosted within basalt and quartz-
monzodiorite.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The Wedge zone has an irregular, crescent-like shape. The zone is about 500–600 m at the 
widest point in the north, tapering to a width of about 200 m in the south, and approximately 
1,400 m long. Mineralisation extends to depths of over 500 m.
The Wedge zone occurs within a north-east dipping sequence of Upper Devonian Alagbayan 
Group strata similar to that hosting the adjacent South zone. However, in the Wedge zone the 
basaltic tuff unit is significantly thicker (up to 180 m) than in the South zone and forms the 
dominant host to copper mineralisation. On the north-east, structurally overlying non-
mineralised rocks of the Alagbayan Group (unit DA4) and the lower Sainshandhudag 
Formation (of Carboniferous age) form the immediate hanging wall to mineralisation.
Mineralised rocks in the Wedge zone are cut by abundant barren dykes, including biotite 
granodiorite, hornblende–biotite andesite, and rhyolite compositions. Biotite granodiorite and 
hornblende–biotite andesite are more common along the north-west margin of the zone and 
typically strike north-east, parallel to the East Bounding Fault. These intrusions were interpreted 
as sills, frequently intruding along the stratigraphic contact between the basaltic tuff and the 
overlying sedimentary strata. In 2011, most contacts were re-interpreted as steep-dipping, 
north-east trending features. Rhyolite dykes are common throughout the zone and typically 
have steeply dipping contacts but varied strike orientations.
The Wedge zone is a rectangular fault block bounded on the west by the north-east striking 
East Bounding Fault and on the south by the east–north-east striking South Fault. Within this 
block, stratigraphic contacts are continuous and relatively planar, showing little evidence of 
structural disruption.
Movement on the East Bounding and South faults has juxtaposed younger strata within the 
fault block hosting the Wedge zone against older strata on the adjacent blocks containing 
the Southwest and South zones. Stratigraphic contacts are relatively continuous between the 
Wedge zone and the Central zone, implying that displacement on the East Bounding Fault is 
largely transferred to the Rhyolite Fault (between the Southwest and Central zones), leaving 
the Wedge and Central zones as a structurally intact block that has been displaced 
downward relative to the Southwest and South zones.
Fault disruption is common along the contact between the Alagbayan Group basaltic tuff 
and the overlying sedimentary strata. However, there is no evidence of significant 
stratigraphic omission or repetition associated with this faulting, and the movement may be 
relatively minor.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 99 of 519
The Wedge zone contains a core of high-sulfidation mineralisation hosted principally in 
basaltic tuff and breccia, grading downward and southward into chalcopyrite mineralisation 
in basalt and quartz-monzodiorite host rocks.
High-sulfidation mineralisation consists of pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, enargite, covellite, and 
primary chalcocite in advanced argillic-altered host rocks. Higher grades of copper 
(>0.8% Cu) occur in a shallowly east dipping zone in the upper hundred metres of basaltic 
tuff/breccia unit. Gold is absent except locally in drillholes adjacent to the South Fault. 
Mineralisation is open to the north.
High-sulfidation mineralisation grades downward into chalcopyrite, with lesser bornite within 
massive augite basalt host rocks, and pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralisation in quartz-
monzodiorite.
Basaltic tuff and breccia within the Wedge zone are characterised by advanced argillic 
alteration consisting of kaolinite, zunyite, pyrophyllite, muscovite, illite, topaz, diaspore, 
alunite, montmorillonite, late dickite, and fluorite. A barren, specular, hematite-rich sector 
occurs marginal to the advanced argillic alteration and is progressively overprinted by 
advanced argillic alteration assemblages with increasing copper grades towards the centre 
of the zone. The advanced argillic alteration grades downward into biotite and chlorite 
alteration with hematite overprinting magnetite, mainly within massive augite basalt host 
rocks underlying the basaltic tuff/breccia.
In the southern part of the Wedge zone, sericite and pyrite alteration is present within the 
quartz-monzodiorite
The Central zone is about 2,300 m wide and tapers from about 200 m in length in the east to 
more than 600 m to the west. Mineralisation extends to depths of over 500 m.
The Central zone is hosted within a swarm of feldspar-phyric quartz-monzodiorite intrusions, 
emplaced into porphyritic augite basalt and overlying basaltic tuff of the Alagbayan Group. 
The basaltic tuff is in turn overlain by unmineralised sedimentary and mafic volcanic rocks of 
the Alagbayan Group unit DA4, which dip moderately to the east.
Several phases of intra-mineral and late-mineral quartz-monzodiorite intrusions have been 
distinguished in the Central zone based on textural variations and intensity of mineralisation 
and alteration. Most have dyke forms, emanating from a larger intrusive mass to the north 
and west of the zone. The quartz-monzodiorite dykes terminate within the base of the 
sedimentary units of the upper Alagbayan Group.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 100 of 519
Basalt flows and basaltic tuffs of the Alagbayan Group are preserved as a series of isolated, 
irregular, moderately north to north-east dipping bodies within the quartz-monzodiorite dyke 
swarm. These volcanic windows are up to 200 m thick and extend several hundred metres 
down-dip to the limit of drilling. The contact between the basaltic tuff and the overlying 
sedimentary sequence is commonly faulted and forms the upper limit to mineralisation, as 
elsewhere in the Oyu Tolgoi district.
Post-mineral dykes are common in the Central zone and comprise rhyolite, biotite-
granodiorite, hornblende–biotite andesite, and dacite dykes. The rhyolite dykes are most 
abundant, with most being west and west–north-west striking bodies in the southern half and 
on the periphery of the zone. Biotite-granodiorite dykes along the eastern margin of the zone 
tend to strike north to north–north-east. East–north-east striking hornblende–biotite andesite 
dykes occur mainly along the north-eastern margin of the zone.
The structural setting within the Central zone is still not well understood.
Drillholes show little evidence of significant post-mineral faulting, and the mineralogical 
zoning, grade distribution, and continuity of contacts are consistent with the overall area, 
being contained in a structurally intact block. However, there is also evidence to suggest that 
a series of north-west trending faults both bound and displace some of the host augite basalt 
blocks. Given that the majority of the high-grade mineralisation in the Central zone lies within 
the augite basalt units, some discontinuity of grade match is noted within and between the 
fault-bounded blocks. Additional work is required to better constrain the structural model for 
the Central zone.
Post-mineral faults form minor zones of breccia and cataclasite in some drillholes, but it is not 
possible to correlate these intersections between drillholes to define continuous fault surfaces. 
Pre or syn-mineral faults, if present, are largely obscured by intrusive and hydrothermal 
overprinting.
The Central zone is overlain to the east by non-mineralised conglomerate, mudstone, and 
siltstone of the hanging wall to mineralisation, the Alagbayan Group (DA4). Wide zones of 
breccia and foliated breccia lie along the basal contact of, and within, the lower portion of 
these sedimentary strata. The displacement history of these faults is uncertain, and they may 
be related to minor post-mineralisation movement between the two rheologically contrasting 
rock packages.
Along its southern margin, the Central zone is juxtaposed against the Southwest zone area by 
an east-west striking fault that is now occupied by a rhyolite dyke swarm (the Rhyolite Fault). 
The basaltic tuff and overlying sedimentary units have been uplifted and eroded from the 
block south of this fault.
Mineralised veins within the Central zone show a range in orientations, the most common of 
which have south-west, west, and north-west dipping attitudes. Vein orientations are similar to 
those documented in the Southwest zone, although the degree of preferred orientation in 
the core is weaker in the Central zone by comparison. Similar preferred vein orientations in 
the Central and Southwest zones suggest that these two zones were formed in a similar 
structural regime.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 101 of 519
However, the Central zone lacks the strong bounding fault control that is fundamental to the 
form and geometry of the Southwest zone; this may account for the more irregular form of 
the mineralised body in the Central zone.
Post-mineral tilting of the Central zone is implied by bedding dips in the enclosing and 
overlying stratigraphic sequence. Rotating the structural data for the Central zone sufficiently 
to restore bedding to horizontal indicates a strong preference for sub-vertical veins within the 
zone at the time of formation.
Mineralisation in the Central zone is characterised by an upward-flaring, high-sulfidation zone 
that overprints and overlies porphyry-style chalcopyrite–gold mineralisation. A secondary-
enriched supergene chalcocite blanket tens of metres in thickness overlies the high-
sulfidation covellite–pyrite zone.
Chalcopyrite–gold mineralisation is dominant on the southern and western margins of the 
Central zone within either basalt or quartz‒monzodiorite adjacent to intrusive contacts with 
basalt. Higher grades are associated with zones of intensely contorted quartz stockwork veins, 
where the gold (ppm) to copper (%) ratios reach 2:1. Peripheral, lower grade mineralisation 
has gold to copper ratios of less than 1:1. Hematite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, magnetite, 
and gold are disseminated in the zone and are also found as fracture fillings. Hematite is 
pervasive and overprints magnetite.
The high-sulfidation part of the Central zone lacks significant gold and contains a mineral 
assemblage of pyrite, covellite, chalcocite/digenite, enargite, tennantite, cubanite, 
chalcopyrite, and molybdenite. Dominant host rocks are dacite tuff and quartz-monzodiorite. 
Higher grade mineralisation is associated with disseminated and coarse-grained fracture-
filling sulfides in zones of intense contorted quartz stockwork veins and anastomosing zones of 
hydrothermal breccias. Hydrothermal breccia consists of quartz vein and quartz‒
monzodiorite fragments within an intensely sericitised matrix. The sulfide-filled fractures cut 
both the quartz veins and enclosing wall rock. High-grade mineralisation grades outward to a 
broad, weakly veined, low-grade halo of dominantly disseminated sulfides. Pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, bornite, and enargite occur here as relic grains replaced by chalcocite and 
covellite, and pyrite also hosts small inclusions of covellite. Covellite, chalcocite, and enargite 
occur as intimate intergrowths or as free disseminations. Cubanite and tennantite are 
intergrown with, or replace, enargite, and molybdenite occurs locally with quartz.
A supergene enrichment zone overlies the high-sulfidation assemblage and underlies a 20– 
60 m thick, hematitic limonite, goethite-rich leached cap. The supergene zone consists of 
pyrite, hematite, and chalcocite/digenite, with lesser amounts of colusite, enargite, tenorite, 
covellite, bornite, chalcopyrite, cuprite, and molybdenite. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide and is 
present as disseminated crystals. Sooty chalcocite occurs as rims or microveinlets in pyrite 
and covellite, and as independent disseminations. Colusite occurs as single grains or 
intergrown with chalcocite/digenite and/or pyrite. Tenorite occurs interstitial to silicate-iron 
oxide grain boundaries. Micrograins of chalcopyrite replaced by bornite and covellite occur 
as small inclusions within pyrite.
Minor exotic copper oxide mineralisation occupies a bedrock depression on the north-
eastern flank of the Central zone. Chrysocolla, malachite, and neotocite mineralisation is
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 102 of 519
found over a 400 m x 300 m area as a thin, two to four metre thick layer at the base of the 
gravels. The leached cap is generally devoid of mineralisation except on the edges of the 
eastern and southern flanks of the zone, where patchy malachite and neotocite occur.
Alteration in the Central zone shows a close spatial relationship to mineralisation and original 
host lithology. Biotite–chlorite and intermediate argillic alteration coincide with chalcopyrite–
gold mineralisation within basalt. Advanced argillic and sericite alteration coincides with the 
high-sulfidation mineralisation within quartz-monzodiorite and basaltic tuff/breccia.
The biotite–chlorite zone consists of an assemblage of biotite, chlorite, epidote, sericite, albite, 
carbonate, and anhydrite. Hematite and minor magnetite are present in veins and as 
disseminations. Biotite has been overprinted by chlorite and sericite, and magnetite has been 
altered to hematite. Anhydrite and carbonates occur as late veins. K-feldspar alteration 
increases at depth beneath the Central zone, occurring as vein selvages within biotite-
altered basalt.
Intermediate argillic alteration forms a narrow zone separating the advanced argillic and 
sericite alteration from the biotite chlorite alteration. Intermediate argillic alteration is 
characterised by a creamy yellow to pale green coloured assemblage of kaolinite, chlorite, 
pyrophyllite, and illite.
Advanced argillic and sericite alteration are associated with high-sulfidation mineralisation, 
hosted primarily within dacite and quartz‒monzodiorite. The advanced argillic assemblage 
consists of topaz, quartz, zunyite, diaspore, alunite, illite, andalusite, late kaolinite, and dickite. 
There is a zonation from an advanced argillic assemblage of zunyite, andalusite, and alunite, 
associated with higher grade hydrothermal breccia-hosted mineralisation, to a muscovite, 
sericite-dominant peripheral zone, associated with lower grade disseminated mineralisation.
Alteration within the supergene zone is characterised by illite, muscovite, kaolinite, alunite, 
and pyrophyllite. Montmorillonite, smectite, kaosmectite, illite, and kaolinite are the dominant 
clay minerals in the leached cap.
The Bridge zone has a triangular shape, tapering from about 500 m wide in the north to about 
30 m wide in the south, and is approximately 250 m in length. Mineralisation extends to depths 
of over 500 m.
The Bridge zone consists of copper-mineralised basalt and quartz-monzodiorite between the 
Southwest and Central zones.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 103 of 519
Low-grade copper mineralisation is characterised by lower vein densities than in surrounding 
zones and is hosted in chlorite and epidote-altered basalt and lesser sericite- and albite-
altered quartz-monzodiorite. Magnetite veinlets post-date the quartz veins but predate the 
main sulfide event.
Chalcopyrite, bornite, and pyrite are mainly disseminated, with fracture- or vein-controlled 
sulfides being less prominent. There is no clear geological boundary distinguishing the 
disseminated mineralisation from the adjacent peripheral zone mineralisation.
The definition of the West structural zone is based on a soil anomaly and fault interpretations. 
Drillholes testing the Southwest zone and Far South zone mineralisation were collared in the 
West zone and drilled to the south-east to intercept the mineralisation in these zones. To date, 
results have not been not encouraging.
The Hugo Dummett deposits, Hugo North and Hugo South, contain porphyry-style 
mineralisation associated with quartz-monzodiorite intrusions, concealed beneath a 
sequence of Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The 
deposits are highly elongated to the north–north-east and extend over 3 km. The dividing line 
between the two deposits is 4,766,300 mN, a location marked by the thinning and locally 
discontinuous nature of the high-grade copper mineralisation (defined by greater than 2.0% 
copper). The line, which is broadly coincident with the east striking 110° Fault (refer to 
Figure 7.6 for the projections of the major faults in the area of the Hugo Dummett deposits), 
separates the gold- and copper-rich zone hosted in augite basalt and quartz-monzodiorite of 
the Hugo North deposit from the more southerly, gold-poor, ignimbrite- and augite basalt-
hosted mineralisation at Hugo South.
Early technical reports filed by Ivanhoe Mines on the project refer to the Far North zone; this 
was the initial name for the Hugo Dummett area, and its use has been discontinued. Part of 
the Hugo North deposit extends onto the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence. This area is known as 
the Hugo North Extension and is referred to as the Copper Flats deposit in technical reports 
filed by Entrée Gold.
The Hugo South deposit is separated from the SOT deposit group by the Central Fault and 
from the Hugo North deposit by the 110° fault. The deposit is tapered, being approximately 
650 m wide and about 850–1,300 m long.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 104 of 519
The Hugo South deposit is hosted by an easterly dipping sequence of volcanic strata 
correlated with the lower part of the Devonian Alagbayan Group and by quartz-
monzodiorite intrusive rocks. The stratigraphically lowest rocks in the sequence consist of 
porphyritic (augite) basalt flows and minor volcaniclastic strata. These are overlain by basaltic 
tuffs and breccias forming a sequence varying from 100–200 m thick. The basaltic fragmental 
sequence was previously thought to be dacitic in composition. Whole-rock geochemistry has 
shown it to be similar in composition to the underlying basalt, and it has been affected by 
advanced argillic alteration to give it the appearance of a dacitic tuff. As such, the true 
boundary between the augite basalt and the fragmental rocks is difficult to determine, being 
texturally destroyed and diffuse in character.
Weakly altered to unaltered sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the upper Alagbayan Group 
and Sainshandhudag Formation structurally overlie the mineralised sequence along the 
eastern flank of the Hugo South deposit. The thickness of the non-mineralised Alagbayan 
Group sequence commonly exceeds 600 m, although structural thickening within the 
sequence may be possible. The Sainshandhudag Formation strata unconformably overlie, 
and are locally faulted against, the Alagbayan Group.
There are several phases of intrusive rocks in the Hugo South deposit. The oldest recognised 
intrusions are quartz-monzodiorite bodies, which underlie the entire deposit area and contain 
low copper grades. Quartz-monzodiorite contacts are irregular but overall show a preferred 
easterly dip, sub-parallel to contacts in the enclosing stratified rocks. The quartz-monzodiorite 
is broadly contemporaneous with alteration and mineralisation; two varieties are 
distinguished on the basis of alteration characteristics and position within the deposit:
  An intensely quartz-veined phase that occurs along the upper margin of the main
intrusive body or as a separate east dipping tabular body in the overlying strata.
  A lower grade, more weakly veined variety, which makes up the large intrusive body
forming the lower part of, and underlying, the entire deposit.
Late to post-mineral biotite-granodiorite intrusions form a north–north-east striking dyke 
complex cutting across the western edge of the deposit. Correlations between drillhole 
intersections and measurements of individual contacts indicate that dyke contacts have a 
moderate to steeply west dipping preferred orientation.
Younger intrusions include rhyolite, hornblende–biotite andesite, dacite, and basalt–dolerite 
compositional varieties. These intrusions usually occur as dykes with sub-vertical orientations, 
or less commonly as easterly dipping sills emplaced along stratigraphic contacts. They are 
non-mineralised and appear to be volumetrically insignificant except locally in the deposit.
The Hugo South deposit lies within a north–north-easterly elongate block bounded on the 
north and south by moderately north dipping faults and on the east and west by steep, 
north–north-east striking faults. Strata within the block form a homoclinal sequence dipping 
moderately to the east–south-east.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 105 of 519
Deformation of the Hugo South deposit is dominated by brittle faulting. Major faults cutting 
the deposit can be grouped on the basis of orientation into four sets:
  East–west striking, moderately north dipping faults (e.g., 110 Fault and Central Fault). The
110 Fault defines the division between the Hugo North and Hugo South deposits, 
although mineralisation is continuous across the fault. The Central Fault is a shallowly to 
moderately north dipping structure that lies beneath the southern part of the Hugo 
Dummett deposit.
  Steep north–north-east-striking faults (e.g., East Fault, West Bat Fault, East Hugo Fault, and
Axial Fault). The linear mineralised trend defined by the Central and Southwest zones of 
the Southern Oyu Tolgoi (SOT) deposit and the Hugo Dummett deposit likely reflects the 
presence of a deep, north–north-east striking crustal fault or fault zone controlling 
magma emplacement and mineralisation, termed the Axial Fault. The West Bat Fault is a 
north–north-east striking, sub-vertical structure that extends along the west side of the 
Hugo Dummett deposit. It cuts the north-western edge of the Hugo North deposit but is 
well to the west of the main part of the Hugo South deposit. The East Bat Fault is a north–
north-east striking, sub-vertical structure along the east side of the Hugo Dummett 
deposit. The East Hugo Fault is a north to north–north-west striking, steeply east dipping 
zone of strong to intense brecciation and clay gouge along the east limb of the Hugo 
South and Hugo North deposits.
  North–north-east striking faults that dip moderately east, sub-parallel to lithological 
contacts (e.g., Contact and Lower). The Contact Fault has been interpreted as a 
bedding-parallel detachment zone that normally occurs at the contact between 
tectonised mudstones stratigraphically overlying the deposit (unit DA3) and overlying 
basalt flows and volcaniclastic rocks (unit DA4). This interpretation remains to be 
confirmed. The Lower Fault is as an intensely brecciated, clay gouge-rich zone within the 
middle or lower part of the mineralised body, typically 200–400 m below the Contact 
Fault.
  East-west striking, sub-vertical faults (e.g., East-West). The East-West Fault cuts across and
displaces the northern end of the Hugo South deposit.
Two orientations of folds were identified in the Hugo South deposit area: a dominant set of 
north–north-east trending folds, and a subordinate set of north-west trending folds. Both of the 
dominant fold orientations are also found in Carboniferous post-mineral strata, indicating that 
both events post-date mineralisation and may have modified the form of the deposit.
Copper mineralisation at the Hugo South deposit is centred on a high-grade (typically 
>2.0% Cu) zone of intense quartz stockwork veining, which in much of the deposit is localised 
within narrow quartz-monzodiorite intrusions and extends into the enclosing basalt and 
basaltic fragmental units. The intense stockwork zone has an elongate tabular form, with a 
long axis plunging gently to the north–north-west and an intermediate axis plunging 
moderately to the east. Copper grades gradually decrease upwards from the stockwork 
zone through the upper part of the massive augite basalt and the basaltic tuff, and a 
broader zone of lower grades lies below and to the west in basalt and quartz-monzodiorite.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 106 of 519
Dominant sulfide minerals at Hugo South are chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, and pyrite, 
with minor molybdenite, enargite, tennantite, and covellite. Sphalerite and galena are less 
common. Sulfides are zoned, with bornite ± chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and tennantite 
comprising the highest grades (>2.5% Cu), grading outward to chalcopyrite (1.0%–2.0% Cu). 
Pyrite–chalcopyrite ± enargite, tennantite, bornite, chalcocite, and (rarely) covellite occur in 
a lower grade zone (<1.0% Cu), mainly in advanced argillic-altered basaltic tuff.
Alteration in the Hugo South deposit is typical of copper porphyry systems, including K-silicate 
(minor), advanced argillic, muscovite/sericite, and intermediate argillic styles. The mineral 
groupings used to define individual zones are not necessarily true assemblages that formed 
contemporaneously, but are associations that may represent several paragenetic stages. The 
distribution of the alteration is strongly lithologically controlled: basaltic tuff typically shows 
strong advanced argillic alteration, whereas basalt tends to be chlorite–muscovite–hematite-
altered with pyrophyllitic advanced argillic alteration in its uppermost parts. Pockets of 
advanced argillic alteration are present locally in the high-grade zone in the quartz-
monzodiorites.
The Hugo North deposit is virtually contiguous with the Hugo South deposit and lies within a 
similar geological setting. The two deposits are separated by a 110°-striking, 45°–55° north 
dipping fault that displaces Hugo North vertically down a modest distance from Hugo South. 
Hugo North extends from +500 masl to depths well below 400 masl, has a strike length in 
excess of 1,800 m, and is 500 m wide.
Host rocks at Hugo North are an easterly dipping sequence of volcanic and volcaniclastic 
strata correlated with the lower part of the Devonian Alagbayan Group and with quartz-
monzodiorite intrusive rocks that intrude the volcanic sequence.
The stratigraphically lowest rocks in the host sequence are basalt flows and minor 
volcaniclastic strata, overlain by a basaltic tuff and breccia sequence. The basaltic tuff 
sequence has been affected by advanced argillic alteration to give it the appearance of a 
dacitic tuff. The host sequence basaltic volcanics are overlain by dacitic block and ash tuff 
and dacitic ash flow tuff. Weakly altered to unaltered sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the 
upper Alagbayan Group and Sainshandhudag Formation structurally overlie the mineralised 
sequence along the eastern flank of the deposit.
Intrusive rocks at Hugo North are dominated by quartz-monzodiorite bodies that underlie the 
entire deposit area and host a significant portion of the copper and gold mineralisation. 
Intrusive contacts are typically irregular but overall show a preferred easterly dip, sub-parallel 
to stratification in the overlying rocks. The sub-parallel position of the quartz-monzodiorite to 
the overlying strata may suggest that the intrusion was more of a sill emplacement that 
became tilted to the east, possibly due to the many intrusive events in the Carboniferous. 
More work is required to confirm this theory.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 107 of 519
The quartz-monzodiorites are contemporaneous with alteration and mineralisation. The 
quartz-monzodiorite is considered to be the progenitor porphyry, and two zones are 
distinguished on the basis of alteration characteristics and position within the deposit.
A late to post-mineralisation biotite-granodiorite intrusion forms a northerly striking dyke 
complex cutting across the western edge and deeper levels of the deposit. At higher levels, 
the biotite-granodiorite flares out considerably to form a voluminous body. Although this 
intrusion locally contains elevated copper grades adjacent to intrusive contacts or within 
xenolith-rich zones, it is essentially barren.
Based on correlations between drillhole intersections and measurements of individual 
contacts using oriented drill core, the positions and orientations of dyke contacts are 
reasonably well established in the Hugo North deposit area. Dominant dyke orientation varies 
with depth. At levels above approximately 250 m RL, where the biotite-granodiorite cuts 
through the non-mineralised hanging wall strata, it is present as a single intrusive mass with 
contacts dipping moderately to steeply to the west. The hanging wall sequence model to be 
completed in 2014 should identify the nature of the contact between the hanging wall strata 
and the biotite-granodiorite and assist in modelling the subsidence zone. Below this level, the 
biotite-granodiorite is more complex, found as multiple and sub-parallel to anastomosing 
dykes that cut through the quartz-monzodiorite intrusion and mineralised Alagbayan Group 
strata.
The Hugo North deposit lies within easterly dipping homoclinal strata contained in a north–
north-easterly elongate fault-bounded block. The northern end of this block is cut by several 
east-west and north-east striking faults near the northern boundary of Oyu Tolgoi. The 
structural geometry and deformation history of the Hugo North deposit generally similar to 
those of the Hugo South deposit.
Several iterations of the structural framework have been modelled between 2007 and 2014. 
The following paragraphs describe the structural setting of the Hugo North deposit as 
understood from the 2014 modelling. The structural interpretation was updated in 2014.
Deformation of the Hugo North deposit is dominated by brittle faulting. Major faults cutting 
the deposit can be grouped on the basis of orientation into the following sets:
  East-west striking, moderately north dipping faults (e.g., 110). The 110 Fault defines the
division between the Hugo North and Hugo South deposits.
  East-west striking, steeply dipping faults with locally varying dips between north and south 
(Bogd, Bumbat, Dugant, and Blacktail). These faults offset the lithology and mineralisation 
in oblique slip fashion (dextral displacement).
  Steep, north–north-east-striking faults (e.g., East and West Bat, 160, and Axial). The linear
mineralised trend defined by the Central and Southwest zones of the SOT deposit and 
the Hugo Dummett deposit likely reflects the presence of a deep, north–north-east 
striking crustal fault or fault zone controlling magma emplacement and mineralisation, 
termed the Axial Fault. The sub-vertical, north–north-east striking West Bat Fault runs along 
the west side of the Hugo North deposit and cuts the western edge of the northern part 
of the deposit.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 108 of 519
The north–north-east striking East Bat Fault follows the east flank of the Hugo Dummett 
deposit, well east of the known deposit extents. The 160 Fault can be traced through the 
southern part of the Hugo North deposit, where it cuts across stratigraphic contacts at 
moderate angles and forms a sharp break in alteration intensity and copper grade.
  North–north-east striking, moderately east dipping faults sub-parallel to lithological 
contacts (e.g., Contact, Lower, and Intermediate). The Contact Fault is a bedding-
parallel detachment zone that normally lies at the contact between tectonised 
mudstones that stratigraphically overlie the deposit (unit DA3) and overlying basalt flows 
and volcaniclastic rocks (unit DA4). The Lower Fault at Hugo North is an intensely 
brecciated, locally foliated, clay-rich gouge zone within the middle or lower part of the 
high-grade mineralised body, typically at a level 200–400 m below the Contact Fault. The 
Intermediate Fault is sub-parallel to the augite basalt (Va) and ignimbrite (Ign) contact.
  East–north-east striking faults (e.g., Boundary Fault System, Kharaa, Eroo, and Rhyolite).
The Boundary Fault follows the intrusive contact of the granitic complex in the north-west 
part of the Oyu Tolgoi area and juxtaposes strongly mineralised rocks against post-
mineral Carboniferous strata near the northern property boundary. The North Boundary 
Fault juxtaposes Carboniferous granitic rocks against Carboniferous strata to the south. 
The sub-vertical, east–north-east striking Rhyolite Fault cuts across the southern part of the 
Hugo North deposit and coincides with a wide zone of rhyolite dykes. The Kharaa and 
the Eroo may be reactivated faults associated with the North Boundary Fault System.
  North-west striking faults that offset (oblique slip) lithologies and in some case
mineralisation (7100, Noyon, Gobi, Burged, Javkhlant). These faults may have an oblique 
slip component.
Fold styles and orientations in the Hugo North deposit are similar to those at Hugo South, with 
most folding restricted to the upper part of the Alagbayan Group and overlying 
Sainshandhudag Formation.
The highest-grade copper mineralisation in the Hugo North deposit is related to a zone of 
intensely stockworked to sheeted quartz veins known as the QV90 zone, so named because 
>90% of the rock has >15% quartz veining. The high-grade zone is centred on thin, east 
dipping quartz-monzodiorite intrusions or within the apex of the large quartz-monzodiorite 
body, and extends into the adjacent basalt. In addition, moderate-to-high-grade copper 
and gold values occur within quartz-monzodiorite below and to the west of the intense vein 
zone, in the Hugo North gold zone. This zone is distinct and has a high Au (ppm) to Cu (%) 
ratio of 0.5:1.
Bornite is dominant in the highest-grade parts of the deposit (3.0%–5.0% Cu) and is zoned 
outward to chalcopyrite (2.0% Cu). At grades of <1.0% Cu, pyrite–chalcopyrite dominates. 
Within the upper levels where advanced argillically altered basaltic tuff is reported, the 
assemblage comprises pyrite–chalcopyrite ± enargite, tennantite, bornite, chalcocite, and 
more rarely covellite.
The high-grade bornite zone consists of relatively coarse bornite permeating quartz and 
disseminations in wall rocks, usually intergrown with subordinate chalcopyrite. Pyrite is rare to 
absent except locally where the host rocks are advanced argillically altered. Although
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 109 of 519
chalcocite is commonly found with bornite at Hugo South, it is less common at Hugo North. 
High-grade bornite is associated with minor amounts of tennantite, sphalerite, hessite, 
clausthalite, and gold that occur as inclusions or at grain boundaries.
Elevated gold grades in the Hugo North deposit occur within the up-dip (western) portion of 
the intensely veined, high-grade core and within a steeply dipping lower zone cutting 
through the western part of the quartz-monzodiorite. Quartz-monzodiorite in the lower zone 
exhibits a characteristic pink to buff colour, with a moderate intensity of quartz veining (5.0%–
25% by volume), and is characterised by finely disseminated bornite and chalcopyrite. 
Sulfides are disseminated throughout the rock in the matrix as well as in quartz veins. The fine-
grained bornite has a black sooty appearance. Red colouration of the rock type is attributed 
to fine hematite dusting, primarily associated with albite.
The Hugo North deposit is characterised by copper–gold porphyry and related styles of 
alteration similar to those at Hugo South. These include biotite–K-feldspar (K-silicate), 
magnetite, chlorite–muscovite–illite, albite, chlorite–illite–hematite–kaolinite (intermediate 
argillic), quartz–alunite–pyrophyllite–kaolinite–diaspore–zunyite–topaz–dickite (advanced 
argillic), and sericite–muscovite zones. The distribution of alteration zones is similar to that in 
the Hugo South deposit except that the advanced and intermediate argillic zones are more 
restricted and lie mainly along the outer and upper margins of the intrusive system.
Chlorite–illite marks the outer boundary of the advanced argillic zone, mainly in the coarse, 
upper part of the basaltic tuff/breccia.
Quartz–pyrophyllite–kaolinite–dickite (advanced argillic) is hosted mainly in the lower part of 
the basaltic tuff, although on some sections at Hugo North it extends into strongly veined 
quartz-monzodiorite. The advanced argillic zone is typically buff or grey, and late dickite on 
fractures is ubiquitous. Within the advanced argillic zone, a massive quartz-alunite zone forms 
a pink–brown bedding-parallel lens. As with elsewhere within the property, the advanced 
argillic alteration is texturally destructive and often obliterates the contact between the 
augite basalt and overlying basaltic tuff. As a result, a diffuse lithological and mineralisation 
contact typically characterises this zone.
Topaz is widespread as late alteration controlled by structures cutting both the advanced 
and intermediate argillic zone. In certain areas topaz appears to replace parts of the quartz-
alunite zone. In addition, topaz may also occur disseminated with quartz–pyrophyllite–
kaolinite.
Hematite–siderite–illite–pyrophyllite–kaolinite–dickite (intermediate argillic) is an inward 
zonation from the advanced argillic zone. It is commonly hosted by augite basalt but may 
also occur in basaltic ash-flow tuff. Hematite usually comprises fine specularite and may be 
derived from early magnetite or Fe rich minerals such as biotite or chlorite.
Hematite–chlorite–illite–(biotite–magnetite)–(chlorite) is transitional to the intermediate argillic 
zone and is commonly hosted by augite basalt. It is characterised by a green colour and 
relict hydrothermal magnetite, either disseminated or in veins.
Muscovite–illite (sericite) generally occurs in the quartz-monzodiorite intrusions and is a feature
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 110 of 519
of the strongly mineralised zone. Alteration decreases with depth in the quartz-monzodiorite.
The Hugo North Extension is a term used to delimit that part of the Hugo North deposit that 
extends into the Joint Venture ground. The zone extends from the licence boundary north for 
approximately 700 m and appears to be closed off to the north; drilling on a section 
approximately 150 m north of the northernmost extent of the Hugo North Extension grade 
shell has indicated that mineralisation is truncated by an east-west trending fault. North of the 
fault, the prospective stratigraphy has been down-dropped to depths greater than 2,000 m 
below the surface.
The Heruga deposit is the most southerly of the currently known deposits at Oyu Tolgoi. The 
deposit is a copper–gold–molybdenum porphyry deposit and is zoned with a molybdenum-
rich carapace at higher elevations overlying gold-rich mineralisation at depth. The top of the 
mineralisation starts 500–600 m below the present ground surface.
The deposit has been drilled over a 2.3 km length, is elongated in a north–north-east 
direction, and plunges to the north. Exploration of the down-plunge extension was active as 
at 31 March 2012. The northern boundary of the mineralisation is assumed to be the Solongo 
Fault, which marks the southern boundary of the planned SOT open pit.
Quartz-monzodiorite intrusions intrude the Devonian augite basalts as elsewhere in the district, 
and again are considered to be the progenitors of mineralisation and alteration. Within 
Heruga itself, quartz-monzodiorite intrusions are small compared to the stocks present in the 
Hugo Dummett and SOT areas, perhaps explaining the lower grade of the Heruga deposit. 
Non-mineralised dykes, which make up about 15% of the volume of the deposit, cut all other 
rock types. However, the quartz-monzonite body appears to flare to the east and forms a 
large stock within the Heruga North area of interest.
The deposit is transected by a series of north–north-east trending vertical fault structures that 
step down 200–300 m at a time to the west and have divided the deposit into at least two 
structural blocks.
Mineralised veins have a much lower density at Heruga than in the more northerly SOT and 
Hugo Dummett deposits. High-grade copper and gold intersections show a strong spatial 
association with contacts of the mineralised quartz-monzodiorite porphyry intrusion in the 
southern part of the deposit, occurring both within the outer portion of the intrusion and in 
adjacent enclosing basaltic country rock.
At deeper levels, mineralisation consists of chalcopyrite and pyrite in veins and disseminated 
within biotite–chlorite–albite–actinolite-altered basalt or sericite–albite-altered quartz‒
monzodiorite. The higher levels of the orebody are overprinted by strong quartz–sericite–
tourmaline–pyrite alteration where mineralisation consists of disseminated and vein-controlled 
pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite.
There is no oxide zone at Heruga. No high-sulfidation style mineralisation has been identified 
to date.

The project has significant exploration prospectivity, and exploration activities are ongoing. 
Over the course of 2013, emphasis shifted from drilling to data acquisition, compilation, and 
interrogation to identify and prioritise a pipeline of exploration targets on the mine licences.
The objective is to develop low-cost options with the potential to directly improve the value 
of the operations and to focus on deposits that could represent enhanced opportunities in 
line with the current development of the Oyu Tolgoi orebodies.
The Exploration Team is also continuing to build legacy datasets in 2014 with a focus on 
ground magnetics, geophysical modelling, geochronological studies, core re-logging, and 
surface geological mapping programmes.
The Heruga North zone, which in earlier reports was referred to as the New Discovery zone, is 
the down-plunge extension of the Heruga mineralisation. The top of Heruga North is 
approximately 1,100 m below surface and plunges gradually downward as it extends to the 
north. The Solongo Fault forms the projected northern limit of mineralisation associated with 
Heruga.
An exploration drilling programme was completed at Heruga North in late 2012. Since that 
time the fundamental data have been validated and a preliminary structural and geological 
model has been created. The next step is to estimate the resources of the entire Heruga and 
Heruga North system; this work will be undertaken in late 2014.
The Javkhlant target area is an area of interest within the current exploration work 
programme. The Javkhlant target was originally identified from regional IP surveying in 2005. 
EJD0035A, drilled in 2010, encountered an intercept of 30 m at 0.92% Cu from a depth of 
1,422 m.
The Javkhlant target is currently being advanced through geophysical and geochemical 
analysis to determine prospectivity and identify potential drilling targets.
At present, this is the southernmost known mineralisation on the Oyu Tolgoi trend.
Hugo West Shallow was identified in 2013 following a review of the current drilling data, 
mapping, and geophysics. It is located in the north part of the SOT block that hosts the 
current open pit resources. The deposit is a small porphyritic intrusion on the footwall of the 
Central Fault. Drilling completed on this deposit in Q4’13 and Q1’14 identified low-grade 
mineralisation that is currently being advanced to modelling. The mineralisation is hosted in 
the Devonian host sequence and Qmd intrusives and is characteristic of the SOT zones.
Other potential analogous shallow targets have been identified within the SOT deposit and
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 112 of 519
are currently being studied. These potential targets will be prioritised by business needs, drill 
testing will be identified and planned as part of the current work programme.
The Hugo West Deep target was identified in 2012 by a magnetotellurics (MagTell) survey and 
geological review. The area was drill tested in 2013. The first drillhole returned 502 m at 
0.54% Cu and 0.32 g/t Au. The mineralisation associated with the Hugo West Deep target is 
hosted entirely within the Qmd intrusives. The mineralisation is currently thought to represent 
an extension of the grade shells associated with Hugo North and Hugo South. The current 
drilling has identified a large, low-grade target that will require future work to identify 
potential resources. The target area is currently being studied to identify future drill testing 
requirements based on business needs.
Three deep, high-grade targets have been identified by the current exploration reviews: West 
of West Bat Fault, North of West Bat Fault, and Heruga North Bornite. These three targets are 
currently being studied via various geological, geophysical, and geochemical methods. The 
current exploration review will aim to identify future potential drilling requirements, if any.
Exploration will continue on the Oyu Tolgoi Mining Licences scaled to meet the business 
strategy and in line with annual budgets. The focus will be on resources that could change 
the life-of-mine schedule and defer development of deeper and lower grade resources. The 
work aims to identify smaller, incremental additions to the resource base, increase knowledge 
of the orebodies at the known deposits, and plan infill drilling as part of a longer term goal to 
convert resources into reserves.

Coordinates used by Ivanhoe Mines, and subsequently by OT LLC, for exploration on the 
project are mostly UTM coordinates with the datum set to WGS-84, Zone 48N. The boundary 
coordinates of the mining and exploration licences are defined by latitude and longitude 
coordinates. The official Mongolian survey datum is MSK42 using the Baltic mean sea level as 
the elevation datum. Ivanhoe Mines noted the coordinates obtained using the MSK42 data 
were almost identical to those using WGS-84, Zone 48N.
Various topographic surveys have been completed on the project area, the most recent of 
which was in 2010 by Geomaster, covering a 10 km x 10 km area using an electronic total 
station instrument with an accuracy of 5.0 cm. The survey had a contour interval of 1.0 m.
In 2011, the governing authority in Mongolia changed the official survey datum to WGS84, 
Zone 48N. As a consequence, there has been a small shift in the bounding coordinates of the 
licences. Geomaster is completing a new survey of the boundaries using the total station 
instrument on behalf of OT LLC.
OT LLC acquired a GeoEye satellite image in 2012 and used it to derive a new topographic 
map.
In 2001, Ivanhoe commissioned Pacific Geomatics from Vancouver to produce 1:100,000 
scale LandSat satellite images and a structural and alteration interpretation over a 1,500 km2 
area centred on the project. These data are integrated into a GIS database and have been 
used to aid in the structural interpretation of the project and for alteration mapping.
In 2003, Ivanhoe requested that Pacific Geomatics provide Quickbird imaging over the entire 
Oyu Tolgoi Mining Licence.
In 2012, OT LLC engaged Fugro Spatial to acquire GeoEye imagery over the entire area of 
the mining licences and to extend this coverage along key infrastructure corridors such as the 
Gunii Hooloi water borefield and the road to the China/Mongolia border. Resolution is 
approximately 0.5 m in the vertical and horizontal components.

Geological mapping programmes have been restricted by the paucity of outcrop in the 
project area.
Outcropping mineralised zones (Southwest, South, and Central) were mapped at 1:1,000 
scale and the central part of the Oyu Tolgoi Licence area at 1:5,000 scale in 2001. The entire 
Oyu Tolgoi Licence area was mapped at 1:10,000 scale in 2002.
Additional geological and structural mapping was completed by Alan Wainwright during 
2005–2008 as part of his PhD thesis research.
Mapping on the Shivee Tolgoi Licence consists of 1:20,000 and 1:10,000 scale regional 
mapping, with detailed prospect-scale mapping at 1:2,000 scale, undertaken between 2004 
and 2008.
In 2011, David Crane initiated a detailed 1:2,500 surface geological mapping programme 
across part of the Javkhlant area west and south-west of Heruga. This programme focused on 
determining stratigraphic relations that may indicate vectors to prospective stratigraphy.
The long-term aim is to complete a detailed geological map of the entire mine licence area 
at a scale of 1:5000.
Detailed geological mapping has been undertaken on exposed development faces on the 
1300 Level in the Hugo North underground workings. The mapping was done initially on paper 
sheets, which were scanned, imported to Vulcan software, geo-referenced, and converted 
to lithological and structural strings for interpretation.
The mapping was used to help predict ground conditions in front of planned development 
and to validate the geology model interpreted from drillholes. The 2014 geology model 
update incorporates useful information from the underground mapping, such as the location 
and nature of contacts between the BiGd and Qmd units in areas of sparse drilling coverage.
Underground mapping will recommence when the underground development restarts.
The following programmes will help define the relationships of the fault structures:

In addition to the underground mapping data used in the updated 2014 Hugo North 
geology model, efforts to improve the understanding of the faults on the 1300 Level 
include re-logging the underground core. Core photos were re-examined to look for fault 
zones that had not previously been recognised by the core loggers. In an ongoing 2014 
programme, the underground geology mapping will be integrated with the Adamtech 
photos, geotechnical mapping data, and the previous underground mapping by 
Ivanhoe to create a detailed map of the 1300 Level underground.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 115 of 519
  The hanging wall sequence east of the Hugo North deposit (Carboniferous units
adjacent to the BiGd) and west of the West Bat Fault is being modelled as part of a 2014 
programme. This was not done in the past because modelling focused on the orebody. 
This work will lead to a better understanding of the continuity of structures across the 
West Bat Fault and the relationship with the overlying Carboniferous sediments.
During 2010–2011, the structural and geological model for SOT was updated with all currently 
available information and based on level plan interpretations. Major faults identified from this 
programme are incorporated in the updated 2011 SOT resource block model.
A provisional fault hierarchy for the area was established:
  Early stage: north–north-east trending faults (East Boundary, West Boundary, and
Andesite).
  Middle stage: north–north-west trending faults (AP01, AP02, AP03, AP04, AP05, AP06,
AP011, and Rhyolite).
  Late stage: east–north-east trending faults (Solongo Fault system and associated splays).
Figure 9.1 shows the current fault interpretation for SOT.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 116 of 519
Key elements from the work completed to date are as follows:
  11 new faults were modelled from level plan interpretations.
  Faults in the southern part of the Hugo fault model were extruded to the margins of the
model for convenience. The result is that the northern part of the SOT open pit and Hugo 
South fault models overlap, but do not actually link together structurally or geologically. 
Rectification of this issue is planned and is critical to obtaining a district-wide coherent 
structural architecture.
  The East Boundary Fault was extended to the north, re-modelled as a steeply west
dipping, gently listric fault, and interpreted as a >50 m wide fault zone characterised by 
fault gouge, lithological repetitions, and a swarm of BiGd dykes. The fault has been 
modelled as a series of segments displaced across newly interpreted north-west–south-
east trending faults.
  The geologically unusually shallow-dipping BiGd intrusions in the Central Pit were re
modelled as steeply dipping dykes, compatible with the BiGd intrusions associated with 
the well-constrained East Boundary Fault in the Southwest zone. The dykes are 
interpreted to be intimately associated with extensional faulting along the East Boundary
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 117 of 519
Fault. The orientation of these dykes presents a potential geotechnical risk, and further 
work will be required to confirm the sub-vertical reinterpretation. This is currently being 
addressed through a programme of pit mapping and reconciliation to the resource 
geology model.
  The previously modelled east-west trending Rhyolite Fault between the Southwest and
Central zones, which was the northernmost fault in the 2007 model, was retained but re-
modelled into segments separated by the newly interpreted north-west–south-east 
trending faults.
  The north–north-west trending faults appear to be sub-vertical to steeply north-easterly
dipping. Faults AP04, AP05, and AP06 are coincident with a swarm of presumably 
synchronously intruded rhyolite dykes (which have the same strike, but shallower, 60°–70° 
dips) between the Central and Southwest zones.
It was concluded that:
  The East Boundary Fault is likely to form a significant geotechnical and hydro geological
feature during mining operations.
  Changes in interpretations of the dip of the BiGd intrusions, when confirmed, could have
significant benefits for slope design. In the previous model, BiGd dykes are not only 
parallel to the slope, but also immediately below the ramps on the east side of the pit, 
posing a major slope stability hazard. It was recommended that the BiGd units in the 
Central zone be re-modelled, with geotechnical holes sited to determine whether the 
BiGd units are favourably steeply dipping (as in the 2011 work), or unfavourably dipping 
west, parallel to the Central Pit slope (as previously modelled).
The interpretation of the structural framework of Hugo North has evolved over time. Rio Tinto 
staff, on behalf of OT LLC, performed an initial structural review of the faulting and fault 
models during 2009–2010 for the Hugo Dummett deposit area in support of the planned block 
cave mining operation. The result was a preliminary fault model based on apparent 
displacements of geological boundaries, coupled with interpretation and analysis of 
structural data collected from drill core. These interpretations were used as a guide for the 
2011 and 2014 structural framework used to construct the Hugo North geology model 
(Figure 9.2).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 118 of 519
The 2011 geology model introduced several north-east and north-west trending faults to the 
Hugo North geology model. These structures were added based on faults in the drillholes and 
to accommodate offsets in lithology that were previously explained by folding and the 
thickening and thinning of the volcanic package. The cross-sectional and plan section 
interpretations in the 2014 model added an additional set of east-west faults in the north-east 
extension area to explain the sudden directional change of the strike of the ore body from 
north-south trending to north-east trending. These faults are steep-dipping, but dip direction 
may change locally from north to south. These east-west faults are interpreted as being late 
developments.
During 2010–2011, a significant amount of work was undertaken to review the geological and 
structural setting of the Oyu Tolgoi mineralisation, particularly in the Hugo North area. This 
work formed the basis of the 2011 structural interpretation of Hugo North, which added a 
series of north-east and north-west faults and one east-west trending faults in addition to the 
legacy faults from the 2007 geology model. The 2014 geology model then added east-west 
faults in the north-east extension area to explain the directional change of the orebody from 
north trending to north-east trending as a series of dextral offsets.
The additional faults that were modelled in each year of the model updates are as follows 
(Figure 9.3):
  2007: The Legacy faults include the Contact, Lower, Intermediate, 160, 110, West Bat,
East Bat, North Boundary, Rhyolite, and 7100.
  2011: Kharaa and Eroo (north-east trend), Noyon, Gobi, Javkhlant, Burged, and the
Kharaa-Suult (north-west), Selenge (east–west).
  2014: Bogd, Bumbat, and Dugant (east–west). Bogd replaces the Selenge.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 119 of 519
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 120 of 519
Key elements from the work completed to date are as follows:
  The north-west and north-east trending faults effectively broke apart and offset the
deposit parallel faults (Contact, Intermediate, Lower).
  There is an offset in lithology and mineralisation along the 7100 Fault, indicating an
oblique slip nature.
  The Kharaa and the Eroo may be (reactivated?) splays from the North Boundary Fault.
  The Bogd, Bumbat, and Dugant offset the mineralisation and lithology and have an
oblique slip component associated with them, including significant dextral movement 
across the Bogd Fault.

If the deposit is turned on its side, then the north-west and north-east faults form a basin 
such that the volcanic units are close to horizontal. This theory is conceptual at present. 
The model of the hanging wall sequence should help in understanding this development 
in the ore deposition cycle.
An elementary fault hierarchy for Hugo North was established, although more work needs to 
be done to understand and confirm the fault hierarchy:
  Early stage: The deposit parallel faults Contact, Lower, Intermediate, and160.
  Mid stage: The north-west trending faults are earlier than the East Bat and West Bat faults.
However, the 7100 cuts the West Bat Fault and so may have been reactivated.
  Mid to Late stage: North Boundary, Kharaa, Eroo, 110, and Rhyolite faults.
  Late stage: East-west trending oblique slip faults in the north-east extension area (Bogd,
Bumbat, and Dugant).
Future work to locate the faults in the hanging wall sequence (HWS) will target the BiGd and 
volcanic sequence contact above the block cave and model the faults on the west side of 
the West Bat Fault. The HWS model should help the understanding of whether or not certain 
faults cut across the West Bat Fault and if the BiGd/HWS contact is faulted.
Oyu Tolgoi staff updated the Heruga structural and geological model in 2013 and it was 
reviewed by Alasdaire Pope in October 2013. Notes on the structural setting of the Heruga 
orebody are summarised below.
The surface map shows a north-east trending Carboniferous syncline axial trace directly 
above the Heruga deposit footprint. Level plans 1.0 km down in the mineralised zone show a 
Devonian core with Carboniferous on the flanks, i.e. an anticline. The corresponding anticline 
axial trace at surface lies ~500 m to the east, suggesting that the axial surface dips in the 
order of ~60°to 70° to the west–north-west.
On level plans and cross-sections the anticline looks like a positive flower structure 
(i.e. transpressive – a pop-up structure) developed in an east dipping homocline, but the 
surface map shows anticline and syncline fold closures. This may be a potentially important 
difference in trying to understand the genesis and geometry of the deposit, and may 
indicate the presence of more mineralisation in the immediate vicinity.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 121 of 519
The current model has been built from serial cross-sections. Due to wide drillhole spacing on 
the flanks of the deposit, the model has an irregular, saw-tooth geometry when viewed in 
level plans. By concentrating on individual distinctive marker units and smoothing the 
interpretation to something that looks geologically reasonable, the geological setting of the 
deposit, in the faulted core of an anticline, becomes apparent.
Faults have been modelled as vertical. However, the easterly offset surface anticline axial 
trace and parallel related faults suggest that the north-east trending faults may also dip 
steeply west. This is also suggested by sequential level plans where the mineralised Qmd in 
the northern part of the deposit migrates across three fault panels while maintaining the 
same contact relationships and showing no sign of displacement. If faults seen in drillholes 
have been projected vertically to surface and to depth, then the modelling could 
conceivably have included more faults than are really there, instead of correlating fewer, 
steeply west dipping faults.
There is a generally modest to poor correlation between faults in the Heruga model and 
those mapped on surface. It is important to link poorly drill-defined faults, and often barely 
more than conceptual faults, to the well-defined surface fault traces. This is an important part 
of integrating the sub-surface geology with the surface in order to de-risk the interpretation. 
Interpreted faults that do not correspond with, or at least fit the pattern of, surface-mapped 
faults can be considered high risk. The degree of non-correlation between modelled and 
surface-mapped faults is an indicator of the level of uncertainty and hence geological risk in 
the model.
Work completed on the Joint Venture area includes trenching, soil and mobile metal ion 
(MMI) sampling, rock chip and grab sampling, and stream sediment and pan concentrate 
sampling. The total geochemical dataset is summarised in Table 9.1.
Although Ivanhoe and previous companies completed a great deal of prospecting and 
litho-geochemical sampling in the Oyu Tolgoi Licence area, the data have been superseded 
by drilling information in the SOT and Hugo Dummett areas. This work is summarised in 
Table 9.2 for the soil samples collected between 1997 and 2008.

During 2011, all previous geochemical surveys completed in the Oyu Tolgoi area were 
reviewed (Sketchley, 2011). Survey data were levelled and compiled into a single dataset, 
and the anomalies were ranked according to location and type (Bell et al., 2012). Anomalous 
zones were compared to the rock chip and drill databases. Known anomalies are shown in 
Figure 9.4.
Results of the review:
  Anomalous areas are considered to be related to known and explored mineralisation or
are lithologically associated.
  Areas not previously covered by soil geochemistry are underlain by large intrusions, non-
prospective rock exposures, or thick alluvial cover.
  Highly prospective areas have been extensively drilled, and thick cover sequences
render buried mineralisation undetectable by surface geochemical methods.
From this review it was concluded that no new or additional infill surface sampling was 
warranted in the licence areas.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The initial geophysical surveys conducted by BHP in 1997 and 1998 consisted of airborne 
magnetics, ground magnetics, and gradient-array IP. The airborne magnetic survey was 
flown on 300 m spaced east-west lines with approximately 100 m mean terrain clearance. The 
ground magnetic survey and IP survey were completed on 250 m line spacings; the latter 
showed chargeability anomalies over the SOT Central, South, and Southwest zones.
In 2001, Ivanhoe Mines contracted Delta Geoscience of B.C., Canada, to conduct gradient-
array IP on 100 m spaced north-south lines over the 3.0 km x 4.0 km core block of Oyu Tolgoi. 
Using multiple current (AB) electrode spacings ranging from 1,000–3,600 m, the sulfide 
assemblages in the Southwest, South, and Central zones were clearly defined on all of the AB 
plans, indicating significant vertical depths for the mineralisation in all zones. Delta 
Geoscience re-oriented the IP survey lines to east-west and resurveyed the core block of 
Oyu Tolgoi on 100 m spaced lines using multiple current AB electrode spacings. This survey 
resulted in an entirely different chargeability signature that reflected a continuous zone of 
sulfide mineralisation extending north–north-easterly from the south-western end of the 
Southwest zone through to the northernmost extent of the property, for a total strike length of 
approximately 5.0 km. Detailed total field, ground magnetic surveys, reading 25 m x 5.0 m
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 124 of 519
and 50 m x 10 m centres, were completed over the full Oyu Tolgoi mining lease. The data 
were merged to produce a high-quality magnetic image of the block.
In 2002, the geophysical programme was further expanded to include a gravity survey over 
the Oyu Tolgoi concession block. The survey was controlled by GPS with readings taken on 
50 m centres over the core of the concession and 100 m centres over the extremities. The 
Bouguer map was reduced to residual gravity for contouring.
In 2005, telluric electromagnetic (TEM) surveying was also conducted over the eastern half of 
the concession in conjunction with extensive TEM surveying used to define the Cretaceous-
aged, semi-consolidated sedimentary basins along the Galbyn Gobi and Gunii Hooloi valleys, 
south-east and north-east, respectively, from Oyu Tolgoi. These basins developed along the 
East Mongolian Fault system and a splay off the fault, and form reservoirs for extensive water 
resources.
At Oyu Tolgoi, the TEM work was designed to delineate smaller drainage basins that could 
have channelled copper-rich surficial waters from the exposed copper deposits during the 
Cretaceous period. These pregnant waters could potentially have precipitated copper into 
river gravels downstream to form secondary exotic copper deposits, although to date no 
such deposits have been discovered. Moreover, given the relative lack of supergene 
alteration of the known deposits and a paucity of evidence of unroofing of the porphyries, 
the potential for a large-scale exotic copper deposit is considered unlikely.
A Zeus-based geophysical survey operation started at Oyu Tolgoi on 19 June 2009 and 
terminated on 11 November 2009. Survey work continued during 2010 outside the Ivanhoe 
ground in the Shivee Tolgoi licence. The Zeus IP survey used east-west lines, which resulted in 
the generation of north-south trending anomalies.
The Zeus System is a high-powered, low signal-to-noise ratio induced polarisation / resistivity 
instrumentation platform. The Zeus system is based on the use of multiple signal measuring 
systems with broadly spaced electrode configurations.
The owners claim that post-acquisition processing then allows images of conductive and 
resistive blocks to depths below 3 km. However, no inversion is carried out on the data, and 
independent reviews have identified this as a potential issue. To address this, the owners have 
recently pursued inversion processing of the data. However, progress has been slow because 
of the complexity of inverting gradient array-type Three-dimensional (3D) IP data.
During 2011, Fugro was contracted to complete a district-wide magnetotellurics (MagTell) 
survey. Experience with MagTell has shown that the data can detect and delineate isolated 
conductors at substantial depths, and reliable 3D models of conductivity can be derived that 
are readily integrated with geology. The Fugro field crew collected 1,006 individual stations 
covering the main mineralised zones from Ulaan Khuud in the north extending down to 
Javkhlant. Approximately 30 planned stations around the SOT area and to the west of the 
Hugo deposits were omitted because of mine construction activities. Approximately 10% of 
the stations were repeated because of high noise levels that were attributed to cultural 
activity. Results are currently being interpreted in the context of new target generation 
activities within the district.

An initial IP survey (and detailed magnetics), using gradient-array with 11,000 m electrode 
spacing, commenced north of Oyu Tolgoi but was eventually extended through 2005 to 
cover all of the ground within the Shivee Tolgoi licence and to include the Javkhlant licence 
area. Three north-south trending chargeability anomalies were defined.
In late 2008, a 26.6 km2 detailed magnetometer survey was undertaken in the Hugo North 
Extension area. Lines were oriented east–west at 25 m spacing with continuous readings. Two 
large magnetic features were found in the survey area.
At the same time, a 26.6 km2 detailed magnetometer survey was undertaken in the Heruga 
area to obtain a more detailed view of the geology and structure. Lines were oriented east-
west at 25 m spacing, with continuous readings.
During mid-2011, a ground-magnetic survey was undertaken to the east and west of 
Javkhlant and Heruga, extending eastward to the edge of the Khukh Khaad mining licence 
to the east and westward into the Manakht licence:
  Manakht licence – 1,138 line km over 161 lines with 25 m line spacing oriented east-west,
with continuous readings.
  Khukh Khaad licence – 1,007 line km over 221 lines with 25 m line spacing oriented east-
west, with continuous readings.
A GEM GSM 19W (v7) Proton Precession equipment unit was used for this work.
During 2002, two trenches were completed over surface exposures of the Southwest zone. 
Both trenches were approximately 60 m in length and provided early-stage geological and 
assay information about the area.
During 2003 and 2004, an extensive 8,000 m trenching programme was carried out over the 
South and Southwest zones, plus an additional 20 km of trenches were completed in various 
other locations throughout the licence. Trenches at the South zone ranged in length from 
280–1,177 m and averaged around 600 m. Trenches were generally excavated 25 m apart, 
sampled over 2 m intervals, and assayed for Cu, Au, Mo, As, and Ag.
A number of trenches were excavated in 2009–2011 to support construction activities. These 
were reviewed by site geologists to confirm mapping across the licence areas. The vast 
majority of the excavations were within Cretaceous clays, however, and no sampling was 
carried out.
A number of research, petrological, and mineralogical studies have been performed. These 
include age dating of key lithological units, detailed stratigraphic reviews, petrographic and 
spectral analysis of alteration products and minerals, and detailed structural reviews, 
particularly in the areas proposed for the block caving operation at Hugo Dummett.

Ivanhoe Mines established, and OT LLC maintains, an in-house petrology laboratory in the 
Oyu Tolgoi Geosciences Department. Equipment for making polished mineral specimen 
blanks and polished thin sections is currently in use.
Alteration minerals are determined by short-wave infrared spectrometry—short-wave infra-
red (SWIR) or portable infrared mineral analyser (PIMA) analysis—on typical specimens from a 
number of alteration zones in each drillhole.
A programme of preparing mineralisation samples and making metallurgical index estimates 
from all of the Oyu Tolgoi deposits was undertaken between 2002 and 2006.

Core drillholes are the principal source of geological and grade data for Oyu Tolgoi. A small 
percentage of the total drilling comes from reverse circulation (RC) or combined RC/core 
drilling. Most of the RC holes were drilled in the early days of exploration at the SOT deposit. 
Combined RC/core holes, which have RC at the top of the hole and core drilling at the base, 
also make up a small percentage of the total number of holes on the project.
The first drilling was completed by BHP in 1997 and 1998, when 23 core holes (3,902 m) were 
drilled at the SOT deposit. Ivanhoe carried out approximately 109 holes (8,828 m) of reverse 
circulation (RC) drilling in 2000, mainly at Central zone, to explore the chalcocite blanket 
discovered earlier by BHP.
In 2001, Ivanhoe continued RC drilling (16 holes totalling approximately 2,091 m), mostly in the 
South zone area; however, a combined RC collar/core tail drilling method was tested for hole 
number OTRCD149. Ivanhoe drilled two additional holes using this method (OTRCD50 and 52), 
along with seven additional RC holes totalling 801.5 m (up to hole OTRC158), before switching 
to core drilling methods for all of its exploration.
As of 31 December 2013, a total of approximately 1,115,706 m of drilling in 2,603 holes has 
been completed on the project. Of this, 1,022,254 m was core drilling in 1,807 holes and 
72,696 m was completed in 713 RC holes. The drilling has been spread mostly over the Hugo 
Dummett, SOT, and Heruga deposits. These totals include approximately 525 holes (75,427 m) 
drilled as part of a condemnation programme to assist in the determination of suitable sites 
for the proposed plant, infrastructure, and dumps, and for water and geotechnical purposes.
Table 10.1 is a summary of all drillholes; the drillhole collars are shown in Figure 9.4.
The drillholes are drilled at a wide range of azimuths and dips depending on the orientation 
of the mineralisation, but an east to west orientation is dominant throughout the project area. 
Drilling is normally oriented perpendicular to the strike of the mineralisation. Depending on the 
dip of the drillhole and the dip of the mineralisation, drill intercept widths are typically greater 
than true widths.
Average drillhole lengths at the Hugo Dummett and SOT deposits range from 316 m (South 
zone) to 894 m (Hugo North) and average around 525 m overall.
The drill spacing is a nominal 70 m on and between drill sections in the SOT zones. Drill spacing 
at Hugo North is on approximate 125 x 75 m centres. Drill spacing typically widens toward the 
margins of the deposits.

Diamond drilling on the project has been almost continuous since 2001, using a variety of 
different contractors. Most of the more recent drilling was contracted to Major Pontil Pty Ltd. 
(Major), based out of Australia, which has used a variety of rigs, some with depth capabilities 
in excess of 2,500 m; these include UDR 1000, 1500, and 5000, LM90, and Schramm rigs.
Other drilling campaigns have been completed by Gobi Drilling, Can Asia, Mongolia Drilling 
Services, Australian Independent Diamond Drillers, and Soil Trade.

Note: Includes all holes drilled to 12 May 2011. Not all of this drilling is relevant to the Mineral Resource estimate.
Some of these holes were collared in the Shivee Tolgoi lease and drilled back into the Oyu Tolgoi lease.
Includes holes drilled for geotechnical, water, and condemnation purposes.
Approximately 79% of the combined RC/core drilling is by core methods.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The vast majority of core diameters at the SOT and Hugo Dummett deposits have been either 
PQ-size (85 mm nominal core diameter), HQ-size (63.5 mm nominal core diameter), or NQ-size 
(47.6 mm nominal core diameter), with a small percentage drilled with BQ-size core (35.5 mm 
nominal core diameter). Most holes at Hugo North were collared with PQ core and were 
reduced to HQ at depths of around 500 m prior to entering the mineralised zone. A few holes 
have continued to depths of about 1,300 m using PQ diameter. The depth of size reduction in 
any given hole varies depending on drilling conditions.
Many of the deeper holes, especially at Hugo North (including Copper Flats), include multiple 
daughter holes (wedges) drilled from a PQ diameter parent drillhole. A bend is placed in the 
parent hole at the location where the planned daughter holes are to branch off. The bend is 
achieved by means of a Navi-Drill® (navi) bit, which is lowered down-the-hole to the desired 
depth and aligned along the azimuth of the desired bend. As the navi bit advances, a bend 
is achieved at the rate of 1° every three metres. No core is recovered from the navi-drilled 
interval, and the core diameter is reduced, generally to HQ size.
Most core has been drilled using Ball Mark™ or Ace™ oriented core marking systems to assist 
with geological and structural interpretations and for geotechnical purposes. More recently a 
Reflex ACT II Rapid Descent tool has been used for core orientations.
At the drill rig, the drillers remove core from the core barrel and place it directly in wooden or 
plastic core boxes. Individual drill runs are identified with small wooden or plastic blocks, 
where the depth (m) and drillhole number are recorded. Unsampled core is never left 
unattended at the rig; boxes are transported to the OT LLC core logging facility at the main 
camp twice a day under a geologist’s or technician’s supervision. Core is transported in open 
boxes in the back of a truck. Those holes drilled specifically for geotechnical purposes 
typically use triple tubes, which are pumped out at the rig, transferred to a steel V-rail, and 
logged on-site before transport back to the core shed.
The RC logging involves capture of geological, alteration, and mineralisation data on paper 
logging forms.
Core logging facilities are indoors. Core logging takes place on sturdy steel racks, each of 
which is capable of holding upwards of 25 or more core boxes. Upon arrival at the core shed, 
the core is subject to the following procedures:
  Quick review.
  Box labelling check: The core boxes are checked to ensure they are appropriately 
identified with the drillhole number, metres from–to, and box number written with a 
permanent marker on the front.
  Core re-building: Core is rotated to fit the ends of the adjoining broken pieces.
  Core photography.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 132 of 519
  Geotechnical logging, using pre-established codes and logging forms, includes: length
of core run, recovered:drilled ratio, rock quality designation (RQD), and maximum length, 
structural data, and oriented core data. Orientated core measurements were logged as 
interval data using standardised codes for structural and vein data only; the orientated 
core measurement did not usually begin until the hole was within the mineralised zone.
  Geological logging: Until August 2010 this was completed on paper logging forms. After
that, OT LLC implemented a digital logging data capture system, using commercially 
available acQuire® software, which uses standardised templates and validated logging 
codes that must be filled out prior to log completion. The logging is entered directly into 
laptops at the core shed and is wirelessly synchronised with the geological database. The 
template includes header information, lithology description and lithology code, graphic 
log, coded mineralisation, and alteration.
  The geologist marks a single, unbiased cutting line along the entire length of the core for
further processing.
Recovery data were not collected for the RC drill programmes.
OT LLC’s geological staff measure the following core recovery and rock quality designation 
(RQD) parameters at the core logging area:
  Block interval
  Drill run (m)
  Measured length (m)
  Calculated recovery (%)
  RQD measured length (m)
  Calculated RQD (%).
The methodology used for measuring recovery is standard industry practice.
In general, OT LLC reports that core recoveries obtained by the various drilling contractors 
have been very good, averaging between 97% and 99% for all of the deposits. In localised 
areas of faulting and/or fracturing, the recoveries decrease; however, this occurs in a very 
small percentage of the overall mineralised zones. In addition, OT LLC notes decreased 
recoveries near surface in overlying non-mineralised Cretaceous clays and to a lesser extent 
in some of the oxidised rocks (generally above 100 m depth), owing to the lower 
competencies of these units.
Table 10.2 shows the recovery averages per year from 1998–2013.

Collar survey methods were similar for core and RC drillholes.
Upon completion of a drillhole, the collar and anchor rods are removed, and a PVC pipe is 
inserted into the hole. The drillhole collar is marked by a cement block inscribed with the 
drillhole number (e.g., OTD663). Proposed drillhole collars are surveyed by a hand-held GPS 
unit for preliminary interpretations. After the hole is completed, a Nikon theodolite or DGPS 
instrument is used for final survey pickup. The two collar readings are compared, and if any 
significant differences are noted the collar is re-surveyed; otherwise the final survey is 
adopted as the final collar reading.
RC drillholes were typically not downhole surveyed. Drillholes are assumed to be without 
deviation from the collar survey. In general, most RC holes are less than 100 m in depth and 
therefore unlikely to experience excessive deviations in the drill trace.
OT LLC uses downhole survey instruments to collect the azimuth and inclination at specific 
depths of the core drillholes for most of the diamond drilling programmes. The principal types 
of survey method used over the duration of the drilling programmes include Eastman Kodak, 
Pontil, Flexit, Ranger, gyro, and north-seeking gyro.
No downhole survey data were collected during the first 149 holes drilled on the project, 
including the initial core drill programme by BHP in 1998 and the 125 RC holes completed by 
Ivanhoe in 2001 and 2002.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 134 of 519
The first surveys initiated by Ivanhoe were for holes OTRCD149, 150, and 152, which were 
surveyed by the Eastman Kodak method. Ivanhoe used this method interchangeably with 
gyro and Ranger as the principal means of measuring deviations until approximately drillhole 
OTD397, after which gyro, north seeking gyro, Flexit, and Ranger methods were used. A small 
percentage of the holes in the database remain unsurveyed. It should be noted that the 
Eastman Kodak, Pontil, Flexit, and Ranger methods derive azimuth measurements using a 
magnet and are therefore subject to potential problems that can be caused by magnetic 
minerals, common at some of the deposits on Oyu Tolgoi.
Since January 2006, the procedure has been to measure deviations initially using a Flexit 
instrument along 30–60 m intervals to monitor the drillhole progress. At completion, all holes 
are re-surveyed with a north seeking gyro or SRG gyro instrument at approximately 5.0–20 m 
intervals. The gyro instruments are not dependent on magnetic readings and are therefore 
considered to be more appropriate methods for this style of deposit and the depth of the 
holes.
OT LLC has a detailed validation programme built into the database to reveal any moderate 
kinks or deviations in the downhole data. All of these are checked and adjusted, if required, 
before finalising the database.
All core is stored in a secure location at the main camp. Core is stacked on pallets in a stable, 
3 x 3 box configuration to a height of about 1.0 m (15 boxes per pallet). Each pallet is 
covered with a canvas tarpaulin, which is labelled with drillhole identification and the interval 
stacked in the pallet.

Ivanhoe Mines’ sampling programmes at Oyu Tolgoi included stream sediment, soil, trench, 
and rock chip samples. All of the sampling was carried out by Ivanhoe personnel or 
contractors.
Sampling performed by Entrée Gold and Ivanhoe Mines personnel on the Shivee Tolgoi JV 
leases also included stream sediment, soil, trench, and rock chip samples.
Because all of these early-stage sampling methods have been superseded by drill data, 
which form the basis of the Mineral Resources estimates, the early-stage sampling methods 
are not discussed further.
The core cutting protocols at the now decommissioned OT Camp core shed for core drilling 
in both the Oyu Tolgoi and Shivee Tolgoi JV areas were as follows:
  Core is photographed.
  The uncovered core boxes are transferred from the logging area to the cutting shed
(approximately 50 m) by forklift on wooden pallets.
  Long pieces of core are broken into smaller segments with a hammer.
  Core is cut with a diamond saw, following the line marked by the geologist. The rock saw
is regularly flushed with fresh water.
  Both halves of the core are returned to the box in their original orientation.
  The uncovered core boxes are transferred from the cutting shed to the sampling area
(approximately 50 m) by a forklift carrying several boxes on a wooden pallet:
-  Constant two metre sample intervals are measured and marked on both the core
and the core box with a permanent marker.
-  A sample tag is stapled to the box at the end of each two metre sample interval.
-  Sample numbers are pre-determined and account for the insertion of quality
assurance and quality control (QA/QC) samples (core twins, standards, blanks).
  Samples are bagged. These are always half-core samples collected from the same side
of the core. Each sample is properly identified with inner tags and marked numbers on 
the outside. Samples are regularly transferred to a sample preparation facility operated 
by SGS Mongolia LLC (SGS Mongolia) approximately 50 m from the sample bagging 
area.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 136 of 519
The core cutting and sampling procedures in the new Crane-Kavalieris core shed have been 
modified slightly to the following.
  Core is photographed.
  A pallet jack transfers the core boxes on pallets to the core cutting room.
  Long pieces of core are broken into smaller segments with a hammer.
  The core is placed in a core cradle and cut in half using automated feed Almonte core
saws.
  Half the core is placed directly into a pre-numbered sample bag and half the core is
returned to the core tray.
The unsampled half of the core remains in the box, in its original orientation, as a permanent 
record. Where additional sampling is required (e.g., for metallurgical testwork), a skeleton 
core is left. In some cases, however, the additional testwork has consumed the entire core, 
and only photographic records remain. Core boxes are subsequently transferred to the on-
site core storage area.
Non-mineralised dykes that extend more than 10 m along the core length are generally not 
sampled.
Ivanhoe Mines and later OT LLC collected an extensive database of bulk density 
measurements for the SOT and Hugo Dummett deposits from core samples dating back to 
2002. Currently, there are 49,365 bulk density determinations in the database relating to the 
deposits as shown Table 11.1.

Before March 2012, 10 cm samples of full or half core were taken at approximately 10 m 
intervals per drillhole for bulk density determination. The bulk density for non-porous samples 
(the most common type) is calculated using the weights of representative samples in water 
(Wwater) and in air (Wair). The bulk density is calculated by the formula:
Density = Wdried in air / (Wdried in air-Wwater)
In March 2012, the immersion method was improved slightly to account for minor porosity in 
the rocks. The sample size was increased to 20 cm lengths of full core. The samples are 
weighed and then oven dried for 12 hours at 105°C. The dry weight is then measured.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 137 of 519
The sample is then lowered into a basket submerged in water beneath the scales and the 
immersed weight is measured. The sample is removed from the suspended basket, excess 
water is brushed off, and the saturated weight is measured. Bulk density is then calculated:
SG = Wdried in oven / (Wsaturated – Wwater)
Using the saturated weight is an improvement on the previous method because it accounts 
for the water absorbed by the sample during immersion to give a more accurate measure of 
displacement.
Less commonly, porous samples were dried and then coated with paraffin before weighing. 
Allowance was made for the weight and volume of the paraffin when calculating the bulk 
density.
In March 2012, a calliper method was introduced as a quality assurance check on the 
immersion method. Because the calliper method requires a cylinder of core, the procedure 
changed to taking a representative rock sample every 20 m. The samples are 20 cm long 
and cut perpendicular to the core axis using a core saw to create a cylinder for 
measurement. Where substantial chipping occurred when cutting the ends, the samples 
were rejected. The samples are weighed and then oven dried for 12 hours at 105°C. The dry 
weight is measured and the sample is then measured using a digital calliper. Three 
measurements are taken of the diameter of the cylinder and two measurements of the 
length. These values are then averaged.
The formula for the calliper method is:
SG = Wdried in oven / (π x (((d1 + d2 + d3) / 3) / 2)2 x (l1 + l2) / 2)
Where:
Wdried in oven = Weight of sample dried in oven
D1-3 = Diameters of the core in three positions
L1-2 = Lengths of the core in perpendicular position

Until September 2011, all routine sample preparation and analyses of the Oyu Tolgoi samples 
were carried out by SGS Mongolia, which operates an independent sample preparation 
facility at the Oyu Tolgoi site and an analytical laboratory in Ulaanbaatar. SGS Mongolia, part 
of the global SGS Group, and predecessors have maintained a full service laboratory in 
Ulaanbaatar since the late 1990s. This laboratory was recognised as having ISO 9001:2000 
accreditation and conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025 for specific registered tests. 
The laboratory performs all fire assay analyses.
Since September 2011, a second pulp has also been sent to the ALS Chemex facility in 
Vancouver, Canada, for inductively-coupled plasma and LECO analyses. ALS also acts as 
the check assay lab for SGS and vice versa. Since 2005, ALS Chemex has held ISO/IEC 17025 
accreditation.
During 2002 and 2003, the on-site sample preparation facility and analytical laboratory were 
operated under the name Analabs Co. Ltd. (Analabs). Analabs is an Australian-based 
company controlled by Scientific Services Limited, which was bought by the SGS Group in 
2001. SGS is an internationally recognised organisation that operates more than 
320 laboratories worldwide, many of which have ISO 9002 certification. The operating name 
of the Mongolian subsidiary was changed to SGS Mongolia LLC (SGS Mongolia) in 2004.
Until May 2005 (OTD900), SGS Welshpool in Perth, Australia, was designated as the secondary 
(check) laboratory. This laboratory currently has ISO: 17025 accreditation, but whether it did 
at the time of the analyses is unknown.
After May 2005, the secondary laboratory was changed to Genalysis Laboratory Services Pty 
Ltd. (Genalysis), also in Perth. The National Association of Testing Authorities Australia has 
accredited Genalysis to operate in accordance with ISO/IEC: 17025 (1999), which includes 
the management requirements of ISO 9002:1994.
Check assays were also performed by ActLabs Asia LLC, part of the global ActLabs Group, 
which has maintained a full service laboratory in Ulaanbaatar since 2006. The laboratory has 
sample preparation, weighing, fire assaying, wet laboratory, and instrumentation sections.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 140 of 519
It maintains an ISO: 17025 accreditation and participates in CANMET and Geostats 
Proficiency Testing Programmes.
Check assays in the early phases of project drilling were performed by Bondar Clegg and 
Chemex laboratories. It is not known what certification these laboratories held at the time of 
the check assay programmes.
All Ivanhoe Mines rock and drill samples since 2002 and subsequently, all OT LLC samples 
since 2010 have been submitted to the same sample preparation and analytical laboratory 
that was operated by either Analabs or SGS.
The preparation laboratory was installed in 2002 as a dedicated facility for Oyu Tolgoi during 
exploration and resource definition stages. The laboratory was operating continuously up to 
the end of 2008, when it was put on care and maintenance during a slowdown in drilling 
operations. It re-opened sporadically during 2009, and resumed continuous operations in mid-
2010, when drilling operations increased. Although the facility has mostly dealt with samples 
from the project, it also has, on occasion, prepared some samples from other Ivanhoe Mines 
projects in Mongolia. In March 2014 the facility was again put under care and maintenance 
as drilling operations ceased.
Split-core samples were prepared for analysis at the on-site sample preparation facility 
operated by SGS Mongolia. The prepared pulps were then shipped by air to Ulaanbaatar 
under the custody of either Ivanhoe Mines or OT LLC personnel, where they were assayed at 
the laboratory facility operated by SGS Mongolia.
All sample preparation procedures and QA/QC protocols were established by Ivanhoe Mines 
in consultation with SGS Mongolia and have been continued by OT LLC. The maximum 
sample preparation capacity has been demonstrated to be around 600 samples per day 
when the sample preparation facility is fully staffed.
The sample preparation facility has one large drying oven, two Terminator jaw crushers, and 
three LM2 pulverisers. The crushers and pulverisers have forced air extraction and compressed 
air for cleaning.
The sample preparation protocol for Oyu Tolgoi samples is as follows:
  Coding – An internal laboratory code is assigned to each sample at reception.
  Drying – The samples are dried at 75°C for up to 24 hours.
  Crushing – The entire sample is crushed to obtain nominal 90% at 3.35 mm.
  Splitting – The sample passes twice through a nominal one inch (approximately 2.5 cm)
Jones™ splitter, reducing the sample to approximately 1.0 kg. The coarse reject is stored.
  Pulverisation – The sample is pulverised for approximately five minutes to achieve nominal 
90% at 75 µm (200 mesh). A 150 g sample is collected from the pulveriser and sealed in a 
Kraft™ envelope. The pulp rejects are stored on-site.
  The pulps are put back into the custody of OT LLC personnel, and SRM control samples
are inserted as required.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 141 of 519
  Shipping – The pulps are stored in a core box and locked and sealed with tamper-proof
tags. Sample shipment details are provided to the assaying facility both electronically 
and as paper hard copy accompanying each shipment. The box is shipped by air to 
Ulaanbaatar where it is picked up by SGS Mongolia personnel and taken to the 
analytical laboratory. SGS Mongolia staff confirm by electronic transmission that the seal 
on the box is original and has not been tampered with.
  Storing and submitting – The pulp rejects are stored on-site at the laboratory for several
months and then returned to the project office in Ulaanbaatar for storage.
Between sample processing, all equipment is flushed with barren material and blasted with 
compressed air. Screen tests are done on crushed and pulverised material from one sample 
taken from the processed samples that make up part of each final batch of 20 samples to 
ensure that sample preparation specifications are being met.
Reject samples are stored in plastic bags inside the original cloth sample bags and are 
placed in bins on pallets and stored at site. Duplicate pulp samples are stored at site in the 
same manner as reject samples.
SGS Mongolia routinely assayed all samples submitted for gold, copper, iron, molybdenum, 
arsenic, and silver on two metre composite intervals.
Up to September 2011, copper and molybdenum were determined by acid digestion of a 
sub-sample, followed by an AAS finish. Samples were digested with nitric, hydrochloric, 
hydrofluoric, and perchloric acids to dryness before being leached with hydrochloric acid to 
dissolve soluble salts and made to volume with distilled water. Routine assays up to 2.0% Cu 
used a sub-sample size of 0.5 g, whereas a sub-sample size of 0.25 g was used for samples 
expected to be over-range, or >2.0% Cu. The detection limits of the copper and 
molybdenum methods were 0.001% and 10 ppm, respectively.
Gold was determined using a 30 g fire assay fusion cupelled to obtain a bead and digested 
with aqua regia, followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish, with a 
detection limit of 0.01 g/t. The same acid digestion process used for copper and 
molybdenum was also used for analyses of silver and arsenic with detection limits of 1.0 ppm 
and 100 ppm, respectively.
A trace elements composites (TEC) programme was undertaken in addition to routine 
analyses. Ten-metre composites of equal weight were made up from routine sample pulp 
reject material. The composites were subject to multi-element analyses comprising a suite of 
47 elements determined by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy/mass 
spectrometry (ICP-OES/MS) after four-acid digestion. Additional element analyses included 
mercury by cold vapour AAS, fluorine by potassium hydroxide (KOH) fusion / specific ion 
electrode, and carbon/sulfur by LECO furnace. Results from the TEC programme were used 
for deleterious element modelling.
During 2011, an audit of assay techniques was instigated on the restricted suite of Cu, Au, Fe, 
Mo, Ag, and As. The audit suggested that high detection limits for As, Ag, and Mo restricted 
the usefulness of the information gained from these elements to only well mineralised areas.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 142 of 519
The most serious example of high-detection thresholds was for As, where 99% of the As assays 
were found to be below the threshold for repeatable data, the threshold being equal to five 
times the lower detection limit. The result is that all elements analysed, apart from Cu and Fe, 
are considered to have been compromised for exploration purposes by the detection limit. 
Since Au is assayed by a separate fire assay method, the assays are deemed not to have 
been compromised.
Similarly, gold concentrations were historically analysed using a 30 g fusion with an atomic 
absorption (AA) determination. This gives an accurate range from 0.01–10 g/t Au; however, 
by using inductively-coupled plasma/atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to analyse the 
gold in solution concentration, a ten times decrease in detection limit is possible with a similar 
upper detection limit. The current drill database shows 50% of the Au analyses are below five 
times the current detection limit.
As a consequence, a shift to high-resolution ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) for routine samples 
was implemented in September 2011. Given the relative complexity of ICP-MS equipment 
and the tendency for laboratories to centralise them globally to assist with operation and 
maintenance, this has necessitated a shift to an offshore laboratory for analysis of all resource 
and exploration samples.
As a result, the following actions were taken:
  SGS continued to manage the on-site sample preparation facility.
  SGS in Ulaanbaatar was appointed the primary laboratory for Au and F to ensure rapid
turnaround of gold values.
  ALS (Vancouver) was appointed the primary laboratory for the high-resolution multi 
element ICP-MS based suite (42 elements) and LECO sulphur and carbon analyses.
  ALS and SGS were to act as the secondary laboratories for each other, reinstating the
secondary laboratory checks systematically in resource and exploration drilling. The 
check sample rate was at a nominal check rate ratio of one sample in 20.
The intended outcome for this was to:


Identify grade and mineralisation type (Cu, Au).
Identify new mineralisation from pathfinder elements (As, Bi, Pb, Zn, etc.).
  Determine the distribution of potential credit elements (Ag, Mo).
  Determine deleterious elements and allow mitigation procedures to be prepared (S, As,
F, Cl, Se, and Ti).
  Support the mapping of deleterious alteration or rock types to allow mitigation
procedures to be prepared (Si, K, Na, and Ca).
  Support the mapping of rock types for appropriate logging of litho-types.
Run-of-mine samples from the open pit and concentrator are subject to a separate 
analytical flowchart at the mine laboratory situated within the concentrator complex on-site.

Geological aspects of the QA/QC programme were set up during 2001 by Charles Forster, 
who was Ivanhoe Mines’ manager for Oyu Tolgoi at the time. Simple analytical quality control 
procedures were followed until March 2002 when a formal programme was set up under the 
direction of Dr. Barry Smee, P. Geo., an independent quality control consultant. This work 
included development of procedural guidelines, laboratory audits, and preparation of 
reference materials, with initial on-site monitoring conducted by designated Ivanhoe Mines 
and later OT LLC staff.
All sampling and QA/QC work before 2007 was overseen on behalf of Ivanhoe Mines by its 
QA/QC Manager Dale A. Sketchley, M.Sc., P. Geo. QA/QC reviews were intermittent in the 
period 2007 to end-2010.
Ivanhoe Mines had also retained independent geologist/geochemist Dr. Barry Smee to 
conduct semi-annual audits of both the preparation and analytical facilities from March 2002 
through 2008 (Smee, 2008). Dr. Smee’s reports over this period are available through OT LLC.
The most recent audit of QA/QC data was completed on behalf of Ivanhoe Mines by 
Dale Sketchley in 2011.
Samples were initially assembled into groups of 15 or 16 samples, and then four or five quality 
control samples were interspersed to make up a batch of 20. The quality control samples 
inserted by Ivanhoe Mines consisted of one duplicate split core sample, one uncrushed field 
blank, a reject or pulp preparation duplicate, and one or two standard reference material 
(SRM) samples (<2.0% Cu and >2.0% Cu if higher grade mineralisation was present based on 
visual estimates). The two copper SRMs were necessary because SGS Mongolia used a 
different analytical protocol to assay all samples >2.0% Cu. The SRMs were matrix-matched to 
ensure consistency with routine analytical samples. OT LLC has continued this procedure.
The split core, reject, and pulp duplicates are used to monitor precision at the various stages 
of sample preparation. The field blank can indicate sample contamination or sample mix-
ups, and the SRM is used to monitor accuracy of the assay results.
The SRMs are prepared from material of varying matrices and grades to formulate bulk 
homogenous material. Ten samples of this material are then sent to each of at least seven 
international testing laboratories. The resulting assay data are analysed statistically to 
determine a representative mean value and standard deviation necessary for setting 
acceptance/rejection tolerance limits. Blank samples are also subjected to a round-robin 
programme to ensure the material is barren of any of the grade elements before the blank 
samples are used for monitoring contamination.
From January 2006 (OTD930/EGD53) to mid-2007, the check assay programme was in 
abeyance based on recommendations from Smee (2006), who concluded:
“The check analysis confirms the conclusions drawn from the ongoing quality control 
program, but at a considerable cost in time, effort, and money. I recommend that the 
check assay program be discontinued.”
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 144 of 519
Check sampling was re-instated in mid-2007 and continued through to mid-2009, when it was 
again discontinued due to a slowdown in drilling activities.
In September 2011, when the change in laboratory protocols was initiated, check assays 
once again became routine in the programme. Insufficient data are currently available from 
the re-introduced programme to draw firm conclusions; however, no evidence of bias is 
apparent from the small dataset that is available.
Standard reference materials (SRMs) routinely used at Oyu Tolgoi are matrix-matched and 
developed from drill core crushed rejects. Materials are pulverised, screened to minus 75 μm, 
homogenised, and tested for homogeneity, and then sets of randomly selected samples are 
sent to international laboratories for round-robin testing.
Tolerance limits for SRMs were set at two and three standard deviations from final round-robin 
mean value of the reference material. A single batch failed when SRM assays were beyond 
the three-standard deviation limit, and any two consecutively assayed batches failed when 
SRM assays were beyond the two-standard deviation limit on the same side of the mean.
The performance of the SRM samples was monitored as the assay results arrived at site in the 
period 2002–2007. The ability of the laboratories to return assay values in the prescribed SRM 
ranges steadily improved to more than 99% by end-2007. All samples were given a ‘fail’ flag 
as a default entry in the project database. Each sample was re-assigned a date-based ‘pass’ 
flag when the assays passed acceptance criteria.
In August 2007, a commercial molybdenum SRM was introduced to monitor molybdenum 
assays from Heruga. Because other deposits at Oyu Tolgoi have low molybdenum values, 
close to detection limit, a molybdenum standard had not previously been required. In August 
and September 2007, the failure rate of the SRMs increased to 9.0% and 5.0%, respectively. 
The higher failure rate was attributed to the commercial SRM not being matrix-matched to 
core samples and therefore producing a significantly low bias in the molybdenum assays. In 
October 2007 the commercial SRM was replaced with a matrix matched molybdenum SRM, 
and by January 2008 the failure rate had fallen to 1.0%.
The 2011 Sketchley review noted that for SRMs analysed between 1 January 2008 and 
1 November 2010, the laboratory has a slight upward drift for copper, resulting in an 
operating range for some SRMs that partly overlaps the two standard deviation tolerance 
limit established for SRM data.
Due to the change in analytical method in 2011, the SRM materials are currently undergoing 
re-certification.
Barren material was procured from a local site and tested to ensure its barren nature for use 
as field blanks. Tolerance limits for field blanks were set at 0.06 g/t Au, 0.06% Cu, and 
10 ppm Mo. Batches are automatically failed and re-assayed if these tolerance limits are 
exceeded, unless values are extremely low, in which case a barren override is applied in the 
database, and the batch remains as is.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 145 of 519
Evaluation of the blank samples submitted to the laboratory in the period 2002–2007 
indicated a low incidence of contamination for the analytical programmes for the SOT and 
Hugo Dummett deposits. A few cases of sample mix-ups were identified during the review of 
the blank performance, which were investigated at site and corrected.
No evidence of systematic contamination was noted for the review of data from 
1 January 2008 to 1 November 2010 (Sketchley, 2011).
Duplicates routinely used at Oyu Tolgoi include core, coarsely- crushed rejects, and pulps. 
Core duplicates are taken in the field from one-half of core that has been split along a 
continuous line marked along the middle of the core, parallel to the long axis. Coarsely 
crushed rejects and pulp duplicates are taken in the laboratory by using a riffle splitter. Assays 
of each type follow the parent sample in a batch.
Laboratory check pulp samples sent to an umpire laboratory were only used up to the end of 
2005 for the SOT and Hugo Dummett deposits. Other duplicate sample types employed in the 
QA/QC programme were core, coarse reject, and pulp.
In the period 2002–2007 copper generally performed very well with absolute relative 
difference results well within expected limits; gold absolute relative difference results are were 
higher than copper but considered acceptable. Core duplicates for both copper and gold 
were above the ideal arbitrary absolute relative difference value of 30%, which was related 
to an uneven distribution of mineralisation between core halves as typically caused by quartz 
vein and fracture-controlled mineralisation.
At Hugo North, percentage differences for gold for the coarse reject and pulp duplicate 
samples were about the same because of the finer reject crushing size. Although the reject 
precision was within the ideal threshold, the pulp duplicates tended to be higher, probably 
because most gold values lay near the detection limit where precision was poorer. This is 
further supported by an improvement in precision at higher grades, although there is also a 
possibility of gold liberation during pulverisation. For copper, both coarse reject and pulp 
duplicates were also similar because of the finer reject crushing size, with both being well 
within the ideal limits.
The review of the 2008–2010 data noted a strong bias for several gold duplicate samples, 
which is most likely related to sample mix-ups, as that pattern is present for core, coarsely 
crushed, and pulp samples. The remaining data display normal distribution patterns, and the 
precision is deemed acceptable for the types of material and mineralisation being examined 
(Sketchley, 2011).
Sample security relies on the fact that the samples were always attended to or locked in a 
sample dispatch facility. Sample collection and transportation were always undertaken by 
company or laboratory personnel using company vehicles. Chain-of-custody procedures 
included filling out sample submittal forms that were sent to the laboratory with the sample 
shipments to ensure that the laboratory received all the samples.

Before August 2010, all geological and geotechnical drillhole data were entered into an 
MS Access® relational database that had been developed in-house. Data were exported 
from the main database to meet end-user requirements.
In August 2010, OT LLC elected to migrate the Access® database to a full Oracle content 
(OCDB) acQuire® database with links to the end-user software programmes. The database is 
read-only for these programmes, preventing accidental overwriting and ensuring up-to-date 
live and centralised data, rather than distributed databases.
Before August 2010, all drillhole data were initially manually recorded in the field or in the core 
logging shed on paper logging sheets. The logging geologist then introduced logging 
information into the MS Access® database, which had a series of embedded checking 
programmes to look for obvious errors. Formational names were subsequently assigned 
according to the accepted geological interpretation and position within the stratigraphic 
column.
With the move to the acQuire® database, which instituted direct digital data capture, the 
design stubs for the logging sheets do not permit any invalid data. No drillhole can be 
completed and entered into the database until the logging is correctly entered.
SGS Mongolia reports the results digitally by email and submits signed paper certificates. 
General turn-around is approximately seven days. All hard copy assay certificates are stored 
in a well-organised manner in a secure location on-site.
Before August 2010, the digital assay results were imported to the MS Access® files once the 
assay data had been received from the laboratory in Ulaanbaatar. With the subsequent 
direct import to the acQuire® database, none of the assay data are entered manually. 
Project personnel visually check each assay on the signed paper certificate against the assay 
entry in the digital database.
Final surveyed collars (total station) are entered manually into the database and are visually 
checked against the preliminary, hand-held GPS readings. No double data entry is applied 
during the entry of the final collar coordinates.
Data are presented in up-to-date 50–100 m spaced drill sections in two directions (north-west 
and north-east) and reconciled to 50 m spaced level plans to ensure that domains (solids) 
were properly constructed and interpretations were sound. Sections and levels are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that all holes crossed the target where planned and that data density is 
sufficient to make an appropriate interpretation.
The solids of all lithologies and mineralisation types are present on the interpretations, and if 
significant deviations are noted in the holes, or they appear to miss their targets, additional 
holes are planned to infill untested areas in the model.
OT LLC intends to develop a comprehensive and coherent geological (geometric) model 
based on sound and accurate geological information as the basis for future resource 
estimates.
Digital data is backed up regularly.

A number of data reviews have been undertaken by independent third-party consultants as 
part of preparation of technical reports on the project, including the following:
  Roscoe Postle Associates (RPA), 2002 – Review of exploration information from earlier
work by BHP and Ivanhoe and visited the project site in Mongolia and the Analabs assay 
laboratory in Ulaanbaatar. A suite of independent core samples was collected and 
assayed. Duplicate analytical datasets were examined. No biases or errors were noted 
that would affect Mineral Resource estimates.
  AMEC and AMEC Minproc, 2002–2007 and 2012 – Review of QA/QC data and
databases in support of Mineral Resource estimates undertaken in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 
2007 and 2012, and independent core check sampling. QA/QC reviews showed 
acceptable analytical precision, low contamination, and a small number of sample mix-
up errors. The database iterations reviewed were considered sufficiently error-free to 
support Mineral Resource estimation.
  Barry Smee, 2002–2008 – Review of sample preparation, analytical, and QA/QC data. 
Inspections and reports were completed in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. No 
significant biases or errors were noted that would affect Mineral Resource estimates.
  Quantitative Geoscience, 2007–2008, 2010 – Data verification of previous AMEC
estimates, review of on-site sample preparation facility, independent sampling, and 
review of geology, mineralisation, core sampling, sample preparation, QA/QC, and 
Mineral Resource modelling for the Heruga and Heruga North (New Discovery) areas and 
for geotechnical drilling underway at Hugo North. No biases or errors were noted that 
would affect Mineral Resource estimates.
Other than the issues noted above, all reviewers have concluded the Oyu Tolgoi drillhole 
dataset was sufficiently free of errors, reasonably accurate, precise, and free of 
contamination, and suitable for use in estimating Mineral Resources.
In 2011, TRQ carried out a review of the QA/QC system. The review covered laboratory 
audits, quality assurance procedures, quality control monitoring, and database 
improvements at Oyu Tolgoi for the period 2008 to 2010. Recommendations arising from the 
review included:
  QA/QC improvements at site:
  Updating SRM inventory and sample storage.
  Re-designing batch layouts.
  Re-instating bias charts, failures table, load statistics, failure rates.
  Upgrading analytical suites.

Improving density measuring techniques.
  Rectifying SRM failures and duplicates mix-ups.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 148 of 519
  Completing check assaying.
  Completing regular progress reports.
  Preparation laboratory improvements:
  Minimising fine particle extraction biases.
  Using correct pulverising amounts.
  Rectifying safety issues.
  Using correct sizing test amounts.
  Proper archiving.
  Database improvements:

Improving functionality.
  Correcting integrity issues.
  Fixing operational issues.
Implementation of the recommendations by OT LLC continues, with a number of the 
recommendations either already addressed, such as changes in analytical methods for multi-
element exploration suite, or under advisement.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Oyu Tolgoi currently has three orebodies scheduled for production: the Southwest and 
Central zones of the SOT deposit, and Hugo North. Three additional deposits (Hugo South, 
Heruga, and Heruga North) remain in the assessment phase and are scheduled for a later 
stage of development.
The Southwest zone is now being mined by an open pit mine. Central zone ores will also be 
mined by open pit mining methods. Hugo North will be mined by underground block caving.
A substantial amount of metallurgical testwork has been conducted over the years, which 
was presented in the IDOP (Integrated Development and Operating Plan) report of May 2011 
and the 2013 OTTR.
The latest work has focused on verifying assumptions made during design with actual 
operation experience gained from the start of commissioning the concentrator. In addition 
further floatation variability test have been conducted on Hugo North, Central zone, and 
blends of Southwest zone and Hugo North.
On completion of the variability flotation test work on the individual deposits a series of 
locked cycle tests were conducted on further composites representing chronological blends 
of ore planned to feed the mill in the mine plan.
Southwest zone and Hugo North blend locked cycle tests, not only responded as well, but 
better than either the Hugo North or Southwest zone composites individually. The composite 
with 25% Hugo North and composites containing 50% Hugo North achieved 92.8% recovery to 
a 30.2% copper grade and 92.5% recovery to a 27.3% copper concentrate respectively.
The Central zone covellite–chalcopyrite composite yielded a concentrate grade of 17.1% 
with 62.2% copper recovery and 32.3% gold recovery, which is significantly higher than in the 
batch tests. There was only enough material to perform a single cleaner test on the Central 
zone covellite–chalcopyrite composite, which gave a copper recovery of 70.9% to a copper 
grade of 25.5%.
For Phase 1, Minnovex Minerals Services derived two generic equations to describe the 
capacity and the flotation feed sizing expected from Southwest zone ore. Both equations use 
the same comminution parameters as developed for use in its Comminution Economic 
Evaluation Tool (CEET):
  SAG Power Index (SPI), (in minutes) – closed-circuit small-scale dry grinding test
conducted on –12.7 mm ore.
  Modified Bond Index (MBI or BWI, kWh/t) – a short form of the Bond Ball Mill Index test,
which is calibrated or validated by several full Bond tests.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 150 of 519
  Minnovex Crushing Index (Ci) – developed from the sample preparation process for SPI, 
which is a predictor for the fraction of material already finer than SAG discharge closing 
screen size.
These parameters were used to model a large number of conventional SAG mill / ball mill 
(SABC) circuits, with successful prediction of capacity (or throughput (TPUT) the instantaneous 
tonnage per hour (tph) achievable through grinding x 8,059.2 h/a) and P80 (the 80% passing 
size of grinding circuit product). The Phase 1 plant has achieved and exceeded design 
production rates with primary grind P80 in-line, or better than predicted by the model.
The exercise was not repeated for Hugo North ore.
Because the equations developed are generic, good agreement is to be expected on any 
ore fed to the same circuit configuration, which is within the range of comminution indices 
presented by the majority of Southwest zone ore. Figure 13.1 shows the correlation between 
SPI and MBI, the two strongest determinants of capacity, for Central zone comminution 
samples, and Figure 13.2 shows the range of all 336 comminution samples as a cumulative 
frequency distribution of SPI and MBI. Also plotted are the distributions of 137 samples from 
Hugo North testing in 2007, a further 82 samples from the more northerly set tested in 2011, 
and 74 Central samples – these data are discussed in more detail in Section 13.3.3. All the 
Hugo North samples fall within the Southwest zone range tested and modelled, while half of 
Central zone ore samples fall within the Southwest zone SPI data range.

These correlations effectively describe the capacity and the product sizing from the Phase 1 
circuit and will not be improved upon unless operational experience indicates that fine-
tuning of the constants with actual operating data is required. It is an empirical, power-based 
method that allows capacities and product sizings with different ores to be estimated from 
the same constants and exponents applied to new comminution parameters, as long as the 
SAG circuit configuration and closing screen aperture are kept constant. These equations 
assume that the SAG mill can be kept near full loading on soft ore (e.g. with a high 
percentage of Central zone ore).

With the planned feed change to softer and higher grade underground Hugo North ore, the 
mill volumetric constraint becomes one of concentrate handling and tailings handling 
capacities. The volumetric capacity limit is a capped throughput at 5.5 ktph (44.3 Mtpa, 
121 ktpd), this value is derived from tailings capacity.
The constraint is experienced on Central zone chalcocite and covellite ores in 2036 and 2037 
when Central zone ore exceeds 40% of the feed and the balance is primarily Hugo North ore.
The projected P80 for flotation feed with and without the conversion Ball Mill 5 are shown in 
Figure 13.3. During the Hugo North years 2020–2036 it is projected that the flotation feed will 
be slightly above the optimum P80 for Hugo North. However, the flotation test results indicate 
little sensitivity for recovery in the expected range of grind sizes. The effect of a change in 
SAG:ball mill power ratio has been estimated by taking the original flotation feed P80 
predicted by the Minnovex equation and adding the kWh/t change in ball mill energy 
applied to the tonnage processed, resulting in a finer flotation feed P80 than for the reference 
case.
The prediction of throughput and transfer size is fundamental to the mine planning process 
and is the basic determinant of annual production capacity. It is also fundamental to 
predicting the capacities of the operation in a variable ore source environment. However, it is 
necessary to validate the predictions in early operation so that they can either continue to 
be used with increased confidence; or if the predictive power is poor, be replaced by a 
better system.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Plant surveys were carried out in November 2013 and survey samples were submitted for 
comminution testing. This allowed correlation of plant capacity against ore body 
characteristics. Besides SPI, MBI, and crushing index (Ci) measurements, other tests performed 
on the samples included the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JK) drop-weight tests 
to evaluate potential alternative predictive methods.
It was concluded that the actual SAG mill capacity in Surveys 1 and 2 was in excess of the 
generic model by about 10%, when corrected for charge level. In addition, the SAG mill 
appeared to be producing more fines than anticipated, leading to a finer P80 in flotation 
feed than expected. The surveys recorded P80 values of 130–150 µm on relatively hard ore 
with a work index of 22.6 kWh/t, Ci of 19.5, and SPI of 117.3. These parameters are at the 40th 
percentile for Southwest zone ore SPI, but at the 80th percentile for Hugo North SPI and 
above the 90th percentile for both orebodies for MBI. With the same material, the generic 
model used in the mine plan would have predicted a P80 of 218 µm.
Due to the difficulties in representative sampling of coarse SAG mill feed and the impact of 
belt cuts on survey stability, these results must still be considered indicative, but encouraging, 
for Phase 2 performance. Sensitivity analysis to JK drop-weight parameters around Survey 2 
was also carried out by simulation. When the survey hardness parameters were replaced with 
values representing the softest and hardest Southwest zone ores, SAG capacity increased by 
19% and decreased by 15.5%, respectively, while achieving product P80 values of 130–134 µm. 
This is in line with the capacities indicated by the generic capacity prediction model, 
although P80 appears to be more conservatively estimated by the Minnovex model.
The number of samples and tests for each orebody is listed in Table 13.1. The major recent 
additions are as follows:
  Twenty variability composites from 72 holes throughout the Hugo North block cave, for 
abrasion index and crusher work index. Sub-samples were taken for mineralogy, head 
grade, and rougher flotation testing.
  Thirteen variability samples from Central zone, selected based on copper mineralogy, 
pyrite grade, and location, for Bond ball mill, Bond rod mill, and crusher work index. A 
blended sample of covellite ores was taken for JK tests, and flotation tests were carried 
out on samples categorised as chalcocite, covellite and chalcopyrite, based on 
dominant copper speciation.
  Seven composites from the Southwest zone, designed to represent the first seven years of
the mine’s life, subjected to mineralogy and flotation testing. Two master composites 
represent the years when Southwest zone ore is processed individually and then as a 
blend with Hugo North.

The Phase 1 design has been based on Southwest zone ore with up to 9.0% mixture of early 
Hugo North ore. No further testwork has been carried out on Southwest zone ore since IDP09, 
other than the following:
  QEMSCAN on overall Southwest zone composites to provide simulation inputs for regrind
optimisation for fluorine rejection to inform the final number of Phase 1 regrind mills.
  Roughing and cleaning tests to produce representative tailings materials for humidity cell
testing on Southwest zone, Hugo North, and Central zone ore types and blends.
  Physical simulation of process water and measurement of process water quality by taking
raw water from the borefield and applying an equivalent number of grinding and 
flotation water exchanges as applied at the full-scale water balance.
  Determining the impact of simulated process water on flotation performance.
  Bulk solids handling testwork on Southwest zone concentrate to inform the Phase 1 and
Phase 2 bagging plant designs.
  Production of Southwest zone composites representing early ore to assist in
commissioning.
  Production of Southwest zone composites representing 25% and 50% Hugo North
admixture for locked cycle tests.
With the completion of the Phase 1 design for Southwest zone ore, the primary design focus 
for sample selection for the study was better definition of the northern third of the Hugo North 
Lift 1 block cave envelope, as can be seen from a comparison of the charts in Figure 13.4.
Cave initiation is in the vicinity of 4,767,700 mN and 651,650 mE. Ore located south of 
4,766,800 mN would not report to the current block cave drawpoints, but would be mined as 
a separate Hugo South block cave.
Comminution test sampling density is given in Table 13.2.
The sample density on a life-of-mine basis was doubled in the Hugo North block cave 
compared to the open pit orebodies because of the inability to re-sample a block cave by 
drilling once fragmentation has commenced. Sample density in the open pit orebodies is
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 155 of 519
2–4 times higher in the early production years than for the life-of-mine as a whole, and as 
such meets the criteria normally applied in the SPI methodology for new orebodies.

A secondary focus of the study was better definition of the life-of-mine response of the 
Central zone, which will be processed with Hugo North and Southwest zone ores. A plan view 
and sections of Central zone comminution composite sample locations are presented in 
Figure 13.5.
Little additional comminution work was done on Central zone ore in this phase of study 
because prior work had shown that the Central zone indices were uniformly low for both SPI 
and MBI, resulting in volumetric limitation of the flotation circuits at the plant design tonnage 
before the SAG mill or flotation feed sizing limits were met. There is a trend of increasing 
hardness with depth. Owing to the reasonably good correlation between SPI and MBI for 
Central zone ore, as shown in Figure 13.6, there is potential to use the grind times in flotation 
testwork to infer hardness in SPI terms.

The earlier Hugo North comminution dataset was populated more densely to the south of the 
prior block cave envelope. The cave initiation point subsequently moved north to the 
orebody inflexion point to access a high gold core that has recently accounted for more 
value at higher long-term gold price projections (Table 13.3).

The 2011 dataset is compared to the prior dataset and the combined dataset in Figure 13.2. 
TPUT and P80 are derived from the generic Minnovex formulae and reflect the hypothetical 
situation where Lines 1–2 are fed with 100% Hugo North ore.
Comparison of the combined dataset with the previous dataset indicates a 5.0% reduction in 
the predicted capacity to 5,279 tph from 5,557 tph, compared to that currently attributed in 
the block model. This potential bias has been corrected by inclusion of the 82 sample results 
in the Hugo North block model update for OTFS14.
Minnovex Modified Bond index results were checked against the Standard Bond Index test on 
18 samples, with generally good agreement, moderate scatter, and no evidence of bias. This
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 159 of 519
indicated that the MBI results can be used to populate the block model and wherever else 
Standard Bond index results may be required, as in the calculation of incremental ball milling 
requirements.
A large number of direct and indirect mineralogical assessments have been carried out on 
ore and flotation products, in the following categories:
  Routine thin sections on intervals of core in conjunction with logging to qualitatively
assess the nature of the copper mineral and gangue mineral assemblage.
  Routine semi-quantitative clay mineral measurements by infrared spectroscopy to assist
in alteration classification and to potentially identify rheology-modifying species that 
could be problematic in processing.
  Visual logging of all core with respect to estimated sulfide mineral totals.
  Mineralogical assessment of ore sections from all orebodies by Terra Mineralogical
Services (TMS), including analysis of gold association, fluorine deportment in ore and 
concentrate, copper mineral associations in tailing, and leach residues (49 reports and 
memos from 2002–2005).
  The production by TMS of a spatial ‘metallurgical index’ block model of metallurgical 
degree of difficulty, primarily for the Southwest and Central zones, but also with some 
coverage of Hugo North (Far North Extension as then known).
  Diagnostic leach work on oxide and secondary copper zones to distinguish between
chalcocite, chalcopyrite, and covellite.
  QEMSCAN on particulate Southwest and Hugo North composites (flotation feed and
rougher concentrates).
  Full QEMSCAN analysis on all 20 flotation feed composites from Hugo North and Central
zone testwork programmes (Blue Coast/SGS).
  X-ray diffraction and QEMSCAN on composites of flotation tailings produced for NAF/PAF
characterisation.
  Mineralogy inferable from the 48-element ICP assays on 24,000 intervals over all deposits.
  Liberation analysis by conventional particle counts on Heruga.
A graphical summary of QEMSCAN results for the 20 Hugo North composites, are given in 
Figure 13.7.

The first graph in Figure 13.7 displays mineral abundance by weight in the feed, summing to 
100%. Sulfides are at the bottom in the stacked chart, with pyrite in red. Pyrite is only present 
at significant levels in three of 20 composites and when present is usually accompanied by 
higher-than-average levels of copper sulfides, which leads to easier separation. Little dilution 
of concentrate by pyrite has been observed in previous flotation work, as expected from this 
mineralogy.
Copper sulfides plus pyrite rarely form more than 10% of the total weight, with chalcopyrite, 
bornite, and chalcocite/covellite present at 3.9%, 2.7%, and 0.04%, respectively by weight. 
Quartz is the dominant rock-forming mineral (46% on average), followed by sericite mica 
(24%), chlorite (3.0%), and feldspar (5.0%). Clays account for 1.0%–18% of the mineral 
components in the composites, but average less than 5.0% overall. The broad footprint of the 
cave is likely to minimise daily variation in clay content to very manageable levels in the 
grinding and flotation circuits.
Oxides, primarily of iron (magnetite, hematite, and goethite), average only 2.8% and 
carbonates 5.4%. The former are too low to provide much benefit from magnetite recovery, 
while the latter present useful buffering capacity to minimise acid mine drainage from 
tailings. Apatite is present at 0.6 wt%, and is moderately variable. It can locally form a 
significant source of fluorine in feed and thus, by entrainment, in concentrate. Overall, the 
previous work has indicated less fluorine contributed by apatite, than by sericite and fluorite.
The second graph shows the relative contributions of chalcopyrite, bornite, and 
chalcocite/covellite to the total copper content of the feed. Due to its high stoichiometric 
grade, on average bornite contributes 52.3% of the copper, followed by 45.5% from 
chalcopyrite, only 1.1% from chalcocite/covellite, and 1.2% from other copper sulfides. The 
latter will also include the sulfosalts tennantite and, to a much lesser degree, tetrahedrite. The 
former is the predominant arsenic source for Hugo North and is difficult to depress, even at 
high pH. In Central zone ore, arsenic reports to concentrate at 78% of the copper recovery 
and is likely to be similarly related in Hugo North. The high bornite content implies a limiting 
average grade of 46% copper in concentrate. The metallurgical correlations from flotation 
testwork include the dilution contributed by pyrite flotation, by entrained free gangue 
minerals, and by incomplete liberation of both minerals from the copper sulfides. This results in 
an average 35% reduction in copper grade below the theoretical limit established by 
quantitative mineralogy.
Incomplete liberation also results in incomplete copper sulfide recovery, as indicated by the 
lowest pair of graphs. The left graph shows the rougher feed cumulative liberation yield (CLY) 
profile. A copper-sulfide mineral grade versus incremental recovery plot is obtained by 
including progressively less-liberated particles from the lower right to the upper left, until all 
copper sulfide containing particles have been included, at the 100% recovery axis. At 
roughing sizes from P80 110–220 µm, there is a fair degree of variation in liberation level, which 
is only partially independent of the P80 variation from the different sample work indices. 
Hugo North composites HN1 and HN8 are softer, finer, but less well-liberated, while HN18 and 
HN19 are harder, coarser, and also less well-liberated. The average Hugo North rougher 
flotation grade-recovery point (96%–12% Cu or 26% copper sulfides) is included for reference, 
at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical target lines. It is comfortably to the left of any 
of the 20 CLY curves, allowing room to include significant dilution resulting from the 10% mass 
yield to rougher concentrate that occurs naturally from gangue entrained in water in froth 
after 30 minutes of continuous froth removal.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 162 of 519
All but four of the 20 composites intersect the 100% recovery axis between 30%–45% copper 
sulfides, which is at the bottom of the normal range of liberation for porphyry copper 
processing. Lower plant recoveries are to be expected for the other four composites, with 
only 20%–25% copper sulfides when 100% of the copper distribution is included. The data also 
demonstrates the importance of regrinding, compared to other, better-liberated porphyry 
copper deposits, where regrind circuits are sometimes considered an optional extra. If a 90% 
liberation level is considered necessary for the production of marketable concentrate, as is 
usual, then overall copper recovery in roughing would have to be restricted to 80%–85%, if 
the regrind circuit were shut down, compared to 93% overall with regrind. This assumes that 
the normal offset between theoretical CLY distribution and actual plant recovery 
performance applies.
The right-hand graph shows the same data for the cleaner feed size distribution, at a P80 of 
45 µm. This is constructed from a weighted average of the data for separate –38 µm and 
–106 +38 µm fractions. The degree of liberation after regrinding to the target Hugo North size 
distribution is much higher than in roughing and the variability much reduced. All but two of 
the 20 composites meet the 100% copper distribution axis at 65%–85% copper sulfides and the 
concentrate is 90%–96% liberated at the 97% cleaner recovery target. The two composites 
that have liberation challenges are HN1 and HN8, which also showed sub-normal liberation in 
roughing. Referring to Table 13.4, the copper assays for both composites are below 1.0%, so 
that not much copper distribution is at risk. They are unlikely to present more than 5.0% of the 
draw at any given time.
The mineralogy of the Central zone composites, Figure 13.8, shows more complex sulfide 
speciation, significant levels of copper present as arsenic-bearing enargite, much higher 
pyrite content (8.0%–24%) and much finer and more variable grain sizes at rougher and 
cleaner feed sizes. Bornite is minor in all zones and chalcopyrite is predominant in the Central 
chalcopyrite zone, represented by composite C13 and also by composites C6 and C7. In the 
other composites, most of the copper is present as covellite, followed by chalcocite, then by 
chalcopyrite, enargite and bornite.
It is possible to produce Central zone concentrate of 25% grade and 75% recovery by use of 
very high pH in cleaning. These levels are shown in copper sulfide grade and cleaner stage 
recovery terms in the cleaner feed liberation graph. However, the use of lime to pH 12 at 
25 µm to depress/liberate pyrite is very expensive and is untested in blends with majority Hugo 
North ore to reflect the conversion case, further high pH is expected to depress copper and 
final gold recoveries for Hugo North ores and so Central zone ores will be processed instead 
at Hugo North conditions.

The samples selected in the latest confirmatory programme of work on the northern area of 
Hugo North are shown in Table 13.4 and Table 13.5. The confirmatory work better investigated 
low pH conditions for Central zone ore flotation of composites that were both spatially and 
mineralogically discrete in terms of sulfide speciation. It also generated flotation results for 
Hugo North composites, which displayed the full range of copper head grades, gangue 
mineralogy/alteration, and for which comminution characteristics had been defined in 
SPI/MBI/Ci terms.

The locations of the additional flotation samples are aligned with the Hugo North 
comminution samples. Spatial variability composites for flotation were generated from three 
to seven interleaved sub-samples of the core intervals selected for the comminution samples. 
These are designated by points of a common colour on Figure 13.4. The new Hugo North 
flotation samples are described in Table 13.4. Selection criteria for compositing were primarily 
spatial, with fairly tight groupings that could be tracked via similar height-of-draw. However, 
the process managed to differentiate a wide range of head grades for head grade-recovery 
relationship development and also managed to classify partly by alteration type.
Plan views and sections of Central zone flotation composite sample locations are presented 
in Figure 13.9 and Figure 13.10, respectively. These samples were selected solely on the basis 
of flotation characteristics rather than comminution characteristics, since these are likely to 
be a greater constraint in operation than the latter. Central zone flotation samples were 
selected for compositing for variability testwork, as shown in Table 13.5, and were 
differentiated by dominant copper mineralogy and pyrite content to characterise the major 
performance drivers. Sample selection also retained some spatial separation to allow future 
refinement of the block model performance predictions by zone.

Flotation feed sizing in the block model outputs is established by the SAG mill / ball mill power 
split and the ratio between SPI and MBI for Southwest zone, Central zone, and Hugo North. As 
discussed earlier, a correction is required for the addition of Ball Mill 5. The economic 
optimum flotation feed sizes are summarised in Table 13.6. These values have been 
approached quite closely by the grinding circuit design and production schedule predictions 
via the hardness parameters in the block model, which allows the continued use of the IDOP 
metallurgical predictions for Hugo North and Southwest zone with minor corrections of the 
latter for recent operating experience. The size-by-size Aminpro grind‒recovery optimisation 
approach is described in Section 13.4.1.3 on the flotation capacity modelling.

In the absence of penalty element liberation problems, the coarsest regrind sizing that 
achieves 90% liberation of copper sulfides in cleaner feed is generally considered a good 
estimate of the optimal regrind level in plant operation. Hugo North ore has showed uniformly 
lower fluorine levels than Southwest zone ore in concentrate from locked-cycle testwork. In 
testwork, one-third of the Hugo North concentrates would exceed the 300 ppm fluorine 
penalty level. Penalties between the 300 ppm penalty threshold and the 1,000 ppm rejection 
level are insufficient to repay much investment.
The Aminpro work also used Southwest, Hugo North, and Entrée kinetic flotation work by PRA 
in Vancouver to develop flotation simulation models in roughing and in cleaning that could 
be calibrated against the kinetic work and used to simulate the effects of ore type, copper 
head grade, primary grind level, rougher pH, regrind level, and cleaner pH.
In general, the following trends were observed:
  With sufficient collector adjustment, copper recovery is insensitive to pH within broad
ranges (pH 7to 11).
  Gold recovery is adversely affected by lime addition (both pH and Ca++ concentration 
above pH 9) and is not as responsive to additional collector. This has influenced a slower 
ramp-up of Central zone pit development in OTFS14 until high-gold Hugo North ore has 
been processed (2022‒2024). Gravity gold recovery is a possible contingency to recover 
slow-floating gold, while unit cell operation on regrind cyclone underflow is a possible 
means of preventing as much gold from becoming slow-floating by reducing over 
grinding.
  Additional collector and retention time is required at high copper head grades (feed
forward strategy required to link collector addition to copper metal units in flotation 
feed).
  Better copper grade‒recovery response and pyrite rejection are typically achieved with 
dithiophosphinate collector (3418A) than with any single xanthate (isopropyl, isobutyl, or 
amyl). However, xanthate storage and mixing facilities have been provided for potential 
synergistic addition with secondary gold collectors. The Blue Coast testwork completed in 
2012 indicated a slight advantage in copper and gold recovery with potassium amyl 
xanthate. The results were not conclusive, however, against the comparative 3418A tests 
conducted at higher rougher concentrate grades.
  Additional cleaner collector is required at finer regrinds and higher pH values.
  There is a benefit from staged addition of collector.
  Rougher flotation kinetics might be slower at low pulp potential (eH). In recent
confirmatory testwork, rougher flotation response was delayed until the flotation pulp 
potential (absolute) was above 0 millivolts. This trend was exacerbated by even modest 
lime additions, because increasing pH reduces eH. It is possible that this observation is a 
reflection of batch testwork and not representative of a continuous flow system. The 
cyclone overflow eH in almost all concentrators (except those treating ores with 
extremely high pyrite content, or an active pyrite or pyrrhotite content) is routinely in the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 169 of 519
range of 0–50 mV, with no specific chemical interventions or additional aeration in the 
grinding circuit. Even the most-pyritic Oyu Tolgoi ores have less than 15% pyrite content, 
which is not chemically active. If low eH is encountered, then additional aeration may be 
warranted. There is space to retrofit conditioners or aeration devices of a few minutes’ 
capacity on the ball mill floor below the cyclones. In this event, it might also be 
necessary to retrofit an additional pumping stage, for which the grinding basement has 
sufficient space.
Testwork to assess the effect of water quality on flotation has been conducted since IDOP. A 
bore water composite was collected from the Gunii Hooloi bore field as a simple average of 
samples from individual wells. Testwork was conducted at SGS, with Vancouver tap water 
used as a control. The testwork indicated that, for Southwest zone ore, recycle water was 
favourable to the copper grade-recovery curve at lower grades (possibly due to collector 
recycle), but unfavourable to copper recovery at higher grades. One year of experience at 
Oyu Tolgoi has shown no ill-effects from using process water.
The selection of flotation design criteria for mechanical cells in the concentrator conversion 
has taken account of the following information:
  The laboratory bench kinetic testwork at Ammtec in roughing and cleaning, while 
achieving the rougher and cleaner overall stage recoveries required by the mass 
balance.
  The review of flotation kinetics by Aminpro and the results of the Minemaster model for
Hugo North and Central zone ores. Column cell and mechanical requirements were 
confirmed at both 30 µm and 40 µm grinds by Aminpro simulations around results from 
PRA kinetic flotation test programmes carried out in Vancouver.
  Comparison with cell capacity allocations for Lines 1–2 in Phase 1, before and after an
additional rougher bank.
Aminpro evaluated the kinetic tests carried out at PRA in Vancouver to determine rate 
constants (k) and maximum recoveries (Rmax). These values formed the basis of the detailed 
design of the Phase 1 flotation circuit design. Two examples of the output for Southwest zone 
ore rougher flotation are given in Figure 13.11 and reflect FLEET methodology (FKT and VSKT 
tests). The curves shown represent fitting of rougher timed recovery results for four particle size 
fractions for each mineral (+150, –150+75, –75+25, and 25 µm). The rougher work was carried 
out on Southwest, Central, Hugo North, and Entrée composites. Similar results are available at 
+32, –32+25, –25+20, and –20 µm in cleaning for Entrée ore (Hugo North extension).
The mineral contents are developed from indicator assays (Au, Ag, F, Cu, Mo, and Fe, As, S) 
and balanced to 100%.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 170 of 519
Changing the flotation P80 changes the weighting in each of the size fractions, which in turn 
alters grade-recovery curves. As in the Ammtec evaluation, the additional operating and 
capital costs associated with increased grinding were set against the additional revenue 
from copper and gold recovery. This was extended to the cleaner circuit and repeated for 
each ore type. This exercise was not repeated in the feasibility study for the concentrator 
conversion design, but rather retention times were specified from laboratory tests and 
compared with the capacities and retention times specified for Phase 1.
After the addition of the extra rougher bank for the conversion, rougher retention times and 
froth carrying capacities will be near those used in Phase 1. Currently the mechanical 
cleaners are handling a higher-than-expected flow due to low column stage recovery (20% 
versus 60% design). The mechanical cleaners, which are not being expanded, will have 
slightly shorter retention time and increased froth loading compared to Phase 1. The high 
recirculation of column cleaner tails observed in Phase 1 is not projected to persist when 
treating the high-grade Hugo North ore with 10 column cells in place of four in Phase 1.
The initial selection of column cell capacities for the expansion was factored from the Phase 1 
design and the Minemaster modelling. The Phase 1 columns are currently operating at a 
copper stage recovery near 20%. It is projected that when treating Hugo North ore the 
recoveries will be above the Phase 1 design of 40% due to coarser regrind (45 µm versus 
35 µm) and lower upgrade ratios. The column cell expansion was determined by froth-
carrying capacity rather than retention time. The Phase 1 column cell dimensions were 
retained for the six additional concentrator conversion cells.

Testwork has not focused on generating large volumes of concentrate and tailings for 
thickening and filtration testwork, as was carried out for Southwest Oyu ore. To allow for a 
conservative design, the same unit thickener capacities have been used for concentrate 
thickening as in Phase 1, despite the coarser regrind targets.
The same is true in the final tailings area, where the dewatering duty for blended Southwest, 
Central, and Hugo North tailings is similar to Phase 1. Phase 1 thickener optimisation is still in its 
infancy, but significant reductions in flocculant addition (from 30–20 g/t) have recently been 
achieved, while improving underflow density.
Phase 1 adopted conservative design margins in thickener unit area, which can be further 
enhanced by higher flocculant addition. In a recent operating period in which one thickener 
was out of service, the remaining thickener was operated at rates to 75 ktpd. It is unlikely that 
the conversion will push the existing thickeners to capacity. As a contingency measure in 
detailed design, more thickener area is available at locations that the original Fluor design 
had reserved for two additional tailings thickeners. Such additions would be motivated by 
operating experience on Southwest zone ore.
Phase 1 filtration performance has performed to specification. Filtration has been trouble-
free, allowing a very straightforward scale-up for the conversion, which includes the addition 
of two more identical filters. Industrial experience indicates that cake formation rates will 
increase by 14% due to the envisaged coarser Phase 2 regrind (45 µm vs. 35 µm). A location 
for a fifth pressure filter has been reserved in the layout as a contingency against a further 
20% increase in peak filtration duty.
It is recommended that further Hugo North tailings thickening and concentrate pressure 
filtration testwork at 0.1 m2 scale be conducted before detailed design, but after 
underground development has progressed, to allow lower cost acquisition of larger-diameter 
core samples from a greater number of access points. Phase 1 operating performance will 
continue to be monitored.
The current models used for metallurgical performance and throughput estimation are 
presented in Table 13.7 to Table 13.11. The key changes from DIDOP include:
  A change in the grade-recovery point for Southwest ore, with a 1.5% absolute decrease
in copper assay in concentrate and a corresponding 1.8% absolute increase in copper 
recovery at mean copper and Cu:S ratio in feed.
  A reduction in gold recovery for Southwest ore. The relationship between gold and
copper recovery was validated as shown below:
-  BDT29 (DIDOP / initial Phase 1:   Au Recovery(%) = 0.8 x Cu Recovery(%) + 9.8
-  BDT31 (OTFS14 / revised Phase 1): Au Recovery(%) = 0.8 x Cu Recovery(%) + 4.8
  Similar relationships between gold and copper recovery being recommended for the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 172 of 519
Central ores. The relationships are similar in nature to that shown above for Southwest ore 
gold recovery. The 4.8 intercept is maintained, but the copper recovery multipliers 
(gradients) replace the 0.8 factor for Southwest zone. The new recommended gradients 
are chalcocite (0.70) and Central zone covellite (0.65) with chalcopyrite remaining the 
same as Southwest zone (0.8).
  Reductions in the ‘a’ constant multiplier term in copper recovery from Central zone
chalcocite (–10%), covellite (–5.0%), and chalcopyrite (–10%) to account for blended 
feed operations at Hugo North optimised parameters.
  Reductions in concentrate grades from Central zone chalcocite (–5.0%), covellite (–
5.0%), and chalcopyrite (–1.5%), which were also required to shift the overall grade-
recovery curve for blended feed operations at parameters optimised for Hugo North ore 
(primary grind P80, regrind P80, and cleaner pH).
The parameters used for Hugo North were also applied to the Entrée ore, which is a 
continuation of the same orebody beyond the Oyu Tolgoi lease boundary. Additional 
testwork conducted in 2012 on 20 Hugo North composites did not materially affect 
comminution or recovery estimates, given the greater volume of earlier work and the use of 
fresh core. The Hugo North core for the Blue Coast testwork at SGS was stored outside (at 
ambient conditions, but kept dry) for six years before selection, crushing, and freezer storage 
at SGS. Similarly, the Central zone core was stored outside for eight to ten years before 
testing. While local conditions are relatively non-conducive to oxidation, it is possible that 
flotation response suffered as a result. It is recommended that fresh core from the 23 drillholes 
from the 2013 infill drilling programme be preserved in frozen storage as a precaution.
The formulae in Table 13.7 to Table 13.11 have been incorporated in interim operating cost 
estimates for cut-off determination purposes. The throughput algorithms are used for 
scheduling the MP2014 mine plan in OTFS14. The higher ratio of ball mill power after the 
concentrator conversion is modelled by applying an additional stage of ball milling on the 
original flotation feed sizing predicted by the Minnovex model.

Arsenic and fluorine are the only penalty elements that have been identified in the Reserve 
Case orebodies. Enargite is the primary arsenic carrier in all orebodies, although tennantite is 
locally important.
High flotation pH is the primary mineral processing control on arsenic recovery, but it is only 
partially effective because of the difficulty in depressing enargite and the related copper 
losses. In addition, high pH has an adverse impact on gold recovery and is therefore not 
expected to be used often.
Fluorine distribution in concentrates is more variable, being locally present as coarser-grained 
fluorite or finely intergrown topaz in some high-fluorine areas, but with a background level 
distributed as 0.6%–2.0% fluorine in sericite, which itself represents 15%–30% of the weight of all 
orebodies. Regrind level and the degree of entrained gangue removal are the primary 
control mechanisms for fluorine.
As long as concentrator feed is managed such that rejection levels are avoided, the modest 
impact of fluorine and arsenic penalties averaging less than $5/t of concentrate. To handle 
production peaks while maintaining a base load for contract, a certain amount of the 
Oyu Tolgoi concentrate production has been considered for sale to traders for subsequent 
blending. This could be an avenue for disposal of high-penalty element concentrates.
For arsenic in copper concentrate, the production model assigns a rate of 
$2/tonne/1,000 ppm above a 3,000 ppm threshold up to the rejection level of 5,000 ppm. For 
fluorine, the production model assigns a rate of $2/tonne/100 ppm above a 300 ppm
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 174 of 519
threshold up to the rejection level of 1,000 ppm. The penalties are in line with terms from 
custom smelters. However, it has been reported that no fluorine penalties have been applied 
under the contract terms in operation since sales commenced in late 2013, so some 
conservatism is inherent in the Net Smelter Return (NSR) estimates.
Previous analyses of Hugo North and Southwest zone ore data from locked-cycle test results 
are shown in Figure 13.12, where the blue line describes the formula used for predicting 
fluorine in concentrate for all ore types in IDP10, IDOP, and now OTFS14 (Table 13.12). The 
testwork results support the fluorine content of concentrates from the Central zone and Hugo 
North orebodies. For Central zone ore, the fluorine assay in concentrate from 82 batch 
cleaner variability tests was predicted to be 0.153 (adjusted to pass through origin) of the 
fluorine assay in feed (green line).
Fluorine and arsenic predictions for all ore types for MP2014 are as shown in Table 13.12.

The fluorine grade in final concentrate from Southwest zone ore has been almost twice what 
would have been projected from the relationship above based on batch test and locked-
cycle results. It is suspected that the especially good fluorine rejection in the lab work is a 
function of a generally finer P80 than currently targeted in plant operation (P80 of 25 µm vs. 
35 µm) and partly because the bead mill used in batch mode in Ammtec laboratory work 
had a very steep size distribution, with most of the top 20 wt% very close in size to the P80. In 
the past, size-by-size fluorine analysis of the final Southwest zone concentrate has indicated a 
rapid increase in fluorine at coarser sizes.
As a result of this trend, and the use of tower mills and the coarser regrind in future, it was 
decided to increase the factor from 0.15 to 0.3 for all ore types to account for the plant 
response. This has not presented a problem with rejection limit in the production schedules.
Given its less-variable mineralogy and positive association with copper minerals, arsenic in 
concentrate should be predictable with greater precision than fluorine. The relationship in 
Table 13.12 was derived from locked-cycle tests for Hugo North and Southwest zone ores and 
was used for all ores in IDOP. It has been retained for OTFS14 and relates arsenic in 
concentrate directly to arsenic in feed, with a negligible intercept at normal arsenic levels. 
Because the mineralogy has indicated that arsenic is largely contained in copper sulfosalts 
(primarily enargite), which recover almost as well as the primary copper minerals, this result 
also requires that the As:Cu ratio in concentrate differs from the ratio in feed only by the ratio 
of arsenic to copper recovery.
A simpler correlation was originally developed on Central zone ore for 49 batch cleaner 
variability tests from chalcocite, covellite, and chalcopyrite zones (Figure 13.13). The 
correlation is of acceptable quality but has much greater scatter than for the Hugo North 
and Southwest zone data and has a gradient of 24 rather than 21.
The updated hypothesis described above was tested by correlating As:Cu ratios in feed and 
concentrate for the same data in Figure 13.14. A much better correlation was obtained. The 
gradient of 0.78 infers that the arsenic recovery predicted for Central zone ore is 78% of the 
copper recovery.
Although this relationship is expected to hold for all ores at Oyu Tolgoi, with enargite being 
the predominant arsenic carrier in all cases, there is a persistent over-estimation of the arsenic 
in final concentrate from current Southwest ore. As a result, the recovery ratio constant was 
reduced to 0.125 to match the current arsenic levels in concentrate.

separate concentrate, but does have value for Heruga in the life-of-mine case. Concentrate 
production volumes are dominated by the increasing contribution from Hugo North from 2020 
onwards.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 178 of 519
Copper assay varies with higher grade Hugo North production and increased bornite content 
early in the block cave. The peak grades from underground bornite are moderated by 
simultaneous treatment of large amounts of Central zone ore in 2022–2026. High copper 
content, especially high Cu:S ratio, is attractive to most smelters as it provides high copper 
yield while not taxing acid recovery and handling systems. The peak anticipated grades 
(MP2014) of near 35% Cu are projected in 2022 and 2023. The life-of-mine average after 
conversion is competitive with other imports to the Chinese market at 28% Cu. The minimum 
annual production grades of 23%–24% Cu in the last few years are less attractive, but are on 
a par with Erdenet product and represent small volumes far in the future.
Gold assay is much more variable, with early peaks in 2014 and 2019 coinciding with 
extraction of the high-gold core to the maximum depth for successive phases of the 
Southwest zone pit. A lower gold peak is obtained in 2023, reflecting early production from 
the high-gold zone of Hugo North. With open pit ore ramping up again in 2036, gold assay 
increases to a peak in 2049. Silver represents a much lower percentage of value and is 
elevated in the final years by virtue of a higher Ag:Cu ratio in feed. The significant variability in 
precious metals content may require shifts in concentrate allocations to smelters. Some 
smelters are better set up for precious metals recovery than others, thus making better 
margins relative to the amount of gold paid for.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 179 of 519
Arsenic and fluorine are penalty elements, but the terms have relatively little economic 
impact. At high levels in concentrate, smelters are unable to deal acceptably with arsenic 
and fluorine and, rather than a penalty, their presence becomes a basis for rejecting the 
concentrate. The Chinese State inspection agency also monitors quality and enforces 
national limits. Consequently, the primary concern is staying well clear of the rejection limits, 
and retaining the ability to respond to a potential decrease in the rejection limit if 
environmental standards become more stringent.
Predicted levels of fluorine and arsenic in concentrate resulting from simultaneous processing 
of all the ore types according to the MP2014 production plan are shown in Figure 13.17 and 
Figure 13.18.
For each element, the annual mean level and the maximum level expected in a 5.0 kt 
shipment is estimated. Due to the differing sources of variation and measures available to 
control it, maximum fluorine is assessed at 1.2 times the annual average level, while maximum 
arsenic is assessed at 1.3 times the annual average. The fluorine variation allowed is based on 
an analysis of variation in Southwest production to date.
Average concentrate production is usually in a possible penalty position with regard to 
fluorine, if typical terms were applied. However, current shipments are not attracting a 
penalty and peak shipment levels still retain a minimum 10%–20% margin below the rejection 
level (1,000 ppm).
Average concentrate production will occasionally attract arsenic penalties when Central 
zone ores forms a significant fraction of feed. Arsenic maintains a minimum 30% margin to the 
rejection level.
Both fluorine and arsenic are modelled in the mine plan and neither element is expected to 
present significant long-term marketing difficulties. However, the primary control over fluorine 
rejection is in the hands of the concentrator, while the primary control over arsenic is by long-
term planning and short-term grade control at the open pit mine. In Phase 1 and Phase 2, 
sufficient blending capacity exists in the concentrate slurry storage tanks (5–10 kt) and in the 
load-out shed (25 kt) to mitigate most process upsets affecting fluorine in a 5.0 kt smelter 
shipment. Such upsets would include loss of regrind efficiency or capacity or loss of control 
over column cleaner operation. Longer-term excursions in arsenic content in feed could be 
managed by maintaining a larger-than-usual inventory of higher arsenic as bagged product 
at the site and scheduling its release over a longer time.
Depression of arsenic by elevated pH in cleaning is not particularly effective and would 
affect gold recovery from Southwest zone and Hugo North ores. It would be a less-expensive 
measure whenever Central zone chalcocite and covellite ores predominate, when gold 
grades are much lower. Optimised cleaning schemes for Southwest zone and Central zone 
ores are possible when processed sequentially, but this is not possible in a mine plan 
optimised around aligning the grinding and volumetric capacity limits.

In addition to conventional payable and penalty elements, smelters are also interested in 
non-payable elements from which they may derive by-product credits (rhenium, mercury, 
selenium). There are also components that may be penalised in certain cases depending on 
other sources of smelter feed and their levels (bismuth, thallium). Other critical, non-penalty 
elements not tracked by the Oyu Tolgoi production model are also of importance in assessing 
a smelter’s productive capacity (sulfur via the acid plant) or its operating costs and slag 
chemistry (Al, Ca, Mg, SiO2, Fe). Such elements can be assayed directly in production year 
composites, or their overall variation inferred from other indicator assays or mineralogy. 
Finally, the particle size and the moisture of the concentrate are required to assess the 
dusting and bulk handling characteristics in the feed preparation and gas handling areas.
The expected means and ranges of these parameters are presented in Table 13.13. None of 
the parameters listed would appear to give smelters cause for concern. The ranges are 
necessarily wide to reflect the assay results from a variety of ore types treated over an 
extended life-of-mine. They also vary due to the uncertainty in their recoveries to 
concentrate.

The process decisions made in OTFS14 will affect the quality of the concentrates produced. In 
particular, processing the Central zone ores will increase arsenic content to levels that 
exceed penalty limits. The quality of concentrates that will result from the blended treatment 
of Central zone and Hugo North ores and, later, Central and Southwest zone ores can only 
be inferred from testwork and orebody knowledge. The performances from unblended ore 
composites of each type are known.
Final concentrate locked-cycle test concentrate assays were generated under conditions 
that follow those applied in Phase 1. Minor elements that were non-payable and non-penalty 
in nature were taken directly from the ranges observed in those tests. The major payable 
metal (Cu, Au) and penalty element (As, F) assay trends are best determined by applying the 
metallurgical prediction formulae for recoveries and final concentrate copper grade to the 
head grades predicted by the open pit and underground mining plans, block models, and 
dilution and mixing models.
Marketing studies produced by Rio Tinto Marketing are reported in Section 16.2.8.4. Sales 
contract terms were negotiated in 2012 and 2013. Phase 2 is beyond the range of any 
realistic contract commitments and must be evaluated in the context of the current and 
medium-term marketability of similar materials currently in the market. Product specification 
will generally become more attractive and volumes will increase as the tonnage of high-
grade Hugo North ore increases rapidly from 2020 onwards.
The high levels of arsenic in early Central zone ore will need to be managed by blending with 
the low-arsenic Hugo North ore, as has already been discussed. The projected annual and 
peak arsenic levels are presented in Figure 13.19. The arsenic content in final concentrate is a 
fairly direct function of As:Cu ratio in feed, and this parameter is one of the constraints in the 
mine production schedule.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 184 of 519
As Hugo North ore production ramps down after 2036, arsenic levels are projected to 
increase significantly, but the metallurgical models predict an average level of only 
2,900 ppm – substantially lower than the current rejection limit of 5,000 ppm. The open pit 
mine plan has used a lower internal limit of 3,000 ppm as a monthly average to avoid 
approaching rejection levels on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Contracts have been drafted 
so that payables and penalty elements are assessed on the weighted average of all lot 
assays in a 5.0 kt shipment.
Fluorine is projected to be above the usual penalty level but below the rejection limit 
throughout the mine life. Penalties are not always applied, but the 1,000 ppm rejection limit is 
legally enforceable. The expected level of fluorine in the concentrate is presented in 
Figure 13.20. Unlike arsenic, control of fluorine is primarily within the scope of processing rather 
than pit grade control. The spread between peak shipment assays and annual average 
levels is based on variation observed in the first year of operation.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Major constituent non-payable, non-penalty components such as Fe, S, silica, and alumina 
are important for smelter metal and mass balances and are predictable from the mineralogy 
of ore and concentrate. The balance of less-significant components (minor elements) each 
form less than 1.0% of the total weight. Typical values and expected ranges are reported in 
Table 13.13 in Section 13.5. Ranges have been predicted from the full elemental assays for 
concentrate from each ore type, based on achieving a 100% mineral and/or metal balance 
in final concentrate with the predicted mineralogy and the average minor element assays.
Unlike the payable and penalty grades, major and minor non-penalty / non-payable 
components are stated as ‘typical’ values and are not expected to be a source of contract 
dispute, although moisture ranges should be respected, even with bagged product, to 
minimise freight costs either to seller’s account (in Mongolia) or buyer’s account (in China). 
Allowances have been made for the greater variation to be expected in a 5.0 kt shipment 
(representing one day’s production at the Phase 2 peak) than in a monthly or annual 
average.

OT LLC produced 3D geological models of the major structures and lithological units based 
on the structural and geological information outlined in the geological discussion in this 
report. The geological shapes for the deposits are listed in Table 14.2 and Table 14.3.
For each deposit, appropriate copper and gold shells at various cut-off grades (Table 14.4) 
were also defined. These shapes were then edited on plan and section views to be consistent 
with the structural and lithological models and the drill assay data.
Checks on the structural, lithological, and grade shell models indicated that the shapes 
honoured the drillhole data and interpreted geology.

The lithological shapes and faults, together with copper and gold grade shells and deposit 
zones, constrain the grade analysis and interpolation. Typically the faults form the first order of 
hard boundaries constraining the lithological interpretation.
The solids and surfaces were used to code the drillhole data. Sets of plans and cross-sections 
that displayed colour-coded drillholes were plotted and inspected to ensure the proper 
assignment of domains to drillholes.
Domains were established using the codes outlined in Table 14.5, where the domain variable 
used in grade estimation was a four-digit integer code composed from the following fields in 
the composite database: deposit (DPOSIT), grade shell (GS_CU or GS_AU), lithology (FLAG), 
and supergene (SUPERG).
A third digit in the code was originally intended to accommodate a greater number of 
lithology codes, but currently remains unused.

Extreme (outlier) copper and gold grades were evaluated using histograms, probability, and 
cumulative distribution function plots.
No cap was applied to the copper for SOT estimation. For most domains, an outlier restriction, 
rather than grade capping, was applied to gold, silver, molybdenum, and arsenic during 
grade estimation. A 50 m isotropic outlier sample search distance was used during estimation 
for the main lithological units: Va, Ign, Qmd, and HWS. A 20 m x 20 m x 15 m isotropic outlier 
sample search distance was used during estimation for dykes.
Top-cuts were applied to composites before applying the outlier search restriction to further 
limit the risk of outlier Au values in four domains, and consisted of 3.0 g/t Au in two domains 
and 8.0 g/t Au in the other two domains. The predicted metal removed for each element by 
capping, excluding blocks above the oxide surface, is as follows:
  Au   =   3.5%
  Ag   =   3.7%
  As   =   0.4%
  Mo  =   2.7%
Grade caps for the SOT zones are summarised in Table 14.6.

A combination of outlier restriction and grade capping was applied during grade estimation 
for the Hugo North area (Hugo North and Hugo North Extension). In most cases, an outlier 
restriction of 50 m was used to control the effects of high-grade samples within the domains, 
particularly in the background domains where unrestricted high-grade composites tended to 
result in over-representation of high-grade estimates owing to the disproportional numbers of 
high-grade to lower grade composites. In outlier-restricted kriging, outliers (i.e. values above 
the specified cut-off) are restricted to the specified threshold value if their distance to the 
interpolated block is greater than 50 m. If the distance to the interpolated block is less than 
50 m outliers are used at their full value. The outlier thresholds applied at Hugo North and 
Hugo North Extension were defined at the 99th percentile of their respective population. The 
thresholds for restrictions are shown in Table 14.7 (copper) and Table 14.8 (gold).

As well as top-cutting of extreme grades, some outlier restriction was also applied for the 
Heruga deposit, particularly in the background domains. Top-cutting was generally applied 
at values close to or above the 99th percentile for gold and molybdenum. No cap was felt 
warranted for copper. The grade caps on outlier grades employed at Heruga are shown in

The drillhole assays were composited into downhole composites of a fixed length that was 
considered appropriate when taking into account estimation block size, required lithological 
resolution, and probable mining method. This compositing honoured the domain zones by 
breaking the composites on the domain boundary for all deposits except in the Hugo North 
models. The domains used in compositing were derived from a combination of the grade 
shells and lithological domains. Composite lengths of 8.0 m (approximately half the selective 
mining unit (SMU) size of 15 m) were used for SOT, and 5.0 m lengths were used for all other 
deposits.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 196 of 519
Intervals of less than the fixed length (8.0 m or 5.0 m) represented individual residual 
composites from end-of-hole or end-of-domain intervals. Composites that had a length of less 
than 1.5 m (Hugo North) or 2.0 m (Heruga and SOT) were excluded from the dataset used in 
interpolation.
For SOT, the following default values were applied to any unsampled intervals during 
compositing:
  Cu
0.005%
  Au
0.005 g/t
  Ag
0.5 g/t
  As
25 ppm
  Mo
2.5 ppm
At Hugo North, the composites included any post-mineralisation dyke intervals that were 
deemed too small to be part of a dyke geology model. Any unsampled intervals included in 
the composites dataset for Hugo North were set to:
  Cu
0.001%
  Au
0.01 g/t
For the Heruga deposit, the composites included any post-mineralisation dyke material 
intervals that were deemed too small to be part of a dyke geology model. Any unsampled 
intervals included in the composites dataset for Heruga were set to:
  Cu
0.001%
  Au
0.01 g/t
  Mo
10 ppm
The lithological, structural, and mineralised domains for Hugo North and SOT were reviewed 
to determine appropriate estimation or grade interpolation parameters. Several different 
procedures were applied to the data to discover whether statistically distinct domains could 
be defined using the available geological objects.
The data analyses were conducted on composited assay data, typically using either 8.0 m or 
5.0 m downhole composites. Descriptive statistics, histograms and cumulative probability 
plots, box plots, contact plots, and X–Y scatter plots were completed for copper and gold in 
each deposit area.
Results obtained were used to guide the construction of the block model and the 
development of estimation plans.

Copper grades inside the grade shells display generally similar means and coefficients of 
variation (CVs) between zones, and low CVs of between 0.6 and 0.75. The Va, Ign, and Qmd 
units were able to be combined inside the grade shells due to similar mean values seen in 
univariate statistics. Outside the copper grade shells, and in Va or in the combined Va+Qmd 
units in the South zone, CVs are similar to those inside the grade shells. Other copper domains 
outside the grade shells typically display lower mean grades and higher CVs when compared 
to Va outside the grade shells or Va+Qmd in the South zone.
Gold grades inside the 0.3 g/t Au grade shells of the significant gold-bearing domains 
(Southwest, Far South, Bridge, and Central zone) display generally similar means and CVs, 
and low CVs (<1). Samples inside the 0.7 g/t Au shell are dominantly in the Va unit of the 
Southwest zone, are similar in mean and CV to the Qmd inside the 0.7 g/t Au shell of 
Southwest, and show low CVs (~0.7). The few samples inside the 0.7 g/t Au shell of the Central 
zone show lower mean grades and higher CVs than Southwest inside the 0.7 g/t Au shell.
Outside the gold grade shells in Va unit, CVs are similar to inside the grade shells, with the 
exception of the combined Va+Qmd unit in the South zone, which has a very high CV due to 
some extreme outlier grades. Other gold domains outside the shells typically display lower 
mean grades and higher CVs when compared to the Va units outside shells.
The correlation coefficients between Cu–As, Cu–Mo, and Au–Ag, although varying by 
domain, were generally weak, ranging from 0.2–0.4, 0.2–0.4, and 0.20–0.25, respectively.
Copper grades in the mineralised units (Va, Ign, Qmd, and xBiGd) show single lognormal to 
near-normal distributions inside each domain (0.6% and 2.0% Cu Shells). Coefficients of 
variation values are low at 0.3 to 0.6. There are small variations in grade as a result of 
lithological differences within the copper domains: generally, Qmd and Va have the highest 
values, followed by Ign. Xenolithic biotite-granodiorite (xBiGd) has the lowest grades of all 
lithologies.
The cumulative distribution function patterns of copper data for all domains show evidence 
of three populations: a higher grade population (above a copper threshold value of 2.0%–
2.5% Cu), a lower grade zone (threshold value of 0.4% Cu to 0.5% Cu), and a background 
lowest-grade domain. The pattern supports the construction of the quartz-vein shell (2.0% Cu 
is approximately co incident) and the 0.6% Cu shell.
Gold grade distributions at Hugo North show typical positively skewed trends. The distributions 
are slightly more skewed than those for copper, but the level of skewness can still be 
described as only mild to moderate within each domain. The Qmd shows higher average 
gold values than the Va unit, which in turn is higher than the ignimbrite. Coefficients of 
variation values for the host lithologies are moderate, varying from 0.6 to 0.9. The cumulative 
distribution function pattern of gold data of all domains and the background domain shows 
evidence for three populations: a higher grade population (above a gold threshold value of 
1.0 g/t Au), a lower grade zone (threshold value of 0.2– 0.3 g/t Au), and a background 
lowest-grade domain. The pattern supports the construction of the 1.0 g/t Au and 0.3 g/t Au 
grade shells.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

At Hugo North the gold-to-copper relationships that were identified in 2005 are poorer. 
Generally two trends may be present. The more common is a low gold trend that outlines a 
Au:Cu ratio of about 1:10 in the mineralised volcanic units. The Qmd unit also displays the 1:10 
Au:Cu ratio trend but also shows a more gold enriched Au:Cu ratio at about 1:2.
Copper grade behaved as expected between grade shells. No significant ‘within shell’ 
variations due to lithology were observed. Gold grade distributions showed typical lognormal 
trends in all domains. Molybdenum grades were generally low, but Hugo South was observed 
to have higher molybdenum grades than Hugo North.
Copper grades within the 0.3% Cu shell generally displayed single distributions with some 
evidence for a lower grade population resulting from the presence of unmineralised post-
mineral dykes that had not been captured by wireframes. CVs were relatively low at 
0.5 to 0.6. The cumulative distribution function plot for the entire population supported the 
construction of a grade shell in the 0.3%–0.4% Cu range.
Gold grades were observed to display a moderate positive skew and multiple populations 
with evidence of lower grade populations in the range of 0.2–0.3 g/t Au.
Molybdenum grades within the 100 ppm Mo shell display a low-to-moderate positive skew 
and a single population distribution.
A strategy of soft, firm, and hard (SFH) boundaries was implemented to account for domain 
boundary uncertainty (dilution) and to reproduce the input grade sample distribution in the 
block model. Soft boundaries allowed full sharing of composites between domains during 
grade estimation; firm boundaries allowed sharing of composites from within a certain 
distance of the boundary; and hard boundaries allowed no composite sharing between 
domains. Contact plots and visual inspection of grade distributions were also used in cases 
where results were unclear or were contrary to geological interpretations.
The following major faults were considered as hard boundaries in all cases: Central, Solongo, 
East Boundary, West Boundary, Rhyolite, and South (near the mineralised zones). The 
exceptions are the boundaries between the Southwest and Bridge zones, and the Southwest 
and Far South zones, which were determined as soft, firm, or hard on a case-by-case basis 
from statistical relationships.
Boundaries between elements, lithologies, and grade shells were based on compilation of 
detailed SFH matrices. Typically, the following boundaries were broadly applied; however, 
actual boundaries as indicated in the SFH matrices are complex:
  Silver uses the same SFH relationships as gold.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 199 of 519
  Arsenic and molybdenum use the same SFH relationships as copper.
  For copper, the contact between the Qmd and Va units is typically a soft boundary, but 
can be firm or hard. The Ign boundary with the Qmd and Va units is more often than not 
a soft boundary, but can on rare occasions be hard.
  Gold relationships across changing lithologies are more complex, and no general
observations can be drawn.
  The Central, West, Wedge, and South zone boundaries are each hard to all other zones.
The boundaries between the Southwest, Bridge, and Far South zones are soft in most 
cases.
  Grade shell boundaries are typically firm; most commonly sharing samples within 40 m of
the boundary, but occasionally a more restricted distance is used, where a boundary 
can share samples within 20 m of the boundary.
Grades for blocks within the three copper grade shells were estimated with a hard boundary 
between the shells; only composites within the shell were used to estimate blocks within the 
shell.
Different boundary designations of soft, firm, or hard can be used for the different lithologies, 
depending on the grade shell. The intra-domain contact boundaries are summarised in the 
matrix in Table 14.11 for copper and in Table 14.12 for gold. The various copper and gold 
grade shells used to constrain the selection of composites and blocks during the interpolation 
of block grades at Hugo North and Hugo North Extension are illustrated in Figure 14.1.

Data analysis showed no discernible difference between the two main host lithologies, augite 
basalt and quartz-monzodiorite at Heruga. Therefore, for estimation purposes the 
two lithologies were able to be grouped into a single lithology domain. The post-
mineralisation lithologies (Lqmd, BiGd, HbBiAn) were assigned zero grade. Within each 
structural domain, the cells in the model were therefore coded according to whether or not 
they were mineralised or unmineralised, and which grade shell they fell within.
The quality of the variogram model fits for copper correlograms were excellent for the 
Southwest zone inside copper grade shells and good for the Central zone inside the copper 
grade shells. The quality of copper model fits in other domains ranged from moderate to 
good. Model fits for gold correlograms were less robust than for the copper correlograms. 
Gold grade shells are typically smaller than the copper grade shells, and are also divided into 
0.3 g/t Au and 0.7 g/t Au datasets, resulting in less data being available to support 
correlogram construction for each grade shell domain.

The correlogram-model fits for copper and gold are considered to be of acceptable quality 
for global and local grade estimation at the Indicated level of confidence, or at the 
measured level of confidence for well-drilled domains.
Model fits for silver, arsenic, and molybdenum were moderate-to-good for the larger domains 
inside grade shells. For other domains, fits were typically interpretable.
Table 14.13 summarises the results of the copper correlograms by domain, and Table 14.14 
shows the results for gold by domain.

Data in some shells were subdivided into north and south sectors for the variographic analysis 
to take into account the flexure in direction of the deposit that occurs near the 4,767,600 mN 
coordinate.
The mineralisation controls observed were considered to be related to the intrusive history 
and structural geology (faults). The patterns of anisotropy demonstrated by the various 
correlograms tended to be consistent with geological interpretations, particularly to any 
bounding structural features (faults and lithological contacts) and quartz + sulfide vein 
orientation data.
The nugget variance tended to be low-to-moderate in all of the domains assessed. Copper 
variograms generally had nugget variances of between 15%–20% (relative) of the total 
variance, except in BiGd, where the nugget is 38% of total variance. The nugget variance for 
gold variograms varied from 5.0%–25%.
Both copper and gold displayed short ranges for the first variogram structure and moderate-
to-long ranges for the second variogram structure (where modelled).
The model parameters for copper outside the 0.6% Cu grade shell are summarised in 
Table 14.15; for copper inside the 0.6% Cu grade shell and outside the 1.0% Cu grade shell in 
Table 14.16; for copper within the 1.0% Cu grade shell in Table 14.17; and for copper within 
the BiGd in Table 14.18.
The model correlogram parameters for gold outside the 0.3 g/t Au grade shell are 
summarised in Table 14.19; for gold inside the 0.3 g/t Au grade shell and outside the 1.0 g/t Au 
grade shell in Table 14.20; for gold within the 1.0 g/t Au grade shell in Table 14.21; and for gold 
within the BiGd in Table 14.22.

Correlograms indicated a north-easterly trend at Hugo South. The deposit displayed a 
consistent steep easterly dip with a flat plunge. Ranges were longest along strike of the 
respective trend for copper and a mixture of along-trend and down-dip of the trend for gold. 
Ranges tended to be less than 75 m for the first variogram structure in all metals and less than 
200 m for the second variogram structure.
Although data are limited, an attempt was made to model directional variograms for gold, 
copper, and molybdenum. Copper and gold showed relatively low nuggets of 25%–35% 
(relative) of the total variance, whereas molybdenum was moderate-to-high at 40% of the sill. 
All three metals showed relatively short first variogram structures and long second variogram 
structures of 250–300 m.
The block size selected for the SOT block model was based on mining selectivity 
considerations for open pit mining. It was assumed the smallest block size that could be 
selectively mined as mill feed or waste, referred to the selective mining unit (SMU), was 
approximately 20 m east x 20 m north x 15 m high. A sub-cell model was used for resource 
estimation, where the ‘parent’ (maximum) block dimensions were equal to those of the 
ultimate resource block model (20 m x 20 m x 15 m) and the minimum sub-cell dimensions 
down to 5.0 m x 5.0 m x 5.0 m. The actual sub-cell sizes vary as necessary to fit the specified 
boundaries of the wireframes used to tag the block model. Grade variables were regularised 
to the tonnage-weighted (volume x density) mean of the like-domained sub-cell source 
grade values enclosed in the parent blocks.
For Hugo North, mining selectivity was less of an issue because the mining method envisioned, 
block cave mining, and does not allow for consideration of selectivity. A sub-celled model 
was used for resource estimation that has parent block dimensions equal to 
15 m x 15 m x 15 m and minimum sub-block dimensions down to 5.0 m x 5.0 m x 5.0 m. Like the 
SOT model, the actual sub-block sizes in the Hugo North model vary as necessary to fit the 
specified boundaries of the wireframes used to tag the block model.
Bulk density data were assigned to a unique assay database file. These data were 
composited into 8.0 m and 5.0 m fixed-length downhole values for the SOT and Heruga 
models, respectively.
Various domain coding was done on the block models in preparation for grade interpolation. 
The block models were coded according to zone, lithological domain, and grade shell. Post-
mineral dykes were considered as potentially selectively mineable. For Hugo North, sub-
celling was used to honour lithology, grade, and structural contacts.
Blocks above topography were removed from the block model. Non-mineralised units were 
flagged using a lithology code and were excluded during the interpolation process.

Blocks in the Hugo North model were assigned an estimation domain using a combination of 
grade shells or alteration and lithology.
With the exception of Central zone, only the hypogene mineralisation was estimated. The 
base of the interpreted sulfide oxidation surface defined the top of the hypogene 
mineralisation in the SOT zones.
Resource modelling at SOT consisted of grade interpolation by ordinary kriging (OK). Nearest 
neighbour (NN) grades were also interpolated for validation purposes.
Search ellipsoid orientations were based upon the geometry of macro-scale grade trends, 
typically reflected in the grade shell boundaries. A three-pass kriging strategy was used to 
estimate the block grades. The first estimation pass kriging neighbourhood corresponds 
approximately to blocks expected to satisfy Measured and Indicated classification criteria. 
The kriging neighbourhood was expanded and relaxed with each successive pass while 
maintaining the same axial ratios for samples searches as in the first pass.
Estimations were run one domain at a time, with three passes per domain. The following 
exceptions represent groups of domains that were permitted to be estimated together:
  All supergene outside grade shells (three passes).
  All supergene inside grade shells (three passes).
  All BiGd dykes (one pass).
  All Andesite dykes (one pass).
  All Rhyolite dykes (one pass).
The selection of sample search ellipsoids was largely based on macro-scale grade controls 
seen in the average grade shell orientation within a given domain. In some domains, such as 
Southwest, search ellipsoid selection was influenced by grade trends that were identifiable 
within a grade shell by using robust anisotropic variogram models and/or visual identification 
of grade trends seen in drillholes.
The ranges and the rotation angles for the various search ellipsoids used in estimation at SOT 
are shown in Table 14.23 (copper, arsenic, and molybdenum) and Table 14.24 (gold and 
silver).
A block discretisation of 4 x 4 x 2 was used when estimating block grades. Pass 2 was 
executed on blocks that did not receive an interpolated grade in Pass 1, and Pass 3 was 
executed on blocks that did not receive an interpolated grade in Passes 1 or 2. For all 
elements, a minimum of six composites and maximum of nine composites, as well as a 
maximum of three composites per drillhole, were required for the first and second estimation 
passes. For the third pass, a minimum of two composites and a maximum of eight composites 
were required, as well as a maximum of five composites per drillhole. A single estimation pass 
was used to estimate dyke blocks, requiring a minimum of three composites, a maximum of 
eight composites, and a maximum of five composites per drillhole.

During estimation of the sub-celled model, the estimated grade of the parent cells was 
assigned to each sub-cell. Grade composites flagged as less than zero grade were excluded 
from sample selection. Grade composites less than two metres in length were also excluded. 
The composites were length-weighted during estimation. Composites were weighted by 
ordinary kriging according to variogram parameters, with the exception of dyke grades, 
which were estimated using inverse distance weighting to the second power (ID2) 
interpolation.
The bulk density estimation domains were based on three attributes: deposit, oxidation plane 
(above or below the lowest modelled limit of oxidation), and lithology. ID2 was used to 
estimate the bulk density values in the sub-blocked block model. The bulk density estimation 
domain boundaries were treated as hard boundaries; bulk density composites from one 
domain could not be used to inform blocks of another domain. Only bulk density composites 
from specific domains were used to inform target blocks of the same domain. The estimation 
search neighbourhood used an isotropic search of 100 m as well as conditions on sample 
counts: a minimum of two and a maximum of 12 composites within the search radius, and a 
maximum of two samples from any individual drillhole to inform the block estimate. A total of 
12 bulk density estimation domains lacked samples in the composite database. Default bulk 
density values from nearby, lithologically similar domains were assigned to each of the 
domains lacking composites.

Interpolation was limited to the mineralised lithological units (Va, Ign, Qmd, and xBiGd). Only 
composites belonging to those units were used. Grades and metal values within blocks 
belonging to all other units (post-mineral dykes and sediments) were set to zero.
Modelling consisted of grade interpolation by OK, except for bulk density, which was 
interpolated using a combination of simple kriging and inverse distance weighting to the third 
power (ID3). Restricted and unrestricted grades were interpolated to allow calculation of the 
metal removed by outlier restriction. Grades were also interpolated using NN methods for 
validation purposes. Blocks and composites were matched on estimation domain.
The search ellipsoids were oriented preferentially to the general orientation of each 
estimation domain. The search strategy employed concentric expanding search ellipsoids. 
The first pass used a relatively short search ellipse relative to the long axis of the correlogram 
ellipsoid. For the second pass, the search ellipse was increased by 50% (up to the full range of 
the correlogram) to allow interpolation of grade into those blocks not estimated by the first 
pass. A final, third, pass was performed using a larger search ellipsoid.
To ensure that at least three drillholes were used estimate blocks in Pass 1, the number of 
composites from a single drillhole that could be used was restricted to three. Similarly, Pass 2 
required a minimum of two drillholes to generate an estimate. The number of composites 
allowed from a single hole was restricted to three.
The search parameters for copper outside the 0.6% Cu grade shell are shown in Table 14.25; 
for copper within the 0.6% Cu grade shell and outside the 1.0% Cu grade shell in Table 14.26; 
for copper within the 1.0% Cu grade shell in Table 14.27; and for copper within BiGd in 
Table 14.28.
The search parameters for gold outside the 0.3 g/t Au grade shell are shown in Table 14.29; for 
gold inside the 0.3 g/t Au grade shell and outside the 0.1 g/t Au grade shell in Table 14.30; for 
gold inside the 0.1% Au grade shell in Table 14.31; and for gold inside BiGd in Table 14.32.
These parameters were based on the geological interpretation, data analyses, and 
variogram analyses. The number of composites used in estimating grade into a model block 
followed a strategy that matched composite values and model blocks sharing the same feed 
code or domain. The minimum and maximum numbers of composites were adjusted to 
incorporate an appropriate amount of grade smoothing.

Estimation of sub-cells at the boundary of grade or lithology domains was based on assigning 
the parent cell grade to the sub-cells; the end result being that all like-flagged sub-cells within 
the larger parent cell contain the same grade.
For both copper and gold, a combination of outlier restriction and grade capping was used 
to control the effects of high-grade samples within the domains. This is discussed in 
Section 14.1.3.
Grade variables were regularised to the tonnage-weighted (volume x density) mean of the 
sub-cell source grade values enclosed in the parent blocks before they were provided for use 
in detailed engineering and tabulation of Mineral Resources.
The cell size was 20 m east x 20 m north x 15 m high. Domain codes were assigned by a simple 
majority. In the case of assigning dyke codes to the block model, a slightly higher percentage 
of 60% was necessary. For the ore percent model, the default value was set to 100% but 
modified to reflect where blocks were intersected by dykes. Percent below topography was 
also calculated into the model blocks.
Modelling consisted of grade interpolation by OK, and also NN for validation purposes. The 
search ellipsoids were oriented preferentially to the orientation of the copper grade shells, 
with the long axis at 20° east of north, with no plunge, and dipping 55° to the south-east.
A two-pass approach was instituted for interpolation within the grade shells. The first pass 
allowed a single hole to place a grade estimate in a block, while the second allowed a 
minimum of two holes from the same estimation domain. A single-pass, two-hole minimum 
rule was used in the background domains. All blocks received a minimum of three and 
maximum of four composites from a single drillhole (for the two-hole minimum pass). 
Maximum composite limits varied by metal: nine for copper, 15 for gold, and 12 for 
molybdenum. Most interpolation runs implemented an outlier restriction to limit grade 
smearing in areas of limited data.
Bulk density data were assigned to an assay database file. These data were composited into 
15 m fixed-length downhole values to reflect the block model bench height.
The selected block size was 20 m east x 20 m north x 15 m high for consistency with previous 
modelling at the Oyu Tolgoi deposits. It was also considered to be a suitable block size for 
mining studies using the block cave approach, the assumed mining method for the Heruga 
deposit. The parent blocks were divided into sub-cells when flagging the model with dyke 
wireframes. The block model was coded according to zone, lithological domain, and grade 
shell. Post-mineral dykes and the late quartz-monzodiorite were assumed to represent zero-
grade waste cutting the mineralised lithologies.
Only the mineralised lithologies were estimated, i.e. Qmd and Va. All other units in the model 
were set to zero grade. Modelling consisted of grade interpolation by OK. As part of the 
model validation, grades were also interpolated using NN, ID3, and OK of uncapped 
composites. Density was interpolated by ID3.

The search ellipsoids were oriented preferentially to the general trend of the grade shells. A 
staged search strategy was applied, with the first pass at 200 m and a second at 400 m. A 
minimum two-hole rule was applied to both passes. Any blocks not interpolated by the first 
two passes were populated in a third pass that removed the two-hole constraint. Outlier 
restriction was applied as a second cap whereby grades over a particular threshold were 
only used in blocks within a specified distance from a drillhole (50–100 m). Outside of this 
distance the lower capped value was used.
The sub-cells in the final model were regularised to parent cell size after estimation was 
complete.
The results of the Mineral Resource estimates are presented below as grade and tonnage 
tables at variable copper equivalent cut-off grades for different resource classifications, and 
as copper and gold grade-tonnage curves. The information is arranged as follows:
  SOT: Table 14.33 and Figure 14.2.
  Hugo North: Table 14.34 and Figure 14.3.
  Hugo North Extension: Table 14.35 and Figure 14.4.
  Hugo South: Table 14.36 and Figure 14.5.
  Heruga: Table 14.37 and Figure 14.6.

Validation was completed at the time of updating the model in 2011.
A visual validation of the variogram models and search ellipsoids was completed as a check 
for reasonableness against grade trends and grade shells. These checks were performed for 
copper and gold in the major domains at a minimum and for less-significant domains when 
deemed appropriate.
Checks were also performed on the ID2 bulk density model. A visual review of the density 
model was completed on 15 m level plans and 50 m east–west vertical sections. The model 
slices were displayed together with the 8.0 m bulk density composite database. The 
composites and estimated blocks were scrutinised to identify blocks with unreasonable 
density values compared to the composite values. The ID2 block model estimate, the NN 
interpolation, and bulk density composites were compared to assess global bias. Mean 
density value comparison charts and swath plots were also prepared to assist in validating 
the density estimation.
A NN interpolated model was created to approximate the declustered composite 
distribution. This NN model was used to check for global bias of the block grade estimates 
above zero cut-off and for local bias using swath plots. The NN model was also used as the 
first step in checking model smoothing, using volume-variance corrections from the 
composite scale to the SMU scale.
Visual checks were completed comparing composites to blocks as well as behaviour of 
grade estimates near firm boundaries. Histograms of blocks with and without firm boundaries 
were compared to assess the impact on removal of troughs that were not seen in the 
composite histograms.
A final set of checks was performed to compare the 2005 model to the 2011 model and to 
compare elements of the 2007 model to the 2011 model:
  Examination of dilution inside the 2005 and 2011 models, first, by assuming whole-block
dilution, (i.e. selective mining cannot occur on a scale finer than 20 m x 20 m x 15 m) 
and, second, by assuming selective mining of dykes as was applied in 2005, although 
100% of the dykes interpreted in 2011 were assumed to be ‘selectively mineable’ for the 
purposes of those dilution calculations.
  Comparison of the 2007 and 2011 model copper and gold grade maps on level plans.
The most notable areas of grade change between the 2007 and 2011 models occurs at 
the grade shell margins; often for only a single block width.
  Comparison of the 2007 and 2011 model ‘grade shell difference maps’ for copper and
gold on plans and sections. Very significant differences were noted where the grade 
shell strategy had changed, e.g., the creation of Cu grade shells in Southwest and Far 
South in 2011 where none were used in 2007, and of 0.3 g/t Au grade shells in Southwest 
and Far South where only 0.7 g/t Au shells had been used in 2007. Outside of these areas, 
the 2011 grade shells generally appear to be slightly more conservative than the 2007 
grade shells.

  Block model estimates were checked for global bias by comparing the average metal
grades (with no cut-off) from the model (OK) with means from NN estimates. Results 
showed a good relationship (Table 14.39).
  Evaluation of the 2007 versus 2011 volumes of each primary lithology in 30 m swaths for
blocks classified as Measured or Indicated in 2007. Results indicated an acceptable 
comparison.
  Comparison of 2007 versus 2011 dyke volumes by calculating directly from percent
variables. The 2011 dyke volume falling within the designated pit was 3.0%–4.0% higher 
than in 2007, with 63.8 Mm3 in 2007 and 65.8 Mm3 in 2011. A visual plan-view comparison 
of dyke difference between 2007 and 2011 was also completed.
  Examination of histograms of 2005 block grades, 2011 block grades, and 2011
composites for Cu and Au in select domains. The histograms display the reduction in 2011 
of troughs seen in the 2005 block distribution that were not observed in the composite 
distributions.
  Review of plans and sections of classification differences where the block class was ‘1’ or
‘2’ in the 2005 model but not the same as assigned in the 2011 model, or vice versa, or 
where both models shared the same values. Overall volumes were similar, though the 
2005 classification was considered to be more liberal near the grade shell boundaries, 
and it was determined that some of the documented classification criteria may not have 
been strictly followed in the 2005 classification.

Ore control activities undertaken through the mining process in the SOT pit enabled a further 
validation of the SOT model.
A block-to-block comparison of the resource model to the current ore control model 
indicates that the two models are in good agreement. The resource model appears to be a 
global predictor of tonnes above the range of cut-offs. At all grade ranges, the resource 
model is within 1.0% agreement with the ore control model. The comparison does however 
indicate a slight reduction (1.0%) in tonnes above 0.6% copper. However, this grade category 
represents only 3.0% of the total tonnes.
A block-to-block comparison of copper grades in the ore control model to the grade of the 
resource model indicates that at Cu >0.0% (both models), the ore control grade is 
approximately 6.6% higher, (i.e. 0.306% ore control versus 0.287% resource model). This 
observation is in-line with the observed results reported by the Oyu Tolgoi open pit team. As 
the cut-off is raised, the observed variance (var) also changes from a high of 12% at 0.1% Cu 
(var=0.431 ore control model versus var=0.381 resource model) to a low of -3.0% at 0.9% Cu

(var=0.960 ore control model versus var=0.989). Again, the negative variations of grade at the 
higher grade ranges should be balanced by the relative tonnes in this range.
Model reconciliation will continue to be used to validate and improve the resource 
estimations based on actual production data.
Detailed visual validation of the Hugo North block models was performed in plan and section, 
comparing resource block grades to original drillhole data. The checks showed good 
agreement between drillhole composite values and model cell values. The addition of the 
outlier restriction values succeeded in minimising grade smearing.
Block model estimates were checked for global bias by comparing the average metal 
grades (with no cut-off) from the model (OK) with means from NN estimates. Results showed a 
good relationship (Table 14.39).
Models were also checked for local trends in the grade estimates (swath plot). This was 
undertaken by plotting the mean values from the NN estimate versus the OK results for 
benches in 30 m swaths and for northings and eastings in 40 m swaths.
The OK estimate would be expected to be smoother than the NN estimate, thus the NN 
estimate should fluctuate around the kriged estimate on the plots. The two trends behaved 
as predicted and showed no significant trends of copper or gold in the estimates.
Swath plots of uncapped copper estimations along easting, northing, and elevation are 
shown in Figure 14.7. The same information for gold estimation is shown in Figure 14.8.

Visual inspection of the estimates indicated no significant issues with the model. The 
smoothing in the estimates was checked independently. Grade-tonnage predictions 
produced for the model show that grade and tonnage estimates were validated by the 
change-of-support calculations over the likely range of mining grade cut-off values (0.8%–
1.2% Cu).
The block model estimates were checked for global bias by comparing the OK grades (with 
no cut-off) from the model with the NN estimates. No bias was identified.
Local trends in the grade estimates were verified using swath plots. The trends behaved as 
predicted and showed no significant bias in the estimates.
A detailed visual validation of the Heruga resource model found that flagging of the drill data 
file and the block model was performed correctly. The block model estimates were checked 
for global bias by comparing the average metal grades from the model with means from
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 247 of 519
unrestricted NN estimates. No bias was identified.
The distribution of the grades in the model was compared to the distribution of the original 
drillhole data, the composites used to build the model, and the declustered NN model. In all 
cases, although smoothed due to the kriging interpolation method, the model was found to 
reflect the underlying data used to build it. The degree of smoothing occurring within the 
model was considered reasonable for the type of deposit and the likely block cave mining 
method.
The resource model was also checked for trends and local bias using 50 m swath plots that 
compared the restricted OK estimates to NN estimates. The trends behaved as predicted 
and showed no significant bias in the estimates.
An initial classification was assigned using a set of rules based on estimation (OK) passes, 
distances to nearest composites, and numbers of holes used to inform the block estimates. A 
separate ID2 estimation was run for copper grade composites at SOT, which was used to 
derive the initial classification in the model. At SOT, the initial block classification was then 
assessed and modified with an algorithm designed to eliminate isolated blocks of a particular 
classification by ‘switching’ them to majority classification of the surrounding blocks.
At Hugo North, block classification confidence is based on the copper grade variable. A 
three pass inverse distance squared (ID2) estimation of Cu composites was used to capture 
the distance from a block centroid to the nearest composites; the closest anisotropic 
distance was captured from Pass 1 and Pass 2, and the closest Cartesian distance was 
captured from Pass 3. For the ID2 estimation the principal mineralised rock types Va, Ign, and 
Qmd were treated as one group, and unmineralised rock types BiGd and Rhy were treated 
as another group. Contacts between these two groups were treated as hard. The HWS rocks 
were not classified. The seven search anisotropy zones used for 2012 copper grade estimation 
were used for the ID2 estimation.
At Hugo North, block confidence classification is based on three processes: preliminary block 
classification using a script based on distance to a drillhole and number of drillholes used to 
estimate a block, generation of probability model for the three confidence categories, and 
manual ‘cleaning’ using polygons generated in sectional view.
A series of probability models were generated using the preliminary classification code of ‘1’ 
for Measured, ‘2’ for Indicated, and ‘3’ for Inferred. Using a threshold value of 50%, the 
probability shells were compared to the preliminary classification block code. Boundary 
polygons reflecting the three categories were then manually digitised to eliminate the 
inclusion of isolated blocks and incorporate geologic and grade continuity. The probability 
shells were used as a guide for confidence.
The polygons were then connected to create a 3D solid. Blocks were then recoded as 
Measured, Indicated, or Inferred based on these solids.
Mineral Resources were classified based on the criteria outlined in Section 14.3.1.

In order to assess the value of the total suite of minerals of economic interest in the mineral 
inventory, formulae have been developed to calculate copper equivalency (CuEq) based 
on given prices and recoveries.
The initial formula used to calculate the copper equivalent (CuEq) grade was developed in 
2003 for Hugo North and SOT. There have been numerous variants on the formula used since.
The base 2014 copper equivalent formula incorporates copper, gold, silver, and 
molybdenum. The assumed metal prices are $3.01/lb for copper, $1,250/oz for gold, 
$20.37/oz for silver, and $11.90/lb for molybdenum. Copper is expressed in block grade in the 
form of percentages (%). Gold and silver are expressed in block grades in the form of grams 
per tonne (g/t). Molybdenum is expressed in block grades in the form of parts per million 
(ppm). Metallurgical recovery for gold, silver, and molybdenum are expressed as percentage 
relative to copper recovery.
The unit conversions used in the calculation are:
g/t to oz/t = 31.103477
lb/kg = 2.20462
tonne to lb = 2,204.62
g/tonne to tonne = 1x10-6
This leads to a base formula of:
CuEq14 = Cu + ((Au x AuRev) + (Ag x AgRev) + (Mo x MoRev)† ) / CuRev
† Mo and MoRev are only incorporated into CuEq calculations for Heruga
Where:
CuRev = (3.01 x 22.0462)
AuRev = (1,250/31.103477 x RecAu)
AgRev = (20.37/31.103477 x RecAg)
MoRev = (11.90 x 0.00220462 x RecMo)
RecAu = Au recovery/Cu Recovery
RecAg = Ag recovery/Cu Recovery
RecMo = Mo recovery/Cu Recovery
Different metallurgical recovery assumptions lead to slightly different copper equivalent 
formulas for each of the deposits; these are outlined in the following tables for SOT, Hugo 
North, Hugo North Extension, Hugo South, and Heruga. In all cases, the metallurgical recovery
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 249 of 519
assumptions are based on metallurgical testwork. For SOT, actual mill performance has been 
used to further refine the recovery assumptions over the life-of-mine. Recoveries are relative 
to copper because copper contributes the most to the equivalent calculation.
All elements included in the copper equivalent calculation have a reasonable potential to 
be recovered and sold, except for molybdenum. Molybdenum grades are only considered 
high enough to support construction of a molybdenum recovery circuit at Heruga, and 
hence the recoveries of molybdenum are zeroed out for the other deposits.

The historical metal equivalence formula developed in 2003 assumed a copper price of 
$0.80/lb and a gold price of $350/troy oz, with 100% recovery of both metals. As indicated 
above, the OTFS14 metal equivalence formula incorporates updated metal prices and 
application of metal recoveries. An applicability check was performed by comparing the 
formulae in terms of revenue ($/t) and cut-off grade. The results for Hugo North are shown in 
Table 14.45.
Comparative results indicate the CuEq formulae are relatively insensitive to the changes in 
prices and application of recoveries since 2003. Using the average grade for Hugo North of 
1.66% Cu and 0.34 g/t Au (Table 14.41), the two equivalent copper grades are approximately 
equal (1.877 vs. 1.878). The relative differences between the 2003 and 2014 metal 
equivalence formulae are approximately 8.0% in terms of revenue measured in $/t. Note that 
while silver has been added to the metal equivalence formulae, its relative contribution in 
terms of revenue is minor.

Table 14.46 compares revenue ratios for four cases:
  Case 1: 2003 metal equivalence assumptions (price and no recoveries).
  Case 2: 2003 metal price assumptions and OTFS14 metallurgical recoveries.
  Case 3: OTFS14 pricing and no metallurgical recoveries.
  Case 4: OTFS14 pricing and metallurgical recoveries.
Silver was omitted from the comparison because it provides only a minor contribution. The 
revenue ratio has low sensitivity to copper grades (and also gold grades). Comparing the 
OTFS14 metallurgical recoveries to the 2003 formula recoveries results in a lower CuEq 
contribution by gold. When using the OTFS14 metallurgical recoveries (Case 2 vs. Case 4), the 
relative differences in CuEq between the two formulas are approximately 1.0% and 5.0% in 
terms of revenue ratio (RevAu / RevCu). However, when comparing Case 1 (2003) to Case 4 
(OTFS14) the relative difference in CuEq is extended to approximately 2.0% and the 
difference in revenue ratio is approximately 14%. Hence, if reserves were stated using the 
2003 formula, they would overestimate the contribution of gold to copper equivalent by 9.0% 
compared to use of the current formula that incorporates the metals prices and recoveries 
used to develop the OTFS14 resources.

Cut-off grades were determined using Base Data Template 31 (BDT31) assumptions. The Net 
Smelter Return (NSR) per tonne of ore needs to equal or exceed the production cost of a 
tonne of ore for the mine to break even or make money.
For the underground mine, the break-even cut-off grade needs to cover the costs of mining, 
processing, and general and administrative (G&A). A NSR of $15.34 per tonne would be 
required to cover costs of $8.00 for mining, $5.53 for processing, and $1.81 for G&A. This 
translates to a CuEq break-even underground cut-off grade of approximately 0.37% CuEq for 
Hugo North. This cut-off grade has been used for tabulating underground Mineral Resources 
in this report.
In the open pit, the mining cost for a tonne of waste is the same as for a tonne of ore. 
Therefore, the marginal open pit cut-off grade is determined where a tonne of material 
covers the processing and G&A. A NSR of $8.36/tonne would be required to cover process 
costs of $6.20 and G&A of $2.16 per tonne. This NSR translates to a copper equivalent 
marginal open pit cut-off grade of 0.22% for Southwest ore. This cut-off grade has been used 
for tabulating open pit Mineral Resources in this report.
CIM Definition Standards require reported Mineral Resources to have reasonable prospects 
for eventual economic extraction. The following subsections address the reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction together with commentary on conceptual 
mining considerations and other constraints used in tabulating the Mineral Resources.

Constraining 3D shapes were generated by ascribing positive values that defray mining, 
processing, and G&A costs to blocks that have been assigned to Measured, Indicated, and 
Inferred (MII) Mineral Resource categories.
In 2014, OT LLC undertook pit optimisation that was used to confirm the current reserve pit 
designs. The parameters used for the pit optimisation work are described in BDT31. The metal 
prices used were: copper price of $3.01/lb, silver price of $20.37/oz, and gold price of 
$1,250/oz. A pit shell was generated from the pit optimisation work using all the estimated 
blocks classified as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred. The result was a pit shell (MII Pit Shell) 
that was larger than the reserve pit design to be used to constrain the estimates that would 
go into the SOT mineral resource reporting.
The reserve pit design contains Inferred Mineral Resources that are ignored in the declaration 
of Mineral Reserves. Given that this Inferred material is located within the reserve pit, it is 
considered to be amenable to mining and, provided the Inferred blocks are above the 
economic cut-off, they are considered to have reasonable prospects of future economic 
extraction and thus can be stated as Mineral Resources.
Using the BDT31 prices and other parameters, a marginal copper equivalent cut-off of 
0.22% CuEq was calculated for SOT. This cut-off grade represents the point at which the 
copper revenue is equal to the processing and G&A costs. The use of a marginal cut-off is 
based on industry standard practice. It is calculated assuming that there is a decision point at 
the pit rim, if the revenue from processing is less than the cost then the block is assumed to be 
waste. As a result, the SOT open pit mineral resources are tabulated at a marginal cut-off 
grade of 0.22% CuEq.
Blocks coded as being within the oxide horizon are excluded from the mineral resource on 
the basis of being considered to be mineralogically unfavourable within the existing 
processing options.
Mining depletion has also been accounted for by using the 2013 year-end mining surface to 
constrain Inferred Mineral Resource material reported within the reserve pit design.
The SOT deposit has several mineralised areas beneath the MII Pit Shell that are considered to 
be targets for future underground mining. Located within 3 km of the planned Hugo North 
underground mine and associated infrastructure, these target areas could also be used for 
access to and hoisting or conveying from any underground operation at SOT.
Underground constraining stope-block shapes (based on assumed mechanised block 
caving) were defined with at least a 100 m x 200 m footprint for the four areas (Figure 14.9). 
Constraining 3D stope-block shapes were outlined based on estimation of economic criteria 
that would pay for primary and secondary development, mining, ventilation, tramming, 
hoisting, processing, and G&A costs, i.e. the underground stope shape cut-off. In delineating 
the constraining stopes-block shapes, a mining costs of $12/t was used, which included 
primary and secondary development, mining, ventilation, tramming, and hoisting costs. These 
stope-block shapes and the cost assumptions used in generating them have not been
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 257 of 519
updated in this study because the infrastructure built for Hugo North Lift 1, and perhaps in 
future for Hugo South, could provide synergies for lower capital intensity underground 
development at SOT.
Using the MII Pit Shell and the underground constraining shapes, mineral resources have been 
stated for those blocks that are located within the constraining underground cave shapes 
and that met a marginal cut-off grade of 0.37% CuEq (Section 14.2.2).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 258 of 519
To assess reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction and to declare 
underground resources at Hugo North, an underground resource-constraining shape (the 
“reasonable prospects of economic extraction,” or RPEE, shell) was prepared on vertical 
sections using economic criteria that would pay for development, block-cave mining, 
ventilation, haulage, hoisting, processing, and G&A costs.
A primary and secondary development cost of $8.0/t and a mining, process, and G&A cost 
of $12.45/t were used to delineate the RPEE shape cut-off. Using OT LLC’s Base Data 
Template 29 (BDT29) gold price of $970/oz and a revised copper price of $3.00/lb, it was 
estimated that a 0.50% copper cut-off would return $21.74/t, which would cover the RPEE 
shape cut-off costs stated above. The RPEE shell was developed in 2012 and has not been 
updated in 2014. The infrastructure built for Hugo North Lift 1 would provide synergies for lower 
capital intensity underground development at subsequent Hugo North panels. Mineral 
resources within the RPEE shell at Hugo North are reported at a breakeven copper equivalent 
cut-off grade of 0.37%.
Estimates classified as Inferred Mineral Resource within the Lift 1 block cave shape are 
assigned a zero grade and treated as dilution in the reserve. Thus, they are not treated in the 
same way as Inferred Mineral Resources within the open pit final reserve shell.
Inferred Mineral Resources at Heruga and Hugo South have been constrained only by using a 
CuEq cut-off of 0.37%.
Once the open pit and underground constraining shapes were generated, resources were 
stated for those model cells within the constraining underground stope-block shapes that met 
a given CuEq cut-off grade.
Classification was undertaken using a set of rules based on estimation (OK) passes, distances 
to nearest composites, and numbers of holes used to inform the cell estimates to establish an 
initial classification. A separate ID2 estimation was run for copper grade composites at SOT, 
which was used to interpolate the initial classification model. The initial classification was then 
assessed and modified with an algorithm designed to eliminate isolated cells of a particular 
classification by switching them to majority classification of the surrounding cells.
Confidence categories, contained in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, were 
applied to the resource block models.
Mineral Resources were classified based on the criteria outlined in the following sections.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 259 of 519
A three-hole rule was applied where cells contained an estimated grade from three or more 
composites from different holes, all within 50 m and at least one composite within 30 m of the 
cell centroid. These cells were classified as Measured Mineral Resource.
The drillhole spacing over much of the SOT area is approximately 70 m. The drillhole spacing 
and geological and grade continuity over this area was considered to support an Indicated 
Mineral Resource classification in this area. A two-hole rule was used where cells containing 
an estimated grade were required to have been informed by two or more composites from 
different holes. Furthermore, for the Southwest zone, the two holes were required to be within 
a distance of 75 m, with at least one hole within 55 m of the cell centroid. For the remaining 
SOT zones, the two holes were required to be within 65 m with at least one hole within 45 m of 
the block centroid.
Estimates in the SOT area with that did not meet the classification criteria for Measured 
Mineral Resource or Indicated Mineral Resources were assigned to the Inferred Mineral 
Resources category if the cell centroid was within 150 m of a copper composite.
Recent underground drilling has resulted in sufficient confidence in geological and grade 
continuity to support Measured Mineral Resources in proximity to underground drillholes. 
Blocks classified as Measured Mineral Resources have satisfied the following criteria:
  A three-hole rule was used for OK-estimated Cu blocks with three or more composites
from three different holes, from three different search octants, all within 50 m and at least 
one composite within 35 m of the block centroid, all distances from ID2 Pass 1. The 
distance used is the closest anisotropic distance.
  Blocks were constrained by the Measured classification solid generated using sectional
interpretation and block probabilities.
The drillhole spacing over much of the Hugo North area is approximately 125 m x 75 m. The 
minimum nominal drillhole spacing of 75 m (horizontal) between drillholes and 150 m 
between drill lines for Indicated Mineral Resources was determined in the course of a study 
on drillhole spacing conducted in 2004. The following conditions need to be met to classify 
blocks as Indicated Mineral Resources:
  A three-hole rule was used for OK-estimated Cu blocks not classified as Measured and
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 260 of 519
with three or more composites from three different holes, all within 50 m distance from 
ID2 Pass 1. The distance used is the closest anisotropic distance.
  A three-hole rule was used for OK-estimated Cu blocks with three or more composites
from three different holes, all within 150 m and at least one composite within 105 m of the 
block centroid, all distances from ID2 Pass 2. The distance used is the closest anisotropic 
distance.
  A two-hole rule was used for OK-estimated Cu blocks with two or more composites from
two different holes, all within 150 m with at least one hole within 75 m of the block 
centroid, all distances from ID2 Pass 2. The distance used is the closest anisotropic 
distance.
  Blocks were constrained by the Indicated classification solid generated using sectional
interpretation and block probabilities.
All blocks in the Hugo North model with an OK-estimated Cu grade that did not meet the 
classification criteria for Measured or Indicated Mineral Resources were assigned to Inferred 
Mineral Resources if the block centroid was within 150 m of a composite. The distance used is 
the closest Cartesian distance captured from Pass 3 of the ID2 estimation described above.
  Blocks were constrained by the inferred classification solid generated using sectional
interpretation and block probabilities.
There are no Measured Mineral Resources at Hugo South.
Interpolated cells were classified as Inferred Mineral Resources if they fell within 150 m of a 
drillhole composite. All mineralisation at Hugo South is currently classified as Inferred Mineral 
Resources.
There are no Measured Mineral Resources at Heruga.
Interpolated cells were classified as Inferred Mineral Resources if they fell within 150 m of a 
drillhole composite. All mineralisation at Heruga is currently classified as Inferred Mineral 
Resources.
The summary of the Oyu Tolgoi Mineral Resources is presented in Table 14.47.
Mineral Resources are classified in accordance with the 2010 Canadian Institute of Mining,
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The contained copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum estimates in the Mineral Resource 
tables have not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries. However, the differential 
recoveries were taken into account when calculating the copper equivalency formula 
explained in Section 14.2.1. The various recovery relationships at Oyu Tolgoi are complex and 
relate both to grade and Cu:S ratios.
Mineral Resources were also estimated for trace and impurity elements, including arsenic, 
fluorine, and sulfur, as well as the copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum estimates reported in 
these tables.
A sulfide mineral abundance model was created for SOT and Hugo North that will allow 
improved estimates of geometallurgical modelling and assist with characterisation of tailings 
acid rock drainage (ARD) capacity.

Areas of uncertainty that could materially affect the Mineral Resource estimates include the 
following:
  Commodity pricing.

Interpretations of fault geometries.
  Effect of alteration as a control on mineralisation.
  Lithological interpretations on a local scale, including dyke modelling and discrimination
of different Qmd phases.
  Pit slope angles.
  Geotechnical assumptions related to the proposed block cave design and material
behaviour.
  Metal recovery assumptions.
  Dilution considerations.
  Contaminants such as arsenic and fluorine.
  Estimates of operating costs used to support reasonable prospects assessment.
  Changes to drill spacings and number of drillhole composites used to support
classification categories.
Mineral Resources were last publically reported in the 2013 Technical Report March 2013 
(2013 OTTR). A comparison of the 2013 OTTR and 2014 Mineral Reserves is shown in 
Table 14.48.
The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources have increased by approximately 80 Mt with 
a 2% decrease in Cu grade, a. 0.4% decrease in gold grade, and a 6% increase in silver 
grade. This has resulted in a 2% increase in recovered copper, a 2% increase in recovered 
gold, and a 10% increase in recovered silver.
A comparison of the 2013 OTTR and 2014 EJV Mineral Reserves is shown in Table 15.9. The 
Mineral Reserves have increased by 4.0 Mt with an 8.1% decrease in Cu grade, an 11.3% 
decrease in gold grade, and a 0.6% decrease in silver grade. This is matched by a 2.8% 
increase in recovered copper, a 0.4% decrease in recovered gold, and an 11.2% increase in 
recovered silver.
Relative to the previously reported resources, in copper equivalent (CuEq) terms, this 
represents an increase of less than 1% CuEq metal in the Measured and Indicated categories, 
and a decrease of approximately 8% CuEq metal in the Inferred category.

The Mineral Reserves for the project have been estimated using the SOT and Hugo North 
Mineral Resources. Total Mineral Reserves for the project and the OT LLC and EJV Mineral 
Reserves for the open pit and underground components of the project are shown in 
Table 15.1. The Mineral Reserves for the 2014 OTTR are based on mine planning work 
prepared by OT LLC. Mine designs were prepared using industry-standard mining software, 
assumed metal prices as described in the notes to the Mineral Reserves, and smelter terms as 
set forth in Section 22. The report only considers Mineral Resources in the Measured and 
Indicated categories, and engineering that has been carried out to a feasibility level or 
better to estimate the open pit and underground Mineral Reserve.

The Mineral Reserves in the SOT Open Pit are shown in Table 15.4. Pit designs were prepared 
using industry-standard mining software, assumed consensus metal prices as described 
above, and smelter terms as set forth in Section 22. The estimate was prepared on a simplified 
project analysis on a pre-tax basis. The report only considers Mineral Resources in the 
Measured and Indicated categories, and engineering that has been carried out to a 
feasibility level or better to estimate the open pit Mineral Reserve.
The silver grades used and reported by OT LLC in the SOT Open Pit mine planning work for the 
2014 Mineral Reserve are the silver grades reported in the 2005 Mineral Resource model for 
SOT. This is the result of a timing issue in that the silver grades were not completed when the 
mine planning work was undertaken. Subsequent to the mine planning work, the silver grades 
in the 2012 resource model were updated and have been reported in the current Mineral 
Resources for SOT. As discussed in Section 14, the silver grades in the current resource model 
are lower than the 2005 model silver grades. Silver is a by-product and this difference has 
been calculated to have an NSR value of approximately $0.10/t. OreWin considers that this is 
within the accuracy of the study work and is not a material issue.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 269 of 519
OreWin has therefore concluded that the Mineral Reserve is valid. However it is 
recommended that the Feasibility Study review the resource estimates for silver and that the 
updated mine planning work take account of any changes to silver and other elements.

Mine planning work by OT LLC has continued since the previous Mineral Reserve estimate in 
2013. The underground Mineral Reserve has increased by approximately 8 Mt.
The Hugo Dummett underground deposit will be mined by panel caving, a safe, highly 
productive, cost-effective method. The deposit is comparable in dimension and tonnage to 
other deposits currently being developed by panel cave mining elsewhere in the world. The 
mine planning work has been prepared using industry-standard mining software, assumed 
metal prices as described above, and smelter terms as set forth in the 2014 OTTR. For Hugo 
North Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were used to report Probable Mineral 
Reserves. There is approximately 60 Mt of Measured Mineral Resource that has been 
converted to Probable Mineral Reserve. The engineering has been carried out to a feasibility 
level or better to estimate the underground Mineral Reserve.
To ensure that Inferred Resources do not become included in the reserve estimate, copper 
and gold grades on Inferred Resources within the block cave shell were set to zero and such 
material was assumed to be dilution. The block cave shell was defined by a $15/t NSR. Further 
mine planning will examine lower shut-offs.

Key assumptions are summarised below; other assumptions are documented in the 
2014 OTTR:
  Metal prices used for calculating the SOT Open Pit NSR and the Hugo North Underground
NSR are copper $3.01/lb, gold $1,250/oz, and silver $20.37/oz based on long-term metal 
price forecasts at the beginning of the Mineral Reserve work. Analysis indicates that the 
Mineral Reserve is still valid at these metal prices.
  The NSR has been calculated with assumptions for smelter refining and treatment
charges, deductions and payment terms, concentrate transport, metallurgical 
recoveries, and royalties.
  For the open pit, processing and general and administration operating costs have been
used to determine cut-off grades: Southwest at $8.37/t, Central Chalcocite, Central 
Covellite, and Central Chalcopyrite at $7.25/t.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 273 of 519
  For the underground a footprint cut-off of $15/t NSR and column height shut-off of
$15/t NSR were used to maintain grade and productive capacity.
  For the underground block cave, all Mineral Resource within the shell has been
converted to Mineral Reserve. This includes low-grade Indicated Mineral Resource and 
Inferred Mineral Resource assigned zero grade treated as dilution.
  Only Measured Resources were used to report Proven Reserves and only Indicated
Resources were used to report Probable Reserves.
  EJV is the Entrée Gold Joint Venture. The Shivee Tolgoi and Javkhlant licences are held
by Entrée Gold. The EJV Shivee Tolgoi and EJV Javkhlant Licences are planned to be 
operated by OT LLC. OT LLC will receive 80% of cash flows after capital and operating 
costs for material originating below 560 m, and 70% above this depth.
  The Mineral Reserves are not additive to the Mineral Resources.
  The underground Mineral Resource cell models used for reporting the Mineral Reserves
are the models reported in the Mineral Resource section of 2014 OTTR. The 2012 SOT 
resource model prepared by OT LLC has been used for the open pit Mineral Reserve.
The processing schedule philosophy adopted for the mine planning work assumes feeding 
the open pit ore into the plant at an elevated cut-off grade and stockpiling low grade 
material for later treatment. This philosophy provides some insulation against metal price 
cycles and reduces the risk that the Mineral Reserve size is overestimated.
Mineral Reserves were last publically reported in the 2013 Technical Report March 2013 
(2013 OTTR). A comparison of the 2013 OTTR and 2014 Mineral Reserves is shown in Table 15.8. 
The Mineral Reserves have decreased by approximately 8 Mt with a 4.5% decrease in Cu 
grade, a 3.8% decrease in gold grade, and a 4.7% decrease in silver grade. This is matched 
by a 6.0% decrease in recovered copper, a 7.6% decrease in recovered gold, and a 6.1% 
decrease in recovered silver.
A comparison of the 2013 OTTR and 2014 EJV Mineral Reserves is shown in Table 15.9. The 
Mineral Reserves have increased by 4.0 Mt with an 8.1% decrease in Cu grade, an 11.3% 
decrease in gold grade, and a 0.6% decrease in silver grade. This is matched by a 2.8% 
increase in recovered copper, a 0.4% decrease in recovered gold, and an 11.2% increase in 
recovered silver.

The Mineral Reserve reported for NI 43-101 is also applicable for reporting the Ore Reserve 
under the US SEC Industry Guide 7. OreWin estimated the Oyu Tolgoi Mineral Reserves for the 
NI 43-101 2014 OTTR, which are based on feasibility study work. The definitions of the Mineral 
Reserve classifications under NI 43-101 are the Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) Definition 
Standards – For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, Prepared by the CIM Standing 
Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council on 11 December 2005. The 
definitions below are quoted from the CIM Definition Standards – For Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves, page 5.
After consideration of guidelines and other information regarding the declaration of Reserves 
for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) reporting, OreWin 
considers that the 2014 OTTR is suitable for declaring a Reserve as defined in US Industry 
Guide 7.
Documentation underlying Mineral Reserves determined in accordance with Industry Guide 7 
generally includes the following:
  A ‘final’ feasibility study.
  Utilisation of the historic three-year average price for the commodity that expected to
be mined in determining economic viability.
  Primary environmental analysis has been submitted to government authorities.
OT LLC is in an advanced stage of project financing with a core lending group of financiers 
for an approximately $4.0 billion project-finance facility. The core lenders group is comprised 
of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Export Development Canada, 
International Finance Corporation, BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered Bank, US Ex-Im Bank 
and its adviser, Standard Bank, the World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee 
Agency and the Australian Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.
TRQ has advised OreWin that bids have been received from a number of banks that would 
allow OT LLC to achieve its project financing target and discussions are ongoing with the 
lenders to finalise the terms of those offers. The project financing is subject to the unanimous 
approval of the OT LLC Board of Directors, which includes representatives from the GOM and 
the financiers are aware of this requirement. OreWin therefore considers it reasonable to
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 278 of 519
conclude that the bankable study test in US SEC Industry Guide 7 has been met.
The base case financial analysis has been prepared using current long-term metal price 
estimates of:
  Copper
$3.08/lb
  Gold
  Silver
$1,304/oz
$21.46/oz
The 2005 SME Guide Section 53 describes how the Test Price for commodities should be 
applied.
"If a Mineral Reserve is reported using a price lower than the test price, the forward-
looking discounted cash flow must be positive, and the Reserve Sensitivity Test (based 
on an undiscounted cash flow) need not be performed. When applicable, a statement 
should be made that a Reserves Sensitivity Test was completed, or that such a test was 
not applicable."
The metal prices for the previous three years, their average and the metal prices used for the 
Mineral Reserve estimates are shown in Table 15.14. The sensitivity analysis using the three year 
averages shows the after tax NPV8% of US$9,635 million compared to the base case 
US$7,430 million. The results are improved compared to the base case financial analysis, as 
the averages for the copper, gold and silver prices are higher. This indicates that the Mineral 
Reserve is still valid at the three year average prices.

The 2007 SME Guide Section 56 describes how the permitting and legal requirements of 
US SEC Industry Guideline 7 should be applied. It indicates that:
"To demonstrate reasonable expectation that all permits, ancillary rights and 
authorisations can be obtained, the reporting entity must show understanding of the 
procedures to be followed to obtain such permits, ancillary rights and authorisations. 
Demonstrating earlier success in getting the necessary permits can be used to
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 279 of 519
document the likelihood of success."
Based on the understanding of the procedures and the history of permitting, it is considered 
reasonable to assume that the final environmental permitting will be granted without resulting 
in a change to the Reserve.
OT LLC has completed a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
for Oyu Tolgoi. The culmination of nearly 10 years of independent work and research carried 
out by both international and Mongolian experts, the ESIA identifies and assesses the 
potential environmental and social impacts of the project, including cumulative impacts, 
focusing on key areas such as biodiversity, water resources, cultural heritage, and 
resettlement.
The ESIA also sets out measures through all project phases to avoid, minimise, mitigate, and 
manage potential adverse impacts to acceptable levels established by Mongolian 
regulatory requirements and good international industry practice, as defined by the 
requirements of the Equator Principles, and the standards and policies of the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and 
other financing institutions.
Corporate commitment to sound environmental and social planning for the project is based 
on two important policies: TRQ's Statement of Values and Responsibilities (March 2010), which 
declares its support for human rights, social justice, and sound environmental management, 
including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948); and The Way We 
Work 2009, Rio Tinto’s Global Code of Business Conduct that defines the way Rio Tinto 
manages the economic, social, and environmental challenges of its global operations.
OT LLC has commenced the development and implementation of an environmental 
management system (EMS) that conforms to the requirements of ISO 14001:2004. 
Implementation of the EMS during the construction phases will focus on the environmental 
policy; significant environmental aspects and impacts and their risk prioritisation; legal and 
other requirements; environmental performance objectives and targets; environmental 
management programmes; and environmental incident reporting. The EMS for operations will 
consist of detailed plans to control the environmental and social management aspects of all 
project activities following the commencement of commercial production in 2013. The 
Oyu Tolgoi ESIA builds upon an extensive body of studies and reports, and DEIA’s that have 
been prepared for project design and development purposes, and for Mongolian approvals 
under the following laws:
  The Environmental Protection Law (1995).
  The Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (1998, amended in 2001).
  The Minerals Law (2006).
These initial studies, reports and DEIA’s were prepared over a six-year period between 2002 
and 2008, primarily by the Mongolian firm Eco-Trade LLC, with input from Aquaterra on water 
issues.
The original DEIA’s provided baseline information for both social and environmental issues. 
These DEIA’s covered impact assessments for different project areas, and were prepared as
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 280 of 519
separate components to facilitate technical review as requested by the GOM.
The original DEIA’s were in accordance with Mongolian standards and while they 
incorporated World Bank and IFC guidelines, they were not intended to comprehensively 
address overarching IFC policies such as the IFC Policy on Social and Environmental 
Sustainability, or the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy.
Following submission and approval of the initial DEIA’s, the GOM requested that OT LLC 
prepare an updated, comprehensive ESIA whereby the discussion of impacts and mitigation 
measures was project-wide and based on the latest project design. The ESIA was also to 
address social issues, meet GOM (legal) requirements, and comply with current IFC good 
practice.
For the ESIA the baseline information from the original DEIA’s was updated with recent 
monitoring and survey data. In addition, a social analysis was completed through the 
commissioning of a Socio-Economic Baseline Study and the preparation of a Social Impact 
Assessment (SIA) for the project.
The requested ESIA, completed in 2012, combines the DEIA’s, the project SIA, and other 
studies and activities that have been prepared and undertaken by and for OT LLC.
Mongolia has its own system for reporting Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources. OT LLC 
registered a Mineral Reserve with the GOM in 2009. A key difference between the two 
standards is the classification of material contained in Hugo North Lift 2, Hugo South and 
Heruga under Mongolian standards as reserves. This contrasts to the Canadian National 
Instrument (NI) 43-101 definitions, which include only SOT and Hugo North Lift 1 in the Mineral 
Reserve category.
The system is based on a review by Mongolian experts in a number of disciplines. A significant 
difference between the Mongolian system and NI 43-101 is that, under the Mongolian system, 
resources and reserves are not valid until registered by the GOM. A committee of Mongolian 
experts examines a report prepared by the Owner using a set of guidelines and then, based 
on a consensus of nominated experts, a recommendation is made to the Minister for Mineral 
Resources and Energy.
The recommendation to the Minister states the resources and reserves and any conditions. 
The Minister then issues an order registering the resources and reserves. OT LLC have 
submitted an update of the Mongolian Mineral Resource and Reserve to the GOM, which is 
based on the production and costing in a production case assuming that the plant is not 
expanded and that additional mines are developed (2014 LOM Case).

In the 2013 Pit Slope Management Programme (PSMP) nine boreholes were drilled totalling 
4,120 m, using conventional geotechnical mud rotary and coring methods. The boreholes 
were drilled from surface to a maximum depth of 600 m at inclinations between 55° and 65° 
from the horizontal. Some of the boreholes were equipped with time domain reflectometry 
(TDR) and hydrogeology monitoring instrumentation (vibrating wire piezometers). Some of the 
holes were also used for packer testing and geophysical logged using acoustic televiewer 
(ATV).
The drilling programme was completed at the end of 2013, and analysis of the drilling and 
hydrogeology data is still ongoing. The pit slope design has not changed.
In terms of pit slope monitoring, prism monitoring has been implemented with two robotic 
total stations (RTS) installed on opposite sides of the pit. The pit, dumps, and stockpiles are all 
monitored regularly.
Pit slope stability investigations and design for the Oyu Tolgoi open pit mine were originally 
completed by SRK (Australia) in 2005. In May 2009, OT LLC retained Golder Associates Limited 
(Golder) to carry out a review of the proposed pit slope designs. In mid-2010, OT LLC 
commissioned Rio Tinto Technology and Innovation (T&I) to lead a study to examine the 
hydrogeological and geotechnical conditions of the open pit area to determine the 
anticipated pit slope performance and design criteria, the expected groundwater 
conditions, and dewatering and slope depressurisation requirements for the planned pit 
sequence. T&I prepared scopes of work and engaged three consulting firms, Golder, 
Schlumberger Water Services (Schlumberger), and Aquaterra, to complete the study. The 
work was intended to provide feasibility level geotechnical assessment for the first seven 
years of planned mining and pre-feasibility level assessment for Year 8 through the planned 
life-of-mine (LOM).
Golder conducted the following field investigations from 4 December 2010 to 
21 February 2011:
  Drilled 12 new geotechnical core holes (denoted OTD1629/GT01 to OTD1640/GT12) with
core orientation.
  Collected rock samples for laboratory testing.
OT LLC performed ATV surveys in the 12 new geotechnical holes and in 14 existing open pit 
exploration holes. Golder interpreted the survey results to determine structural data. 
Aquaterra completed the hydrogeological field testing (packer testing) on the geotechnical 
drillholes, and Schlumberger provided pit wall pore pressure predictions.

Two main rock zones are present in the open pit area: the Weathered Zone and the 
Bedrock Zone. Field assessment of rock hardness, point load tests, and laboratory rock test 
results indicated that the rocks found within the Weathered Zone are weak and those within 
the Bedrock Zone are moderately strong to very strong; uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) 
values are shown in Table 16.1. The basalt, granodiorite, andesite, and rhyolite dykes are the 
strongest rock units (UCS values varying from 62–133 MPa), followed by the porphyritic augite 
basalt, quartz-monzodiorite, dacite, and conglomerate rocks (R4, 50 MPa < UCS < 100 MPa). 
The siltstone-sandstone, ignimbrite, and fault zone rocks have the lowest strengths. The 
average fresh and altered ignimbrite UCS tests indicated moderately strong rock (R3, UCS in 
the range of 25–50 MPa).
Based on the rock mass classification system, rock mass quality is expected to be fair within 
the Weathered Zone (40 <RMR <60). Within the Bedrock Zone, the main rock masses to be 
exposed on the pit walls are estimated to be generally of good rock mass quality (RMR >60). 
The ignimbrite may show fair rock mass quality where the argillic alteration is more intense. 
Fair to poor rock mass quality is expected within some fault zones (Figure 16.1). The intrusion of 
dykes on the ‘old’ faults, like the Solongo fault, improved the rock mass conditions, creating 
fair to good rock mass quality.

Limit equilibrium stability assessments were carried out for rock mass failure, considering the 
potential for circular and bi-linear failure surfaces formed by the combination of the major 
geological structures and through the rock mass. Based on the recommended inter-ramp 
slope angles, the stability analyses confirmed that the overall pit wall would exhibit a Factor 
of Safety (FS) higher than the accepted criterion of FS = 1.3, even when considering a lower 
overall rock mass strength with a disturbance factor of 0.7. A more conservative inter-ramp 
angle was recommended within the ignimbrite.
Given the strong, fair to good rock quality of the rock masses and the results of the limit 
equilibrium analyses, the main consideration for rock slope failure will be structurally 
controlled mechanisms (kinematics) at either a small scale (i.e. wedge fallout from benches) 
or a larger scale (i.e. slope failure along persistent joints or faults).
The structural data collected from the geotechnical and reconciled exploration drillholes 
were used to develop and assess seven structural design domains, labelled West, East, South, 
Solongo, Southwest, Northwest, and Middle. The locations of these structural domains were 
predominantly based on the orientations of major faults, lithological boundaries, and rock 
mass quality. Where required, these domains were further subdivided into sub-domains based 
on the rock type. For example, the East domain, corresponding to the east wall of the Central 
and South pits, was sub-divided into the sediments and intrusive structural sub-domains.
Based on stereonets generated for each structural domain, kinematic analyses were 
conducted to investigate structurally controlled failure in rock slopes―planar, wedge, and 
toppling failures. Each domain was analysed kinematically every 30° to cover all wall 
orientations expected to daylight through the different phases of mining.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 284 of 519
Feasibility level pit slope design recommendations were made for each design domain, 
considering the proposed bench face angles (BFA, or batter angle) and berm widths based 
on the rock mass quality and the structural controls. For simplicity, three BFA angles were used 
in the design: 60°, 65°, and 70°. BFA = 65° corresponds to fair rock mass quality and some 
structural controls. BFA = 60° corresponds to areas with high structural controls, and BFA = 70° 
to areas with minimum structural controls and good rock mass quality. In addition, the pit 
design recommendations considered vertical separation of single (15 m) or double (30 m) 
benches, berm widths varying from 7.5–15 m, and inter-ramp angles (IRA) of 38°–52°.
The convention used to define the orientation of each design sector was the wall dip 
direction, which corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the wall when looking into the 
pit. However, these orientations were redefined because the Oyu Tolgoi team uses a 
programme that requires the strike of the wall, which would be equivalent to the wall dip 
direction of minus 90°, to be considered as well.
The resulting design criteria recommendations are summarised as follows:
  Single, 15 m bench height (or batter) configuration in all rock slopes.
  Maximum BFA of 65° in Weathered Zone.
  Average BFA of 70° in Bedrock Zone.
  Minimum berm width of 7.5 m.
  Where structural controls are present, other berm widths of 9.0 m, 12 m, and 15 m to
match the recommended IRA angles.
Figure 16.2 shows a typical inter-ramp bench design. The pit slope design recommendations 
for the geotechnical domains are listed in Table 16.2, followed by a summary of the 
geotechnical parameters for domains in weathered rock in Table 16.3.
In its review, Golder suggested that applying the slope angles over extended wall heights was 
not appropriate at the current stage of design because drillholes are the primary source of 
data and no structural mapping has been performed. Therefore, Golder recommends that 
the final and interim walls be subdivided into a series of bench stacks, either by providing haul 
road traverses or by including geotechnical berms at least 15 m wide or more at about 90 m 
vertical intervals (six benches x 15 m high). These berms would also protect personnel from 
potential major rock falls, allow for horizontal drain hole water controls, provide some flexibility 
in wall development, provide access for instrumentation, and allow for periodic bench clean-
up.

The rock mass is expected to exhibit low to very low hydraulic conductivity; however, 
Schlumberger recommended that long horizontal drains be installed to ensure adequate 
depressurisation behind the pit walls. Pore-pressure monitoring will be required to investigate 
whether natural (or gravitational) drainage is adequate or if sub-horizontal drains are 
required. Installation of additional piezometers may be required for this monitoring.
Surface drainage ditches should be maintained along the outside perimeter of the pit to 
collect and convey surface water away from the pit slopes in areas where water run-off 
could affect the stability of the pit face.
For the overburden, slope stability will also vary with slope height and overburden thickness. It 
was recommended that the slopes be fully dewatered and then excavated with different 
slopes as a function of height, varying from 2.4H:1V for 30 m high slopes to 0.8H:1V for <5 m 
high slopes.

Note: Current design inter-ramp slope angle varies by domain.
Golder reviewed the updated phased pit shells from the geotechnical viewpoint. Golder 
developed a preliminary hazard model, which was subsequently refined by the Oyu Tolgoi 
planning team by applying the following individual hazard ratings, varying from 0–2, for the 
SOT pit slope design:
  Rock mass rating (RMR) values:
-  RMR 0–20: hazard rating = 1.
-  RMR 21–40: hazard rating = 0.75.
-  RMR 41–60: hazard rating = 0.5.
-  RMR 61–80: hazard rating = 0.25.
-  RMR 81–100: hazard rating = 0.
  Rock type:
-
Ignimbrite: hazard rating = 1.
-  Sediments: hazard rating = 0.75.
-  Other rocks: hazard rating = 0.
  Proximity to fault type of alteration:
-  Clay: hazard rating = 1.
-  Chlorite: hazard rating = 0.6.
-  Sericite: hazard rating = 0.4.
  Variation of inter-ramp angle:
-  36°–38°: hazard rating = 2.
-  38°–42°: hazard rating = 1.6.
-  And so on until >50°: hazard rating = 0.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 289 of 519
An overall hazard index was estimated by summing all the individual hazard ratings; the index 
varies from 0–6. As an example, a pit wall located close to faults, with poorer rock mass 
quality and argillic alteration, would receive a high hazard index rating.
The overall hazard index mapping identified the following areas as having higher 
geotechnical hazards:
  Rhyolite fault separating the Central and Southwest pit areas.

Inclined AP01 fault daylighting on the southern wall of the Central pit.
  Occurrence and proximity to the other major faults, including the Solongo fault.
  Occurrence of the potentially weaker ignimbrite rock mass on the East domain.
  Unfavourable dipping (and continuous) major set on the West wall of the final pit.
The hazard index mapping was also used to assist in determining the best locations for the 
switchbacks of the ramps.
Slightly conservative pit slope configurations in areas with high hazards are recommended. As 
a result, the geotechnical hazards (and risks) are considered to be low for the recommended 
slope design. Small bench-scale failures can be expected locally where structural conditions 
are unfavourable or blasting practices are poor. Additionally, seasonal variations in 
temperature such as winter freeze and spring thaw may adversely affect bench stability and 
increase rock fall hazards.
The open pit mine area has been divided into 10 phases. Three-dimensional (3D) stability 
numerical analyses were carried out for two critical periods over the LOM―2021 (end of 
Phase 3) and 2038 (end of Phase 8) using Flac3D© software.
The 3D results indicate that the proposed pit walls are expected to be stable based on the pit 
shell configurations, material properties, and groundwater conditions considered in these 
analyses. These results confirmed the results of the two-dimensional (2D) limit equilibrium 
stability assessments that were carried out on 10 representative cross-sections.
The 3D numerical analyses also indicated that while faulting clearly influences the patterns of 
deformation in the pit slopes, complex 3D failure mechanisms associated with faulting were 
not predicted at the end of 2021 (Phase 3) or 2038 (Phase 8).
Areas where yielding and ground movements were predicted, were relatively localised within 
the pit walls and did not extend to pit infrastructure on the ground surface.
Recommendations related to operational considerations include:
  Double-benching to maximise slope angles.
  Controlled blasting with pre-split blasting to maximise slope angles.
  Thorough bench clean-up and scaling using equipment that can safely reach the crest
of the bench.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 290 of 519
With the exception of the eastern walls within the ignimbrite, double-benching may be 
possible if the bench faces are clean and stable to enable safe drilling and excavation.
For practical reasons, the Oyu Tolgoi team decided to use four berm widths in design: 7.5 m, 
9.0 m, 12 m, and 15 m. However, berm widths of 10.5 m and 13.5 m, for example, could be 
considered for the final wall to increase the IRA by 1–2ºº in some design sectors.
A geotechnical drilling programme was conducted as part of the 2013 Pit Slope 
Management Programme (PSMP), targeting the areas for mining in the next three to 
five years within the Southwest mineralisation boundary to better define pit slope angles. A 
better understanding of the geological conditions in the field is particularly important for 
setting the pit slope parameters for Phases 4, 5, and 9.
The purpose of the 2013 geotechnical drilling programme was to increase the confidence 
level of “orebody knowledge” for the geotechnical model, particularly in relation to the 
establishment of Phases 4 and 5. This was achieved through the collection and interpretation 
of geotechnical and geophysical drillhole data. The drilling programme results will be 
assessed to determine the potential to steepen the pit slope angle (inter-ramp slope angle).
Data collected from the geotechnical drilling programme will be used for several purposes: 
obtaining structural geological information by orientating the core; sampling for subsequent 
laboratory testing of rock and defect strength properties; installation of vibrating wire 
piezometers; time‒domain reflectometry monitoring; and packer testing in selected 
boreholes for hydrogeological monitoring.
The hydrogeological outcomes are fully integrated into the geotechnical analysis, using 
sophisticated 2D and 3D numerical techniques. The objective is to provide pit wall design 
parameters that are compatible with achievable depressurisation targets relative to the mine 
excavation schedule.
The 2013 geotechnical drilling programme included nine boreholes totalling 4,120 m, using 
conventional geotechnical mud rotary and coring methods. The borehole locations are 
shown in Figure 16.3. The boreholes were drilled from surface to maximum depth of 600 m, at 
inclinations of between 55° and 65° from the horizontal. Some of the boreholes were 
equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and hydrogeology monitoring 
instrumentation (vibrating wire piezometers). Some of the holes were also used for packer 
testing and geophysical logged using Acoustic Televiewer (ATV).
The drilling programme was completed at the end of 2013, and analysis of the drilling and 
hydrogeology data is still ongoing. Pit slope design has not changed.
An Ace tool core orientation device was run down the boreholes as part of the PQ core 
barrel assembly. Triple-tube core barrels that allow the core to be hydraulically pumped out 
from the splits were used to preserve the quality of the core prior to logging.

ATV images provide a valuable and independent method for evaluating in situ geology. The 
data generated have extensive applications for geotechnical, hydrogeological, geophysical 
and geological purposes. The methodology or “classification scheme” for interpreting the 
raw images is critical to achieve the best outcomes for future use of the data.
Packer testing was carried out to assess the variability of a borehole as it intersects various 
hydrogeological units. The objective of this investigation is to determine the natural hydraulic 
conductivity of bedrock. The testing was done to help understand the detailed 
hydrogeological properties of the various horizons; proper design of the hydrogeological

programme will help in developing a plan for in-pit sump pumping, refining the design as 
required, ensuring the right equipment is ordered, and constructing the hole.
Monitoring piezometers (multiple levels) were installed to infill critical data gaps of the existing 
piezometers in the open pit area. The ongoing data are required to support pit design work.
Vibrating wire piezometers (VWP) are pressure transducers, which when installed within an 
open borehole and sealed with a cement-bentonite grout, allow water pore pressure to be 
measured. Piezometers were installed in the geotechnical boreholes to:
  Monitor the passive response of in- pit slope pore pressures due to the advance of
mining, the reduction of hydraulic head in the pit, and the effects of rock mass 
unloading.
  Collect, update, and validate the current pit slope pore pressure models and also feed
into future planned FS level slope design work. At present, no piezometers are installed in 
slopes of the active phases of the mine.
  Monitor for possible transient increase in bedrock groundwater pressures and flux rates
due to occasional Undai recharge events and later to monitor the response / benefit 
attained in the bedrock system from implementing the diversion (piezometers between 
the Undai River and the west pit wall).
  Provide a baseline of groundwater pressures that can later be used to assess whether a 
front of recharge and increased pore pressure occurs as the TSF expands (piezometers 
between the planned TSF and the east wall).
The hydrogeological study currently underway is being conducted by Schlumberger Water 
Services (SWS) and Aquaterra RPS. The objectives are to improve the understanding of the 
hydrogeological conditions directly within the mine footprint and also external to the ultimate 
pit; and to develop a predictive pore pressure capacity to be used in the assessment of pit 
wall stability and also of external impacts on, or by, the Undai River and tailings storage 
facility.
The hydrogeological field programme (packer test) was carried out in six boreholes and 
involved 3,500 m diamond drilling with in situ downhole testing in each hole to quantify the 
hydrogeological characteristics of targeted fault / dyke structures and the rock mass fabric. 
Each hole will also be completed as either standpipe monitoring wells or cemented vibrating 
wire pressure transducers.
At the end of the field programme, a 3D district hydrogeological model will be developed to 
provide a predictive capacity in assessing groundwater conditions. The requirements for 
depressurisation of the pit walls will be assessed, water inflows will be predicted, and 
strategies will be developed for pit water management and depressurisation.

OT LLC carried out the mine planning and scheduling work for the Oyu Tolgoi open pits. This 
work included the integration of the underground plans.
The OTFS14 work is based on metallurgical parameters and BDT31.
The mining model was created from the latest resource model (mpst15.v9). The recovered 
copper, gold and silver grades, and the NSR were calculated for each block. The calculated 
NSR was stored in a mining model and used for open pit optimisation.
The NSR is the revenue paid for the concentrate at the mine gate, and excludes costs for 
mining, processing, and G&A. NSR is the in situ value after allowances have been made for:
  Recovery to concentrate
  Smelter deductions
  Concentrate transport
  Smelter treatment and refining charges
  Royalties
The resulting NSR values were used to classify the ore blocks in the pit optimisation process. 
The NSR values for the 2014 OTTR were calculated using the parameters described in 
Table 16.4. The NSR calculation does not include penalties for impurities such as arsenic and 
fluorine. The penalties have been minimised through blending in the production schedule 
and are accounted for in the financial analysis.

The pit optimisation was completed by OT LLC using the current resource model. Only 
resources classified as Measured or Indicated were used in the optimisation. Inferred 
resources were treated as waste.

The pit phase selection was based mainly on the incremental revenue factors. The following 
key metallurgical and production constraints were also considered:
  Concentrator operational constraints require that Central ore be delayed until adequate
production quantities of ore from Hugo North underground are available for optimum 
blending.
  The Southwest phases need to provide enough ore to fill concentrator production until
2020.
  The goal for Phase 1 was to achieve 45 Mt of ore with a high value. Phase 2 targeted
100 Mt of ore.
  The pit shells for Phases 4–5 were determined in a similar fashion by subsequently
expanding the pit out of Phase 2 at the minimum 80 m bench width. The goal is to reach 
the bottom of the gold core as soon as possible.
  Phases 8 and 9 are mainly a pushback designed to trim Phase 10.
  Phase 10 is the ultimate pit.
The open pit design work focused on the Southwest and Central zones of the SOT deposit. 
The zones fall within the following pit phases:
  Phase 1

The objection of the phase design strategy was to minimise the early mining costs and 
maximise the economic return. The following design objectives were also considered for the 
design of the internal pit phases:
  The first five phases were limited to the Southwest orebody. This allows for the prioritisation
of the Southwest ore in the schedule. A minimum mining width of 80 m between each 
phase.
  Two exit haul roads per phase.
  General haul road design parameters of 40 m haul road width and 10% haul road
gradient.
A plan view of the 10 pit phases is shown in Figure 16.4.

The open pit mining operations are scheduled for nominally 365 per annum. It was assumed 
that 15 days per annum will be lost due to unscheduled delays due to weather conditions. 
The open pit equipment will operate 24 hours per day in two 12-hour working shifts.
The effective utilisation for the equipment will depend on the performance of the 
maintenance and operation teams. The open pit time-use categories are shown in 
Table 16.6.

Based on operating requirements, OT LLC has prepared a comprehensive labour roster that 
includes local and expatriate personnel. Figure 16.5 shows the anticipated numbers of local 
and expatriate personnel as the national workforce ratio increases over the years. Total 
labour decreases significantly when the open pit production rate drops from 110 Mtpa to 
60 Mtpa in year 2023.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 299 of 519
The open pit mine is a conventional shovel and truck operation. OT LLC’s workforce carries 
out the drilling, loading, hauling, and dumping. The equipment maintenance is conducted 
under Service Agreements with the original equipment manufacturers’ in-country dealers.
The 2014 OTTR assumes the use of 34 m3 diesel hydraulic shovels, 56 m3 electric rope shovels, 
and 290 t class diesel trucks. The equipment estimates are based on the specifications and 
data provided by the equipment suppliers in their submissions to the OT LLC tender process.
The equipment fleet requirements at start up and at five-year intervals are listed in Table 16.7. 
The shovel and drill hours are based on equipment productivities. Truck hours are derived 
from the cycle time estimates and shovel numbers.

Production blast holes are drilled 16.5 m deep x 311 mm diameter. The OT LLC team designs, 
fires, and monitors the blasts, while a contractor provides down-the-hole services, including 
the supply and storage of explosives. It is assumed that ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) is 
used in dry holes and high-density explosives (RIOFLEX) in wet holes. Given the prevailing 
conditions, up to 90% of holes so far have been found to be wet, requiring the use of 90% 
high-density explosives for blasting.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 300 of 519
Almost all materials within the open pit are assumed to be blasted; free digging is only 
possible in the first or second benches covered by weathered or clay material.
Two of the production drills are diesel units and two are electric. As replacements are 
required, one diesel drill will be maintained in service and the other will be replaced with an 
electric power drill.

The primary loading fleet consists of two 34 m3 diesel hydraulic shovels and two 56 m3 electric 
rope shovels. Generally, one of the shovels will be used to mine ore from the lower pit 
benches and the others will be used to strip waste for the development of the next phase. 
Also in operation are two 18 m3 front end loaders (FEL).

The designs for active waste dumps assume a swell factor of 30% for the material delivered 
from pit benches, considering natural sorting and 10% compaction of the dumps. It is also 
assumed that the blasted waste rock will settle at the natural angle of repose of 37°. The plan 
is to build the dumps in 15 m high lifts, forming 30 m high benches with 40 m wide haul roads 
at 10% grade. The dump height is designed to a maximum of 70 m, or the 1,230 mRL, based 
on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) submitted to the GOM in 2007. However, an 
additional 15 m lift would be required on the West and South dump for additional capacity to 
provide flexibility for non-acid-forming (NAF) placement and the tailings stockpile.
The design criteria consider selective placement of rock on the dumps to ensure that 
potentially acid forming (PAF) waste is isolated from stream sediments to eliminate the risk of 
off-site migration of ARD post-closure. The designs include the following:
  Placement of a three metre thick initial NAF lift on the western half of the dumps, in an
area where the surface does not contain clay.
  Placement of a 1–3 m thick NAF cap on the reclaimed dump surface to mitigate the
effects of erosion and to inhibit water penetration into the dump.
The following dumps have been designed:
  Tailings stockpile (TSF dump) – This dump stores NAF oxide and sediment material to be
used in the construction of the tailings storage facility (TSF). This stockpile is dynamic, with 
material dumped from the open pit being removed for TSF construction as required.
  West waste dump – This dump overlies some clay material and the adjacent Undai River;
primarily used for storing PAF material.
  South waste dump – Approximately half of this dump area overlies clay and so does not
require the NAF bottom lift. This dump can be managed to store different types of 
material depending on cycle times and waste rock characteristics.
  SOM dump – This dump stores any oxide material that contains copper grades greater
than 0.25%.
The optimised mine plan requires the milling cut-off grade to be raised, which relies on the 
ability to stockpile the ore mined to date from the open pit. As of the end of 2013, 
approximately 18 Mt of ore have been stockpiled. The stockpile has been divided into three 
categories: high-grade (HG), medium grade (MG), and low grade (LG). Of the total 
stockpiled, 0.8 Mt have been allocated to HG, 11 Mt to MG, and around 6.2 Mt to LG.
The LG and MG stockpiles are part of the mine planning strategy to optimise project value 
and are categorised as mining reserves. These stockpiles will continue to grow, while the HG 
ore will be fed to the concentrator on start-up.
The waste dump and stockpile designs consider an overall slope angle of 18° after 
reclamation. The designs and a cross-section of the dump design geometry are shown in 
Figure 16.7 and Figure 16.8, and the ultimate capacities of the dumps and stockpiles are 
listed in Table 16.10.

As the open pit deepens, it is planned to install diesel-powered pumps for pit dewatering. The 
water will be pumped to a dam at the process plant. Pumps have been sized depending on 
pit depths. Figure 16.9 shows the dewatering system for the open pit. Pumping requirements 
are dependent on the mining schedule. Pump replacement and repair allowances are 
included in the operating costs. The pump requirement estimates are based on the bench 
positions of each pit phase in each year.

The Hugo North, Hugo South, and Heruga orebodies are planned to be mined by 
underground panel caving methods. OTFS14 states that the designs first three panels 
(Panels 0–2) of the Hugo North Lift 1 mine has been completed at feasibility study level.
Hugo North Lift 1 will commence production in 2019 and ramp-up to produce an average of 
95 ktpd. To support mining of Hugo North Lift 1, two declines included in 203 km of lateral 
development, five shafts, 6.8 km of vertical raise-boring, and 137,000 m3 of mass excavations 
will be undertaken.
A significant change from the previous underground designs is that OT LLC has determined 
that a conveyor decline will be developed as the primary materials handling method. OT LLC 
determined that the change was NPV neutral, capital costs were in line with the shaft 
haulage option and operating costs would be slightly lower. The total conveying and hoisting 
capacity from the underground is planned to be approximately 140 ktpd.  OT LLC have 
indicated that the primary advantage of the decline is that it will provide an upside 
opportunity to take advantage of potential improved productivity and increased production 
from Lift 1 or early access to a block cave on Hugo South or a future Hugo North Lift 2.
In total, 499 Mt will be mined at a grade of 1.66% Cu and 0.35 g/t Au. Figure 16.10 illustrates 
the planned mine development superimposed with site layout, Figure 16.11 illustrates an 
isometric of the mine design, and Figure 16.12 illustrates the annual tonnage profile.

The first underground development at Oyu Tolgoi started with sinking the bulk sample Camel 
Well shaft (3.6 m diameter x 74 m deep) in the open pit area between October 2004 and 
January 2005. Surface works for the first shaft to access the Hugo North deposit, Shaft 1, 
began in February 2004, and sinking started in February 2005. The 1,300 m level station was 
reached in October 2007, with the station developed and sinking continuing to a final depth 
of 1,385 m by January 2008. A temporary bucket loadout arrangement was fitted by 
March 2008 to support off shaft lateral development.
Two kilometres of horizontal development from Shaft 1 were completed initially, primarily to 
provide access to and geotechnical characterisation of the orebody and the surrounding 
conditions to support the Pre-feasibility Study. This development was subsequently expanded 
in parallel with the beginning of the Feasibility Study in 2010, focusing on additional data 
gathering to support studies as well as advancing pre-production access. In 2012, after the 
completion of 11 km of horizontal development, the Shaft 1 bucket hoisting arrangement was 
converted to a skip-and-cage arrangement to support a more intensive development and 
construction programme. A total of 16 km of lateral development was undertaken from 
Shaft 1 before the underground project was placed into care and maintenance in 
August 2013.
Lateral development performance has been very good, with advance rates matching and 
exceeding feasibility study rates and excavation and ground support being of high quality.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Ground conditions and response to mining have been as expected. Negligible water has 
been intersected.
Surface works for Shaft 2, a 10 m finished diameter shaft, began in July 2006 and was placed 
on hold in December 2007. Shaft 2 works recommenced in April 2010 and by August 2013, 
Shaft 2 sinking reached a depth of 1,167 m. Shaft-sinking is now adjacent to underground 
development and is ready for breakthrough upon restart, which will establish an independent 
second means of egress and additional ventilation. Ground conditions have been as 
expected with negligible water intersections.
A surface-to-underground raisebore was commenced in mid-2010 adjacent to Shaft 1, with a 
planned 500 m upper leg and 800 m lower leg. Significant challenges were encountered 
while both piloting and reaming, and the raise excavation was abandoned. The ventilation 
strategy for the underground project was reviewed and changed, resulting in removal of all 
surface-to-underground raisebores previously planned for the project in preference to sinking 
an additional shaft (Shaft 5). Shaft 5, a 6.7 m finished diameter shaft, commenced surface 
works in August 2012 and sinking in April 2013. At August 2013, sinking had reached a depth of 
208 m, progressing on schedule with ground conditions as expected.
Hugo North is considered to be highly suitable for the caving method of mining. 
Three caveability assessments were undertaken for OTFS14 using the Laubscher Modified 
Rock Mass Rating (MRMR) rock mass classification system, the Mathews extended stability 
chart, and Flac 3D numerical modelling. The risks associated with caveability and 
propagation are considered to be low. High stress conditions, a highly fractured rock mass, 
and a large caving footprint are key factors. Surface subsidence analysis does not raise any 
concern for surface infrastructure in place or planned.
Fragmentation analysis illustrates fine fragmentation with all geotechnical domains. 
Secondary breaking requirements are not expected to pose a risk to production schedule 
ramp-up or full production rates.
Predicted abutment stresses are considered to be high, and focus has been placed on 
optimising mine design and ground support to manage excavation stability.
The predicted fracture limits (determined as the point of having a notable impact on key 
infrastructure such as hoisting shafts) by the end of mining Hugo North Lift 1 are shown by the 
red outline in Figure 16.13. A fence will be constructed 100 m outside this red outline to restrict 
access. The subsidence angles are predicted to be nearly vertical at the northern and 
southern limits of the cave, where confinement is highest, and are approximately 55° in the 
east and west, where confinement is lowest. All shafts and permanent infrastructure are 
planned to be situated outside the predicted fracture limits.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 309 of 519
Note: fracture limits = thick red line.
Shaft 1 is closest to the fracture limits. Shaft 1 will be used as a hoisting shaft until the Shaft 2 
loadout and primary crusher are commissioned by early 2019. Thereafter the primary function 
of Shaft 1 is for intake ventilation. This provides additional contingency against an 
unexpectedly larger cave subsidence damage area, as a bald concrete lined shaft can 
withstand higher ground movement than a shaft reliant on the close tolerances of operating 
hoisting infrastructure.
The OTFS14 drilling programme, which concentrated on the cave initiation area and the first 
four years of production ramp-up, provided critical characterisation data and confirmed that 
the Hugo North orebody is highly faulted and sheared. In situ stress measurements estimated 
at the extraction horizon are high: σ1 = 58 MPa (sub-horizontal with a dip direction of 055°), 
σ2 = 33 MPa (sub-horizontal with a dip direction of 145°), and σ3 = 27 MPa (sub-vertical). An 
analysis of geotechnical domain data confirmed that a lithology basis for domain assignment 
remains valid. Laubscher rock mass rating (RMR) values for the different lithologies vary 
between 43 and 53.
Stress orientations have been calculated, with the sub-horizontal major principal stress 
bearing towards 055°. The in situ stress regime, summarised in Table 16.11, represents the latest
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 310 of 519
version from the geotechnical assessment in the study.
The rock mass strengths of the orebody units were divided by a range of mining stress levels as 
predicted from the cave-scale modelling: isolated drifts under in situ stresses (60 MPa), 
average abutment stresses (80 MPa), and high abutment stresses (100 MPa). Results indicated 
that closure strains up to 5.0% were possible from high abutment stress loading on the 
extraction and undercut levels.

The Hugo North orebody is a highly jointed rock mass classed as fair to poor. The rock mass of 
MRMR 40–45 is caveable at HR >20–23, or at approximate dimensions of 80 m x 80 m to 
100 m x 100 m. Other key points from the analysis include:
  Major faulting will significantly influence caving and should promote cave propagation.
  Stress caving is likely to dominate the cave propagation.
  The rock mass is caveable, with a predicted critical hydraulic radius of approximately 20–
23 m to sustain continuous caving for median rock mass conditions.
To best manage the risk of drive and pillar damage from high abutment stresses and the 
highly fractured orebody, the footprint design has been divided into three production panels. 
The footprint layout is shown in Figure 16.14.

The design was influenced by the following key geotechnical criteria:
Principal Stress:
  Undercut face perpendicular or sub-perpendicular to principal stress direction of 055°
strike: This provides lower stress conditions immediately in front of the undercut face, and, 
coupled with drive pillars parallel to principal stress as mentioned above, provides highest 
stability.
  Extraction drives parallel or sub-parallel (±20°) to principal stress direction of 055° strike:
This provides best use of the clamping forces from the high horizontal stress on the major 
apex to improve pillar stability. It also improves the development quality and advance 
rate of extraction panel drives, undercut drill drives, and apex inspection drives.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 312 of 519
Structure:
  Undercut face intersecting major structure at an angle, not parallel, to structure: A key
structure in the central and southern areas of the footprint is the north-south trending 
Lower Fault. Key structures in the northern area of the footprint are the H Fault, trending 
north-east–south-west, and other similar faults parallel to the West Bat and Contact faults, 
which are major orebody bounding faults.
  Extraction drives intersecting major structure at an angle, not parallel, to major structure. 
This provides best conditions for development quality and advance rate, along with long 
term stability of key development openings.
Undercut Stability:
  Undercut length under 350 m: Longer undercut faces increase the number of active
undercut drives that are required to operate in series, increasing the risk of one undercut 
drive delaying the retreat of the undercut face. Additional active undercut drives add 
complexity and congestion. Long undercut faces are considered to aid in concentration 
of undercut stresses near the centre of the undercut face.
  Undercut rate of retreat greater than 80 mpa, or 7.0 m per month, as measured along
the undercut drill drive: Slower undercut retreat rates increase the time dependent stress 
deterioration along the zone in front of the undercut face, in particular the half blasted 
pillar area that establishes the undercut lead-lag.
  Undercut lead-lag of 10 m (±1) undercut blast (2.5 m): Larger lead-lags increase the half-
blasted pillar area in front of the undercut face, increasing the risk of ground damage 
and collapse.

Implementation of the Wide W undercut design with apex level: The Wide W design 
increases the volume of undercut pillar and major apex pillar, improving pillar and drive 
stability. The apex level, elevated above the undercut level with drives located along the 
peak of the major apex pillar, provides several benefits, including improved ability to 
inspect undercut blasts, swell void for the toe area of undercut blast rings, a platform for 
monitoring the undercut amount of swell mucking, and an additional platform for 
remedial drilling of unblasted stubs. These operational benefits decrease the risk of 
undercut delay causing stress loading and potential damage and collapse.
To implement the design criteria over the Hugo North Lift 1 footprint, a three-panel approach 
was adopted. This approach includes two panel boundaries. The northern panel boundary 
between Panel 0 and Panel 1 changes in undercut orientation and development drive 
orientation, as illustrated in Figure 16.15. The panel interfaces are not ideal, but are 
considered manageable and have often been used at several operations in the past. These 
boundaries are in isolated areas and are a lesser problem than ongoing issues with long 
undercut faces and slow-moving caves.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 313 of 519
Undercut pillars next to the advancing cave front are likely to experience vertical stresses on 
the order of 45 MPa. Sigma 1 comes into the undercut face in a horizontal direction from a 
bearing of 055° (normal to the cave front) and angles down through the undercut pillars at 
up to 110 MPa, then reduced to in situ levels two or three pillars (30–45 m) behind the 
undercut front. These stresses result in high modelled closure strains (up to 5.0%) immediately 
at the undercut front and lower strains (2.0%–5.0%) behind the undercut face.
Figure 16.16 illustrates the undercut blasting area and cave front. The 10 m lead-lag shown 
between adjacent undercut drives to manage stress build-up near the undercut face results 
in an undercut face orientated at 70° to the undercut and extraction drive. The minimum 
undercut retreat rate (along an undercut drive) will be 7.0 m per month to prevent stress 
build-up and management of time-dependent ground deterioration.
The 4.0 m wide x 4.2 m high undercut drives spaced every 28 m are considered to be 
supportable and adequate. Apex inspection drives, located 17 m above the undercut level 
and spaced every 28 m, are situated along the peak of the major apex pillars and are
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 314 of 519
considered important in managing successful undercutting activities.
Based on geotechnical modelling and cave flow models, 28 m x 15 m drawbell spacing with 
an El Teniente layout was selected. Pillar stability and recovery were major factors in selecting 
the drawpoint spacing. To promote interactive draw, drawcone centroids within a drawbell 
are spaced 10 m apart. Layout parameters are illustrated in Figure 16.17.
The advanced undercut sequence allows the extraction level panel drives to be mined 
ahead of the undercut face. A safety zone running the length of the undercut face will be 
established on the extraction level underneath the advancing undercut face. This zone will 
be 34 m wide, starting 17 m, or 45°, in front of the undercut, and ending 17 m, or 45°, behind 
the undercut face. The development of the drawpoint drives will begin 17 m behind the 
undercut face, and full drawbell excavation will begin at least 60° behind the undercut face. 
This is shown in Figure 16.18.
The 4.5 m wide x 4.5 m high extraction panel drives spaced every 28 m, and the 
4.5 m wide x 4.2 m high drawpoint drives, are considered to be supportable and adequate.

Page 316 of 519
Modelling suggests haulage level excavations could be subject to short term abutment 
stresses of up to 100 MPa associated with the passing of the leading edge of the cave. Stress 
levels along the haulage drives are reduced to 60–70 MPa underneath the active cave, then 
increase to 80–90 MPa once draw ceases. Because of its orientation relative to σH, stresses at 
the north limb haulage level are approximately 10 MPa lower than at the south limb for all 
stages.
Over time, immediately below the haulage level, stresses are modelled to increase to 
100 MPa or higher and remain at elevated levels. This suggests that the haulage drives are 
near the bottom of the stress shadow beneath the cave.
The main production orepasses are located along the central axis of the footprint strike. As 
illustrated in Figure 16.19, each orepass system is configured in a ‘Y’ shape where two 2.8 m 
diameter x 15 m long upper orepass legs (each supporting tonnage from one extraction 
drive) feed ore through a small storage bin into one 3.5 m diameter x 13 m long lower orepass 
leg. A truck chute is used to load material from the base of the 3.5 m diameter raise into 
haulage trucks.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 317 of 519
Geotechnical modelling of this arrangement, including exposure to elevated passing 
abutment stresses, illustrated highest stresses building in the area where the two upper 
orepass legs converge into the storage bin Y junction. To manage, the distance (or the pillar) 
between the converging upper orepass legs has been designed at a minimum of five metres. 
The orepass design is considered supportable and stable. From a geotechnical perspective, 
the short length of orepass legs minimises the time duration between excavating and 
installing steel lining, which aids in managing the risk of time dependent orepass failure. The 
mid-level access also provides an extra working platform if pre or post-support is required.
Different support regimes are proposed as a function of the anticipated ground conditions 
and induced stress regimes that may be encountered during the development and 
operation of the Lift 1 caves.
Two main support categories are specified for heading profiles, relating to ‘Good’ ground 
(Rock Mass Rating) and ‘Poor’ ground. For on-footprint development, 80% of the ground is
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 318 of 519
classified as Good and 20% as Poor. For off-footprint development, 90% of the ground is 
classified as Good and 10% as Poor. A review of geotechnical conditions for on-footprint 
development carried out late in the Feasibility Study programme indicated that a split of 60% 
Good ground and 40% Poor ground may be more representative.  The costing of the 
underground has used the 60% Good ground and 40% Poor ground assumption.
The following ground support elements are included in all ground support designs:
  Fibre-reinforced shotcrete between 50–100 mm thickness, having a minimum UCS of
20 MPa in 72 hours; 30 MPa in seven days; and 40 MPa in 28 days.
  Rock bolts 25 mm diameter, threaded, fully-encapsulated resin-grouted thread bars with
a minimum yield strength of 200 kN. All rock bolts will have a standard bearing and 
domed face plates. The minimum bolt length is 2.4 m.
  Cable bolts installed at all intersections will be 18 mm and 22 mm single-strand cables 
with a minimum yield strength of 331 kN and 510 kN, respectively, installed with a high-
tensile domed face plate. For zones of high deformations such as on footprint or 
strainburst-prone rock masses, cables are to be installed with a two metre debonded 
section at the collar and pre-tensioned to 10 tonnes. Cable bolts are also installed in any 
drive profile greater than 6.0 m wide.
  The ground support for all major excavations (namely the crusher chambers, ore bins,
etc.) have been designed to minimise the deformations predicted by the modelling and 
to avoid any later rehabilitation, which will be extremely difficult to undertake due to 
either construction or production activities.
The ground support recommendations proposed are based on the anticipated average 
ground conditions and stress regime; hence, these are minimum support requirements and 
additional ground support may be required where the conditions demand. Additional 
ground support elements include:
  An additional shotcrete layer from floor to floor will be applied for poor ground
classification and for extraction-level and haulage-level drives for added support and to 
embed mesh layer.
  Debonded cable bolts will be installed in high-stress areas such as extraction drives and
haulage drives.
  A yielding rock bolt, diamond/chain mesh, and debonded cable bolt installation is
proposed for the strain prone zones.
  Strapping on the extraction level, installed around pillar ribs including bullnoses and
camel backs, will be the OSRO/Cable strap design.
  Steel will be installed in each drawpoint on the extraction level to support drawpoint
drive and brow area.
Underground development support recommendations have been standardised for all 
heading types and ground conditions.
The proposed cave monitoring system includes a micro-seismic system, Time Domain 
Reflectometers (TDR), extensometers, and open drillholes. Cave flow monitoring systems 
comprise Smart Markers, Network Markers, and Cave trackers (Elexon Pty Ltd) installed
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 319 of 519
primarily down surface drillholes. These systems are safeguards against potential hazards and 
increase the understanding of cave flow for adjusting draw strategy to optimise recovery.
Panel caving has been the basis for underground mine planning at Hugo North since order-
of-magnitude studies were carried out in 2005. The weak, massive nature of the orebody and 
its location between 700 m and 1,400 m below surface make it well suited both 
geotechnically and economically to the large-scale caving method of underground mining. 
Caving requires a large early capital investment but is highly productive and has low 
operating costs. The long operating life of the mine supports this initial capital investment.
Hugo North Lift 1 will use the panel caving mine method to extract ore, which will be 
transported through a shaft hoist and conveyor to a surface ore handling system. The Lift 1 
mining levels are approximately 1,300 m below surface. The orebody has average dimensions 
of 2,000 m long x 280 m wide. A total of 2,231 drawpoints are planned to be developed within 
the mining footprint, accessed from 52 extraction drives.
The mine design consists of 203 km of lateral development, five shafts, and two decline 
tunnels from surface. Five shafts are required to provide access for mining personnel and 
equipment, for production, and for intake and exhaust ventilation-ways. The primary life of-
mine ore handling system will transport ore to surface by a series of conveyors to surface. An 
overview of Lift 1 is shown in Figure 16.20. Table 16.12 outlines the development quantities.

The focus of the Feasibility Study mine design is to demonstrate the technical and financial 
feasibility of Hugo North Lift 1, to optimise ore production potential, and to manage capital 
cost.
Shaft 1 is the existing pre-production access and services shaft. It is 6.7 m in diameter, 
concrete-lined, equipped with fixed-guides, and, sunk to a depth of 1,385 m. The steel 
headframe supports two winders. One winder operates a double-deck, six-tonne capacity 
cage (1.5 m x 3 m) with a personnel capacity of 32 people per deck. The other winder 
operates two 9.5 tonne skips with 3.5 ktpd muck hoisting capacity. Mine air heaters 
connected to a sub-collar plenum provide heated intake air. Underground fans connected 
to ducts in the shaft provide exhaust ventilation during the pre-production period.
Shaft 2 will be a dual-purpose service and production shaft and a primary intake ventilation 
shaft. It will be 10 m diameter, concrete-lined, equipped with fixed guides, and sunk to a 
depth of 1,284 m. The shaft will be equipped with a service cage and have a capacity of 
39 tonnes and be able to accommodate a peak of 150 persons on a single deck.
Mine personnel and material access will commence through Shaft 1. Personnel utilise the 
Shaft 1 1300 level station for mine access with materials delivered to the 1344 station until 
commissioning of Shaft 2. Shaft 2 will be the primary access for personnel, equipment, and 
materials upon service cage commissioning in mid-2017.
Primary access from Shaft 2 is along two access drives that connect the Shaft 2 1256 service 
level station to the main workshops, offices, and extraction level. Traffic will travel in a 
clockwise direction from Shaft 2 to the workshops and mine workings in the footprint area.
Six distinct levels will be developed to support Lift 1 of the Hugo North mine. These are shown 
in Figure 16.21, followed by a cross-section through the production footprint in Figure 16.22. 
The mine footprint is divided into three mining panels: Panel 0, Panel 1, and Panel 2. The 
panel division allows the apex, undercut and extraction drives to be oriented to optimise the 
undercut face length. It also allows alignment to major fault structures and principle stress as 
the ore body dimension changes along strike.

The apex and undercut levels provide access tunnels for production drilling and blasting with 
the purpose of undercutting the orebody. Production holes are drilled from undercut level 
tunnels up and into parallel tunnels on the apex level. Development of the apex level allows 
inspection for undercut drillhole deviation prior to each blast.
The extraction level is designed for the efficient development of drawbells and LHD operation 
to extract ore from drawpoints. The undercut is situated 17 m above the extraction level to 
provide adequate pillar between the levels. The undercut and apex drives are parallel to the 
extraction level production drives.
The extraction level drives will be spaced 28 m apart, using an El Teniente-style drawbell 
layout with 15 m spacing. The drawpoints are oriented at a 60° angle to the extraction drives 
to optimise the pillar size between drawbells and accommodate loader access. The 
extraction drives drain from the centre to the perimeter drives to stop water from flowing into 
the exhaust raises and orepasses.
The purpose of the haulage level is to collect material from the extraction level and undercut 
level and transport it to crushers for size reduction. The haulage level will be 44 m below the 
extraction level. It is designed to support one-way traffic from the crusher to the truck loading 
chutes and returning to the crusher. In general, it is located under the centre of the footprint,
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 324 of 519
serving orepasses from each extraction drift. Haulage drives will be driven 5.4 m wide x 6.1 m 
high with fully arched back profile.
The intake ventilation system is designed to provide fresh air to the mining footprint level, main 
travel ways, working areas within the mine, and the fixed facilities.
Fresh air for the mining footprint level will be supplied through two sets of two intake tunnels 
parallel to the extraction perimeter drives, 5.0 m wide x 5.5 m high, running the length of the 
footprint. A series of 3 m diameter raises will connect the intake drives to the perimeter drives 
on the extraction level.
The exhaust ventilation level allows passage of used air out of the mine. Fresh air enters the 
east and west side of the mining footprint, removing dust from LHD mucking, and exhausts 
down a two metre diameter central ventilation raise adjacent to the orepasses. Two parallel 
drives on the exhaust level, 5.8 m wide x 6.5 m high, will run the length of the orebody along 
the centre of orebody axis.
Exhaust drives also connect to exhaust raises from the haulage level in each truck loading 
chamber to collect dust from the truck-loading chutes. Return air will exit the mine through 
6.0 m high x 7.0 m wide return air drives.
The conveyor to surface and parallel service drive are pressurised with fresh air from Shaft 3, 
allowing dust generated from the conveyors to be exhausted to surface.
Trucks haul ore from chutes to crushers on the west side of the mining footprint. Ore is crushed 
and transferred by a series of conveyors directly to surface or to the Shaft 2 hoisting system. 
Truck shop facilities will be constructed west of Crusher 1 location to provide optimal access 
and to minimise truck downtime.
The conveyor-to-surface system consists of one 130 m conveyor that transport ores from 
Transfer 5 to three 2,200 m conveyors up to surface. This will be the primary ore handling route 
for the LOM. Shaft 2 will serve as the initial ore handling route to surface until the conveyor-to-
surface system is commissioned. At this time the Shaft 2 system will serve as a backup ore 
handling system.
Vertical development will include shaft development, orepasses, and ventilation raises. With 
the exception of the shafts, all vertical development is planned to be done with raisebore 
and boxhole machines.
Five shafts will be required to support Lift 1 of the Hugo North mine. A list of the shafts is in 
Table 16.13.

Two types of orepasses will be constructed to handle the production and development muck 
from the extraction and undercut levels:
  Central orepasses
  Perimeter orepasses.
The ore bin will be raisebored from the exhaust level at a 3.5 m excavated diameter, 14.5 m 
long with a dip angle of 70° to the haulage truck chute chamber. The orepasses will be 
raisebored at a 2.8 m excavated diameter, 18 m long with a dip angle of 65° from the 
exhaust level to the extraction level. After being excavated, the orepasses will be lined with 
20–50 mm rolled-steel plate (thickness dependent on throughput) capable of handling rock 
flow wear up 24 Mt.
Most of the ventilation raises will be 3 m diameter and range from 20–100 m long. An 
exception is the central exhaust raises, which are relatively short (16 m) and will be 
excavated at a two metre diameter. All ventilation raises will be supported with remotely 
applied fibre shotcrete.
Several mass excavations will be required to support Lift 1 of the Hugo North mine. Each will 
have unique support requirements and excavation methodology, depending on ground 
conditions, geometry, access, and overall functionality. Feasibility level designs and 
excavation plans have been done for the largest and most complex of these excavations, as 
listed in Table 16.14.

The underground mine will require a number of surface facilities to support the overall 
Oyu Tolgoi operation.
Current facilities at the collar of Shaft 1 were constructed as required and have been 
expanded to suit requirements. Current facilities include offices, dryhouse, warehouse, lamp 
room, shop, generators, boiler plant, and miscellaneous ancillary facilities. Most of these 
facilities will stay in service until the completion of the mine construction in 2020.
The production shaft area will include the collars of Shafts 2, 3, and 5. Also in this area are the 
220 kV substation, shaft take-away conveyors, and overland conveyor to the concentrator 
coarse ore stockpile. The permanent mine office and dryhouse will be located near the collar 
of Shaft 2.
The Shaft 4 area will be equipped with the main exhaust fans and an electrical substation.
The underground conveyor to surface system will connect to a surface take-away conveyor 
and onto the overland conveyor.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Load haul dump (LHD) muckers will deliver run of mine ore from draw points to the grizzly 
stations on the extraction level.
Orepasses will connect the grizzly stations to the truck loading stations at the haulage level. 
Each in line truck loading station will be equipped with a hydraulically operated loading 
chute, complete with variable throat openings and active lip for total flow control, to load 
the haul trucks. The truck loading stations will be located at the perimeter and central 
orepasses to load the 160 t capacity (2 x 80 tonne trailers) side dump Powertrans road trains. 
The trucks will deliver ore to two crushers.
The design capacity of each of the crushers is 4.0 ktph, which will satisfy the 95 ktpd 
production target. The crusher sizing has been refined to reflect the latest vendor information 
for two 1,600 mm x 2,400 mm top service ultra duty (TSU) gyratory crushers. Crushed ore 
discharges into a 640 tonne surge bin. Each crusher station will be equipped with a rock 
breaker and an overhead bridge crane for service. The station will be operated remotely 
from a central control facility on the surface.
Primary ore flow will be diverted toward the conveyor to surface system will feed a short 
transfer conveyor and onto the first of a series of three incline conveyors to the surface. The 
conveyor to surface system will be the primary ore handling system.
Ore diverted towards Shaft 2 via the short horizontal conveyor feeds into a two-way diverter 
chute installed above a 5.0 kt ore storage bin. Ore is either fed directly into this bin or diverted 
onto a short conveyor for discharge into a second 5.0 kt ore storage bin. Ore will be 
reclaimed from ore bins onto the skip loadout conveyor via apron feeders and be 
discharged to skips for hoisting material to surface.
The conveyor to surface incline conveyor will deliver ore to the new coarse ore stockpile feed 
conveyor and discharge material onto the stockpile. The stockpile feed conveyor will be 
parallel to the existing stockpile feed conveyor. The new stockpile feed conveyor will be 
similar in construction to the existing system for commonality of parts.
The total conveying and hoisting capacity from the underground is planned to be 
approximately 140 ktpd.  This conveyor to surface system is planned to move an average 
daily throughput of 95 ktpd. Simulation work by OT LLC suggested trucking to the conveyor to 
surface system could have a capacity of 106 ktpd. The Shaft 2 hoisting capacity is designed 
to be 30 ktpd and Shaft 1 hoisting capacity is designed to be 3.5 ktpd. The ore handling 
system will include five apron feeders and 16 belt conveyors. Two-way diverter chute will be 
arranged to optimise operability and maintainability and to reduce geotechnical risk 
associated with large excavations. The underground conveyor system is shown in Figure 16.23 
and Figure 16.24.

Shaft 1 is equipped with skips and a hoist with a capacity of 3.5 ktpd. This is intended to be 
used for development hoisting only, and not for production hoisting.
Production hoisting will be through Shaft 2. Shaft 2 will utilise two 60-tonne capacity bottom 
discharge skips to hoist the ore from underground to the surface. The design capacity of the 
hoist is 30 ktpd over a planned operating time of 19.2 hours.
When completed, Shaft 2 will be 10 m in diameter and equipped with rigid guides. Skips will 
be loaded by a conveyor loading arrangement located on the –28.2 mRL, 1,202.2 m below 
collar. The surface discharge of ore from the Shaft 2 skips will take place below collar level 
into an ore bin. The skip loading system is designed as an automated and continuous 
operation for loading the skips without stopping the loadout conveyors.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 330 of 519
The Shaft 2 skips will discharge ore into a 200 t capacity surface bin within the headframe. 
Ore will be reclaimed from the bin on an apron feeder. Reclaimed ore will be discharged 
onto the 1,400 mm wide Shaft 2 discharge conveyor running at a belt speed of 2.5 m/s.
The discharge conveyor will transfer ore onto the existing open pit overland conveyor and 
stockpile feed conveyor to deliver ore to the coarse ore stockpile.
The Shaft 2 skips will discharge ore into a 200 tonne-capacity surface bin within the 
headframe of Shaft 2. Ore will be reclaimed from the bin on an apron feeder. Reclaimed ore 
will be discharged onto the 1,400 mm wide Shaft 2 discharge conveyor running at a belt 
speed of 2.5 m/s. The discharge conveyor will transfer ore onto the existing open pit overland 
conveyor and stockpile feed Conveyor 1 to deliver ore to the coarse ore stockpile.
The conveyor to surface incline conveyor will deliver ore to the new coarse ore stockpile feed 
Conveyor 2, and discharge material onto the stockpile. The stockpile feed Conveyor 2 will be 
parallel to the existing stockpile feed Conveyor 1. The new stockpile feed conveyor will be 
similar in construction to the existing system for commonality of parts.
Before the Shaft 2 loadout and skip-hoisting system is commissioned, all rock will be hauled by 
50 tonne trucks to the Shaft 1 hoisting system. This will consist of a jaw crusher on top of a 
storage bin, with rock conveyed to a flask-loaded skip system.
At the time of commissioning the Shaft 2 loadout and skip-hoisting system, an 8.5 ktph jaw 
crusher will be installed on top of Shaft 2 ore storage bin 011, and the trucks will haul rock to 
this crusher as well as the Shaft 1 jaw crusher. The crusher discharge will be fed into the ore 
bin for loading into the skips in Shaft 2. This material will be delivered to the concentrator 
stockpile.
In 2018, the production gyratory crusher and conveying system from the orebody will be 
commissioned. At this time all production rock, and most development rock, will be handled 
through the production crusher and conveying system for delivery to the concentrator.
At full production, fresh air will enter the mine through one of three shafts and exit through 
two dedicated exhaust shafts as well as the conveyor to surface portal. The ventilation system 
is primarily a pull design with the main exhaust fans on exhaust shafts. The system components 
are outlined in Table 16.15 and Figure 16.25.
The ventilation system is designed to handle peak demand. This was determined by 
modelling the system for the year 2026 to simulate operating conditions at full production, 
when the maximum number of extraction drifts will have been opened for production. In 
addition, all off-footprint drifts will have been developed and all mine facilities incorporated 
into the ventilation plan.

Future design may consider the potential to add a ventilation management system that 
could be used to reduce airflow to non-operating headings and drifts in non-peak times, thus 
optimising ventilation performance and power usage.
The capacity of the ventilation system will increase incrementally as various shafts and fans 
are brought on line. Figure 16.26 shows the ventilation build-up and loads during the 
construction period to 2019.

The extraction level will be ventilated from both east and west fringes, as shown in 
Figure 16.27. Fresh air will enter the level through raises from the intake airways below the 
level. The air will travel through the extraction drifts to the centrally located exhaust raise and 
then down to the exhaust airway. This arrangement allows one mucker to work in fresh air at 
each end of the extraction drift.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Dust management will be required in various locations throughout the underground mine:
  Extraction Level Dust Control – The two main dust creation areas are the drawpoint
loading locations and the LHD dump locations. Each drawpoint will be fitted with water 
sprays to suppress dust. The extraction drift ventilation system will include intake raises 
along the rim drift and central exhaust raises.
  Haulage Level Truck Chute – Each central truck-loading chute will be fitted with an 
adjacent exhaust raise to remove dust directly to the exhaust circuit. At each of the 
two crusher truck dumps, air will be drawn across the dumping area, capturing the dust 
created and depositing it directly to an exhaust raise that feeds to the return air 
ventilation system. The exhaust connection is shown in Figure 16.28. The crusher dump 
locations will also be fitted with water sprays to suppress dust.
  Ore Handling – Dust collectors will be located on the apron feeders under each crusher. 
Transfer chutes will be enclosed and fitted with water sprays. Conveyors will be fitted with 
dust covers, with conveyor airflow along the direction of ore travel. Dust created from 
the Shaft 2 loadout will be removed directly to Shaft 5 as shown in Figure 16.29.
Mine air heaters will be installed on all intake shafts: Shaft 1, Shaft 2, and Shaft 3. Heaters will 
need to be running any time there is a possibility of the intake air being at freezing 
temperatures. The design temperature for the heated air entering the mine is +2°C. The 
system will use hot water from a central heating plant delivered to glycol heat exchangers to 
transfer heat to each mine air heater glycol loop, which in turn heats intake air from ambient 
to design discharge temperature.

The main warehousing area for the mine is the central warehouse on the surface. 
Underground warehousing facilities will also be available, divided among the five 
underground shop areas. Mine development materials such as pipe, rock bolts, wire mesh, 
etc., will be stored in cut outs, muck bays, and other temporary facilities near the working 
places.
The underground maintenance shops will consist of service bays/garages, auxiliary storage, 
and warehouse facilities for the maintenance of the underground mobile equipment fleet 
and fixed plant equipment. The maintenance facilities for the underground mine are 
summarised in Table 16.16.
Major equipment overhaul and rebuilds will be done in central service facilities on the 
surface. Tyre repairs and recapping will be done in a central tyre shop on the surface.

Underground equipment will be fuelled at one of three locations: the Shaft 1 maintenance 
shops, the extraction-level fuel station near the main shop, and the fuelling station on the 
haulage level. In addition, fuel/lube service trucks will deliver fuel to slow moving equipment 
such as drills that are not working in the vicinity of the permanent fuel stations. The fuel will be 
received and stored in surface storage tanks dedicated to the underground mine. Storage 
capacity will equal six weeks of fuel use at 44 kL/d, the maximum rate of consumption.
Fuel will be delivered in daily batches through a pipeline in a borehole from the surface 
storage facility to a single receiving station near the bottom of Shaft 1; the pipeline will be 
empty except during the transfer. From the fuel-receiving station, fuel will be transferred via 
transfer pipe or truck to fuelling stations on the extraction level, haulage level, and undercut 
level.
Lubricants will be supplied to the underground in totes, which will be stored in specifically 
designated drifts in the fuelling areas, sealed off with spillage bunds and fire doors. Waste oil 
will be collected in empty totes for delivery to the surface.
A single international supplier of explosive products for Oyu Tolgoi will supply blasting agents 
selected for underground mine development and production during project execution. As 
per Mongolian regulations, a maximum of three days’ production worth of explosives will be 
stored underground.
The main underground magazine will include storage areas for bulk explosive product 
reagents, packaged explosives, and detonators. A total of four storage bays will be provided 
within the magazine gates. Additional storage areas to house waste and equipment will be 
outside but in close proximity to the main magazine.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The main underground personnel facilities will be adjacent to the main maintenance shop on 
the extraction level, approximately 450 m from Shaft 2.
One section of the lunchroom is designed to function as the main refuge area. The capacity 
of this refuge area is restricted to 200 persons because of the limitations of the heat 
dissipation capability of the emergency cooling system within the parking drift. Therefore, 
during an emergency, some personnel will need to be relocated to other nearby refuge 
areas.
Portable refuge stations will be strategically located in areas of the mine for ease of access in 
the case of an emergency. These will include both permanent and a network of portable 
MineARC or similar 20-person refuge stations.
The underground mine will require the following services:
  Compressed air.
  Service water.
  Mine dewatering system.
  Fire protection.
  Shotcrete/concrete delivery.
  Electric power distribution.
  Communications, instrumentation, and data system.
The project schedule includes three major components: Development, Construction, and 
Production. Each schedule was developed separately but was linked to the others to 
develop an overall Life-of-Mine project schedule. Refining the schedules required multiple 
iterations to ensure all components matched and provided the optimal solution. Key inputs 
into the schedules were frozen in Q1’14. Based on these schedules, the key milestones to first 
ore are as shown in Table 16.17.

The development heading advance rates are based on simulations developed to model 
various advance scenarios, heading configurations, and crew situations. These rates are 
calibrated against actual job site performance and used in the scheduling package.
The development rates used for the schedule are summarised in Table 16.18.
The conveyor to surface (C2S) is developed from both surface and underground with 
planned breakthrough along CVB-020. The breakthrough location is driven by the availability 
of underground resources to commence incline development. Transfers are developed off 
critical path behind the advancing face by a dedicated mass excavation crew. Table 16.19 
outlines the development rates of the conveyor decline.

Development requirements will increase to a maximum of 13 crews in 2018, then gradually 
decrease until the mine is completely developed in 2032. Figure 16.30 shows the total metres 
per period, the general location of these metres, and the cumulative number of metres 
developed.

The underground mobile equipment fleet is classified into seven broad categories:
  Mucking
  Haulage
  Drilling
  Raisebore / boxhole
  Utility and underground support
  Surface support
  Light vehicles
The underground equipment fleet will increase in size from currently more than 90 units to a 
more than 290 units in 2019. Fleet size and composition will fluctuate with demand and 
changes in the work requirements. Figure 16.31 shows the LOM equipment fleet. Each unit of 
equipment is scheduled for a major rebuild at 60% of its forecast life and will be replaced at 
100% of scheduled life. Table 16.20 shows the planned life of select major classes of 
equipment.

The IA with the GOM requires that the workforce consist of predominantly Mongolian 
nationals, but recognises the need for foreign technical and managerial expertise during the 
early years of the operation. The IA sets specific ceilings for the ratio of Mongolian citizens to 
expatriates at different stages of mine construction and operations. The ratios used for the 
underground mine are outlined in Table 16.21.

OT LLC will develop and operate a training facility and training programme for miners, 
mechanics, process plant operators, and technicians. Development of the training 
programme is continuing with input from OT LLC and major contractors and in coordination 
with the GOM.
The area-specific training programmes are grouped into categories as defined in the Training 
Management Plan – Underground Operation. These categories are:
  Mobile equipment operations.
  Technical and trade.
  Fixed plant operations.
  Lifting equipment.
  Blasting.
  Safety.
  People management.
The Hugo North mine will be highly mechanised. To satisfy its need for skilled equipment 
operators, the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine department will use computerised equipment 
simulators to be used for training operators. This programme has been successful to date and 
will continue to be expanded to match the ramp-up in the number of employees.
The 2014 OTTR has examined production from open pit mining of the SOT zones and 
underground mining from Hugo North. OT LLC has prepared both the open pit and 
underground mining work and schedules. The case adopted for the 2014 OTTR assumes no 
plant capacity, is based on Mineral Reserves only, does not include Inferred Mineral 
Resources, and does not include underground mining areas other than Hugo North Lift 1.
The following scheduling methodology was used to balance mine, mill, and stockpile 
quantities:
  Underground ore is designated as the priority feed. After the available underground ore
is fed to the plant, the additional capacity is met with open pit ore.
  Plant throughput capacity is determined by calculating the available mills hours after the
underground ore is processed.
  The production schedule is based on Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves only. No
Inferred resources were used.
  The open pit schedules were based on mining inventories by bench reported within the
pit stages.
  Low-grade stockpiling was used to balance the mining rate where necessary.

The underground production schedule was developed using PCBC, a cave modelling 
software package. The production start date is scheduled for 1 November 2018, following 
commissioning of the primary crusher and conveyor system to Shaft 2. The production rate will 
ramp-up from 2018–2026, when the mine begins producing at a steady-state rate of 95 ktpd.

Highlights of the production schedule are summarised below:
  Southwest open pit ore is the main concentrator feed during the first five years of
operations. The first central ore is mined in 2019.
  During 2025–2035 the underground reaches a steady state production rate of 95 ktpd.
The open pit production is maintained to fill the remaining concentrator capacity.
  The underground will be completed in 2038 and open pit production is increased to fill
the concentrator until the open pit is completed in 2055.
The processing schedule was balanced to meet the available mill hours after the 
underground material was processed.
The processing schedule by metallurgical ore type with the copper, gold, and silver feed 
grades are shown in Figure 16.36. Total concentrate production by ore type is shown in Figure 
16.37. The recovered copper, gold, and silver production is in Figure 16.38 to Figure 16.40. The 
production schedule is in Table 16.24.

Oyu Tolgoi is being developed in phases:
  Phase 1 – all work required to bring the Southwest zone orebody into full commercial 
production through commissioning and ramp-up of Lines 1 and 2, by the addition of 
essential services and infrastructure. The Phase 1 concentrator was commissioned in early 
2013. Nameplate capacity of 96 ktpd was achieved 6 August 2013. Operating data 
acquired since that time have been used in Phase 2 design, which addresses the delivery 
of Hugo North ore via underground Lift 1 in conjunction with open pit mining.
  Phase 2 – all additional work required to process Hugo North Lift 1 production plus open
pit ore to match Phase 1 SAG mill capacity, including:
-  The addition of a fifth ball mill to achieve a finer primary grind P80 of 150–160 µm for a
blend of Hugo North and open pit ores, compared to 180 µm for Southwest.
-  Additional roughing and column flotation capacity to process the higher level of
concentrate production when processing the higher grade Hugo North ore.
-  Additional concentrate dewatering and bagging capacity.
-  Minimal allowance for incremental expansion beyond Phase 2 other than to ensure
that Phase 2 will not interfere with possible future expansion.
The concentrator commenced ore commissioning in January 2013 with production of first 
copper-gold concentrate on 31 January 2013 and has been ramping up to full production. 
Commercial production was achieved in September 2013
The ramp-up of the concentrator is progressing at a rate that would be normally expected for 
a project of this scale. Mill throughput is ramping up to the nominal 100 ktpd design capacity, 
with milled throughput exceeding design in April, 2014.
Concentrator feed grades have been consistently lower than planned, particularly for 
copper, planned 2013 average 0.57% 2014 average to date 0.60%, and gold planned 2013 
average 0.76 g/t 2014 average to date 0.99 g/t. As a result recoveries to concentrate have 
been lower than planned. Concentrator performance, as measured by recovery, has 
improved with operating experience and improving head grade.
Concentrate production has progressively increased, as a combination of increasing mill 
throughput and grade and improvements in concentrator performance with recovery. 
Concentrates grades have been at or near design, particularly for copper, despite lower 
feed grades, as a result metal production has improved as mill throughput and feed grade 
have improved.

The metallurgical parameters used for the 2014 OTTR were issued in BDT31. The relevant 
metallurgical data and formulae are shown in Table 17.1 to Table 17.5. These parameters 
were used for the 2014 Mineral Reserve estimate. Further details are available in 
Section 13.4.2.
The parameters used for Hugo North were applied to all Hugo North including the Entrée 
(Shivee Tolgoi) ore. Although only limited testwork has been carried out on the EJV area it is 
considered that the results indicate the Entrée area is similar to the rest of Hugo North.
The throughput rate algorithm is as used in IDP10 and was developed by SGS from regression 
analysis of CEET simulation runs for 30,000 Southwest zone blocks over Years 1–30 and the SGS 
database of projects. This formula was applied to all the blocks in the mining model and used 
for production scheduling.

The parameters described below are considered the major capacity determinants for the 
OTFS14 concentrator conversion design.
The peak production plateau from the underground mine is 95 ktpd / 33.25 Mtpa, with 
additional tonnage supplied from open pit orebodies to progressively higher limits set by:
  SAG milling capacity (annual average tonnage varies primarily with SPI from 81–
117 ktpd).
  Ball milling capacity (soft constraint, with pumping and cyclone changes, but ultimately
limited by flotation losses).
  Tailings pumping volumetric capacity (approximately 121 ktpd through one tailings line
after applying 92% availability).
  Flotation and concentrate handling equipment (approximately 125 ktpd at peak
underground heads, whenever open pit ore is not available).
  Current water permit limit of 870 L/s with seasonal water balance variation at the tailings
dam from summer evaporation, winter ice formation, and spring thaw (steady-state 
tonnage limit still undefined but expected to be up to 145 ktpd at OTFS14 average 
annual unit raw water projection of 0.47 m3/t (concentrator only) with wastewater 
recycle to tailings thickeners).
The capacity of the grinding circuit to receive ore is measured in terms of available mill hours 
at a specific rate. This is expressed as TPUT, the annual tonnage achievable in 8,059 running 
hours (92% availability) through Lines 1–2. Design was based upon the then-current MP08v2
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

‘No Expansion’ mine plan. The Central zone ores are particularly soft and have 
correspondingly high TPUT values. The capacity to treat them is limited by other plant 
constraints such as the hydraulic limitations of the tailings system.
The concentrator volumetric capacity may be dependent on either the concentrate or 
tailings production rates. The OTFS14 production basis is to operate at the lesser of TPUT or the 
tailings handling capacity (121 ktpd, or 44.2 Mtpa).
Completion of the concentrator conversion is driven by the underground cave production 
ramp-up schedule. Commissioning is scheduled for June 2021, at which point underground 
ore is projected to comprise 23% of concentrator feed, with corresponding stress on the 
original Phase 1 grinding, flotation, and dewatering capacity design criteria. Mining of 
Central zone ores with a high As:Cu ratio will elevate arsenic in the final concentrate, and so 
requires co-processing of low As:Cu ratio ores, such as Hugo North. Production sequencing to 
avoid penalty or rejection levels of arsenic is discussed in Section 17.3.4.
Separate processing of Hugo North ore was recommended in the 2009 Technical Evaluation 
Group (TEG) review and adopted in IDOP and DIDOP. However, following the independent 
decision to constrain Phase 2 to the original two grinding lines in Phase 1, there was found to 
be little potential to segregate processing conditions because of the Phase 1 plant design, 
where the products from the separate grinding lines are combined before flotation. Even if it 
proved possible to provide separate and equal flotation and pumping capacities for each 
line, and to replicate the sampling arrangements for separate processing and accounting for 
tailings streams, there remained little ability to separate the process water systems to allow 
independent pH control of both flotation circuits.
It was subsequently decided to select a compromise of grinding and flotation conditions for 
the different ores, and to process underground and open pit ores by blending through 
Lines 1 and 2. Hugo North would provide up to 95 ktpd of the maximum concentrator 
capacity of 121 ktpd. Open pit feed would vary as required to keep the concentrator at its 
maximum capacity. This also led to a change in philosophy, where grinding synergy would be 
maximised by combining hard and soft ores for maximum capacity and minimum unit cost, 
while trying to minimise the consequences of negative flotation synergy in terms of sub-
optimal concentrate grade and recovery at compromise conditions. This has had a negative 
impact on Central zone ore reserves of recoverable metal, but a positive impact on project 
economics.
The optimum conditions for treatment of Southwest zone, Hugo North, and Central zone ores 
vary significantly in terms of primary grind and regrind sizes and also in operating pH in 
flotation roughing and cleaning. Hugo North ore carries the highest value and so compromise 
processing conditions are set much closer to those that are optimal for its copper and gold 
recovery, than for those that are optimal for Central zone ore metallurgy. As a consequence, 
recovery and grade from the Central zone ores have been reduced, as discussed in 
Section 13.2.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The production schedule has evolved from IDP07 to the current OTFS14. The plan that has 
persisted is to process all of the high-value underground ore while displacing lower value 
open pit ore. As the cave matures, softer Central zone ore will be delivered up to the 
concentrator grinding or tailings handling capacity. When underground production 
eventually decreases, the total plant capacity will again decline with a return to harder 
Southwest zone ore, where the lower copper head grades and concentrate grades allow less 
blending of soft, high-arsenic Central zone ore, without exceeding maximum arsenic in 
concentrate limits or falling below minimum copper grade targets.
Figure 17.1 shows the Reserve Case production schedule by ore type. Soft constraints on 
maximum concentrate production and arsenic content and minimum concentrate grade 
are respected in the mine scheduling process, with a hard limit on volumetric capacity when 
processing soft ore types.
‒
Keeping the conversion equipment ramp-up and the transition of Phase 1 from Southwest 
zone to underground and Central zone ores in step presents several challenges and 
opportunities. The open pit and underground development schedules must to be reviewed 
continuously in future work to maintain a feasible production schedule.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 357 of 519
To ensure concentrate marketability with less than 5,000 ppm of arsenic (rejection limit) in 
every concentrate shipment, large volumes of higher arsenic Central zone ore can only be 
processed when accompanied by a suitable volume of low-arsenic, high-copper Hugo North 
ore. Such volumes are available only after Hugo North approaches full capacity through the 
concentrator.
After commissioning the conversion equipment, the Phase 2 circuit is scheduled to operate at 
77% open pit ore / 23% Hugo North ore in mid-2021. It is appropriate to construct and 
commission the conversion equipment in reverse order from the traditional ‘front-to-back’ 
process flow order, since the initial exposure is due to lack of concentrate handling capacity, 
rather than lack of grinding capacity.
A review and update of the conversion schedule should be carried out when the study is 
upgraded. This may indicate value in earlier installation of flotation capacity, especially if 
debottlenecking efforts upstream are successful.
The ramp-up profile for the conversion equipment is faster than for Phase 1, which was 
originally benchmarked at the 65th percentile for large copper concentrator start-ups, but 
was subsequently corrected for staggering the twin lines (Table 17.7).
  The dual line ramp-up profile is two months longer than the individual profile for either line 
to avoid overloading the construction, commissioning, and operating resources. Similarly, 
ramp-up for conversion equipment will be shorter than even for an individual line start-
up, since each component can be brought on in parallel and is not required to run the 
other components.
  Concentrator utility tie-ins will be made in advance of Phase 2 commissioning, leaving
fewer systems to troubleshoot.
  Hugo North and open pit ore will be delivered evenly onto the stockpiles for both Lines 1
and 2. However, for full-scale advance testing of operating conditions, Hugo North ore 
could be campaigned through one line during a scheduled shutdown of the other 
grinding circuit in Phase 1 in order to gain operating experience without overloading the 
flotation and dewatering areas.

For the conversion, with the feed change to softer underground and Central zone ores, the 
milling capacity could exceed the volumetric capacity of the Phase 1 tailings system. To take 
account of this limitation, the Phase 2 concentrator capacity is redefined to 5.5 ktph, or
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

121 ktpd, at 92% concentrator availability.
The final concentrate production schedule is shown in Figure 17.2. As compared to the LOM 
in Figure 17.1, the tonnage and concentrate production peaks occur in different years 
because throughput is limited either by the milling power or the volumetric constraint, while 
concentrate production is dependent on ore feed grade. Table 17.8 compares the 
concentrator conversion limiting design criteria with the OTFS14 production schedule annual 
peak values.

In 2013, it was determined that the Line 3 concentrator expansion to 160 ktpd ore throughput, 
as described in the 2012 DIDOP report, could not be approved given project financing 
constraints. Instead, a concentrator conversion was investigated, incorporating incremental 
changes to the Phase 1 plant to treat a blend containing majority higher grade Hugo North 
underground ore. The Hugo North orebody has characteristics compatible with the 
conventional SAG milling, ball milling, and flotation technology used in the Phase 1 plant. The 
conversion includes additional ball mill power to allow a finer flotation feed size compared 
with the Phase 1 grind size; this, in turn, will increase the flotation recovery of copper and 
gold. Use of the conventional flowsheet maximises use of the existing Phase 1 concentrator 
assets for treatment of Hugo North ore and has low process risk.
For the OTFS14 Line 3 expansion, several comminution variants on the basic process route 
were investigated. These included: buffer stockpiles, gravity gold separation, mine-to-mill 
optimisation, secondary crushing or HPGR, two-stage ball milling, rougher flotation, regrind 
milling, additional regrind ball storage, cleaner flotation, Jameson cell retrofit.
Simulation of the process mass balance was undertaken for the Phase 2 expansion.
For OTFS14, a concentrator design throughput of 121 ktpd was selected based on the mill 
volumetric constraint. The potential to overload the concentrate handling system due to high 
copper grades in the individual orebodies was examined and considered highly unlikely, 
given the capacity headroom available. The copper grades that would be required to 
overload the system exceed all values in the mine plan and any reasonable likelihood of 
short-term variation above those plan values, mainly because of the large number of 
underground drawpoints that are open at any one time.
The process inputs modelled to match MP08v2 have been confirmed to meet the final 
production schedule in OTFS14.
At the feasibility level, there was no significant need to track particles by size, and so few unit 
operation types were required to simulate the concentrator. The most common were 
flotation cells, mix tanks, distributors, splitters, phase separators, filters, thickeners, and pumps.
The recovery and grades calculated in the model were based on correlations developed in 
the laboratory flotation programme and integrated with metallurgical predictions in the mine 
production schedule. Copper recovery has been correlated against copper head grade. 
Copper grade in concentrate has been correlated to the Cu:S ratio in ore.
In the model, no recovery distinction was made between individual copper species, e.g., for 
Hugo North the recoveries of chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite were set as equal and 
were dictated by the calculated overall copper recovery. In the flotation model, recoveries 
were stated for gold, silver, arsenic, fluorine, and pyrite. The desired grade was achieved by 
dilution with gangue minerals in proportion to their presence in the feed stream to the 
flotation units. The correlations used in the model are shown in Table 17.9.

Recirculating loads have been altered between Phase 1 and 2. In Phase 1, cleaner 
scavenger concentrate was recycled to the regrind circuit, increasing the flow through the 
regrind cyclones. In the current model, the scavenger concentrate is returned directly to the 
cleaner flotation cells. The assumption is that material once reground to a certain size is 
unlikely to benefit by return to the same circuit with pre-classification and the same product 
size criterion.
A 200% circulating load is assumed for the regrind circuit processing only rougher 
concentrate, compared to 100% in the Phase 1 design. This reflects the impact of material 
that has already been reground no longer being present in the new feed to the regrind 
circuit. These modifications allow Lines 1 and 2 to continue to operate without modification of 
the regrind classification and pumping circuits.
The mass balance model allowed the assessment of all unit operations from the coarse ore 
stockpiles to concentrate dewatering, tailings disposal, water reclaim, and tailings storage

facility (TSF) evaporation. Thus it was possible to effectively evaluate the overall process and 
raw water demands and the impacts on shared facilities such as pebble crushing, 
concentrate handling, tailings thickening, and the TSF.
The process design criteria are the key elements used for plant design. This section discusses 
the overall design assumptions and constraints for selection of equipment for the major 
process plant duties. The DIDOP design criteria have been modified to accommodate the 
concentrator conversion for OTFS14. They include, for example, criteria for sizing the SAG and 
ball mills, pebble crushers, flotation cells, regrind Vertimills, filtration and thickening units, and 
concentrate storage and bagging facilities.
As discussed above, two mine plans were generated during the execution of the project: 
MP08v2 at the commencement of the study, and Mine Plan 2014 (MP2014) closer to 
completion of OTFS14. Mass balance flows and ore analyses for plant design were taken from 
the MP08v2 based on year 2021, the year of peak concentrate production and near-peak 
overall tonnage processed. All concentrator conversion upgrades were based on MP08v2.
The mine plan MP2014 issued during the course of the project was designed to narrow the 
difference between the grinding and hydraulic limits by controlling the admixture of 
Central zone ore over much of the mine life. Because the mine plan was designed with these 
constraints, minimal changes to the major processes were required. The co-processing of 
Hugo North and Central zone ore allows the low-arsenic, high-copper Hugo North to dilute 
the high-arsenic Central zone ore to keep the concentrate below penalty limits (3,000 ppm 
arsenic). After providing additional capability with the 5th ball mill, grinding and volumetric 
throughput were maximised by allowing the flotation feed P80 to flex within the range already 
experienced with finer-grained ore in Phase 1.
The development of the design criteria is an iterative process in which process assumptions 
must match and keep pace with test results, mine plans, economic constraints, vendor data, 
etc. For example:
  Grinding testwork and preliminary mill selection provide the key capacity input to the
mine, resulting in a production plan. In many cases, increments are determined by the 
largest available equipment or the size of the equipment already installed to minimise 
holding costs for insurance spares.
  Flotation recoveries and concentrate analyses provide the head grade-related capacity
and product quality constraints used to tune the mine plan to maximise NSR while still 
producing a readily marketable product.
  The production plan is incorporated into the design criteria and ultimately drives the next
mass balance.
  The mass balance usually identifies shortfalls or inconsistencies that demonstrate the
need for additional testwork before ultimately refining the production plan.
The capacity of the concentrator conversion plant is constrained by the tailings volumetric 
capacity when softer Hugo North and Central zone ores are processed, and then reverts to 
the grinding TPUT (throughput) when Southwest zone ore processing resumes in 2038.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 362 of 519
The tailings volumetric capacity is based on the maximum motor power installed for pumping 
tailings through the overland tailings pipeline to the TFS. This limit is similar to that derived from 
recent CFD analysis of the tailings thickener feed distributor. The TPUT constraint is based on 
parameters developed in the grinding testwork, notably SPI (SAG mill Performance Index), 
MBI (Modified Bond Index) and Ci (Minnovex Crushing Index). These parameters are inputs to 
the Minnovex formulae that generate the grinding model outputs, specifically TPUT 
(throughput, or instantaneous grinding rate) and the P80 product sizing to flotation feed.
The current MP2014 mine plan is compared with the MP08v2 peak design mine plan and 
concentrator design envelopes in Figure 17.3 and Figure 17.4. While the production schedules 
shift, there is less than 1.0% difference in peak ore delivery or concentrate production.
Metallurgical grades and recovery models developed from testwork used for flotation 
predictions are based on meeting the optimum primary and regrind ranges, which has been 
the design objective. An additional ball mill (Ball Mill 5) was required to compensate for the 
higher SAG mill capacity with underground and Central zone ore feed. The softer ore results in 
a higher SAG throughput, but requires a higher ball mill to SAG mill power ratio to maintain 
flotation feed P80.
The Ball Mill 5 circuit is identical to the existing four ball mill lines and will be operated in 
parallel with them. For MP08v2, the total ball milling power was capable of achieving a 
predicted P80 of 140 µm when Southwest zone and Hugo North were to be processed 
concurrently and Central zone ore was to be introduced only as Hugo North production 
ramped down. However, in MP2014, Hugo North and Central zone ore are processed 
together to reduce concentrate arsenic levels and maximise capacity. As a result, the 
predicted P80 in the MP2014 production schedule exceeds 150 µm continuously from 2021–
2037, at the height of Hugo North production.
Figure 17.5 shows the predicted flotation feed P80 along with the ore specific P80 targets and 
percentage of Hugo North in mill feed. Hugo North ore is not particularly sensitive to the 
primary grind size, but the addition of the fifth roughing bank increases retention time by 25% 
to compensate.

In addition, a contingency plan exists for configuration of the fifth mill in series rather than in 
parallel, should additional SAG mill capacity be developed by upstream debottlenecking. 
Flotation feed top size is controlled more effectively by series operation than by parallel 
operation, especially when the new feed to the circuit is pre-classified at a size coarse 
enough to allow additional grinding effort to be directed only to the coarsest 20 wt% of 
particles with the lowest recovery, rather than spreading it across the entire distribution that is 
coarser than the target grind. The net effect is a steeper flotation feed particle size 
distribution.
The regrind circuit has ample capacity to maintain the target grind for efficient concentrate 
cleaning at 121 ktpd capacity, as indicated in Figure 17.5.
The metallurgical relationships developed are typically correlations between copper head 
grade and recovery and Cu:S ratio for concentrate grade.
Flotation cell criteria are compared in Table 17.11 at the peak head grade condition. 
Retention times are specified per cell, with eight cells in line in roughing, four cells in cleaning, 
and four cells in cleaner scavenging.

Flotation circuit design is constrained by layout, available area, cell froth-carrying capacity 
limits, and minimum residence time requirements. Because of the change to much higher 
grade Hugo North ore, eight additional 160 m3 rougher bank cells have been selected for 
installation in the flotation area reserved for expansion in the Phase 1 design. An additional 
rougher bank was selected over a cleaner and cleaner scavenger bank because the 
rougher circuit was approaching its carrying capacity limits, as well as the rougher stage 
recovery being lower than the cleaner stage recovery in operation on Southwest ore. 
Residence time considerations are limited to maintaining minimum per cell residence times of 
2.5 minutes to minimise short-circuiting potential. The rougher and cleaner cell retention 
scale-up factors relative to the latest SGS bench testwork are1.65 and 2.5, respectively.
The design cleaning circuit recovery, at 3.0% copper in the feed, is 96%. With rougher losses, 
this equates to 93% overall copper recovery at peak head grade. By virtue of the head 
grade-recovery relationship, recoveries are projected to fall to 91% at average Hugo North 
heads of 1.66% Cu and to 87% at the Reserve Case average head grade of 0.84%. For 
comparison purposes, Southwest zone ore currently demonstrates 90%+ recoveries at head 
grades in this range, but is unburdened by the higher pyrite content in a 20% admixture of 
high-pyrite Central zone ore.
Additional column cells have been included to process the expected increased volume of 
concentrate. The column cell dimensions are identical to Phase 1 (5.5 m diameter x 16 m 
high). The concentrator conversion will require six new columns.
The concentrate thickener sizing parameters were based on testwork performed by 
FL Smidth; it was determined that one additional 23 m diameter thickener, identical to the 
two supplied in Phase 1, will be required. Although the Phase 2 concentrate volumes are 
triple the concentrate volumes in Phase 1, the Phase 1 concentrate thickeners were so 
significantly over-sized that the addition of a third similar thickener will suffice for the 
conversion. The intent is to run two units and have one on standby, compared to current 
operation with one unit operating and one on standby.
The concentrate thickening and storage design criteria (Table 17.12) assume the following:
  Use of Magnafloc 5250 or equivalent anionic flocculant.
  Specific settling rate of 0.055 m2/tpd at flocculant dosage of 10–15 g/t and 0.04 m2/tpd
at flocculant dosage of 15–20 g/t.
  Feed auto-dilution to 10%–15% solids.

The Phase 1 concentrate filtration sizing parameters were based on Southwest zone 
concentrate testwork performed by Larox at a 25 µm P80. Existing operations data are used 
for Phase 2 design. The filtration rate for Southwest at 35 µm is taken as the midpoint between 
the peak and median three-day moving average filtration rates from May to 
December 2013, scaled up to the expected Phase 2 P80 of 40 µm. They result in the addition 
of two more 144 m2 horizontal plate filters, identical to the two supplied in Phase 1. The design 
criteria include:
  Concentrate storage requirement minimum of 28 hours.
  Filtration rate of 0.75 tph/m2.
  Cake moisture of 8.5%.
  Cake bulk density of 1.99 t dry solids/m2.
  Filter cycle time of 10.5 minutes.
Concentrate bagging design is based on existing operations data. Operations reports that 
the maximum bagging rate, without circuit upgrades, is 3,934 tpd (wet) based on three of 
four bagging modules operating simultaneously. For Phase 2 the following design upgrades 
are required to increase the bagging plant capacity:
  Automation of the sampling, sealing, and scanning stages to allow the use of
four modules simultaneously, providing a 33% increase in capacity.


Installation of four additional modules. It is conservatively estimated that shared use of 
the existing roller conveyors will result in the four new modules providing a capacity 
increase of 50% instead of 100% because of queuing interference.
Increase of bag capacity from 2.0–2.5 tonnes. This would reduce the number of bags 
being filled by 20% and should result in an almost 25% increase in capacity (note that 
actual bag filling time is not capacity limiting). Rather than increase bag height, it is 
recommended that the vibration cycle be extended and the cross-section of the base 
of the bag be increased to improve stability.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 368 of 519
With these upgrades the bagging plant will have a product design bagging rate of 
411 tph (wet) (378 tph (dry)). At a planned usage rate of 7,100 h/a, the bagging capacity 
would be 2.7 Mtpa compared to a peak planned production of 1.9 Mtpa. This may obviate 
the need to automate, although this may be desirable from the perspective of operating 
cost reduction.
No additional tailings thickening capacity is planned for Phase 2 as the conversion is based 
upon the existing tailings capacity.
Reagent consumption based on laboratory flotation testwork.
A design factor is an additional safety allowance applied to nominal capacities to account 
for short-term surges and variability in plant operation. Design factors are not applied 
uniformly across the plant but instead target equipment that typically must operate in a surge 
mode, such as feeders, conveyors, and pumps. A 10% allowance (1.1 design factor) has 
been adopted for the new equipment of this type.
For process equipment such as grinding mills and flotation cells, which are sized from design 
criteria, a design factor of 1.0 is applied. Process equipment can generally tolerate normal 
process variations with minor changes in performance.
The design factors adopted for new equipment are shown in Table 17.13. Some existing 
equipment will fall below its design factors as a result of the expansion.

The selection of process equipment suppliers for the concentrator was based on sole-
sourcing from existing Phase 1 suppliers. Along with the benefits of operator familiarity and 
commonality of spares, sole-sourcing was particularly appropriate in the following 
circumstances:
  To the same manufacturer as used in Phase 1 when long-term, high-level technical
support will be necessary for the life of the operation.
  To the same manufacturer and equipment model/size as used in Phase 1 when larger 
equipment has not been proven up and when Phase 1 design has made provision for 
certain models and model dimensions, e.g., Phase 1 ball mill aisle, Phase 1 flotation cells, 
and Phase 1 pressure filter suppliers.
  To suppliers with which Rio Tinto Procurement has negotiated strategic agreements, e.g.,
supplier of general electrical equipment and variable-speed drives.
This section describes the flowsheet and general arrangement of the expanded processing 
facilities, starting at reception of ore from the overland conveying system and continuing 
through the concentrator to concentrate load-out and the distribution of tailings at the 
storage facility.
The description includes the modifications to be made to process Lines 1 and 2 to accept 
higher milling rates and head grades following the first three years after ore delivery from 
Hugo North Lift 1.
The primary crushing and overland conveying systems that deliver crushed ore to the coarse 
ore stockpile do not need to be modified for Phase 2. The underground provides for the 
delivery of ore to the existing coarse ore storage gantry via an additional parallel conveyor, 
which was allowed for in the Phase 1 design.
Oyu Tolgoi employs a conventional SAG mill / ball mill / grinding circuit (SABC) followed by 
flotation, as shown in the basic flowsheet (Figure 17.6).
Coarse ore is slurried and ground to approximately 2.0 mm in semi-autogenous grinding 
(SAG) mills. Screening of the discharge separates out +15 mm particles, which are transferred 
to pebble crushing for size reduction and then returned to the SAG mills. About 10%–15% of 
the feed circulates from the SAG mills to the pebble crushers, depending on ore type and 
grate condition. SAG mill screen undersize is ground further in ball mills operating in closed 
circuit with cyclones.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 370 of 519
The cyclone underflow returns to the ball mills, while the overflow with an 80% passing size of 
140–180 µm is distributed by gravity to the rougher flotation cells. The rougher concentrate is 
then reground in vertical tower mills to 35 µm before delivery to the first stage cleaners. The 
concentrate from the first stage cleaners is pumped to the column cells, which produce the 
final grade concentrate.
Tailings from the cleaner and rougher flotation cells are combined, thickened, and pumped 
to the tailings storage facility (TSF), where they settle to their terminal density, allowing the 
recycle of process water to the concentrator. The cleaner concentrate is thickened, filtered, 
bagged, and shipped to market.
Phase 1 uses two grinding lines, each consisting of a SAG mill, two parallel ball mills, and 
associated downstream equipment to treat up to 100 ktpd of ore from the Southwest zone 
pit. Softer ore from the Central zone pit will be processed from 2020 through 2050. Combined 
with Hugo North underground ore, concentrator feed rates will be as high as 121 ktpd, which 
represents the tailings handling capacity of the plant. The Phase 2 concentrator 
development programme optimises the concentrator circuit to enable it to maximise 
recovery from the higher grade Hugo North ore.
In approximately 2017, Cell 2 of the TSF will become available for use, and the tailings 
pumping system will be upgraded to feed TSF Cells 1 and 2.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 371 of 519
In 2020, before the underground mine reaches full capacity, Lines 1 and 2 will be expanded 
to allow them to handle both higher tonnage and higher grade material. The ball milling, 
rougher flotation, flotation columns, concentrate filtration, thickening, bagging and bagged 
storage facilities will be upgraded to accommodate the gradual introduction of ore from 
underground. In general, the augmentations embody the operational and maintenance 
philosophies guiding the design of Phase 1 and provide, as much as practicable, a seamless 
production environment.
The intent of Phase 2 is to treat all of the high-value Hugo North ore delivered by the mine, 
supplemented by open pit ore to fill the mill to its capacity limit. The open pit ores have 
different optimal processing conditions than does the Hugo North ore, and the concentrator 
operation will target capturing maximum value from the higher NSR of the underground ore. 
These conditions approximate those for Southwest zone ore but will not be optimal for 
Central zone ore, and the concentrate grade and recovery from the Central zone ore has 
been corrected accordingly. The high-grade of Hugo North ore will generate high tonnages 
of concentrates, which will beneficially dilute impurities, particularly arsenic from the 
Central zone ore.
Figure 17.7 is a block diagram of the process on completion of Phase 2. As shown in 
Figure 17.8, most of the new processing facilities will be located within the existing 
concentrator building. Installation of a new ball mill, column cells, and concentrate 
thickening will require the concentrator building to be expanded to the north.

The existing concentrator substation to the south will be expanded to supply the additional 
electrical loads. The Phase 1 bagging plant will be expanded by the addition of four more 
bagging modules. This expansion was anticipated in the Phase 1 design, and ample room 
was provided for the new equipment. Figure 17.9 is a plan of the expanded concentrator, 
showing the relative locations of Phase 1 and Phase 2 equipment and the modest increase in 
building footprint.
The conversion will share facilities with the Lines 1–2 reagent supply systems. The modifications 
to the reagent system are described below. The recommended inventories and method of 
delivery for the reagents are summarised in Table 17.14. In general the aim is to have 45 days 
of reagent inventory on hand at or near the plant site.
  Lime – No additional lime storage capacity, beyond the four 1.0 kt silos installed in
Phase 1 is required. An additional metering station will be required at the new rougher 
bank and the column cells.
  Primary Collector – The primary collector will be Aerophine 3418A (sodium di-isobutyl 
dithiophosphinate). Consumption will peak at nearly 1,700 kgpd, approximately 65% 
more than the Phase 1 usage. The Phase 1 system has ample dilution capacity to supply 
the conversion. An additional metering station will be required at the new rougher bank.

  Secondary Collector – The proposed on-site inventory for Phase 1 is 40 tonnes, which has 
not been increased for the conversion. An additional metering station will be required at 
the new rougher bank. No secondary collectors are currently added in Phase 1.
  Frother – Frother distribution in Phase 1 provides for the use of two frothers, methyl isobutyl 
carbinol (MIBC) added neat, and a secondary frother (polyglycol ether or similar) added 
as a low concentration solution in water. Primary frother consumption in Phase 2 will be 
roughly equal to Phase 1 design at 15 g/t, peaking at nearly 1,800 kgpd due to a 
reduction in estimated consumption, as corroborated by May-to-December 2013 
consumption reports. No additional frother tankage will be required. Delivery will be in 
18 m3 isotainers off-loaded by forklift and placed on a racking system, from which the 
contents will be pumped to the plant storage. Additional metering stations for each type 
will be required at the new rougher bank.
  Tailings Flocculant – The major flocculant will be a non-ionic type such as Magnafloc 338.
Tailings flocculant use will increase to 2,400 kgpd, proportionate to tonnage. No new 
flocculant preparation equipment will be installed. The proposed reagent inventory is 
considered adequate for Phase 2. Recent testing of an alternate flocculant has led to 
higher underflow densities at significantly reduced consumption.
  Concentrate Flocculant – The flocculant used for concentrate thickening is an anionic
variety, such as Magnafloc 5250. Concentrate flocculant demand will increase to 
110 kgpd, but the Phase 1 capacity is sufficiently under-utilised that expansion will not be 
necessary. An additional flocculant metering pump and dilution system will be installed. 
Reagent inventory will be increased to five bulk bags.
  Water Treatment Chemicals –The existing anti-scalant and corrosion inhibitor supply 
systems will be adequate for both the process and raw water systems. The reagent 
inventory is also adequate for Phase 2.
  Grinding Media – No additional inventory is required for SAG milling.
For ball milling, the new Ball Mill 5 will use the existing 1.6 kt ball storage system for 75 mm 
balls and the ball conveying system will be modified to deliver to it. An additional 
inventory of 192 tonnes of 75 mm media in quarter-height isotainers is provided.
Using Phase 1 regrind media consumption estimates, the regrind mills will consume 
about 22 tpd of 16 mm media, reducing on-site inventory to eight days of operation. 
However, actual operating data for 2013 indicate a large decrease in consumption, 
from the design 2013 plan of 130–60 g/t for Southwest zone ore for OTFS14. Long-term 
consumptions in regrind milling are budgeted in terms of g/kWh for the various ore 
types.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Raw water is used for:
  Cooling;
  Gland seal;
  Domestic and fire water;
  Column and filter wash water, and
  Total water inventory make-up to replace water lost to evaporation and to the settled
tailings.
Raw water is delivered by pipeline from the lagoon to the raw water tank, from where it is 
pumped through cartridge filters to the grinding and air compressor cooling systems. Spent 
cooling water will supply a second gland seal water tank interconnected with the Phase 1 
gland seal water tank. Excess spent cooling water will flow by gravity to the tailings collection 
box and make its way to the process water tank via the tailings thickener overflow; any 
shortfall in gland seal water requirement will be made up directly from the cooling water 
supply.
The concentrator conversion equipment will be serviced by the existing water system with 
minimal modification. The gland seal water storage capacity will be expanded and 
appropriate connections added to the existing network.
The bulk of the process water is added to the SAG mill feed chutes and the cyclone feed 
pump boxes in high volumes at low pressure. The ball mills are secondary addition points. The 
rest of the process water is circulated around the mill at higher pressure for sprays, utility 
hoses, and other miscellaneous uses. A booster pump is provided for high-pressure washing of 
the mill liners. The increased tonnage in Phase 2 will require additional process water but no 
system modifications.
The concentrator raw water demand varies seasonally due to evaporation, ice formation on 
the TSF, and the release of water during spring thaw. The total site raw water demand has 
been estimated to range from a low of 678 L/s in June to as high as 932 L/s in the February-
March period, with an average of 732 L/s. The design groundwater pumping capacity is 
900 L/s. Utilising drawdown of the lagoons will slightly reduce the lagoon recharge rate, but 
the current projection is that the peak instantaneous raw water demand could exceed 
900 L/s at the Phase 2 volumetric limit of 121 ktpd, and approach it at the average of 
117.43 ktpd in the peak Phase 2 year (2021). This compares with the long-term average 
Gunii Hooloi groundwater extraction of 870 L/s approved by the Ministry of Environment and 
Green Development based on average usage over 40 years. The largest water loss, 564 L/s, is 
the entrained water in the settled tailings. The Phase 1 design specified a final tailings settled 
density of 73.5%. That value has not been realised to date and a value of 70% has been used 
in the water balance model.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 377 of 519
Figure 17.9 compares actual plant data and the water balance model. The shutdown of one 
tailings thickener and reduced tonnage in February–March 2014 proved challenging for the 
model assumptions about ice formation and melting. This can be seen in the ‘data wraps’, 
with June to December plant data being from 2013, while the January to April data are from 
2014. Figure 17.10 illustrates the projected raw water demand for OTFS14 under different 
weather assumptions.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 378 of 519
Based on the estimated raw water demand and the available 400,000 m3 surge capacity 
provided by the two raw water lagoons, the nominal raw water pumping rate of 1,900 L/s 
appears adequate. Uprating of the raw water pipeline capacity by installation of an 
intermediate pump station would be required for capacity beyond the current mine plan. 
Normally the cooling water demand is lower than the raw water demand. However, the 
significant increase in reclaim rate and subsequent reduction in raw water demand during 
the spring thaw means that cooling water must be recirculated to balance the demands.
With the addition of the concentrator conversion loads, the peak operating load demand 
from the existing 220 kV concentrator substation will increase by an estimated 20 MW (from 
116–136 MW), and the nominal operating (diversified) load will increase by an estimated 
19 MW (from 106–125 MW). The operating power demand includes the diversity, demand, 
and percent duty factors specific to the type of equipment and process.
Total demand for Phase 1 and the concentrator conversion combined during normal 
operating conditions is estimated at 150 MW peak operating load and 144 MW nominal 
operating (diversified) load. This includes the peripheral 35 kV ring loads to the concentrator 
account. This nominal operating load results in an estimated annual power consumption of 
1,093,800 MWh for the combined concentrator, an incremental increase of 161,400 MWh for 
the concentrator conversion.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 379 of 519
The existing concentrator 35 kV line will distribute power through cable feeders to the 
following:
  One 16 MVA, 35 kV–10.5 kV Ball Mill 5 oil-filled transformer, and
  One 16 MVA, 35 kV–6.3 kV oil-filled transformer from a new 35 kV GIS switchgear section
to be added.
The modifications will provide power for all of the new conversion equipment, in addition to 
the power demands of the relocated air compressors and the new column cells.

The Oyu Tolgoi Project is energy-intensive, with requirements of a peak of 145 MW since start-
up, increasing to 246 MW in the longer term after completion of the underground 
development. A reliable and stable power supply is essential for operations and safety.
OT LLC has a Power Purchase Agreement with the Inner Mongolia Power Corporation to 
supply power to Oyu Tolgoi. The term of this agreement covers the commissioning of the 
business plus the initial four years of commercial operations.
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM 
for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-based independent power producer (IPP). The aim of 
the PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the GOM 
and OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. Participation in the 
PSCA meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power supply within 
Mongolia within four years from the commencement of commercial production. Signing of a 
PSCA has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the establishment of an IPP 
at Tavan Tolgoi is studied.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an IPP 
to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with 
Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
Estimated annual peak power demand for the site over the life of the mine is shown in 
Figure 18.1, and an estimate of power demand on the Oyu Tolgoi power system is tabulated 
in Table 18.2. This is based on a combination of actual site loads and load factors, and, where 
applicable, these factors are used for the future loads. These levels will be reviewed 
progressively as the project develops. The numbers indicate the maximum load estimated for 
that year.

Standby loads are defined as those required to keep minimal process functions operating. 
Emergency loads are defined as those required to keep critical equipment operating to 
maintain the health and safety of personnel or minimise damage to critical equipment.
The diesel power station (DPS) provides standby power. Emergency loads are supplied either 
by the diesel power station via the 35 kV system or by dedicated generators such as those 
located at the administration building and central substation. No additions are required to 
the DPS.
The central substation, approximately 500 m south of the concentrator facility, currently 
receives power from the IMPC, later from the IPP coal fired power plant at Tavan Tolgoi and 
distributes it to the various facilities at either 220 kV or 35 kV. The substation consists of an 
outdoor, double bus 220 kV switchyard, two 31.5/41.5/51.5 MVA 220 kV/35 kV transformers 
and an indoor 35 kV substation. The 220 kV switchyard has 19 bays.
Four 220 kV overhead transmission lines radiate from the central substation, two feed the 
concentrator substation 500 m to the north, and two feed the shaft farm substation 800 m to 
the south-east.
Two 220 kV/35 kV transformers provide power to the indoor 35 kV substation, which uses 35 kV 
GIS to supply the concentrator ring loads, including primary crushing, conveying, and tailings 
pumping, some infrastructure loads, and the borefield loads.
The 35 kV infrastructure power distribution system consists of:
  Three 35 kV rings (north, south, and concentrator). The north and south rings are fed from
the shaft farm substation, and the concentrator ring is fed from the central substation.
  Two radial 35 kV overhead power lines to supply the borefield, fed from the concentrator
substation. This feeder extends approximately 70 km to the north-east of the site.
  35 kV feed to the underground mine.
  Temporary supply to community loads (Khanbogd and Bayan Ovoo).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 385 of 519
Oyu Tolgoi is supplied with electricity from China in accordance with three agreements with 
Inner Mongolia Power (Group) Co. Ltd (IMPC):
  An Electricity Purchase and Sale Agreement for Oyu Tolgoi between OT LLC, IMPC, and
NPTG (IMPC PPA).
  An Operation and Maintenance Agreement between OT LLC and IMPC
(O&M Agreement).
  A Dispatch Agreement between OT LLC and IMPC (Dispatch Agreement).
Supply is physically obtained from a 220 kV double-circuit transmission line from Inner 
Mongolia. Either circuit is capable of supplying approximately 400 MW and thus Oyu Tolgoi’s 
load can be met entirely from one circuit. To date the reliability of the electricity supply from 
IMPC has been very good, with no full outage of the transmission line recorded.
IMPC built, owns, operates and maintains the section of transmission line that operates in 
Inner Mongolia. As part of the O&M Agreement, OT LLC agreed to pay IMPC’s costs for the 
operation and maintenance of this section. The capital cost of the line is recovered through 
the electricity tariff in the IMPC PPA, but there is a requirement for OT LLC to make a final 
payment for the undepreciated capital at the end of the term of the IMPC PPA.
The section of transmission line that operates in Mongolia was built by OT LLC. Currently 
discussions are underway with the GOM to transfer ownership of this section of the line to the 
National Transmission Line Company (NPTG), as required under Mongolian Energy Law.
The diesel power station on the Oyu Tolgoi site consists of two plants, each with 20 MW 
capacity, connected to the site 35 kV grid to supply standby and emergency power in the 
event of loss of power from external sources.
The OTFS14 is based on extension of the existing supply arrangements described above. In 
parallel; however, OT LLC is developing opportunities to benefit from its base demand and 
the Tavan Tolgoi coal reserves in Mongolia by linking to a new power plant primarily 
supported by Oyu Tolgoi demand.
OT LLC has a Power Purchase Agreement with the Inner Mongolia Power Corporation to 
supply power to Oyu Tolgoi. The term of this agreement covers the commissioning of the 
business plus the initial four years of commercial operations.
OT LLC will be the primary customer for the power plant with capacity charge obligations 
covering the entire 450 MW gross capacity and high reliability requirements. The IPP’s charges 
will be predetermined and structured to reflect operating costs, debt repayment, and equity 
return profiles of the IPP.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 386 of 519
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a PSCA with the GOM for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-
based IPP. The aim of the PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation 
between the GOM and OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. 
Participation in the PSCA meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power 
supply within Mongolia within four years from the commencement of commercial production. 
Signing of a PSCA has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the 
establishment of an IPP at Tavan Tolgoi is studied.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an 
independent power provider to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to 
supply electricity, with Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
A permanent domestic airport has been constructed at Oyu Tolgoi to support the 
transportation of people and goods to the site from Ulaanbaatar. It further serves as the 
regional airport for Khanbogd soum. No upgrade of facilities is required.
The airport is 13 km north of the Oyu Tolgoi camp area. It is a non-precision approach, visual 
flight rules (VFR) facility. The runway surface is concrete, with a concrete apron at the 
terminal building. The runway has been aligned to the prevailing northwest-southeast wind 
direction to minimise cross-wind conditions and facilitate optimal landing and take-off 
conditions. The design criteria are set to service commercial aircraft up to the Boeing 737-800 
series aircraft.
Principal airport design features are as follows:
  3,250 m long x 45 m wide runway

International Civil Aviation Organisation Reference Code for aerodromes: 4C
  Projected life: 30 years
  Two arrivals and departures per day
  Terminal building for 120 passengers per hour
  Car park for 40 vehicles
  Perimeter road for security patrols
  Perimeter fence for access security
  Aerodrome category II.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 387 of 519
Other key design criteria are as follows:
  airport service type: private and business, non-scheduled
  airport elevation: nominal 1,200 m above mean sea level
  no aircraft refuelling capability on site

space provided for future expansion of the airport
  areas of disturbance minimised as much as practicable

flight paths over existing camp areas and structures avoided
The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) suggests that runway facilities should be 
sited and oriented for best wind coverage, given the terrain constraints. Secondary or cross-
wind runway facilities should supplement the primary runway. The current design incorporates 
a primary runway only, which has been sited to favour the prevailing winds. The prevailing 
wind direction was considered to be north and the secondary direction to be north-west. To 
favour the prevailing wind and avoid approach path restrictions, the selected runway 
orientation was northwest-southeast. Terminal Building
The terminal building is 37.5 m wide x 45 m long and includes an entry area with a check-in 
counter, security check point with x-ray machine for baggage inspections, personnel metal 
detection equipment, a departure lounge sized for 128 persons, two cafes, offices, and male 
and female washrooms. Electricity is provided from an independent diesel generator 
equipped with a standby unit.
All internal access roads are constructed of graded gravel. The road base is built on 
scarified/compacted existing ground where suitable; where the ground surface is unsuitable 
for use as a wear course, it has been replaced with well-graded gravel and sandy fines. The 
top elevation of the shoulders of the gravel pavement surface is approximately the same 
level as the surrounding surface except at pipeline crossings. Side-drain ditches are provided 
parallel to the road for stormwater drainage. During the expansion additional access roads 
will be constructed for the expanded operations camp, the shotcrete and concrete storage 
facility for the underground, the conveyor-to-surface service portal and Shaft 4.
To support the development of Oyu Tolgoi, the existing access road from Oyu Tolgoi to China 
and the border crossing will be upgraded. This road is referred to here as the OT–GSK Road. 
The detail design was performed by a Mongolian design company, Mongolian Construction 
and Project Consultant (MCPC), based in Ulaanbaatar. The total length of 105 km is public 
from the North gatehouse to the Mongolia–China border and is currently under construction 
(Figure 18.2). Zones 1 (27 km), 2A (27 km), 2B (27 km), and 4.77 km of Zone 3 are complete 
providing a fully tarred road from the North Gate to the intersection with the Energy
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 388 of 519
Resources Coal Road. The final sections of Zone 3 and Zone 5, which total around 23 km, are 
still to be built and are scheduled for construction in 2014 or 2015.
During the expansion phase of the project, three wildlife crossings will be added to the 
OT–GSK road in the central valley at Locations 7, 8, and 10 as shown in Figure 18.2. Crossings 
at Locations 7 and 8 will be 50 m wide and provide 4.5 m clearance for wildlife to pass under 
the road. The crossing at location 10 will consist of a 75 m overpass with a three-span 
configuration for structural efficiency. The wildlife crossings are intended to protect the 
migratory patterns of the Asiatic wild ass (see Section 20, Environment).
The crossings will be precast concrete girder bridges, with 4.5 m vertical clearance above 
ground. The bridge deck will be cast-in-place, and girders will be supported on bearings at 
the concrete abutment walls and on piers where applicable. The abutments will be founded 
on spread footings and have cantilevered gravity wing walls to retain the road fill. Concrete 
aprons will extend outside the deck. The crossings will incorporate a structurally supported 
5.0 m high visual barrier to obscure the animals’ view of traffic and encourage use of the 
crossing. The approach ramp is designed with a 5.0% grade to minimise the fill volume while 
maintaining design speeds of 80 km/h. Drive lines will be included to funnel wildlife toward the 
crossings.

Under clause four of the ‘Agreement with Respect to the Construction of the Oyu Tolgoi 
Road’ (Road Agreement), the Ministry of Roads, Transport, Construction, and Urban 
Development and OT LLC will enter into a separate agreement detailing the terms and 
conditions for the following:
  The maintenance and operation of the OT–GSK road.
  The charging and collection of tolls and fees.
  The conditions for the transfer of the OT–GSK road to the State.
OT LLC is developing an agreement with the GOM for the maintenance and transfer of the 
OT–GSK road.
The GOM has prepared a Master Plan for the strategic development of the border precinct 
and OT LLC will upgrade infrastructure and develop facilities to support its logistic operations 
in accordance with the border Master Plan. The OT LLC border improvement scope will 
involve upgrading the road link between the existing Mongolian customs facility at the 
Mongolian border in Gashuun Sukhait and the existing Chinese customs facility at the 
Mongolian-Chinese border in Ganqimaodao. The inter linking roads between the borders will 
be upgraded, subsequent to discussions with the GOM, to meet the expected project-
related traffic needs at the border crossing, including the upgrade and dedication of two 
border crossing checkpoints. Also to be developed is a secured bonded yard at 
Gashuun Sukhait to accommodate the concentrate fleet, should there be any unanticipated 
border closures and a laboratory for the testing of incoming chemicals and reagents. The 
bonded yard will be expanded in 2020 when the volume of concentrate production 
increases.
A secured customs bonded zone and marshalling yard has been added at the Oyu Tolgoi 
site. It serves as a marshalling yard to assemble convoys for the outbound concentrate fleet, 
a storage area for extra bags of concentrate and a Mongolian General Custom 
Administration approved customs bonded zone. The marshalling yard will be expanded in 
2020 to address the increase in concentrate exports at that time. Office facilities will not need 
to be upgraded.
The GOM has committed to providing OT LLC with non-discriminatory access to any railway 
constructed between Mongolia and China. Energy Resources is currently constructing a 
single-track heavy-haul rail from its UHG coal mine (approximately 120 km to the north-west of 
Oyu Tolgoi) to Gashuun Sukhait, ultimately to be interconnected with the Chinese rail network 
at Ganqimaodao on the Chinese side of the border. Once constructed, the South Gobi Rail 
alignment would pass within 10 km of the Oyu Tolgoi lease area and therefore represents an 
opportunity for eventual connection of the mine to the rail network.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 390 of 519
Some consideration has been given to establishing a rail link to the site for the transport of:
  Concentrate (outbound to various Chinese smelters).
  Coal for the power plant (inbound from Mongolian coal mines).
  Diesel fuel (inbound from Russia).
  Other inbound equipment and consumables.
OTFS14 expansion activities are essentially within the footprint of the existing Oyu Tolgoi site. 
While some general site development is involved, the scope is relatively minor, primarily 
involving site finishing rather than general development.
In assessing camp capacity requirements, OT LLC considers the total number of operations 
and construction personnel, without differentiating between the type and quality of 
accommodation facilities for any group.
Table 18.3 shows the build-up of operations staffing over the first few years of the Project. 
These numbers include all personnel on payroll and based at the Oyu Tolgoi site, including 
those who are not on-site at a given time. The construction staffing plan is shown in 
Table 18.4. The construction manning is driven by estimated labour hours and therefore only 
includes personnel who are on-site, without considering any individuals on a roster break.
The combined staffing plan for both operations and construction through 2052 is shown in 
Figure 18.3. The number of people on-site peaks at approximately 7,910 in 2016.

Oyu Tolgoi has five discrete camps, as listed in Table 18.5. In 2016, when the workforce peaks, 
camp occupancy (including off-site camps) will be about 80%. Camp occupancy is the total 
percentage of the overall camp beds being accounted for by the staffing plan. The 
remaining beds are available for non-site based Oyu Tolgoi employees, vendor 
representatives and other visitors. The bed count for operations staffing reserves a bed for all 
operations personnel whether they are on-site or not. The construction bed count covers the 
required on-site labour and does not hold beds for construction workers who may be on a 
rotation leave.
Before the staffing peak in 2016, there will be ample beds on-site to meet the demands of 
operations and construction, without making full use of the off-site Javkhlant or Khanbogd 
camps. At the peak of on-site manpower, when international contractors may need 
segregated accommodation, the Erchim Camp will be devoted for construction use and 
overflow will be housed at Manlai or Javkhlant.

Subsequent to the 2016 staffing peak, the Javkhlant and the Khanbogd camps will be 
phased out of use and by 2021 will no longer be required to meet the staffing needs of the 
Project. After that, all accommodations will be provided on-site.
The SOT and Manlai camps are the main accommodation facilities for Oyu Tolgoi. The 
SOT Camp was initially built for construction purposes but has been converted for operations 
use. It is at the north-west corner of the mine site, adjacent to the Undai River and within 
1.0 km of the centre of the concentrator site to the immediate east. The layouts of the existing 
SOT Camp and the Manlai Camp, are shown in Figure 18.4, the latter being a kilometre to the 
south-east of SOT.
The SOT Camp provides both dormitory-style and ger accommodation facilities with the 
number of beds listed in Table 18.6.

The rest of the SOT Camp includes all the services and amenities of a small, self-contained 
community. The blocks and other facilities are connected by service roads. SOT Camp 
Expansion
In 2016–2017, the SOT Camp will be expanded to the north as shown in Figure 18.5. A total of 
1,582 beds will be added (Table 18.7).
The new buildings will be of modular construction and will include four senior dormitory wings, 
six junior dormitory wings, a bus shelter, camp administration building, commissary, dining 
room / kitchen, laundry, a recreation/pub facility and a central spine corridor. The dormitory 
modules will be complete with utility rooms, including electrical, ICT, alarm/valve, janitorial, 
and housekeeping rooms. The standards of the facilities will be comparable to those already 
in operation and hence will not set precedence to upgrade the other facilities.

The modular kitchen and pre-engineered dining facility will be designed to accommodate 
1,000 meals at a time on a two-sitting basis, for a capacity of 2,000 people. The pub-style 
establishment will provide seating for 150 people at tables and lounge chairs, with additional 
areas included at the bar and open patio.
A bus shelter with seating for 200 people will be located at the east end of the camp 
expansion area. Light vehicle parking will also be provided at the east end of the camp in a 
centralised area to prevent the vehicle traffic within the main camp area.
During detail design, alternative designs for the camp expansion, including container-style, 
steel-frame, demountable modules, will be considered for cost efficiency.

The Manlai camp is about 1.0 km south of the concentrator (see Figure 18.4). As shown in 
Table 18.8, it provides 2,921 beds. In addition to dormitory units, the Manlai camp is self-
contained.

The Javkhlant Camp was originally provided for workers engaged in constructing the  
OT–GSK road and the power line from China to the Oyu Tolgoi site (see Figure 18.2). It consists 
of dormitory-type units and gers with the number of beds shown in Table 18.9. In addition to 
accommodation, the Javkhlant Camp is self-contained.
The Javkhlant Camp is not currently used to a large degree because it is remote from site, 
approximately 70 km away on the OT–GSK road. It will be used for the construction of the 
wildlife crossings and during peak periods. Most of this camp will then be phased out of use 
over time, leaving only approximately 100 beds for ongoing maintenance of the road and 
concentrate haul fleet.

The Khanbogd Camp is located in the town of Khanbogd. As shown in Table 18.10, it has 
1,539 beds. Being 45 km away from the mine site, this camp is not currently in use and so it 
represents a bed surplus (April 2014). It will be used as required during peak construction 
periods, but will also be phased out of use once construction is complete.

The Erchim Camp was originally located north of the site but has been relocated to an area 
south-west of the central heating plant. It has 879 beds, as shown in Table 18.11.
The Erchim Camp is currently being used by operations but will be made available to major 
international contractors when a stand-alone, segregated camp is most practical for 
management of the construction workforce.

With a peak of nearly 1,200 people in 2016, the number of international contractor personnel 
will exceed the capacity of the Erchim camp. During these years, some workers will need to 
be housed at either the ger camp section of the Manlai camp or off site at the Javkhlant 
Camp. Depending on conditions at the time, it may also be possible to expand the Erchim 
Camp.
Construction of the open pit truck shop complex is complete.
The complex includes buildings for the truck shop, washing shop, lubricant storage building 
and welding and machine shop.
The mine dry is a centralised, permanent operations facility whose primary purpose is to 
provide site staff with a place to shower and change into work clothes and back into clean 
street clothes. This includes and is not limited to open pit, concentrator, and truck shop 
maintenance staff.
A mine dry within the shaft farm will facilitate the underground personnel. The dry will be of 
comparable standard to the existing facilities.

Communications is a vital part of Oyu Tolgoi’s infrastructure and operational capabilities. A 
state-of-the-art information, security, data, and voice communications system is installed to 
ensure that operational needs are met. A fibre optic communications backbone extends 
through the entire mine site and out to the borefield to support the following principal 
components:
  Distributed Control System (DCS).
  Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)-based control systems.
  Electrical monitoring system (EMSys).
  Local Area Network (LAN).
  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system.
  Security system, including closed-circuit television (CCTV) and access control system
(ACS).
  Fire alarm system (FAS).
  Digital trunk radio system (DTR).
  Cable television (CATV) for operations personnel entertainment.
Each of the above components will be expanded to support modifications to the surface 
concentrator, underground development, power distribution system, and operations camp. 
Components and suppliers will be similar to those used for the existing facilities. This will 
provide continuity in support services and parts inventories of the systems and make use of 
the training and experience gained by site personnel. The network backbone infrastructure 
will continue to provide connectivity at the expanded and new facilities.
All of the required subsystems communicate through the Oyu Tolgoi fibre optic 
communications backbone. The communications network comprises an inside battery limits 
(ISBL) section serving the mine facilities, and an outside battery limits (OSBL) section serving 
the raw water supply system.
Expansion of the existing backbone will be provided to the following primary locations:
  To Shaft 4 and the borehole concrete/shotcrete receiving station, by overhead pole line.
  To the new operations camp, as an extension of the backbone from the existing
operations camp.
  Throughout the underground mine and to the mine dry office complex, via Shaft 1,
Shaft 2, and the conveyor-to-surface development.

The VoIP system provides the capability for users to perform voice communications on the 
10 Gbit Ethernet backbone to all users within the voice network. Using appropriate software, 
and with redundant CPUs, it is possible to expand the number of users by adding additional 
call servers, IP client licences and media service cards. It is planned to upgrade the existing 
system based on the number of additional users and services required for the new operations 
camp, mine dry building and underground mine operation. Allowances are included for 
servers and licensing to support the additional users.
The access control system is part of the site security system. Protected facilities include 
buildings, security turnstiles, vehicle gates, fence surveillance, and other like facilities. The 
access control system is transmitted on the 10 Gbit Ethernet backbone. This includes card 
access to selected areas of the plant where security access is deemed necessary. The 
access control system will be expanded to the new operations camp, mine dry building, and 
throughout the underground mine.
The CCTV system comprises a local server plus recorder system, including cameras and video 
encoder devices. All cameras are connected to the local server plus recorder and also to the 
security system backbone and the control centre. Automatic and manual (discretionary) 
display of any video input can be played on any video output. The CCTV system is supported 
by the 10 Gbit Ethernet backbone.
The CCTV system will be expanded to provide cameras for process monitoring in the 
concentrator and underground mine materials handling / utilities areas. CCTV monitors will be 
installed in the mine dry control room for the underground monitoring. Expansion to the 
security applications is provided by CCTV surveillance of the new operations camp, mine dry 
building and underground offices/work areas.
The fire alarm system consists of thermal flame detectors, ionisation smoke detectors, and 
manual pull stations. The fire alarm system provides monitored digital outputs of alarms for 
connection to the plant process distributed control system (DCS). The central fire alarm panel 
is installed in the North gatehouse.
The fire alarm system will be expanded by adding identical equipment / designs in all new 
building infrastructure and in the underground mine. Upgrades will include a main fire alarm 
panel in the mine dry control room to monitor the underground mine. This panel will reside on 
the fire alarm system network, report to the existing fire alarm panels in the concentrator 
control room and in the North gatehouse, and will also interface with the underground mine 
PLC control system.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The cable television system provides Mongolian, Chinese, and English TV channels at the 
accommodation facilities. It includes satellite farm equipment, head-end equipment, 
antennas, optical and/or coax system amplifiers, equalisers, splitters, and taps. The new 
operations camp will be provided with additional head-end equipment, distributed in 
sufficient quantity to suit the personnel serviced by the camp.
This system interfaces with surface operations and provides network connectivity in 
underground shafts and tunnels for the control systems (DCS and PLC), electrical monitoring 
system (EMSys), fire alarm system (FAS), access control system (ACS), closed circuit TV (CCTV), 
and communication systems. The underground mine support communications system will 
include the following items:
  Personnel and vehicle tracking using radio frequency identification (RFID) hardware.
  Mine management/ dispatch system for management of underground vehicle
operations.
  Mobile voice communications using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, with the potential
to migrate to integrate with wireless, portable VoIP phones.
  VoIP telephone system for general voice applications.
  Hard-wired mine telephone/ paging system.
The operations warehouse is a 45 m x 180 m heated building adjacent to the construction 
warehouse that provides 8,100 m2 for the storage of process equipment parts, spares, critical 
piping and valves.
Ongoing operation and development of the underground mine will increase the demand for 
heated warehouse storage space by approximately 6,600 m2. A new 52.5 m x 126 m 
operations warehouse will therefore be constructed adjacent to the existing one. Similar to 
the existing operations warehouse, it will be fitted with shelves, offices, lunch room, 
loading/unloading areas, and roll-up doors. As the warehouse expansion design enters detail 
design, a needs analysis and functional specification will be developed.
The existing surface medical infrastructure is capable of servicing the construction and 
operational needs of the existing operation and the OTFS14 expansion activities.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The existing fire station is capable of servicing the existing operation and the expansion 
construction and operation, no changes are required for OTFS14.
A central coal-fired boiler plant was completed in 2012. The plant provides hot water heating 
for the concentrator building, open pit truck shop, construction and operations warehouses, 
administration building, SOT and Manlai camps, electrical substations and all other surface 
facilities, as well as mine air heating systems for Shafts 1, 2, and 3. Hot water from the central 
boiler plant is supplied and returned through a primary circulation loop to the various 
secondary circulation and heating loops, which are complete with dedicated hot 
water/glycol heat exchangers to provide heating to the end users.
The central heating plant includes a single boiler house building, two 7 MW boilers, 
two 29 MW boilers, a single coal stockpile and coal handling system, a single common 100 m 
high exhaust stack, a boiler house electrical annex, a boiler house mechanical annex, and a 
fire water pump station. The plant general arrangement is shown in Figure 18.6.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 403 of 519
The central heating plant was designed for the future expansion of two more 29 MW boilers, 
which will be installed to meet the demands of the increasing underground mine ventilation 
load. The expansion is currently anticipated in 2016 to meet the 2017 system load. In addition, 
the two existing boilers in the main camp area, which are not currently in use, will be returned 
to service to reduce overall demand on the central heating plant. In 2021, two 15 MW diesel 
boilers will be added at the central heating plant to provide sufficient back-up capacity in 
case one of the 29 MW coal-fired boilers is down for repair and to provide trimming capacity 
for any brief moments of peak heat loads.
The distribution system will also be expanded to accommodate the new facilities, including 
lines to Shaft 1 to service the larger mine air heaters that will replace the temporary units, to 
supply the air heaters at Shafts 2 and 3, and to meet the needs of the concentrator 
conversion, the new operations warehouse, and the operations camp expansion.
Anticipated heating loads and system capacity to 2028 are shown in Figure 18.7.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The underground utility services include raw water, firewater, domestic water, sewage, and 
return water.
Raw water distribution from the borefield lagoon to the site and throughout the site is 
designed as a gravity-flow system. Raw water will be provided to the underground mine for 
makeup and other services during construction and operations. Local flow meters are 
provided to monitor raw water consumption in each area.
The borefield lagoon for raw water storage is about 4.5 km away from site. The lagoon can 
hold 400,000 m3 of water to provide approximately one week of emergency/buffer storage in 
case of any interruption in the supply of water from the borefield.
Six fire pump stations (Figure 18.8) are available on-site to provide firewater for end users. The 
pump stations are at the following locations:
  Raw water treatment and bottling plant.

(former) Construction warehouse.
  Concentrator.
  Shaft 1.
  Shaft 2.
  Central heating plant.
The fire protection pump zones cover the majority of the on-site facilities. Remote on-site and 
off-site facilities are not connected to the high-pressure firewater system, but instead rely on 
local manual fire protection. Fire detection and alarm systems are installed at key facilities 
and report to the mill area control room in the process plant or to the North gatehouse, which 
is be manned 24 h/d.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 405 of 519
Firewater systems are to be provided for the underground mine and associated maintenance 
and explosives storage areas. These systems are self-contained and serviced from the raw 
water distribution system via the shafts.
Domestic water is only used for washing, shower, and eye-wash stations, not for drinking. The 
raw water for domestic use is treated in the water treatment and bottling plant and then 
delivered from the plant to end users by HDPE SDR 13.5 pipe. Use areas include the central 
heating plant, warehouse, open pit truck shop, concentrator, primary crusher, 220 kV central 
substation, diesel power station, North gatehouse, operation camp, and administration 
building. The system will be extended to include the operations warehouse expansion and 
the operations camp expansion.
The sanitary sewer system collects sanitary wastewater from the central heating plant, 
warehouse, open pit truck shop, Shafts 1 and 2, concentrator, North gatehouse, operations 
camp and administration building and delivers it to the wastewater treatment plant. Sanitary 
wastewater from remote areas such as the primary crusher and 220 kV central substation is 
collected in local holding tanks and trucked to the wastewater treatment plant. The system 
will be expanded to include the operations camp expansion and operations warehouse 
expansion.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 406 of 519
The sanitary sewer system is not intended for chemical wastewater, underground mine 
dewatering effluent or oil wastewater, which will generally be sent to tailings in the return 
water line.
The return water system is used to transport dewatering water from Shaft 1 and Shaft 2, 
effluent from the new wastewater treatment plant and emergency water from the central 
heating plant to tailings storage. It does not include the existing plant discharge water, which 
is transferred to a holding tank to be used for dust suppression.
Any additions to Waste Facilities will be made as part of the sustaining capital plan.
Diesel fuel is delivered by the supplier in a tank truck. The fuel is unloaded and stored in 
storage tank farms.
No changes to the open pit or diesel power stations are required for OTFS14. Separate diesel 
storage for underground use is included at the shaft farm. The underground storage and fuel 
distribution system will be supplied from three surface storage tanks, batch transferred to 
underground storage day tanks by means of 50 mm piping installed down a dedicated 
borehole.
The existing core storage is capable of servicing the existing operation and the expansion 
operation, no changes are required.
Toyota has constructed a light-vehicle maintenance facility for contract maintenance of all 
light vehicles at the site. The facility is complete and fully functional but is now being used for 
general purpose maintenance storage. This shop will be used to provide light / medium 
vehicle maintenance for the construction fleet.
The entire site boundary is surrounded by a mine lease perimeter fence with security gates at 
entrance/exit points. The fence is a conventional post-and-chain mesh, wide-type, 
approximately two metres high. Supplementary security fencing will be required at individual 
infrastructure facilities for the expansion activities.

Water demand for the Oyu Tolgoi facility has been calculated at between 588 L/s and 
785 L/s, with an average yearly demand of 696 L/s, to meet a nominal production rate of 
100 ktpd. The primary source of raw water to meet these requirements is the Gunii Hooloi 
basin, which extends 35–70 km north of the Oyu Tolgoi site.
The raw water supply system was completed in 2012.
Minimising water use throughout all the operational aspects has been a key focus of 
attention during mine planning and design. As examples of water conservation planning, the 
following initiatives have been implemented:
  Reuse of cooling water –The process plant is the largest consumer of water. Within the
plant, all water discharged from the cooling systems, still categorised as clean water, is 
sent to the process water pond for reuse in the concentrator.
  High-efficiency tailings thickeners – The tailings thickener at Oyu Tolgoi uses advanced
techniques and is able to achieve a tailings solids content of 60%–64%, which significantly 
reduces the amount of water sent to the TSF. These design modifications help to greatly 
reduce the amount of reclaim water released and evaporative losses from the TSF.
  High-efficiency TSF reclaim – The TSF has been designed so that tailings are deposited in
discreet cells, rather than broadly across the facility, to reduce evaporative losses. The 
entire base of the TSF rests on natural or installed clay and includes a comprehensive 
seepage collection system to minimise seepage losses. The TSF reclaim system has been 
designed to ensure that all supernatant water and collected seepage is returned to the 
process plant for reuse.
  100% mine water recovery – All water encountered in the underground and open pit 
mines is recovered for use as process water or for dust suppression. Recovery of mine 
water helps to reduce site demand for raw water from the Gunii Hooloi aquifer. From a 
water balance perspective, this mine recovery water has conservatively not been 
included as inflow.
  100% treated wastewater reuse – All treated wastewater produced in the site
wastewater treatment plant will be reused in the process plant or for dust suppression.
  100% truck wash water reuse – A comprehensive water treatment system has been
installed at the project mine truck washing facility to allow all truck wash water to be 
continuously recycled and reused.
  Lagoon floating cover – A floating cover is placed over the entire raw water storage
lagoon to eliminate evaporative water losses and to limit the accumulation of dust within 
the lagoon.
  Selection of low or zero water use equipment – Examples of this include the selection of
air cooling systems at the hazardous waste incinerator and central heating plant.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Ongoing attention to water conservation will be maintained during operation through the 
continuous review of key performance indicators for water use and implementation of 
additional water conservation measures.
A site water balance has been established that identifies water supply, recovery loops and 
losses at Oyu Tolgoi during routine 110 ktpd operations. Notable features of the water 
balance with regard to water recovery and reuse include:
  Tailings thickener recovery loop ‒ 76% (2,356 L/s of 3,088 L/s) of water is recovered for
reuse within the concentrator.
  TSF reclaim loop ‒ a further 6.6% (205 L/s of 3,088 L/s) of water is recovered for reuse
within the concentrator.
  Cooling water recovery ‒ raw water supply (163 L/s) for concentrator equipment cooling
is recovered to the process water pond and reused in the concentrator.
  Treated wastewater recovery ‒ Recoverable treated domestic wastewater (anticipated 
3.4 L/s) is returned to the process water pond and reused in the concentrator (or reused 
for dust suppression).
  Mine water recovery ‒ Recoverable water from mining operations is returned to the 
process water pond and reused in the concentrator (or reused for dust suppression).
  Zero discharges ‒ Water is fully recovered and reused within the system and there are no
planned discharges.
A simplified site water balance is shown in Figure 18.9.
As a result of the water conservation and reuse measures, more than 80% of the water used in 
production consists of recycled water; water will typically be used more than five times 
before being lost. Oyu Tolgoi is expected to consume less than 550 L/t of ore, which is less 
than half the typical water usage rate (1,220 L/s of ore) for copper‒gold concentrating mines 
worldwide.

Most water losses will be from the TSF, primarily associated with water that is locked in solids 
(retained in the tailings soil matrix), but also due to evaporation. Additional water losses will 
result from dust control in the underground mine and the roads associated with the open pit 
and infrastructure. Minor water losses relate to construction activities (e.g., concrete 
production), infrastructure maintenance (e.g., heating system make-up), and unrecoverable 
water from domestic water use.
The water demand estimate for Oyu Tolgoi assumes a peak design processing rate of 
110 ktpd and 64% tailings density. Although the need for mine dewatering at a rate of up to 
90 L/s is predicted, this value is uncertain and may not be realised, therefore has been 
conservatively excluded from design assumptions of water demand from the water supply 
system.
The total site design water demand for Phase 1 ranges from 588–785 L/s, with an average of 
696 L/s, to support the nominal production rate of 110 ktpd. The breakdown of the peak 
water demand for Phase 1 provided here demonstrates the significance of the 
concentrator’s water usage:
  Concentrator (especially TSF)
670 L/s

At the 110 ktpd production rate, the anticipated average concentrator demand is 628 L/s 
and peak demand is 670 L/s.
Project water supply investigations began in early 2002 with geophysical surveys of known 
sedimentary basins within a feasible distance of the project area. This early exploration 
indicated the presence of at least six substantial groundwater deposits within the region, all 
within 100–200 km’s from Oyu Tolgoi:
  Tsagaan Tsav
800 L/s
  Balgasyn Ulaan Nuur
150 L/s
  Galbyn Gobi
  Tavan Ald
  Nariin Zag
  Zairmagt
300 L/s
130 L/s
50 L/
30 L/s
Based on initial assessment, Galbyn Gobi was selected for further work, considering its high 
potential for aquifer development and relatively close proximity to the project site.
Figure 18.10 shows the locations of the three regional aquifers initially selected for 
consideration: Galbyn Gobi, Gunii Hooloi, and Nariin Zag.

The suitability of the Gunii Hooloi resource has been determined through three key 
groundwater exploration and testing programmes undertaken for OT LLC by Aquaterra, one 
2003/2004, the second from January to September of 2007 and the third using the significant 
additional body of data generated with completion of the borefield construction in 
2011/2012 and the 2011 drilling and testing programmes.
The results from the three key field investigation programmes were integrated to promote a 
detailed understanding and a detailed hydrogeological model has been developed to 
represent the natural behaviour and dynamics of the aquifer system.
The geology in the Gunii Hooloi area is highly faulted and structurally complex, giving rise to 
aquifer features that include shallow alluvial aquifers, shallow bedrock with weathering-
enhanced permeability, and deeper, structurally controlled aquifers.
The shallow alluvial aquifers occur in near-outcrop colluvial deposits, alluvial outwash plains, 
and alluvium in modern creek beds. Alluvial deposits cover approximately 70% of the 
concession area. Recharge to the shallow aquifers is via infiltration along the interface 
between bedrock outcrop and colluvium, direct infiltration from rainfall, and creek flow. 
These shallow aquifers are typical of water supplies used by local people for domestic and 
livestock purposes along drainage features in the surrounding area.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 412 of 519
Bedrock lithologies within the project area are typically of very low permeability, although 
secondary permeabilities resulting from fracturing and weathering are not uncommon. The 
upper weathering and transported horizons are generally of low permeability.
Gunii Hooloi is a fault-controlled sedimentary basin within a basement graben structure. The 
sedimentary in-fill sequence includes undifferentiated Quaternary sediments, underlain by the 
Upper Cretaceous Bayanzag and Bayanshiree formations. The surface topography of the 
sedimentary basin is relatively flat and subdued. In contrast, the bedrock topography that 
defines the basin profile outcrops around the margins of the basin and forms pronounced 
topographic highs.
The basin contains two main aquifer systems: a major, deep, largely confined aquifer, and a 
localised, unconfined streambed aquifer associated with active drainage channels. The key 
characteristics of these systems are outlined below.
The deep aquifer in the Gunii Hooloi basin is the source of raw water for the Project. The main 
water-bearing unit typically consists of a stratified sequence of sands, gravel, sandstones, 
siltstones, and gravelstones interbedded with lesser clayey aquitard horizons. The unit is 
aerially extensive (>550 km2) and flows continuously for over 40 km to the north-east. It ranges 
in thickness from 30 m in the south-west to >260 m in the large north-eastern sector. An 
extensive, clayey, confining aquitard overlies the main aquifer and separates it from the 
near-surface system; the clay layer ranges in thickness from 10 m in the south-west to 
approximately 100 m in the north-east.
The streambed aquifer system is a discrete river alluvial feature associated with the major 
surface water drainage networks. The shallow water is usually found in alluvium materials less 
than five metre thick.
As with the regional deep Gunii Hooloi aquifer, surface water systems extend farther north-
east, but these appear to be fed from seasonal rainfall and there is no evidence of linkage to 
the regional aquifer. Neither is there seen to be any connection between the deep aquifer 
and the shallow herders’ wells in near-surface streambed aquifers.
Field measurements from the 2007 test programme indicated that water in the deep 
Gunii Hooloi aquifer was generally saline, with TDS in the range of 1,500–5,300 ppm and 
averaging 2,760 ppm. Other testing has found salinity levels ranging from 1,300–3,200 ppm 
with an average of 2,400 ppm. The water is also slightly alkaline, with an average pH of 7.46 
as measured in 2007.
Water in the shallow streambed aquifers was found in the 2007 field measurements to have 
TDS mostly below 800 mg/L and averaging 690 mg/L. Water quality in shallow herders’ wells is 
usually better, often having a salinity of less than 350 ppm. Most wells are associated with 
surface drainage features that recharge seasonally.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 413 of 519
Given the minor amount of recharge to the main aquifer system, abstraction of groundwater 
at the rates proposed will result in drawdown of the aquifer water levels. Assessments were 
based on the predicted aquifer drawdown limits of up to 75 m over 40 years at Gunii Hooloi. It 
is recognised that the depletion of these aquifers will take many hundreds of years to recover. 
However, the groundwater model of Gunii Hooloi predicts that even after 40 years of 
extraction, the deep aquifer system will remain confined and is likely to have no effect on the 
streambed aquifers. Predicted aquifer drawdown is illustrated in Figure 18.11.
Environmental studies for the Project (see Section 20, Environment) have found that the 
drawdown would have very low potential for affecting the environment or shallow water 
resources currently accessed by herders. The shallow water systems present in some parts of 
the Gunii Hooloi area are stream-fed shallow groundwater within riverbeds that are 
replenished following summer rainfall; water levels within the riverbeds are highly variable. The 
deep layer of clay above the deep aquifer is expected to limit leakage from the shallow 
riverbed systems that could result from the drawdown. Considering the seasonal and annual 
variations in water levels within the river sediments, any leakage would be insignificant.
Drawdown will be monitored, and the aquifer model will be updated and refined as more 
data become available. As necessary, abstraction from the boreholes will be adjusted to 
optimise drawdown characteristics and protect the shallow groundwater resources.

Based on the first two hydrogeological investigation programmes, the Gunii Hooloi aquifer 
has been demonstrated and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Green 
Development to be capable of providing 870 L/s based on usage over 40 years and with 
limitations on drawdown that ensure that the main body of the aquifer remains in confined 
conditions.
Updated hydrogeological modelling, completed in 2013, and based on all three 
hydrogeological investigation programmes, demonstrates that the Gunii Hooloi aquifer is 
capable of providing 1,475 L/s based on the same time and drawdown conditions.
Hydrogeological analytical study and reporting, to Mongolian norms, remains to be 
completed in order to demonstrate and gain approval from the Ministry of Environment and 
Green Development of updated approved water reserve for the Gunii Hooloi aquifer.
The existing water treatment and bottling plant is capable of servicing the existing operation 
and the expansion construction and operation, no changes will be made.
The existing water storage and pumping station is capable of servicing the existing operation 
and the expansion construction and operation.
The existing facilities are adequate to cater for the existing operation and the expansion 
construction and operation.
The existing wastewater treatment plant is adequate to manage OTFS14 expansion 
requirements. This facility was installed within the main camp area, was upgraded from 
800 equivalent people (EP) capacity to 4,000 EP in 2006 and is fully operational to 
accommodate the sewage production of the construction and operations labour force. All 
sewage generated on-site will either be pumped directly to the plant or transported by truck 
to an unloading bay.
Operations has now assumed control of the original construction camps. The construction 
workforce will make use of the existing camp facilities in an integrated manner with 
operations.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 415 of 519
Construction water for the expansion will originate from the Gunii Hooloi borefield.
A 90 m x 50 m construction warehouse has been built and is in daily use. As the function of 
the warehouse has evolved into an operations warehouse, more warehouse facilities will be 
required for expansion construction. Therefore, the operations warehouse expansion will be 
built early in the expansion programme for use as a construction warehouse. This will provide 
an interim space of 52.5 m x 126 m for the expansion construction needs.
Batch Plants No. 1, 2, and 3 are complete and operational. No further batch plants are 
planned.
Batch Plant No. 3 optimally operates at 40 m3/h and provides a dedicated supply of 
concrete for the underground mine.
OT LLC owns eight 10 m3 concrete mixer trucks and plans to augment the delivery fleet by 
six 10 m3 units for the expansion activities. Any further short-term mixer truck capacity will be 
provided by contractors as required.
Concrete will be delivered from the surface batch plants through slicklines in Shafts 1 and 2. 
At the peak of construction, additional slicklines will be installed in sacrificial boreholes near 
the end-use points to improve construction rates and reduce shaft station congestion. Shaft 1 
already has two slicklines (152 mm) with a hopper capable of feeding each. Shaft 2 will be 
fitted with four 152 mm slicklines, which will remain in service for LOM requirements.
Several options for the design of the tailings storage facility (TSF) for Oyu Tolgoi have been 
investigated since 2002. Knight Piésold (KP), Klohn Crippen Berger (KCB), and Golder 
Associates (Golder) were all engaged at various times to identify and develop alternative 
sites, deposition strategies, and layouts.
Site selection was based on consideration of such aspects as local topography, location 
relative to other project facilities, required storage capacity, potential environmental 
impacts, water conservation, and the potential for future TSF expansion. Central or perimeter 
discharge, paste tailings, and conventional thickened tailings deposition methods were all 
evaluated. Because of the flat topography, most designs required the construction of a 
perimeter embankment to retain the tailings within a basin. Layout design grew out of the 
decisions for the TSF site, the OTFS14 Reserve Case mine plan, and the tailings disposal 
method.
The selected site for tailings deposition is 2 km east of the open pit, 5.0 km south-east of the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 416 of 519
process plant, and is based on the deposition of conventional thickened tailings. The 
concept is to construct cells using perimeter embankments that would be expanded over 
the LOM.
The 2014 Reserve Case requires the construction of five independent tailings cells of the same 
design. Since the 2014 Reserve Case runs to 2055 and tailings dam design is likely to adapt 
over time to maximise water recovery and minimise construction cost, discussion here is 
limited to the first two cells. These are sufficient for the first 18 years of mine life and are a 
feasible design for the storage of the remaining tailings for the purposes of cost estimation, 
economic evaluation, and environmental compliance.
The Cell 1 facility was designed to store tailings produced from a concentrator designed to 
process 100 ktpd and has already been constructed. The tailings impoundment layout for two 
such cells (see Figure 18.14 in Section 18.7.5) comprises two 2 km x 2 km cells (1 and 2), each 
subdivided into four sub-cells (A through D). Tailings are spigotted from the west embankment 
into the sub-cells to promote water run-off toward the reclaim pond at the north-east corner 
for water recovery. Water is reclaimed from the pond by a floating barge and pumped back 
for re-use in the process plant.
Klohn Crippen Berger (KCB) has been involved as the tailings design consultant since the first 
main pre-feasibility study in 2006 (KCB, 2007b). KCB performed the early site assessments and 
field and laboratory testwork, and evaluated various square cell geometries based on both 
low-permeability and flow-through embankment designs.
Following additional site assessments and investigations of foundation conditions, water 
management, and changes to the mining approach in 2008 and 2010, KCB produced a 
feasibility study update report in 2011 (KCB, 2011).
The 2011 feasibility design, which was ultimately adopted for the project, with some 
modifications, consists of two tailings deposition cells, each 2 km x 2 km in size surrounded by 
earth fill embankments up to 70 m high, with a total storage capacity for 720 Mt of tailings. As 
a result of subsequent field measurements of settled density, the design capacity has been 
reduced to 670 Mt, sufficient for the first 18 years of operations.
The current estimate of tailings production over the life of the 2014 Reserve Case is 1.528 bt. 
The capacity of the TSF will therefore have to be increased for continuing mine operations 
after Year 18. OT LLC is currently in the process of developing alternative layouts and designs 
for three additional cells to meet these storage requirements. This further work will consider 
several factors, such as:
  The clay reserves north and east of Cells 1 and 2.
  Foundation material types, foundation strength, and associated embankment stability in
the footprint options.
  Material requirements for dam construction and the availability of non-acid-forming
(NAF) and borrow materials.
  Haul distance from the open pit and the open pit configuration for the later phases of
the mine plan.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 417 of 519
  Routing of the tailings pipeline alignment.
  Optimisation of the current design based on deposition and construction experience.
  Embankment stability and performance.
  Environmental impacts of a raised impoundment compared to a more expansive
impoundment.
At the time of OTFS14, future facility expansion beyond Cell 2 has not been completed to a 
feasibility level design and will be deferred until operational experience is obtained from 
Cells 1 and 2 and can be incorporated into the expansion designs. The tailings and 
embankment behaviour, as well as overall TSF performance, will be monitored during the 
early operation of Cells 1 and 2. For this study, the quantities and costs developed for 
Cells 1 and 2 have been prorated and scheduled for the full life of both the Reserve case 
and the LOMC, an appropriate assumption considering the flat terrain across the site.
Construction of the starter dam began in 2011, based on the KCB embankment design 
drawings and specifications; progress to date is discussed in Section 18.7.3. In mid-2013, KCB’s 
design contract for the TSF was terminated, and Golder Associates was engaged to conduct 
Quality Control testing and interim design for Years 1–5 based on the KCB feasibility study 
construction drawings. KCB was retained to perform Quality Assurance reviews.
The Golder design work is currently underway. Golder seeks to optimise embankment design 
and reduce material quantities, but because its work has not been independently reviewed, 
the quantity estimates developed for Cells 1 and 2 have not been applied to the OTFS14 
expansion designs for Cells 3, 4, and 5. This is considered to be conservative because the 
future cells will share one common wall with an existing cell.
The starter dam construction was completed in 2013 in time for the concentrator start-up. The 
QC reports indicate that the work was largely completed in accordance with the starter dam 
design drawings issued by KCB. However, a number of issues arose shortly after start-up, 
including:
  The tailings were observed to be much more fluid than expected and did not create a
well-formed beach.
  The tailings beach slope was observed to be about 0.6% initially and then flattened to
0.3% versus the design assumption of 1.0%.
  Tailings density was estimated to be about 1.26 t/m3, significantly lower than the design
assumption of 1.45 t/m3.
  Large ponds needed to be generated within each sub-cell to achieve a degree of
clarity in the decant pond.
All of these factors resulted in more water being stored with the tailings, higher rates of rise, 
poorer return water quality, and the need for higher embankment raises. However, the 
ultimate storage volume of the design remains overwhelmingly a function of the settled 
tailings density.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 418 of 519
It was subsequently determined that many of the tailings thickener rake ploughs had sheared 
off, resulting in lower concentrations of solids than the design assumption of 62%–64%. Due to 
these depositional properties, a number of embankment modifications were implemented:
  All upstream and modified centreline construction designs in the KCB design were
changed to downstream construction.
  Embankment zonation and specifications were not modified, but the embankment zones
were kept relatively wide to facilitate construction.
  Because of poor trafficability on the west beach slope, an intermediate bench was
added to each stage in this area for distribution pipeline raises.
  The east dike needed to be raised quickly to accommodate the flatter beach slopes
and the additional tailings reporting to the east side of the embankment. This was 
accomplished immediately before winter 2013–2014, and the tailings surface has since 
been equilibrating at a slope of about 0.45% (May 2014 results). Tailings flocculation and 
rheology testwork has indicated the potential for steepening the slope to 0.5% and 
beyond with a closer approach to design deposition densities.
Golder re-evaluated the foundation shear strength and concluded that embankment 
quantities could possibly be reduced during the next few years. These assumptions remain to 
be fully modelled, but initial results indicate that quantities can be maintained at or below 
the KCB projections.
KCB prepared a design criteria report as part of the feasibility study (KCB, 2011). Parameters 
include site climatic and hydrology conditions, design throughputs and total storage 
requirements, operating requirements, and environmental considerations. Minimum 
standards for geotechnical and hydro-technical design include return periods for design 
precipitation events, required factors of safety for static conditions and seismic events, and 
allowable deformations under seismic loading conditions.
The design tonnages and throughputs for the OFTS14 plan are compared to the tonnages 
used in the 2011 feasibility design in Figure 18.12 and Figure 18.13. The current estimate of 
tailings production over the mine life is 1,528 Mt. The feasibility level TSF design provides 
storage for 670 Mt of tailings, and conceptual designs have been developed to provide 
storage for the rest of the tailings.

140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 420 of 519
The tailings characteristics are summarised as follows:
  Gradation testing of the tailings indicates the material is a typical copper tailings sandy 
silt with 45%–65% fines (less than 74 µm) and clay-sized material (less than 2 µm) ranging 
from 6.0%–16%.
  The design density of the tailings was estimated to be 1.45 t/m3 for initial placement in the
starter dam and consolidating to 1.5 t/m3 for the ultimate facility. Tailing densities during 
initial start-up were found to be about 1.26 t/m3, however, having been adversely 
affected by poor thickener performance and limited drainage with few sub-cells in use. 
A density of 1.35 t/m3 is being used in current projections to reflect anticipated 
improvements in sub-cell management and thickener performance.
  Hydraulic conductivity for consolidated tailings at shallow depth is estimated to be  
1x10-7 m/s, decreasing to 5x10-9 m/s at the base of the tailings impoundment due to 
increased consolidation pressure.
  Geochemical testwork predicts that tailings from Central zone, the Wedge zone,
Hugo South, and Heruga will be strongly potentially acid forming (PAF). Non-acid-forming 
(NAF) tailings are predicted from Southwest zone, Hugo North, the Shaft Farm area, and 
Hugo North Extension (Rio Tinto, 2011a).
  The original design assumed that tailings would be pumped at a target density of 64% 
solids, forming an assumed overall beach slope of 1.0%. Performance to date suggests 
that densities at discharge may be in the range of 58%–60% solids. With the lower solids 
concentration, beach slopes of about 0.5%–0.7% are anticipated, with short-term beach 
slopes much shallower.
  Based on laboratory testwork, the tailings were expected to form a hard crust as they
dried that would aid in inhibiting dust formation in periods of inactivity. Performance data 
have shown the tailings beaches remain wet during tailings deposition, with little dust 
emission. Estimates of evaporative losses have therefore been updated in the water 
balance to reflect the larger wetted area.
The TSF will be developed by constructing engineered earth fill and rock fill embankments. 
Locally borrowed general fill and clay materials will be used for the starter dam. The clay 
borrow material will also be used for lower permeability liners where Cretaceous clay is not 
present and within core zones.
Two categories of waste have been designated: potentially acid forming (PAF) and non-
acid-forming (NAF). Most of the embankment will be constructed of various mine waste rock 
materials and will include:
  Oxide waste rock – This material will act as the processed filter zones between the fine
tailings and the coarser waste. The oxide units are NAF and can be segregated for 
construction; the remaining oxide would be classified as PAF and placed in waste rock 
storage.
  Sedimentary rock – This material will be placed at the base of the downstream
embankment shells as a NAF filter and drainage system.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 421 of 519
  Random waste rock – Both NAF and PAF waste rock from the open pit will be placed in 
the embankment shells of the TSF where water cannot come into contact with the PAF, 
while NAF-only material will be used where these materials could be in contact with 
seepage.
The mine plan indicates that NAF rock types comprise about 30% (547 Mt) of the total 
1,966 Mt of waste rock to be produced. The timing and ability to effectively separate the NAF 
rock will affect the potential to use all of it for embankment construction. Dam zoning to 
incorporate some PAF rock into the dry sections of the embankment shells may be required. 
OT LLC has developed a draft strategy to identify and segregate waste products by 
chemistry and physical characteristics (gradation) (Rio Tinto, 2011b). All filter zones and the 
basal blanket layer will be constructed of NAF oxide and sedimentary rock units.
This section describes the FS design (KCB, 2011) of the TSF. Where changes have been made 
or are anticipated based on recent operating experience, these are noted.
For the first 18 years of production, the TSF will consist of two cells, each approximately 4.0 km2 
in size, to store a total of 670 Mt of tailings. The facility will be constructed in two stages, 
starting with Cell 1 and then continuing with Cell 2. The general arrangement of the cells is 
shown in Figure 18.14.
This footprint has not changed since 2011, although embankment slopes in final design may 
not be as shown. OT LLC has not yet decided which embankment design to adopt, but the 
alternative Golder design is expected to result in equal or lower net present cost over the 
mine life than the KCB design.
Each cell will be divided into four parallel sub-cells by berms. Berms, or splitter dikes, will 
constrain the active tailings beach to one sub-cell. An alternative method of tailings 
deposition management, whereby the number of spigots is increased to include the south-
west side of the tailings, is being evaluated. This would eliminate the splitter dikes and present 
a cost savings.
Supernatant water will run down the active beach to the eastern embankment and flow 
from there to one of two reclaim ponds situated on the north-east corner of Cell 1 and south-
east corner of Cell 2. The two reclaim ponds may be combined in future by eliminating the 
central north embankment of Cell 1. However, the two cells would need to be combined 
within the next two years to eliminate the centre dike between Cells 1 and 2. The current cost 
estimate is conservatively based on each cell being raised independently, with some 
duplication of one of four walls for each cell.
The original impoundment design is based on the assumption that the tailings beach will 
slope from the deposition point to the reclaim pond at an average of 1.0%. Sensitivity 
analyses were completed for beach slopes varying from 0.7%–1.5% for the starter dam facility. 
At flatter beach slopes, the eastern dike must initially be raised more quickly (while the 
western dike is raised more slowly). Likewise, flatter beach slopes tend to correspond to lower 
placed-tailings density, which requires the embankments to be raised more quickly. This is
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 422 of 519
underway in the 2014 construction season. Recent rates of rise (May 2014) have reduced 
considerably, indicating both melting of winter ice and tailings consolidation.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 423 of 519
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 424 of 519
The earth and rock fill embankments constructed to store the tailings will be up to 70 m high 
and will generally vary in form based on the varying tailings deposition and water 
management regimes around the perimeter of each cell.
As part of the scope of work awarded to Golder Associates in mid-2013, Golder re-evaluated 
foundation strengths to see if it was possible to permit steeper final embankment slopes that 
would use less material within the embankment at a given elevation. Because these design 
input assumptions have not been reviewed by the ITRB, the more conservative slopes and 
embankment quantities developed by KCB are being used at this time. Golder’s design 
assumptions will be evaluated further in a monitoring programme during operations, which 
will include monitoring piezometers, surveying beaches, surface observations, inclinometer 
measurements, and embankment surveys.
Currently, Golder has been tasked to design the impoundment for flatter beach slopes of 
0.6% for the initial years of operation. This redesign will affect short-term embankment 
quantities, bringing additional material forward. Once stable beach slopes are established, 
embankment quantities are expected to be as forecast.
Due to the low tailings density and low deposition gradients observed during start-up and the 
resulting high raise rates, shorter-term design modifications have been necessary. All the KCB 
design sections were modified to a downstream construction approach because a stable 
beach was not available for use in either the centreline or modified upstream construction 
method. This approach is able to impound the soft tailings without requiring support from the 
tailings themselves.
The current embankment sections follow the original design of the KCB decant pond cross-
section, which was applied around the entire perimeter of the Cell 1 embankment. No 
modifications were made to the filter and clay layers previously developed and approved by 
the ITRB.
A preliminary quantity estimate provided by Golder compares favourably to the KCB quantity 
estimate in terms of total volume of materials. Planning for the project will continue with the 
current, more conservative KCB estimate until a design review is completed and the ITRB has 
approved the design modifications to implement the Golder design.
Three types of embankment sections have been developed for construction:
  Reclaim pond section – This section is in the vicinity of the reclaim pond area where a
minimum three metre deep water pond will accumulate against the upstream face of 
the embankment during operations. This section was originally and continues to be 
designed as a downstream-constructed embankment with a low hydraulic conductivity 
zone (Cretaceous clay) to limit seepage. Figure 18.15 shows the original KCB design, and 
Figure 18.16 shows the similar Golder design for the typical reclaim pond section and the 
various material types used to construct this portion of the embankment.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 425 of 519
  Dry section – This section will be used at the upstream end of the TSF where seepage will
only occur during periods of active tailings deposition. Golder has added operational 
benches to support the spigot discharge line. This section is now also being downstream 
constructed with filter zones incorporated to prevent migration of tailings into the 
embankment. Figure 18.17 (lower image) shows a typical dry section.
  Wet section – This section will also be raised using the downstream approach and will
incorporate filter zones to prevent migration of tailings into the embankment. The 
operational benches for placement of spigot pipelines have been removed; otherwise 
the section is the same as the dry section. Figure 18.17 (upper image) shows a typical wet 
section.
The foundation characterisation has identified brittle clay deposits that will require varying 
downstream buttress berms according to the thickness of clay. Buttresses may range in width 
up to 500 m, and the resulting overall downstream slope of the embankments may range 
from 2.5H:1V to 9.2H:1V (horizontal to vertical).
In general, the steeper slopes are applicable to the southern/south-east part of the 
embankment, where foundation clays become discontinuous and bedrock is present, and 
the flatter slopes apply to the north-west part of Cell 2. Given that the stability of the dam on 
the clay foundation is dependent upon the rate of consolidation and pore pressure 
dissipation, an observational and monitoring approach will be used to monitor the 
embankment foundation and test fills to validate and refine the final geometry.
As stated previously, material quantities are based on the more conservative KCB estimates. 
Although the downstream construction approach generally requires more embankment 
construction material, the KCB values are conservative for OTFS14 purposes considering the 
flatter slopes KCB assumed compared to the present estimates by Golder. The following 
approach was used to adjust the KCB quantities to the current concentrator tailings 
production:
  The annual KCB material take-offs (MTOs) were copied into columns
(Year, Cell 1 volume (m3), Cell 2 volume (m3)).
  The planned concentrator production from the original KCB 2011 report was copied into
a parallel column by year.
  The amount of embankment material required each year was copied into a parallel
column so that annual tailings and embankment quantities could be seen.
  The amount of embankment material was plotted against the total amount of tailings for
a given year. The correlation between embankment volume and tailings volume (in m3 
tailings) was developed using the tailings density of 1.45 t/m3 from the original design.
  The above correlation and the OTFS14 tailings production estimate were then used to
estimate the amount of embankment material required for a given tailings tonnage. The 
tailings density was adjusted to the current estimate of 1.35 t/m3.
  The OTFS14 tailings production estimate then yields the amount of embankment material
required in a given year.

140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 429 of 519
The correlation between the original KCB and current embankment quantities at various 
tailings densities is shown in Figure 18.18. Embankment quantities based on KCB 2011 and 
assumed tailings densities of 1.25, 1.35, and 1.45 t/m3 are presented on the left ordinate axis, 
and tailings production is presented on the right ordinate axis. It can be seen that the amount 
of embankment material required each year is lower than in the original KCB design, primarily 
due to the lower concentrator tailings production, even at the lowest tailings density 
assumption of 1.25 t/m3. This excludes the effect of the lower slope, which has resulted in the 
need for additional embankment raising in the 2014 construction season.
Embankment quantity projections for the OTFS14 cost estimate are based on an in-place 
density of 1.35 t/m3, which corresponds to a density of 72% solids This includes the effect of 
additional consolidation pressure with depth (ultimately to 70 m).
Water management is one of the major drivers of the design and operational planning for the 
TSF. Water for Oyu Tolgoi is supplied from a well field some distance from the mine site and is 
expensive. Water conservation is a major objective of project planning, and the concept of 
depositing tailings in sub-cells is intended to minimise evaporation losses and promote water 
release from the tailings by consolidation. Section 13 discusses the concentrator and tailings 
water balance, which dominates site raw water use. The balance has conservatively used 
1.30 t/m3 (approximately 70% solids at tailings SG of 2.8) to demonstrate the sufficiency of the 
raw water supply for the Reserve case. Optimisation of water use will involve balancing the 
evaporative and entrained water losses on the tailings dam, since the greater rate of rise 
leads to more water being entrained in tailings (due to less drainage) but less water being lost
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 430 of 519
to evaporation (due to less wetted area per tpd). Currently, entrainment losses exceed 
evaporation and sublimation losses by a factor of 10.
Water will be reclaimed from the eastern side of the impoundment by a pump barge that will 
return supernatant water back to the process plant. The normal water depth in the reclaim 
pond will be three metres but has been found to be shallower as a result of the flat beach 
slopes. Clarification ponds off the embankment are being evaluated to see if the clarity of 
the reclaim water can be improved while maintaining a small reclaim pond on the 
embankment itself. The water balance completed for Section 13 indicates that enough water 
would be available from the borefield to support a tailings production rate of approximately 
140 ktpd if sufficient raw water storage were provided for seasonal variation. This easily 
exceeds the peak annual tonnage equivalent of 119 ktpd projected in the Reserve case (for 
2029), which is accommodated without any need for additional site water storage.
A diversion ditch on the north side of Cell 1 will divert surface water around the TSF. The ditch 
will be realigned farther to the north before Cell 2 is constructed. The ditch has been 
designed for a 24-hour, 100-year return period precipitation event. Seepage and 
precipitation falling directly onto the embankment is collected in a toe collection ditch at the 
toe of the embankments.
This ditch will be approximately 4.0 m deep and has been designed to carry the anticipated 
amount of seepage (20–40 L/s) and run-off from a 24-hour, 100-year return period 
precipitation event. The ditch will direct water to two toe collection ponds on the east and 
west sides of the TSF.
Seepage from the impoundment to groundwater will be limited by the reduced permeability 
of the tailings themselves and also by the natural Cretaceous clay deposit that underlies 
approximately 75% of the impoundment footprint. The clay is generally absent in the south-
east corner of the facility, and therefore a 1.0 m thick liner of compacted Cretaceous clay 
has been placed there.
The following items will be addressed as future work based on the current TSF design for 
Oyu Tolgoi:
  The current design needs to be optimised given the operating conditions and lower
tailings solids content at deposition.
  Golder Associates is currently developing design drawings for the first five years of
operation, and this work will need detailed review.

It may be more cost effective overall to implement Cell 2 earlier than Year 5 (2018), as 
planned, in terms of the amount of embankment material required to store the tailings. 
Larger tailings deposition areas will result in higher in-place tailing densities (faster 
drainage and drying time) and greater storage capacity. This approach will be 
evaluated for potential cost savings.
  At a revised target density of 1.35 t/m3, the KCB 2011 feasibility design for the TSF provides
for storage of 670 Mt of tailings produced over the first 18 years of mine life. Once 
operating conditions are understood, the facility will need to be expanded to support 
continued mining beyond that capacity. Designs for the three additional cells required to
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 431 of 519
store the total 1.5 bt of tailings will be based on the deposition and construction 
experience gained in optimising the current design.
  The TSF location was originally required to remain inside the OT Licence Area 6709A
boundary, but this constraint has been removed. It may therefore be possible to expand 
the facility to the east or north in the future.
  Embankment slopes should be optimised based on observations from test fills and
conditions during the construction period. The design is currently based on assumptions 
of pore pressure response that could be conservative. The instrumentation and 
monitoring programme should be expanded to improve understanding of foundation 
performance.
  Observations made during operations with regard to beach formation and water
recovery are being evaluated to optimise the number of sub-cells in the TSF design. 
Alternately, the sub-cells may be eliminated entirely and an expanded spigot discharge 
system used to manage tailings deposition.
OT LLC plans to make use of the services of Rio Tinto Technology & Innovation to provide 
expertise to take advantage of opportunities and add value to Oyu Tolgoi. The current have 
been setup to investigate and implement projects in these areas: project monitoring, process 
technology and underground technology. The innovations and possible applications outlined 
below are not exhaustive, nor definitive, but rather are currently viewed as having the most 
significant potential impact for Oyu Tolgoi in the long-term.
Rio Tinto plans a longer-term view to developing its operations management capability to 
maximise performance through evaluation and implementation of advanced technologies. 
This approach would involve the strategic evaluation and collaboration with technology 
partners before further developing and implementing system capabilities in a phased and 
prioritised manner. Experience from a variety of industries has shown this approach to be 
crucial in achieving an integrated system that maximises the potential of the various 
technologies and the benefit to Oyu Tolgoi.
Rio Tinto Technology & Innovation has set up an operational optimisation centre in Brisbane, 
Australia that can remotely monitor most parameters tracked by field instrumentation and 
on-line measurements from several Rio Tinto processing plants around the world. At present, 
three operations are being monitored closely through pilot programmes to demonstrate 
proof-of-concept:
  Oyu Tolgoi concentrator
  Kennecott Utah Copper concentrator,
  Rio Tinto Coal Australia coal-washing plants
Subject matter experts from a variety of industry and academic partners are contractually 
engaged in review of real-time data with a clear mandate to rigorously implement changes 
in operating procedures and monitor performance to lock in gains. To date, Oyu Tolgoi has 
benefited particularly from stabilised control of flotation cell levels, pH optimisation, and the
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 432 of 519
retention of expert knowledge as the start-up teams move on to other projects.
Advanced grinding circuit control and higher-level optimising control ability are targeted for 
development in the next phase of study. Another area of opportunity is mine-to-mill 
optimisation to maximise SAG mill capacity under an Integrated Value Chain engagement. 
Examples are designing tighter drill patterns and customising powder factors, efforts that 
have been successful in increasing capacity by several percentage points at other 
operations.
Rio Tinto has supported a number of new technologies through its investment in the Rio Tinto 
Centre for Advanced Mineral Recovery at Imperial College London. Examples include:
  Copper NuWaveTM, a new mineral sorting technology that uses microwaves to estimate
the copper content on a rock-by-rock basis
  MicroHammerTM, a microwave pre-treatment process for reducing ore hardness and
enhancing value mineral liberation
  Peak Air Recovery, an air control technique in flotation that exploits the link between
flotation air recovery and valuable mineral recovery.
These techniques have been applied at demonstration plant scale at other Rio Tinto 
operations and are being tested at laboratory scale on Oyu Tolgoi ore samples with a view to 
incremental gains in contained copper output and/or recovery.
OT LLC has identified a variety of opportunities that have the potential to materially improve 
the performance of Oyu Tolgoi and ongoing operations at Hugo North Lift 1.
While many of the design principles in OTFS14 are specific to caving, the project and 
operating processes are very much standard in small to medium-size underground mines and 
are being extended to the context of large-scale caving. Given the scope of underground 
mining proposed at Oyu Tolgoi, any improvements in these processes have the potential to 
contribute substantial safety and financial benefits to the business.
Rio Tinto has developed a wide-ranging underground improvement strategy that identifies 
and prioritises capacity and innovation opportunities through the core stages of design, 
construction, and operation. The strategy is based around leveraging both internal and 
external expertise to improve existing technologies and processes and develop new ones. 
While it covers the full scope of underground mining projects within Rio Tinto, the strategy is 
very much focused around opportunities for improvement at Hugo North Lift 1.
It is anticipated that a number of improvements will be made in terms of mine design as well 
as development and production processes throughout the life of the Hugo North Lift 1.
Given the rapid advances in communication technologies over the past 10 years, particularly
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 433 of 519
in fibre optics and wireless networking, sophisticated communication and monitoring systems 
can now be readily adapted to the underground environment at what is expected to be 
reasonable cost and with high reliability. There are other types of operating systems that have 
become commonplace in other industries could have potential application in underground 
mining.
Key developments in these types of systems being investigated and implemented at Oyu 
Tolgoi include:
  Wireless communication infrastructure throughout all areas of the underground mine,
supported by a fibre optic backbone. This system could provide real time monitoring and 
data collection of all activities. Testing and development of wireless communication 
products for Oyu Tolgoi are currently in progress in conjunction with technology partners.
  Traffic management / collision avoidance system. Further evaluation and development 
in conjunction with technology partners is required for this system to be successful on the 
scale required for Oyu Tolgoi. The intensity of activity in large-scale cave mining from the 
large numbers of people and equipment required gives rise to a variety of safety risks, 
particularly in terms of interaction between people and equipment within the 
constrained space and limited visibility of the underground environment.
Together with communications infrastructure, effective data management is crucial to 
founding and realising the full benefits of an effective operations management system. 
Underground mines commonly use a variety of technologies or systems operating on 
independent data platforms with different data structures, standards, and security. Having a 
common and integrated approach to data management will minimise issues associated with 
the excessive effort required to obtain, analyse, use, and assess information in isolation, 
ultimately leading to more-effective decision-making and improved performance. Two data 
management opportunities that Rio Tinto is examining are:
  Optimisation of Operations: The combination of comprehensive real-time monitoring and 
integrated data management offers the potential to utilise expert systems to rapidly and 
accurately analyse mining performance information to develop performance forecasts 
for the short, medium, and long term.
  Shafts 3 and Shaft 4 – Potential Opportunity for Innovation: Shafts 3 and Shaft 4 provide
full ventilation capacity to support production ramp-up to the design production rate 
during ongoing development and construction. After restart construction activity for 
Shaft 4 is planned to commence 17 months and after 28 months for Shaft 3, opportunity 
exists to develop and test potential shaft-sinking innovations ranging from incremental 
improvements and potentially fundamental changes in the shaft-sinking method. The 
benefits realised through innovation in shaft sinking may be predominantly in the area of 
safety as opposed to productivity or cost.
Geotechnical engineering design principles for underground mines have evolved from 
experience at hundreds of mines over many years. An array of empirical and numerical 
models and methods have been developed and refined, but these largely pertain to lower
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 434 of 519
stress mining environments and are less accurate in predicting stress conditions, rock mass 
strength, and overall stability in higher-stress situations such as those in very deep mines or in 
cave mining operations. Given the lack of other prediction methods, geotechnical engineers 
have no alternative but to design stringent, comprehensive ground support systems, 
excavation procedures, and pillar requirements.
Rio Tinto is funding a programme of research through the Centre for Excellence in Mining 
Innovation in Canada aimed at improving the knowledge and understanding of stress and 
rock mass conditions in the caving environment. Known as the Rio Tinto Centre for 
Underground Mine Construction, the research programme involves detailed measurement 
and testing of actual conditions within operating mines, including Hugo North Lift 1, with 
evaluation by a widely experienced group of geotechnical experts from universities, research 
organisations, and companies throughout the world. The information obtained is expected to 
allow for ongoing improvements to the geotechnical design aspects of the Hugo North mine, 
particularly during the first several years of development.
Rio Tinto is evaluating several methods and processes aimed at improving the quality and 
schedule duration of drawbell construction. The anticipated process improvements are 
expected to help Hugo North maintain scheduled drawbell construction rates in areas of 
poor ground conditions and instability and to exceed construction rates in other areas.
The primary design cave production method is the use of load-haul-dump vehicles to load 
rock from drawpoints and transfer it to an ore pass for subsequent transport by trucks to the 
crushing station. Rio Tinto is working with a number of mobile equipment manufacturers, and 
engineering evaluations to date have indicated that payload capacity could be increased 
by as much as 20% with other types of equipment such as electric / hybrid powered loaders. 
An additional advantage would be reduced diesel consumption and corresponding 
ventilation requirements.
The size and flow behaviour of broken rock within the cave volume is perhaps the most 
significant area of uncertainty in cave mining. Rio Tinto is working with technology and 
research organisations to develop cave-monitoring systems capable of real-time 
measurements of rock material size and flow behaviour in the cave. Rio Tinto has indicated 
that initial trials and testing have been promising and if development is successful, such 
systems will be deployed at Hugo North.

The Oyu Tolgoi Sales and Marketing group has identified customers and agreed off-take 
commitments for the sale of all available products in 2014 and 2015. Its main focus for 2014 
has been:
  Continuing ramp-up of customer collections to return to normal inventory levels by end
2014.
  Executing trial shipments to alternative logistics routes, including non-Chinese markets.

Identifying and entering into long-term agreements with buyers for post-2016 production.
Shipment of Oyu Tolgoi concentrates commenced in 2013, after issue of the necessary 
approvals by the Chinese authorities.
The concentrate is loaded into two-tonne bags and shipped ‘delivered at place’ (DAP) by 
truck to the Mongolian‒ Chinese bi-lateral trade border at Gashuun Sukhait (GSK)‒
Ganqimaodao, and also to the dedicated customer pickup facility at the Huafang terminal 
in China, approximately 7 km from the border. At these locations, the customers will pay for 
the copper concentrate by means of a letter of credit and take responsibility for delivery of 
the concentrate by truck or train to the respective smelter(s).
Product specifications are updated for the short-term and medium-term planned production 
schedules. The OT LLC marketing group communicates and discusses any specification 
changes with Oyu Tolgoi customers.

The national impurity limits in China are issued jointly by the General Administration of Quality 
Supervision Inspection and Quarantine of the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection. The last such document was issued in April 2006 and specified the 
upper limits for impurities found in imported copper concentrate as shown in Table 19.2. 
Copper concentrate with impurities content above these limits cannot be approved for 
import into China. Copper concentrate with impurities content above these limits cannot be

Copper industry analysts forecast a surge in new production internationally in the next four 
years. Although there is reason to be sceptical of the timing owing to disruptions in mine 
supply and the delay in new projects coming on, the supply is expected to eventuate. The 
average annual increase in production for the next four years is expected to be 
approximately 840 ktpa Cu, with 4.2 Mt of new production forecast between 2012 and 2017, 
underpinned by mid to large-sized projects. This wave of new mine supply is expected to 
result in a continued surplus of mined concentrates during the period, resulting in higher 
treatment and refining charges for miners, while also encouraging new smelter capacity.
Despite the supply surplus forecast for 2014–2017, China (currently the main export destination 
of the Mongolian mining sector) has become increasingly reliant on imported copper 
concentrates. This trend is expected to continue through to 2017.
The OT LLC analysis of the copper market suggests long-term dynamics for copper will be 
driven by a combination of factors. Significant increases are forecast in copper consumption 
per capita, owing particularly to the industrialization and urbanization of China and other 
emerging markets such as India and Brazil. A back-drop of strong copper demand and 
constrained supply is expected to offer fundamental support to copper prices. In recent 
years, supply has failed to respond quickly enough to increased demand from emerging 
regions. Global electrification and the growth of China and India will drive the increasing 
intensity of use per capita GDP.
Copper demand will also benefit from a greater long-term focus on renewable sources of 
energy and energy-efficient technologies such as wind turbines and electric / hybrid vehicles, 
which are of copper-intensive fabrication.
The forecast risks in bringing on new copper supply pertain to technical difficulties, increased 
political unrest, the length of time required for permitting and approvals, and unforeseen 
disruptions caused by operational failures, strikes, and labour shortages.

With expansions in smelting capacity, the Chinese share of the custom copper concentrates 
market has increased rapidly over the last few years. The combination of reserve exhaustion 
and declining grades will mean that production from existing capacity will decline, while 
committed brownfield expansions will need to maintain current output levels.
Overall, global smelting capacity is expected to increase by the end of 2025. China is 
forecast to see the majority of growth in the next five years. Historically, raw material 
constraints have resulted in low utilisation rates, which have exacerbated the regional 
Chinese demand for concentrate, and this trend is forecast to continue. The issue in the years 
ahead will be the availability of concentrates for the custom smelters as Chinese capacity 
continues to grow. The market for custom, or traded, concentrates – those that are mined 
and processed by different companies – now accounts for more than half of the copper 
concentrates processed. The proportion of total concentrate production accounted for by 
the custom market has risen in recent years due to the rapid growth of the custom smelting 
industries in China and, to a lesser extent, India. Despite limited domestic resources, Chinese 
companies have invested heavily in smelting capacity and are highly dependent on the 
custom market for raw materials.
Oyu Tolgoi concentrate sales will need to capture a 25% market share eight years after start 
up. This is considered by OT LLC to be realistic, given the quality of the concentrate at the 
time and the relative proximity to Chinese smelters. In the intervening period, Oyu Tolgoi 
output will form a smaller percentage of the import market, starting at only 8.0% in 2013. After 
2021, Oyu Tolgoi’s production is projected to decline at a rate that would also result in a 
smaller percentage of total market share than the 2021 peak. Even if Oyu Tolgoi production is 
maintained at close to the peak levels through further mine expansions, Oyu Tolgoi’s market 
share is expected to continue to decline as Chinese concentrate demand continues to 
increase.
The OT LLC’s marketing team will have Mongolian marketing staff, recognising their 
importance and roles in marketing and sales for the Oyu Tolgoi product, and to develop 
capability of the Mongolian employees. Key considerations in the development of the 
marketing strategy include:
  Location of customer compared to imported material landed at Chinese ports (OT LLC
to pay freight differential from mine to customer versus port to customer).
  Precious metals recovery and payment.
  Length of contract.
  Percentage of off-take to smelters versus traders.
  Percentage of tonnage on contract versus spot.
  Percentage of feed for any one smelter.
  Number of customers for a given scale of operation.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 439 of 519
  Management of concentrate quality and volume during commissioning and ramp-up.
  Alternate off-shore logistics and costs.
  Delivery point and terms.
The commercial terms OT LLC will receive are planned be in line with conditions on the 
international concentrates market.
The smelter terms used in this study are based on OT LLC’s assessment of the copper market 
and standard smelter terms in general use throughout the industry.
The Oyu Tolgoi Project is located in the undeveloped region of southern Mongolia with no 
railway service. The mine will operate continuously, year-round, to produce copper 
concentrate, which will need to be transported by truck from the mine to the Mongolian / 
Chinese bi-lateral trade border at Gashuun Sukhait / Ganqimaodao. The customers will then 
be responsible for further transport within China or abroad.
An outbound logistics model has been developed and is now being synchronised with the 
logistics capabilities of the current contracted customer. Customers are aware that the 
assumptions surrounding logistics may change and that OT LLC has committed to an open 
dialogue with them.
The border facilities are rudimentary in nature and until such time that it obtains International 
Trade status, it is likely to remain limited in its capacity to process bi-lateral trade. Operating 
hours and schedule are limited by several factors, and is subject to sporadic closures. 
Weather, communications, and energy failures all contribute to this situation. Efforts are 
underway on both sides of the border to increase its capacity and efficiency.
In the event of a Mongolian / Chinese border shutdown, the outbound transport convoy 
(trucks and trailers) will divert to a secure and bonded holding yard on the Mongolian side of 
the border. The convoy will recommence on its original passage across the border, heading 
to Huafang terminal. Daily customer order shipments will be sequenced in the marshalling 
yard and moved into bond once quality clearance is issued. At this point all export 
documentation will be compiled to satisfy Mongolian Customs and other agencies.

This section provides a summary of the legal and policy framework for Oyu Tolgoi; 
environmental baseline studies and values; environmental assessment and permitting 
requirements; environmental management plans; environmental impact and mitigation 
measures; environmental design; construction management plan; and closure and 
rehabilitation plans with respect to compliance with Mongolian National Standards (MNS) 
and conformance with international guidelines and requirements, specifically those for the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), World Bank (WB), and European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
Where applicable, the text refers to relevant information from the updated environmental 
and social impact assessment (ESIA) for the project completed in 2012.
The Mongolian Constitution (1992) sets out the personal rights and freedoms of the people of 
Mongolia, including the right to a healthy and safe environment and protection against 
environmental pollution and ecological imbalance (Article 16.1.2). It also describes the 
system of government and allocates powers and responsibilities to each branch of 
government.
In general, national laws are introduced and enforced by the central government. The 
Ministry of Environment and Green Development (MEGD) has legal authority for 
environmental protection legislation and regulations. The Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Mines (MNRM) has legal authority for mining legislation and regulations. The central 
government delegates some powers to provincial (aimag) and regional (soum) levels.
The environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) (OT LLC, 2012) provides a good 
overview of the applicable environmental legislation and regulations currently applicable to 
the project.
Oyu Tolgoi has developed a comprehensive Health, Safety and Environmental Management 
System (HSE MS) that meets the requirements of the Rio Tinto HSEQ Management System 
Standard. The management system is designed on the principles of continual improvement 
and adopts the methodology of Plan, Do, Check and Review, which comprises 17 discrete 
elements for implementation.
In addition, the HSE MS incorporates elements of the Social Management System, which will 
continue to be aligned to meet the requirements of the Rio Tinto Communities Standard. The 
2012 Oyu Tolgoi HSE MS has been audited and is certified to ISO14001 and OHSAS18001.

The baseline assessment was prepared by Citrus, for OT LLC, by drawing upon the wide range 
of internal and independent studies that have been prepared for Oyu Tolgoi since 2003. The 
existing information was reviewed and assessed for accuracy, consistency, and validity. 
Where additional baseline data became available in 2010 and 2011 prior to the completion 
of the ESIA, these were incorporated in the publically disclosed ESIA.
Plans for ongoing data collection and studies are set out in the corresponding impact 
assessment chapters and management plans of the ESIA, as well as supplementary 
Operational Management and Monitoring Plans, to ensure baseline data continues to 
improve and that the results of ongoing monitoring and improved knowledge are integrated 
into updated and revised management plans and procedures.
In each baseline chapter of the ESIA, the following issues were considered in order to draw 
together the data and provide an overview of the sources, robustness, and validity of the 
original data:
  Clarity of data sources with key references cited, ensuring a clear appreciation of the
origin of information used.

Identification of third-party data verification undertaken by Oyu Tolgoi.
  Clear descriptions of the methodologies used to develop the baseline data.

Identification of where Oyu Tolgoi has commissioned further data collection, or where 
data collection remains ongoing.
The baseline chapters presented in the ESIA are, necessarily, a summary of an extensive body 
of research and assessment that has been ongoing over many years covering the 
biophysical environment and human environment.
The biophysical environment baseline addresses the following topics:
  Climate and climate change.
  Air quality.
  Noise and vibration.
  Topography, geology, and topsoils.
  Water resources.
  Biodiversity.
  Ecosystem services.
The human environment baseline addresses the following topics:
  Population and demographics.
  Employment and livelihoods.
  Land use.
  Transport and infrastructure.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 442 of 519
  Cultural heritage.
  Community health, safety, and security.
OT LLC is committed to sustainable development through effectively managing its 
environmental, social, and economic responsibilities. Throughout development, OT LLC’s 
primary intent is to assess and prevent the potentially adverse effects that mining activities 
can have on the natural environment, and to plan appropriately for future mining operations 
at Oyu Tolgoi.
OT LLC’s environmental work for Oyu Tolgoi is compliant with Mongolian regulatory 
requirements, internal policies and procedures, and external agreements. The environmental 
management plans for the project are designed to ensure that key environmental factors are 
monitored and protected.
The Oyu Tolgoi ESIA of 2012 built upon an extensive body of studies, reports, and detailed 
environmental impact assessments (DEIAs) prepared since 2002 for project design and 
development purposes and for Mongolian approvals under the following laws:
  The Environmental Protection Law (1995).
  The Law on Environmental Impact Assessment (1998, amended in 2001).
  The Minerals Law (2006).
The various earlier studies and reports have been updated regularly by a number of certified 
Mongolian DEIA consultants, with oversight by Sustainability East Asia and input from 
RPS Aquaterra on water issues.
The DEIAs provided baseline information for both social and environmental issues and were 
generally structured under a core categorisation of Mining and Processing, Transport and 
Infrastructure Corridor, Gunii Hooloi Water Supply, Coal Fired Power Plant, and Airport. In 
addition, a number of specific DEIAs were required to address arising/updated facilities and 
requirements not covered under the broader categories. Examples are specific assessments 
for the fuel depot, use of chemicals, and the Undai River diversion.
All DEIAs were prepared and approved in accordance with Mongolian standards, but, 
although developed to meet international standards, they were not specifically intended to 
comprehensively address overarching IFC or EBRD social or environmental sustainability 
policies.
In preparing the ESIA, the baseline environmental and social information, assessments, and 
monitoring and mitigation requirements were updated with recent data and management 
plans that meet IFC and EBRD performance standards/requirements. In addition, a social 
analysis was completed through the commissioning of a Socio-Economic Baseline Study and 
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for Oyu Tolgoi.
Table 20.1 summarises the previous key baseline studies and core DEIAs prepared for 
Oyu Tolgoi, and Table 20.2 summarises of the supplementary DEIAs and studies.

In addition to the Project elements identified above, certain other activities and facilities are 
expected to be developed over time, either as part of or in support of the project, which do 
not constitute part of the Project for the purposes of the ESIA. These include:
  Project expansion to support an increase in ore throughput from 100–160 ktpd.
  Long-term Project power supply. Under the terms of the IA, OT LLC will source electricity
from within Mongolia within four years of the commencement of Project operations. 
OT LLC may develop a coal-fired power plant within the Oyu Tolgoi Mine Licence Area 
to provide the required power from Mongolian sources.
While the impacts and management of these future Project elements are not directly 
addressed in the ESIA, they are considered in the cumulative impact assessment.
The potential impacts of the Project on the human environment may extend farther than the 
direct physical impacts of the Project on the biophysical environment. As a result, the Project 
Area of Influence (for the purposes of the ESIA) also extends to include:
  Communities and community members that will be directly affected by the Project in
ways that are foreseeable and within the reasonable control of the Project during 
construction, operations, and closure. This includes economically and physically 
displaced persons such as herder families whose winter camps and access to traditional 
summer pastures may be affected by the Project.
  Communities and community members that may be directly affected by population
influx, e.g., effects on water supply, wastewater, solid waste, housing, and other public 
services or facilities, including Khanbogd soum and Khanbogd soum centre
  Communities and herder households that may be affected by potential changes to
local and regional groundwater supplies in the Gunii Hooloi basin, downstream of the 
Oyu Tolgoi site, and along transportation corridors where access to, and water supplies 
in, established herder wells may be affected.
Cumulative impacts are defined by the IFC as the combination of multiple impacts from 
existing projects, the proposed project, and/or anticipated future projects that could result in 
significant adverse and/or beneficial impacts that would not be expected in the case of a 
stand-alone project.
Geographical areas, communities, and regional stakeholders could be subject to cumulative 
impacts from further developments at Oyu Tolgoi together with other existing or planned 
projects, trends, and developments within the South Gobi region. These will include:
  Macro-economic impacts across the Mongolian economy.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 445 of 519

Impacts on communities and infrastructure in the South Gobi region related, for example, 
to influx, economic changes, and pressure on infrastructure. Specifically, within 
Omnogovi aimag, this includes the soums of Khanbogd, Bayan Ovoo, Manlai, and 
Tsogttsetsii and the aimag capital, Dalanzadgad.
  Biodiversity impacts related to the fragmentation of ecosystems by roads and other
infrastructure.

Impacts on water resources in terms of both shallow aquifers for herder water supplies 
and deep aquifers for potential industrial water supplies.
The ESIA addresses a project with a 27-year design life. It is anticipated that the Project will 
continue in operation well after that date, possibly at higher production rates. Such plans are 
still at an early stage, so while they are referred to in the ESIA, they are not evaluated in the 
ESIA because of the limited amount of information available.
Similarly, a number of future developments of project-associated facilities are still under 
evaluation, and no clear decision has yet been made as to the preferred approach to be 
adopted by the Project. These include:
  The potential for a future rail link to be constructed from the South Gobi into China for the
export of coal from the Tavan Tolgoi area. If the rail link is constructed, then the Project 
would propose the construction of a spur line from the Oyu Tolgoi site to join the rail link. 
This would have significant impacts in terms of reducing the volume of heavy vehicles 
transporting concentrate from Oyu Tolgoi and coal from other mines into China. This is a 
decision that is being evaluated by the Government and is not under the control of the 
Project.
  The future power supply for the Project. In accordance with the IA, power will be
supplied from China during the first four years of project operations by the Inner Mongolia 
Power Company, after which Oyu Tolgoi is required to source electricity from within 
Mongolia.
Cumulative impacts are addressed in Chapter C13: Cumulative Impacts of the ESIA.
The key issues in terms of potential impact to air quality include:
  Dust emissions, together with their impact on human health and their potential to cause
nuisance to those exposed.
  Emissions of potentially polluting gases: sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and
carbon monoxide (CO), and their potential impact on human health.
  Emissions of other potentially hazardous species, including hydrochloric acid (HCl),
dioxins and furans, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), hydrogen fluoride (HF), and 
their potential impact on human health.
  Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (principally CO2).

Those receptors considered relevant to Project noise include:
  Worker accommodation facilities within the MLA, which will be used during the
operational and decommissioning phases of the Project.
  Established and permanent winter herder camps, although these are farther than 10 km
from the MLA. The herder winter camp resettlement programme undertaken to move 
herders away from the construction activities associated with the Project was completed 
in 2004. Oyu Tolgoi has since developed new winter camp locations and wells for 
relocated herder families that previously had established nomadic camps within 10 km of 
the Project site.
  Local population in the vicinity of project activities outside the MLA, including the
infrastructure corridor to the south, the airports, and the borefield and its associated 
infrastructure, although the borefield operation is not expected to be a significant source 
of noise.
Khanbogd, the nearest soum centre, is 35 km to the north-east of the MLA and is therefore 
not expected to be affected by noise during operations. Should this position change with, for 
example, future developments connected to the Project, all necessary studies and approvals 
will be undertaken in accordance with the Project Standards.
Through a review of the Project design basis, construction schedule, scoping and baseline 
assessment, the key noise and vibration issues considered to be associated with the Project 
include:
  Noise impacts on herders from the operation of the Oyu Tolgoi to Gashuun Sukhait road.
  Noise impacts on herders from the construction and use of the permanent airport.
  Noise impacts on workers within the MLA.
The screening assessments and acoustic modelling undertaken for the ESIA have 
demonstrated that, with appropriate mitigation, the noise and vibration impacts of the 
Project will be negligible.
Aircraft noise will be noticeable for several kilometres from the airport. Modelling and 
monitoring of noise at the airport have shown that these impacts are minor, of short duration, 
and limited to daytime when a flight is landing or taking off.
Actual and potential impacts on the topography, geology, and topsoil arising from the 
construction, operation, and closure of the Project are as follows:
  Construction of mine infrastructure, including the tailing storage facilities (TSF) and waste
rock dump (WRD) areas.

Impacts associated with the open pit.
  Block caving mining activities, resulting in a surface subsidence zone.
  Creation of structures such as the camps and shaft headframe.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 447 of 519
  Diversion of the Undai River and other ephemeral watercourses.
  Losses of topsoil from erosion by wind and water around earthworks, topsoil stockpiles,
and rehabilitated areas.
  Potential subsidence impacts of the area overlying the Gunii Hooloi aquifer.
Impacts during closure will relate to legacy issues associated with the open pit, block caving, 
TSF, WRD, and potential settlement associated with drawdown of the deep aquifer that will 
have been used to supply the Project’s operational water requirements. While the scope here 
discusses closure at the end of the Project, Oyu Tolgoi also considers the potential for early or 
forced closure every year. The Closure Plan, which was prepared based on the June 2012 
design status.
By means of careful design and planning processes, Oyu Tolgoi aims to prevent and mitigate, 
as far as practically possible, impacts on topography, landscape, geology, and topsoil. The 
key design measures taken to avoid impacts are listed below.
  As areas are decommissioned, e.g., the closure of the first cell of the TSF, progressive
rehabilitation and landscaping will be undertaken while under OT LLC control, allowing 
vegetation to become established without any impacts from grazing by herd animals, 
which will be kept out by the MLA fence.
  The WRD areas will be rehabilitated as soon as feasible. Stored topsoil will be used to
rehabilitate the lower slopes of the waste rock facilities where the risk of losing the topsoil 
through windblown erosion is limited. The WRD area will not be used by underground 
mining operations; at the end of the operational life of the open pit, the remaining active 
areas will be stabilised and rehabilitated. This rehabilitation will be carried out 
concurrently with the underground block caving, with the aim of having the WRD 
rehabilitation completed a significant time (decades) before the end of the mine life.
  Mitigation of the impacts on the topography and landscape will focus on the final design
of the WRD, preferably resulting in a similar profile to the Khanbogd Mountain or the 
steep-sided Javkhlant Mountain.
  Landscaping will be considered to lessen the visual impact of buildings. Per Oyu Tolgoi’s
obligation under the Land Law, this will include assigning over 10% of the built areas 
within the MLA as a green zone. Plants are currently being grown at a nursery in 
Khanbogd near a local well. These saplings will be transplanted to the MLA and watered 
until established.
Based on an appraisal of the baseline conditions and sensitivities discussed in Chapter B6: 
Water Resources of the ESIA, the following key issues were identified:
  The impact of the various elements of the project on surface water systems, including
ephemeral watercourses and ephemeral and permanent springs. These impacts could 
affect water quantity, quality, or the length of time an ephemeral watercourse sustains 
surface or groundwater flows over the course of a year.
  The impact of the Project’s water demand on the deep aquifer water resources of
Gunii Hooloi and its significance to the overall water resources of the region and impacts 
on potential future water use.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 448 of 519
  The impact of the project on shallow aquifer resources across the Project Area of
Influence.
These key aspects of surface water systems, deep groundwater resources, and shallow 
groundwater resources are influenced by a variety of interactive impacts, including:

Impacts on flora and fauna due to potential disruptions to ephemeral surface water and 
groundwater flows and springs, and access to these water sources by wildlife.
  The impact of the diversion of the Undai River on downstream springs and water users
and risks to the Undai diversion from the adjacent WRD and other infrastructure, including 
the quality of the water that drains from these features.
  The impact on surficial aquifers and local ephemeral watercourses of water abstraction
for construction water supply and of dewatering associated with excavation and 
operation of the open pit and underground workings.
  The impact of water abstraction for construction purposes from locations outside the
MLA.
  The impact of the abstraction of deep aquifer water resources, which are generally non-
potable, on shallower potable water aquifers, including the surficial aquifers along the 
ephemeral watercourses used by herders and wildlife.

Impacts on herder water supplies, particularly at their winter camps, which are critical for 
the maintenance of their livelihoods.
  The impact of the increased water demand due to the known and predicted future
increase in population of Khanbogd soum centre.
The impacts on the aquifers in the Gunii Hooloi basin are influenced by the Project water 
demand. Minimising water demand is a KPI that has been at the forefront of the design of the 
Project. OT LLC is engendering a culture of water conservation throughout the company, its 
employees, and contractors and has set targets for water conservation and recycling at all 
levels of the Project. Examples include choosing sanitary ware that reduces water 
consumption through to using treated and recycled wastewater in the concrete batch plant.
In 2011, OT LLC implemented a Regional Biodiversity Assessment (RBA) as part of the risk 
assessment process for impacts on various identified biodiversity features. The risks were 
categorised as critical, high, medium, and low, as discussed below. Proposed mitigation 
options for the potential impacts on specific biodiversity features are addressed in 
Chapter D6: Flora and Fauna Construction Management Plan of the Project ESIA.
The detailed hydrological and hydrogeological investigations undertaken to date have given 
OT LLC a good appreciation of where the most likely impacts on surface hydrology and 
surficial aquifers will occur and of how to develop mitigation measures to address them 
(Chapter C5: Water of the ESIA).
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 449 of 519
There are, however, a number of uncertainties relating to the likelihood and magnitude of 
project-induced impacts on biodiversity features. These uncertainties relate to the likelihood 
for impacts to shallow water systems and associated biodiversity features resulting from 
drawdown of the deeper regional aquifer and from mine dewatering. Although the RBA 
process categorised the likelihood of impacts as low, and thus a risk assessment of 
medium/low, the following hydrological items are still considered to retain some degree of 
inherent uncertainty in impact risk assessment:
  Effect of dewatering on the mine surface area.
  Maintaining surface water and groundwater flow in the Undai River.
  Connectivity between the deep Gunii Hooloi aquifer and overlying surficial and alluvial
aquifers and the deep Galbyn Gobi aquifers.
  Connectivity between the deep Durulj Mount Southern aquifer and overlying surficial
aquifers.
Ecosystem services is a concept that cuts across conventional approaches of looking at 
issues from a subject-specific basis and enables the interactions between the biophysical and 
human environments to be identified. Most, if not all, of these issues, impacts, and associated 
mitigation actions are addressed within either the Biodiversity Mitigations or other chapters of 
the ESIA.
Mitigation actions have been developed for all potential critical and high risk impacts to 
priority biodiversity features. In addition to these measures, OT LLC has more recently decided 
to provide wildlife underpasses for the Oyu Tolgoi to Gashuun Sukhait road owing to concerns 
about connectivity issues before the mitigation actions take effect, even though loss of 
connectivity was originally ranked as only a medium risk. OT LLC is currently in discussions with 
project financing lenders and biodiversity advisors to explore the best suite of mitigation 
actions and/or offsets to reduce the potential habitat fragmentation that may occur as a 
result of the construction of the Oyu Tolgoi to Gashuun Sukhait road.
Actions OT LLC will take to mitigate low and moderate risk impacts to priority biodiversity 
features, or impacts to lower priority biodiversity features, are described in Chapter D6: Flora 
and Fauna Construction Management Plan of the ESIA, and in various other management 
plans, including:
  Water Resources Management Plan.
  Atmospheric Emissions Management Plan.
  Land Use Management Plan and related Land Disturbance Procedures.
  Non-Mineral Waste Management Plan.
  Hazardous Materials Management Plan.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Oyu Tolgoi has committed to a goal of Net Positive Impact (NPI) on biodiversity. As such, 
residual impacts on priority biodiversity features will be offset to achieve this goal. The RBA 
programme implemented in 2011 included the preparation of a Biodiversity Offset Strategy 
for the Project that outlines what needs to be done to achieve an NPI on biodiversity. This 
strategy is based on wide technical consultation and aims to demonstrate the technical 
feasibility of achieving NPI.
Oyu Tolgoi will have unavoidable residual impacts on biodiversity. Residual impacts are 
predicted for 15 priority biodiversity features, two ecosystems, and three priority habitats 
known or likely to occur in the Project Area of Influence. Predicted residual impacts include 
direct habitat loss, indirect habitat loss, and increased mortality from increased hunting, 
increased collecting, collisions with vehicles and power lines, and increased numbers of 
natural predators. Conservation of the Asiatic wild ass is recognised as the highest priority for 
Oyu Tolgoi, given the international importance of the Southern Gobi region to this rapidly 
declining, globally endangered species and the residual impacts it is likely to be significant to 
the project.
Biodiversity offsets are recognised as fundamental to the Rio Tinto environmental tool kit and 
as such OT LLC has produced a draft Biodiversity Offset Guidance Note (Rio Tinto, 2010) to 
assist business units in developing technically, socially, and politically feasible and robust 
offset plans.
This guidance identifies four major sequential stages in the design of offsets:
1.  Offset Scoping – Identify goals and a long list of potential sites in the region or country
broadly considered as possibilities for offsets.
2.  Offset Screening – Screen the potential offset sites against biological, political, economic,
and social criteria. This involves brief consideration of possible types of conservation 
intervention and additional criteria: what actions could be undertaken, and would these 
make a real difference on the ground? Extensive stakeholder consultation, including 
Government, expert organisations, and local communities, is conducted.
3.  Net Positive Impact (NPI) Accounting – Estimate possible biodiversity gains using the
Rio Tinto NPI Accounting Tool. The accounting data are used to define an offset project 
or projects that are most likely to achieve NPI for the operation.
4.  Final Approval and Selection – Communicate the Biodiversity Offsets Strategy to the
regulator or group of key stakeholders for final consultation and approval. Following any 
adjustments post-approval, the final output of the design process is a Biodiversity Offsets 
Plan.
OT LLC’s Biodiversity Offset Strategy is described in detail in Chapter C6: Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services of the ESIA.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

Displacement impacts arising from the construction, operation, and closure phases of the 
Project are as follows:
  Total physical displacement of herder households from the Mine Licence Area (MLA) and
displacement of winter camps from a 10 km residential exclusion zone around the MLA.
  Economic displacement of herders affected by reduced access to and/or loss of
summer pastures due to land taken for the airport.
  Division of pastures caused by the construction of linear project components, including
the Oyu Tolgoi-to-Gashuun Sukhait Road and the water supply pipeline (construction 
corridor).
  Disruption to herding activities.
  Loss of wells and other impacts to water availability/quality, e.g., impeded access to
wells.
  Overall reduction of pastureland in Khanbogd soum, leading to increased competition
for grazing and over-use of remaining grazing land.
OT LLC will require approximately 10,500 hectares (ha) of land to construct and operate the 
mine and ancillary facilities. This includes land for the MLA that was granted in 2009; and 
additional land required for the TSF, concentrator, batch plant, airports, Gunii Hooloi borefield 
and water pipeline, and transport/infrastructure corridor between Oyu Tolgoi and 
Gashuun Sukhait.
Land will also be temporarily disturbed during the construction phase for activities such as the 
installation of worker construction camps, excavation of borrow pits, and soil stripping along 
the water pipeline and transmission line corridors.
Significant residual land use and displacement impacts after the implementation of 
mitigation measures by Oyu Tolgoi will include:
  Herder resettlement and associated changes to herding activities and livelihoods as a
result of physical and economic displacement.
  Reduction in the overall quantity of grazing land available for local pastoralists.
  Division of pastures for some herder families, affecting seasonal migration routes and
access to grazing land and other resources.


Increases in mining-related employment and new and diversified land- and non-land-
based income opportunities and associated increases in income and household wealth.
Improved pastureland management within the soum, including positive changes to 
livestock raising and production, and thus rural livelihoods.
The overall impact of physical and economic displacement of herders is significant and will
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 452 of 519
require resettlement with well-designed and -implemented livelihood restoration and 
pastureland management programmes.
The loss of pastures and other land use changes is likely to be adverse for local herders in the 
short term, but effective implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan is expected to 
potentially result in benefits for affected herders in the long term from increased income 
generation opportunities, education, training assistance, and other regional community 
development programmes being implemented by OT LLC.
From early in the EIA process for the various project elements, OT LLC has attempted to 
design out impacts to archaeological heritage. Wherever possible, changes have been 
made to the location of fixed project elements and the design of project linear features, such 
as the roads and the water pipeline, in consideration of archaeological findings.
Mitigation measures are summarised below.
  Realignment of the Oyu Tolgoi-to-Gashuun Sukhait Road – Archaeological investigations
for the original (2004) Oyu Tolgoi-to-Gashuun Sukhait transport corridor identified 
significant material archaeological findings, which was one of several factors leading to 
the realignment of the road. Further surveys were conducted for revised routing options 
in 2006 and again in 2010 and 2011.
The 2010 investigations discovered five burial sites that were subject to rescue excavations by 
MASIA in early 2011. No additional sites along the corridor were found to be at risk of road 
construction impacts during the most recent survey. As a result, potential impacts are 
considered to have been avoided (Chapter B12: Cultural Heritage of the ESIA).
  Alignment of the Gunii Hooloi Water Supply Pipeline – a number of possible grave sites
were identified close to the Gunii Hooloi borefield water-gathering pipelines and 
production boreholes (OT S-1, OT S-2, and OT S-3). As a result, the main pipeline 
alignment and connection network were designed to avoid damage to the graves 
(Chapter B12: Cultural Heritage of the ESIA).
No significant finds were encountered within the footprint of both the temporary or 
permanent airports, and therefore no design changes were made on the basis of 
archaeological significance.
Considering that the project is at an early stage of operation, many of the impacts on cultural 
heritage have already been realised in relation to land disturbance, topsoil stripping, and 
construction of new access roads and associated borrow pits. Existing and possible future 
impacts are listed below:
  Physical loss of tangible heritage (physical resources) from physical land disturbance
associated with the construction phase of the project.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 453 of 519

Indirect disturbance of tangible heritage through the operation of construction vehicles 
and machinery, operations vehicles, dust deposition, and vibration effects.
  Damage and/or deliberate disturbance of heritage by project workers and/or incomers
to the region.
  Loss of intangible heritage over time as the patterns of work, kinship, worship, and sources
of income change; this includes the loss of “traditional livelihoods” as herders transition 
from subsistence to waged-based employment.
During the operations phase, the potential for permanent physical disturbance of 
archaeological and paleontological sites is expected to be low, since the scale and intensity 
of additional earthworks and engineering activities will be limited in comparison to the 
construction phase. Similarly, further impacts during the decommissioning phase are 
expected to be limited because any further major ground disturbance is unlikely.
However, some levelling, landscaping, contouring, and other land-based activities do have 
the potential to result in further minor archaeological impacts. Should these activities remain 
within the existing disturbance footprint, no significant impacts are expected. Nevertheless, 
predicted changes to traditions and the traditional way of life are considered long-term 
effects.
The development of environmental and social management plans for the Project has been a 
two-stage process:
  Stage 1: Construction Phase Management Plans to control the health, safety,
environment, and social (HSES) management aspects of day-to-day construction 
activities, were initially developed based on the outcomes of the ESIA and were used as 
the basis of management during the Project construction phase, which ended in 
December 2012.
  Stage 2: Operations Phase Management Plans have been developed and implemented
that control the HSES management aspects of all project activities since the completion 
of construction in December 2012 and the commencement of mining operations.
The management plans address the management of health, safety, environment, and social 
aspects associated with the project. The scope of coverage for these plans is defined as 
follows:
  The physical and biological environment as may be affected by activities associated
with on-site and off-site project facilities, managed under the integrated Health, Safety, 
and Environment Management System (the 2012 Oyu Tolgoi HSE MS), including 
biodiversity, air quality, water resources, waste management, transportation, emergency 
response, mine closure and rehabilitation, and health and safety.
  Occupational health and safety (OHS) issues that are managed under the integrated
2012 Oyu Tolgoi HSE MS.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 454 of 519
  Social and community issues, which are managed under the Oyu Tolgoi Social
Management System (SMS) during the construction and operations phases. The SMS is 
aligned with the Rio Tinto Communities Standard, and some issues that involve both 
community issues and HSE issues are managed jointly under the integrated 2012 
Oyu Tolgoi HSE MS. Social issues addressed under the SMS include those related to 
community relations, consultation and stakeholder engagement, labour/worker 
management, community health and safety, influx management, resettlement, cultural 
heritage, regional development, and other potential socio-economic impacts of the 
Project on third parties.
Progressive rehabilitation and planning for closure is a critical and integral part of the business 
process and demonstrates a commitment to sustainable development. Progressive 
rehabilitation involves the continuous technical and biological rehabilitation of disturbed 
areas following completion of works activities. Closure planning involves the development of 
strategies to avoid or mitigate potential environmental and social impacts associated with 
closure to the extent that is financially appropriate.
The progressive rehabilitation planning that forms part of the Oyu Tolgoi Closure Plan adheres 
to all regulatory requirements of the GOM and industry best practices as stated in IFC and 
EBRD performance standards and the Rio Tinto Closure Standard (Rio Tinto, 2009).
Progressive reclamation will be performed on any areas of the mine site where it is deemed 
practical to do so and with consideration of the need to preserve future mine expansion 
options. Disturbed areas that are no longer used in the active operation will be technically 
and biologically rehabilitated concurrently with ongoing mining operations, as practicable.
Significant progressive rehabilitation opportunities exist for the technical and biological 
rehabilitation of disturbed land following completion of construction. Examples include:
  Historically used temporary airport.
  Historically used borrow pits and quarries used to support construction activities (e.g., of
airport, Oyu Tolgoi to Gashuun Sukhait road).
  Land disturbed areas following completion of installation of underground pipelines (e.g.,
for the Gunii Hooloi raw water supply pipeline).
  Land disturbed areas following completion of drilling activities (e.g., from exploration).
  Historically used tracks and access roads (e.g., the diversion road used during
construction of the Oyu Tolgoi to Gashuun Sukhait road).
  Any other areas that have been subject to land disturbance during construction, but
which are no longer used.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 455 of 519
Opportunities for further progressive reclamation related to the underground and open pit 
mines or surface facilities and infrastructure are more limited. The main ones presented in the 
Closure Plan relate to the following:
  Any facility that is either redundant or no longer in use will be decommissioned and
closed.
  Landfill cells and lagoons at the waste management centre will be progressively
maintained during operations by placing a rock cover over the waste every day. The 
waste disposal grounds have a life of up to 30 years, after which the cell will be closed 
and a second phase initiated if necessary.
  The waste rock dumps are currently planned to be progressively reclaimed, as
practicable, over the mine operating life. The dumps will be constructed with set-back 
berms so that the slopes can adhere to the final stable configurations during operations. 
Completed parts of the dump will be covered with a suitable thickness of NAF material 
during operations, followed by progressive placement of topsoil/growth media and 
revegetation, where possible.
  Cells 1 and 2 of the TSF will be the first to be completed and will be allowed to desiccate 
over time. Alternatively, a NAF cover may be constructed progressively over PAF tailings 
surfaces, taking into account the potential to re-use those cells for tailings deposition in 
the future. In the meantime, to mitigate environmental impacts due to inactive and dry 
tailings surfaces, interim reclamation measures may include the placement of a thin layer 
of NAF cover to protect against wind erosion and maintain surface water run-off quality.
There are potential opportunities for local communities and herder groups to participate in 
the implementation of several progressive rehabilitation measures that could result in 
economic benefits and capacity development for those involved. The Closure Plan outlines 
some of these opportunities.
The Oyu Tolgoi Mine Closure Plan for OT LLC, (June 2012) is based on the design status at that 
time. The Closure Plan documents the outcomes of an order-of-magnitude closure study 
conducted with the following objectives:
  Compliance with the Rio Tinto corporate Closure Standard.
  Compliance with relevant international guidelines and directives.
  Documentation of closure vision, objectives, and targets.
  Early development of strategies to meet closure objectives and targets.
  Early identification of likely site-specific closure issues and assessment of risks.

Identification of action items that should be conducted to manage and mitigate risks 
and enable efficient and effective closure methods and technologies in the future.
  Preparation of a preliminary closure schedule based on current information.
  Estimation of costs associated with the closure, developed to an intended accuracy of
an order-of-magnitude study.
  Development of a multi-disciplinary information resource.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

A large number of parameters will be monitored during the closure and post-closure phases 
of the mine, to characterise both physical and chemical stability of the project area and the 
environmental impact of the Project.
Physical stability monitoring at the site will cover the following facilities, structures, and 
features:
  The open pit and future subsidence area.
  Mine site and disturbed areas.
  Waste rock dumps and TSF.
  Undai River diversion.
  Site security features.
The Closure Plan describes the post-closure chemical stability monitoring at specific facilities, 
such as the following, in more detail:
  Open pit and subsidence area.
  Mine site and disturbed areas.
  Waste rock dumps.
  Tailings storage facility.
  Undai River diversion.
  Gunii Hooloi borefield (water levels).
Minimising water use throughout all the operational aspects has been a key focus of 
attention during mine planning and design. As examples of water conservation planning, the 
following initiatives have been implemented:
  Reuse of cooling water – The process plant is the largest consumer of water. Within the 
plant, all water discharged from the cooling systems, still categorised as clean water, is 
sent to the process water pond for reuse in the concentrator.
  High-efficiency tailings thickeners – The tailings thickener at Oyu Tolgoi uses advanced
techniques and is able to achieve a tailings solids content of 60%–64%, which significantly 
reduces the amount of water sent to the TSF. These design modifications help to greatly 
reduce the amount of reclaim water released and evaporative losses from the TSF.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 457 of 519
  High-efficiency TSF reclaim – The TSF has been designed so that tailings are deposited in
discreet cells, rather than broadly across the facility, to reduce evaporative losses. The 
entire base of the TSF rests on natural or installed clay and includes a comprehensive 
seepage collection system to minimise seepage losses. The TSF reclaim system has been 
designed to ensure that all supernatant water and collected seepage is returned to the 
process plant for reuse.
  100% mine water recovery – All water encountered in the underground and open pit 
mines is recovered for use as process water or for dust suppression. Recovery of mine 
water helps to reduce site demand for raw water from the Gunii Hooloi aquifer. From a 
water balance perspective, this mine recovery water has conservatively not been 
included as inflow.
  100% treated wastewater reuse – All treated wastewater produced in the site
wastewater treatment plant will be reused in the process plant or for dust suppression.
  100% truck wash water reuse – A comprehensive water treatment system has been
installed at the project mine truck washing facility to allow all truck wash water to be 
continuously recycled and reused.
  Lagoon floating cover – A floating cover is placed over the entire raw water storage
lagoon to eliminate evaporative water losses and to limit the accumulation of dust within 
the lagoon.
  Selection of low or zero water use equipment – Examples of this include the selection of
air cooling systems at the hazardous waste incinerator and central heating plant.
Ongoing attention to water conservation will be maintained during operation through the 
continuous review of key performance indicators for water use and implementation of 
additional water conservation measures.
As of March 2014, ongoing work programmes for developing water resources include:
  Gunii Hooloi Resource – Completion of updated modelling and analytical calculation of 
water resource based on data from final bore drilling installation, supplementary drilling, 
and testing programme and initial operational data.
  Oyu Tolgoi Regional Model – Updating the hydrogeological model for the Oyu Tolgoi
region based on supplementary drilling and testing programme and updated 
monitoring, including monitoring response from open pit development to further define 
and understand the regional influence of the mine operations.
  Khanbogd Resource – Completion of hydrogeological model and analytical calculation
of water resource based on supplementary Khanbogd drilling and testing programme.
  Undai River Assessment – Review of monitoring of the Undai River diversion, including
hydrogeological and ecological assessment of the performance of the established 
spring and the influence on downstream shallow water conditions.

The capital costs cover the entire scope of the OTFS14. The capital cost estimate represents 
the overall development and includes the Hugo North underground mine, supporting shafts, 
the concentrator conversion project, and the infrastructure expansion project. The capital 
estimate also includes the costs associated with the EPCM and Owner’s project execution 
teams.
The total estimated cost to design, procure, construct, and commission the complete 
expansion capital costs, inclusive of an underground block cave mine, supporting shafts, 
concentrator conversion, and supporting infrastructure expansion, is $4,864 million. The 
expansion and sustaining capital costs are summarised in Table 21.1.
All capital costs are expressed in Q1’14 U.S. dollars. No allowances are made for currency 
fluctuations or interest during construction.
The estimates for each major component cover:
  The direct field cost of executing the project.

Indirect cost associated with the design, construction, and commissioning of the new 
facilities.
  Mongolian customs duties, Mongolian VAT.
  Some allowances for contingency.

The following estimate assumptions are excluded from schedule contingency analysis, and if 
they cannot be achieved, the project schedule may be delayed and / or execution duration 
extended. On a project of this magnitude, time-dependent costs, e.g., overheads, 
equipment rental etc., may be considerable:
  All permissions required to initiate the Project on time will be received without incurring
additional cost or affecting the schedules.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 463 of 519
  Transportation access from point of manufacture to the Project site, including the border
crossing, will be unrestricted.
For consistency of estimating and conversion of native currency costs to the US dollar 
reporting currency, fixed rates of currency exchange and key project commodities were 
established and applied across all source estimates. Major currency exchange rates and 
commodity rates are shown in Table 21.2 and Table 21.3. The estimate does not provide for 
variation of exchange rate, and any significant changes should be regarded as requiring 
changes to approved funding (up or down.)

Specific commodity pricing assumptions include the following:
  Currency exchange rates were prepared by OT LLC Finance and represent the average
interbank buy/sell rates over Q4’13.
  Diesel fuel is an average rate based on five months of summer fuel and seven months of
winter fuel. Rates were provided by OT LLC Operations based on actual Q4’13 costs.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 464 of 519
  The rate for power has been based on the existing Chinese IMPC PPA agreement. (Note
that this PPA expires in 2017, and the extension of the arrangements or the use of 
domestic power may cause power costs to increase.)
  Concrete and shotcrete rates have been derived from first principles and checked
against past project experience. Rates are based on the engineered mix designs, batch 
plant operation, OT LLC quarry operation, and use of imported bulk cement.
  Backfill rate is based on average costs experienced for Phase 1 construction.
  Surface rock handling rates were derived from first principles assuming use of the OT LLC
open pit fleet equipment and of local decline and shaft waste stockpiles.
  Charter flight costs were provided by OT LLC Operations based on actual Q4’13 costs.
  Site support costs allow for a combination of services to be provided by the OT LLC
Operations group in support of the Phase 2 capital works construction, including airport 
facilities, site busing, site inductions, basic PPE, site medical, bottled drinking water, and 
camp and messing services. Rates were provided by OT LLC Operations based on actual 
Q4’13 costs.
Potentially acid forming (PAF) mine waste is used for construction of the major tailings 
embankment structure, the downstream shell. Of the total amount of embankment material, 
70%–80% is composed of mine waste that will be placed by the mine fleet, and so is included 
in the open pit haulage estimate. Allowance is made for dozing mine dumped material to 
achieve the final contour. Other mine waste requiring controlled placement will be delivered 
to a stockpile located between the pit and Cell 1 and will then be reloaded and hauled to 
the tailings storage facility (TSF) by a fleet of 60 tonne trucks.
KCBL provided the designs and the MTOs for the civil works of Cells 1 and 2. Rio Tinto 
Technology and Innovation (T&I) developed conceptual designs for Cells 3, 4, and 5 based 
on the KCBL work for Cells 1 and 2. The quantities in cubic metres were classified into various 
placement zones. The material handling costs for the embankment materials vary with haul 
distance, hence with the cell being constructed or raised.
TSF construction costs average $35 million per year over the life-of-mine.
A cost of $18 million is included for replacement of the concentrator support mobile 
equipment, and $76 million is allowed for replacement of the mobile equipment supporting 
the construction of the tailings dam. Replacement is based on the operating life of each 
piece of equipment, which varies from 10–15 years.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 465 of 519
A total of $150 million is included to replace the fixed processing plant equipment after it is no 
longer feasible to maintain its designed function. Replacement costs are based on 0.5% per 
annum of the initial capital value.
An allowance of $4 million is included to modify the expanded process streams after 
commencement of their operation. Most process plants typically require some minor 
changes to the initial design to attain design or optimum capacity.
Sustaining capital is capital costs incurred after the Project has commenced operations. The 
items in this category are required to either replace worn-out or exhausted assets or to 
support planned growth of the mine that does not increase production capacity. Projects 
that improve operational efficiency, safety, or costs are usually considered sustaining capital. 
For Hugo North, sustaining capital costs fall under four main categories:
  Ongoing Development: All mine development, lateral or vertical, is capitalised until after
first ore (May 2019). All development not directly associated with the final material 
handling system, off-footprint ventilation infrastructure, permanent shafts, and main shops 
will be considered sustaining capital after that time.
  Undercutting and Caving: All undercut drill and blast, associated swell mucking, and
drawbell drill and blast are considered sustaining capital. The only exception is the 
portion of this work done prior to first ore.
  Ongoing Construction: Construction activities included under the category of sustaining
capital are projects that are considered routine and are an integral part of the mine 
operations. The mine schedule provides the information required to determine how many 
of each type of installation was required during each schedule period. The following 
work is included in this category:
-  Drawpoint lintels
-  Grizzlies
-  Truck-loading chutes
-  Ventilation control doors
-  Gathering sumps
-  Power stations (for portable substations)
-  Stations for portable refuge stations
-  Concrete road construction
-  Ventilation controls and bulkheads
-  Service doors.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 466 of 519
  Mobile Equipment Rebuild and Replacement: The annual cost of mobile equipment 
replacement is based on estimated operating hours. Mobile equipment rebuild and 
replacement schedules are a product of the mining schedule. The following 
methodology was used to determine the annual cost of mobile equipment rebuild and 
replacement:
-  Rebuild life is estimated as 60% of the initial life of the equipment.
-  Rebuild cost is assessed at 40% of the base unit cost.
-  Replacement cost is assessed at 100% of the base unit cost plus development
allowance and freight.
-  No replacement costs are provided for any of the mobile equipment during the final
four years of mine operations, and no rebuild costs are provided for any of the mobile 
equipment during the final two.
Sustaining capital includes the following:
  Replacement of communication and information technology (ICT) equipment at a rate
of 10% per annum of initial capital value.
  Refurbishment/replacement of the central heating plant boiler every 10 years.
  Refurbishment of process and non-process buildings approximately every 10 years.
  Expansion of the waste management centre in 2015 to provide additional capacity to
meet life-of-mine requirements.
The cost estimate is based on the remediation activities described in the Closure Plan. A 
25% contingency is included.
Contingency has been applied to the sustaining capital portion of each area of Operating 
Costs.
A contingency of 4.6% on sustaining capital costs is included.
A contingency of 7.2% on sustaining capital costs is included.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

A contingency of 0.5% on sustaining capital costs is included.
A 2.0% contingency on operating costs is included.
A contingency of 5.0% on sustaining capital costs is included.
A contingency of 4.2% on sustaining capital costs is included.
Mine operations at Oyu Tolgoi commenced in July 2011 with the start-up of the open pit 
mine. First mill feed to the concentrator was in August 2012, and the first concentrate was 
produced in 2013. Feed from the underground mine is planned to commence Q2’19 and to 
ramp-up to the full underground design tonnage of 95 ktpd. The mill operating rate at that 
time will be a nominal 110 ktpd, with supplementary ore feed provided from the open pit 
mine. Once the Hugo North Lift 1 underground mine resource is mined out in 2038, the 
operation will revert back to a nominal 100 ktpd feed from open pit mining until 2050. The mill 
will continue to operate on open pit feed from the low- and medium-grade stockpile until 
closure, scheduled for 2055.
The life-of-mine operating cost estimates begin 1 January 2014. The estimate includes all 
expenses to operate and maintain the Oyu Tolgoi plant. The following battery limits are 
noted:
  All costs are in Q1’14 U.S. dollars, based on fixed exchange rates.
  Costs pre-31 December 2013 are excluded.
  Escalation is excluded from the operating costs.
  No cost of financing is included.
  Royalties and joint venture fees are included.
  The operating costs for 2014 and 2015 were adjusted to match the Q3’13 approved
operating plan and the Q1’14 business forecast update.
  Power has been treated as a purchased utility from a third-party provider.
The estimates were built up on the fundamental principle of centrality, giving them an equal 
probability of upside and downside. Life-of-mine total costs are shown in Table 21.4.

Turquoise Hill 2.0% NSR Payment is modelled to be non-tax deductible.
2.  Other operating costs include payments estimated to be made to the EJV as calculated in the Financial
Model.
All operating cost estimates were prepared on a first principles basis wherein all expenses 
have been quantified as much as possible and unit cost rates applied. Estimates were 
prepared by major operating cost function, as follows:
  Open pit mine.
  Underground mine.
  Process plant – inclusive of concentrator and bagging plant.
  Tailings – inclusive of tailings pumping, tailings dewatering, and tailings storage facility.

Infrastructure.
  General and Administrative (G&A) – inclusive of operations support.
  Geosciences.
Operating cost estimates were also developed by expense type classified into the following 
categories:
  Labour – cost to employ all direct OT LLC staff.
  Fixed overheads – accommodation and meals, travel, business overheads, insurances,
and general expenses.
  Utilities – power and water charges.
  External services – third-party contracted services.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 469 of 519
  Materials and supplies – fuels, equipment spares and parts, process consumables and
reagents, other maintenance materials.
Pricing is predominantly based on operating experience and market conditions as at Q4’13. 
Escalation is excluded from all operating cost estimates. Contingency for operating costs has 
been calculated based on similar principles as those used for the initial capital costs.
The open pit operating costs were developed by the OT LLC open pit Technical Services 
team based on the OTFS14 mine plan. The operating costs are driven mainly by the hauling 
unit requirement, which will increase as the pit deepens and hauling distances increase.
The following boundaries are noted for the scope of the open pit operating cost estimate:
  The operating cost for any ore rehandle at the concentrator stockpile (coarse ore) is
carried by the concentrator.
  The primary crusher and conveyors designed to size and transfer open pit ore from the
truck dump to the coarse ore stockpile are within the scope of the concentrator for both 
capital and operating cost estimates.
  The open pit provides material for construction of the tailings dam, either at a dump or
directly to the dam wall. Costs for rehandle and any placement costs beyond dumping 
are carried in the tailings sustaining cost estimate.
Mine Underground operating costs are the costs of operating the underground mine, 
including all indirect costs. The costing for operations is based on the following assumptions:
  Labour is either a fixed value (i.e. one hoist man on duty, two electricians on duty, etc.)
or on equipment productivity (one driver per truck).
  Labour rates are standard rates provided by Oyu Tolgoi.
  Material costs are the same as used in the capital estimate. For specific replacement
costs, such as skips, the costs used in the initial purchase costs are considered to be valid 
for the life of the mine.

Indirect costs are similar to those for the capital phase of the Project.
The estimate is derived on the following key headings:
  Mine Management: This includes the mine management and technical services groups,
administration, safety, and training activities.
  Mine Production: This includes all direct costs associated with moving production ore
from the drawpoints to the primary crushers. This includes mucking, secondary blasting, 
grizzly/raise/chute operations, truck haulage, and ground repair.
Costs are developed in the XERAS model from time-phased equipment performance 
data from the production simulation, as well as predictions of oversize material projected 
in the geotechnical models, both provided by OT LLC.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 470 of 519
  Rock Handling: This includes all crushing and conveying of rock from the truck dump at
the crusher to the coarse ore stockpile at the concentrator. It does not include power 
costs or shaft-hoisting operations.
Costs are based on ore throughput rates from the mine plan and estimated equipment 
maintenance costs on a per tonne basis. Labour costs are based on fixed crew sizes 
developed from the equipment in service during a given period.
  Shaft and Logistics Operations: This includes the operating costs of all shafts for service 
and rock hoisting and the operation of the logistics system to deliver supplies from the 
surface to designated delivery points underground. This specifically includes logistics 
support for all initial construction activities prior to first ore.
  Maintenance Overhead: This includes all maintenance overhead for the life of the mine:
maintenance management, planning, indirect labour support, vendor reps, and other 
similar support functions. This covers both OT LLC and mine contractor functions. 
Maintenance labour costs for fixed plant are included here for estimating purposes.
  Electrical & Instrumentation: This includes costs for electrical and instrumentation and
communication maintenance labour.
  Mine Services: This includes labour and equipment costs to perform routine mine-wide
services such as road maintenance, drainage and pumping, and maintenance of utility 
piping.
  Utility Back-Charges: This carries all charges for utilities, the largest being electrical power.
The concentrator operating costs were developed by the OT LLC based on OT LLC Phase 1 
operating cost data derived from the Q3’13 financial plan. The following battery limit 
clarifications are noted:
  Operating costs for any ore rehandle before gyratory crushing are carried by the open
pit.
  The conveyors used to transfer underground ore from the shafts to the coarse ore
stockpile are within the underground mine capital cost scope but within the 
concentrator operating cost scope.
  Tailings operating labour costs are included in the concentrator area, with OT LLC
operating and construction equipment labour integrated with the overall concentrator 
labour plan. Incremental costs to move benign waste from the open pit to the local 
stockpile at the TSF are included in the open pit mine estimate.
  Tailings operating costs for fuel and other non-labour construction equipment costs are
presented separately in Section 21.1.5.
The OT LLC Q3’13 plan costs for 2014 and 2015 were used as the basis for the life-of-mine plan; 
warehouse unit costs were used for most consumables. OT LLC labour rates and staffing were 
based upon the OT LLC 2014–2018 five-year plan with later staffing flexed for changes in 
national productivity, expatriate ratios, Phase 2 capital scope additions, and economies 
during the mature operational phase after underground mining of Lift 1 is completed.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 471 of 519
VAT and duties were applied on a weighted average basis, and no contingency was 
applied.
Annual operating costs are projected to vary primarily as a function of unit power cost and 
percentage of expatriate personnel. Unit costs vary primarily as a function of capacity and 
thus average ore hardness. Phase 2 tonnage is expected to vary around a nominal 96 ktpd, 
ranging from 85 ktpd with the hardest ore to a hydraulic limit of 121 ktpd on the softest ore. 
The life-of-mine average throughput is projected at 103 ktpd. Phase 2 annual costs are not 
significantly changed from Phase 1 costs.
The infrastructure operating cost estimate covers the costs directly attributable to operational 
activities of the infrastructure department. The main responsibilities of this department are to 
operate and maintain all Phase 1 and Phase 2 site infrastructure, including:
  Central heating plant (CHP).
  Raw water supply from the borefields north of the site.
  Heavy mine equipment (HME) facility.
  Warehouse (buildings only).
  Water bottling plant.
  Electrical utilities other than the power plant and 220 kV distribution.
  Camp facility (buildings only).
  Airport.
  Light vehicle facility.
  Other building maintenance, including the waste management centre.
The basis of the cost estimate is the Q1’14 plan, followed by a detailed estimate from 2015–
2038, and an estimate for long-term costs from 2038–2055.
The cost of maintaining a department to manage this work and to update the resource 
geology has also been included and estimated based on expected activity relative to the 
2014 reference year.
Direct drilling expenses from surface and underground are included under Sustaining Capital 
and only to the extent of 4,000–5,000 metres of drilling per year to prove up additional 
prospects to an order-of-maintenance level, or resources to a higher level, to allow for 
strategic production planning updates.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 472 of 519
The General and Administrative (G&A) costs encompass costs not directly attributable to 
operational output such as the mining and processing operations. G&A costs are divided into 
two main areas: Operations Support, comprising departments based at Oyu Tolgoi, and 
General and Administrative, covering those departments principally operating from OT LLC’S 
Ulaanbaatar offices.

The 2014 OTTR is an update of the Reserve Case previously presented in 2013 OTTR. The results 
of the 2014 Reserve Case show an after tax NPV8% of US$7.4 B. The case exhibits an after tax 
IRR of around 29% and a payback period of around nine years. The estimates of cash flows 
have been prepared on a real basis as at 1 January 2015 and discounted to a Net Present 
Value (NPV) at a rate of 8.0% (NPV8%). The NPV results have been calculated starting from 
January 2015 as this matches the assumptions for the recommencement of the ramp-up of 
activity on Hugo North Lift 1.
The key economic assumptions for the analyses are shown in Table 22.1.

Both the process of negotiation and the final agreement of the IA presented an opportunity 
to confirm how the Laws of Mongolia should be interpreted in their application to the Project 
and provided for some specific terms to apply to Oyu Tolgoi. For OT LLC, the agreement has 
provided the confidence in the stability of the terms the Project will operate under and 
reliably assess its intended investment in the Project. The agreement itself is effective for an 
initial term of 30 years with an available extension of a further 20 years.
In accordance with the requirements outlined in the 2006 Minerals Law of Mongolia, upon 
execution of the IA and the fulfilment of all conditions precedent, the GOM has become a 
34% shareholder in OT LLC through the immediate issue of OT LLC’s common shares to a 
shareholding company owned by the GOM. Upon a successful renewal of the IA after the 
initial 30-year term, the GOM also has the option to increase its shareholding to 50%, under 
terms to be agreed with TRQ at the time.
A number of conditions precedent were set down in October 2009 and were required to be 
met before the IA terms came into effect. These were met and confirmed by the GOM in 
March 2010, triggering the issue of the GOM’s equity share in the Project and bringing the IA 
into full effect.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 474 of 519
Despite its role as an equity owner, the GOM will not be required to contribute to the initial 
capital cost of the Project. TRQ, as the parent company, retains the right to fund the Project 
by way of a combination of debt, redeemable preference shares and common shares 
provided the debt to equity ratios fall within the 3:1 ratio required by Mongolian Law.
In the case of shareholder debt, loans (including existing shareholder loans at the time of the 
agreement) initially attracted an interest rate of 9.9% (real) per annum with corresponding 
adjustments to be made to the outstanding balance to reflect increases in US CPI during 
each period. The coupon rate applicable to redeemable preference shares was to be 9.9% 
(real) and carry the same escalation terms. All principal and interest outstanding on 
shareholder debt, outstanding coupon payments on redeemable preference shares and the 
face value of those redeemable preference shares must be paid in full prior to any dividends 
on common shares being paid.
In 2011, an Amended Shareholders Agreement was concluded, which reduced the 
applicable rate from 9.9% to LIBOR plus 6.5%. In addition, an in principle agreement was 
reached to convert the balance of preference shares into ordinary shares. Both adjustments 
were to take place based on the 31 January 2011 balances, although the preference share 
conversion had not occurred by 31 December 2011.
Under the authority of the Shareholders Agreement, TRQ has the right to act as or appoint a 
Management Team to oversee the construction and operation of Oyu Tolgoi. The 
management team is compensated with a Management Services Payment equal to 3.0% of 
total operating and capital costs prior to commencement of operations and 6% of operating 
and capital costs during operations. This payment is included in the economic analysis as a 
project expense and is confirmed as tax deductible in the IA.
OT LLC is required to achieve commencement of production within seven years of the 
effective date of the IA.
Under the terms of the IA, a range of key taxes has been identified as stabilised for the term of 
the agreement at the rates and base currently applied. The following taxes comprise the 
majority of taxes and fees payable to the GOM under Mongolian Law and are shown with 
their stabilised rates:
  Corporate income tax
  Royalties
  Value added tax
  Customs duties
25%
5.0% (gross sales value)
10%
5.0%
In accordance with the Excess Profits Tax invalidating Law, as from 1 January 2011, the 
taxpayer will not be subject to the excess profits tax or any similar windfall tax.
OT LLC is also only subject to those taxes currently listed in the General Taxation Law and not 
taxes introduced at any future date. These taxes are collectively noted as non-discriminatory 
taxes and as such cannot be imposed on OT LLC in any manner other than that applied to all 
taxpayers.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 475 of 519
OT LLC may also apply to take advantage of any future law or treaty that comes into force 
and which would apply any rates lower than those specified in the IA.
In 2009, the GOM enacted amendments to the legislation governing the carry forward of 
income tax losses. The loss carry forward period has been extended to eight years and if 
sufficient, can be applied to offset 100% of taxable income. This contrasts with the previous 
law in which losses carried forward for two years and were subject to a 50% limit.
The agreement also provides OT LLC with the benefit of a 10% tax credit for all capital 
investment made during the construction period. The amount of this credit can be carried 
forward and credited in the three subsequent profitable tax years. It is noted in the 
agreement that if VAT payments, which are currently non-refundable, become refundable in 
the future, the availability of the investment tax credit will cease from that point. In that event, 
past earned investment tax credits will still be applied.
Although it has a requirement to make its self-discovered water resources available to be 
used for household purposes, it is confirmed in the agreement that OT LLC holds the sole rights 
to use these water resources for the Project. The contract for the utilisation of water with the 
GOM water authority is in effect for 30 years with subsequent 20-year periods of renewal.
The supply of power has been recognised as being critical to the execution of Oyu Tolgoi in 
the IA. OT LLC has been given the right to import power initially but must secure power from 
sources within Mongolia from the fourth year of operation.
OT LLC also has the right to construct roads for the transport of its product and airport facilities 
to suit the Project’s needs. The GOM has committed to providing OT LLC with non-
discriminatory access to any railway constructed between Mongolia and China if such a 
railway is constructed.
A summary of the 2014 Reserve Case project financial results is shown in Table 22.2 and the 
mining production statistics are shown in Table 22.3.
The estimates of cash flows of the Project have been prepared on a real basis based at 
1 January 2014 and discounted to an NPV at a rate of 8.0% (NVP8%). Long-term metal prices 
used for the analysis are copper $3.08/lb, gold $1,304/oz, and silver $21.46/oz.

Notes: Payments made directly to TRQ from the Project, principally 50% of the management payment as specified in 
the terms of the IA and a 2.0%NSR based payment (2.0% Ex-BHP Payment)are not included in the Mine Site Cash Cost 
per pound of payable copper. These payments due to TRQ add to around 0.12 $/lb over the 2014 Reserve Case.
The revenues and operating costs have been presented in Table 22.5, along with the net

An analysis comparing the 2013 OTTR and 2014 OTTR financial models was carried out. The 
analysis considered the impact of a one year delay, the delay from slower ramp-up, the 
draw point losses and dilution impact on grade and the changes in prices and costs from 
2013 to 2014.
The one year delay was modelled by applying an extra year of discounting to the 2013 OTTR 
financial model. The slower ramp-up was modelled by a further six months of discounting 
discounting using the 2013 OTTR financial model.
Using the 2014 OTTR, the drawpoint losses and dilution were modelled by applying the 
following factors to increase the Hugo North Lift 1 grades: 8% to the copper grade, 8.5% to 
the gold grade and 9.7% to the silver grade. Further analysis compared the combined 
differences of and the changes in metal prices and costs from 2013 to 2014. It should be 
noted that the results of the analysis are only indicative and have used broad assumptions to 
model the differences between the scenarios. A waterfall chart of the analysis is shown in 
Figure 22.4. The chart shows that the one year delay reduces the After Tax NPV8% by 
approximately $760 M, the further six months delay is another $360 M, the impact of 
drawpoint losses and dilution is $1,105 M and the remaining differences for metal prices and 
costs are $225 M.

To analyse the impact of productivity improvements in the plant throughput, a revision to the 
2014 Reserve Case production schedule has been prepared and costed. The analysis 
assumes that there is a 5% increase in plant throughput for five years. This case has been 
called the 2014 Reserve 140 Case; only Mineral Reserves are used for the economic analysis.
The analysis of the 2014 Reserve 140 Case was prepared by OreWin, OT LLC, and TRQ using 
the costs and assumptions from the 2014 Reserve Case. A summary of the production is 
shown in Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.6. The underground production from Hugo North Lift 1 
remains the same as in the 2014 Reserve Case. The additional plant capacity is consumed by 
bringing forward open pit ore from the SOT Open Pits.
A summary of the 2014 Reserve 140 Case cash flow analysis is shown in Table 22.10. 
Cumulative cash flow for the 2014 Reserve 140 Case is depicted in Figure 22.7. Mine site cash 
costs, revenues, operating costs, and capital costs are shown in Table 22.11 and Table 22.12.

Oyu Tolgoi is a very large project that includes four separate deposits. The long-term 
development of Oyu Tolgoi would involve the development of the resources on all deposits. 
Alternative production cases have been developed to provide early stage analysis of the 
development flexibility that exists with respect to later phases of the Oyu Tolgoi deposits 
(Heruga, Hugo South, and the second Lift of Hugo North).
Development of these deposits will require separate development decisions in the future 
based on then prevailing conditions and the development experience obtained from 
developing and operating the initial phases of Oyu Tolgoi.
Oyu Tolgoi’s large resource base represents outstanding opportunities for production 
expansion. Figure 24.1 shows an example of the decision tree for the possible development 
options at Oyu Tolgoi. This has been updated to include options that take advantage of 
productivity improvements in plant throughput that have begun to be recognised in the 
process plant. The decision tree shows options assuming that continuous improvements in 
plant productivity are achieved over the next five years. Then there would be key decision 
points for plant expansion and the development of new mines at Hugo North Lift 2, Hugo 
South and eventually Heruga. This provides an opportunity as OT LLC will have the benefit of 
incorporating actual performance of the operating mine into the study before the next 
investment decisions are required. OT LLC plans to continue to evaluate alternative 
production cases in order to define the relative ranking and timing requirements for overall 
development options.

As part of the long-term development strategy, although outside of the scope of reserve 
reporting, OT LLC continues to examine alternative production cases to better define future 
work plans and prepare for investment decision points. The mine designs developed by OT 
LLC are shown schematically in Figure 24.2 and listed below:
  SOT Open Pits

Under the NI 43-101 guidelines, Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative 
geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would allow them to 
be categorised as Mineral Reserves. There is no certainty that the Alternative Production 
Cases will be realised.
These cases will be part of the strategic planning that is being undertaken by OT LLC. There 
are three production expansion cases described by the decision tree shown in Figure 24.1. 
The expansions shown are:
  Case A - Continuous improvement of plant throughput of 5.0% per year for five years
  Case B - Case A plus a 100% plant expansion after approximately 20 years
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 494 of 519
  Case C - Progressive expansion of the plant to 350 ktpd
Case A assumes that there is an increased in plant throughput productivity of 5.0% per year 
for five years as described in the 2014 Reserve 140 Case and that the additional mines are 
developed. The average throughput rate is approximately 140 ktpd or 51 Mtpa and potential 
processing schedule for Case A is shown in Figure 24.3.
Case B is an extension of Case A and assumes that the plant capacity is doubled after 
approximately 20 years to an average throughput rate of 260 ktpd or 95 Mtpa. Case C 
assumes that there are progressive plant expansion to a rate of 350 ktpd or 128 Mtpa. With 
each successive expansion case there is a reduction of the mine life that would necessitate 
the success of further exploration to continue production. In Case C this would be required to 
bring the exploration potential to production in approximately 30 years.
The work on the alternative production cases is not yet at feasibility study stage, in particular 
the definition of the expansion sizes and costing of the cases. It is recommended that the 
options be studied further and that the timing of the new mines be defined in more detail.
Under the NI 43-101 guidelines, Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative

As part of regular risk assessment and management for Oyu Tolgoi, OT LLC undertakes risk 
assessments. The risk assessments are subjected to evaluations and the preparation of risk 
management approaches. Each of the risks is assigned a Risk Owner to monitor and manage 
the risk. OT LLC undertakes last major assessment workshops involving personnel from across 
Oyu Tolgoi. The last workshop was in November 2013. All risks identified were combined into 
the project risk register, and records the controls that have been implemented throughout 
the process to date, or that are firmly incorporated within the project scope/design.
The primary risk breakdown structure for the risk analysis are as follows:
  Approvals
  Resources
  Marketing
  Development Schedule
  Commercial / Project Management
  Engineering / Design


In addition to the operational and project risks that are assessed by OT LLC, TRQ has identified 
events or circumstances could cause TRQ’s actual results to differ materially from those in the 
forward-looking statements in the study work. Important factors that could cause actual 
results to differ from these forward-looking statements are included in the Risk Factors section 
in the TRQ Annual Information Form dated as of 26 March 2014 for the year ended 31 
December 2013.

  The geology of the Project is well understood.
  The deposits are considered to be examples of a copper–gold porphyry system and
related high-sulfidation types of deposits.
  The deposits are grouped into three areas: Heruga, SOT and Hugo Dummett.
The exploration programme relies strongly on geophysical survey data (IP and magnetics), 
and other target anomalies still remain within the Project land holdings.
Four discrete zones have been identified in the SOT system, each of which are potentially 
mineable by open pit methods. In the current Technical Report, the resource estimate has 
been re-estimated in 2012. The base case assumes a CuEq cut-off of 0.22% but includes the 
results of alternative scenarios down to 0.2% CuEq cut-off. The base case CuEq cut-off grade 
assumption was determined using cut-off grades applicable to mining operations exploiting 
similar deposits.
The Southwest zone consists primarily of pyrite–chalcopyrite mineralisation related to biotite-
magnetite alteration, overprinted by chlorite–sericite alteration. Mineralisation is 
characterised by high gold contents with Au:Cu ratios (g/t Au to % Cu) of about 1:1 in the 
main part of the deposit, rising to 3:1 in the core of the system and at depth. Gold in the 
Southwest zone is closely associated with chalcopyrite and occurs intergrown with 
chalcopyrite, as inclusions and fracture infills within pyrite, or on grain boundaries of pyrite. 
The Southwest zone is essentially hosted in augite basalts.
South zone mineralisation is hosted in quartz-monzodiorite in the south-west and basalt 
throughout the central portion of the zone. Chalcopyrite is the principal copper sulfide, but in 
higher grade areas bornite locally exceeds chalcopyrite. Alteration in basaltic rocks consists 
of chlorite, biotite, hematite–magnetite, and weak sericite. Quartz-monzodiorite has been 
altered by advanced argillic alteration. Small zones with elevated gold values occur locally.
Mineralisation in the Central zone is characterised by an upward-flaring high-sulfidation zone 
that overprints and overlies porphyry-style chalcopyrite–gold mineralisation. A secondary 
enriched supergene chalcocite blanket tens of metres in thickness overlies the high-
sulfidation covellite–pyrite zone. The high-sulfidation portion of the Central zone contains a 
mineral assemblage of pyrite, covellite, chalcocite–digenite, enargite, tennantite, cubanite, 
chalcopyrite, and molybdenite. Dominant host rocks are dacite tuff and quartz-monzodiorite. 
Higher grade mineralisation is associated with disseminated and coarse-grained fracture-
filling sulfides in zones of intensely contorted quartz stockwork veins and anastamosing zones 
of hydrothermal breccias. Chalcopyrite–gold mineralisation is dominant on the south and 
western margins of Central zone within either basalt or quartz-monzodiorite adjacent to 
intrusive contacts with basalt.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 499 of 519
The high-sulfidation part of the Central zone lacks significant gold. Alteration in the Central 
zone shows a close spatial relationship to mineralisation and original host lithology. Biotite–
chlorite and intermediate argillic alteration coincide with chalcopyrite–gold mineralisation 
within basalt. Advanced argillic and sericite alteration coincide with the high-sulfidation 
mineralisation within quartz-monzodiorite, and ignimbrite.
The Wedge Deposit contains a zone of high sulfidation mineralisation hosted principally in 
dacite tuff, grading downward and southward into chalcopyrite mineralisation in basalt and 
quartz-monzodiorite host rocks. High-sulfidation mineralisation consists of pyrite, chalcopyrite, 
bornite, enargite, covellite, and primary chalcocite in advanced argillically-altered host 
rocks. The high-sulfidation mineralisation grades downward into chalcopyrite, with lesser 
bornite within basalt host rocks, and pyrite + chalcopyrite mineralisation in quartz-
monzodiorite. Gold is absent, except locally in drillholes adjacent to the South Fault.
Copper mineralisation at the Hugo South deposit is centred on a high-grade (typically 
>2.0% Cu) zone of intense quartz stockwork veining, which in much of the deposit is localised 
within narrow quartz-monzodiorite intrusions and extends into the enclosing basalt and dacite 
tuff. The intense stockwork zone has an elongate tabular form, with a long axis plunging 
shallowly to the north–north-west, and an intermediate axis plunging moderately to the east. 
Copper grades gradually decrease upwards from the stockwork zone through the upper part 
of the basalt and the dacite tuff, and a broader zone of lower copper grades occurs below 
and to the west in basalt and quartz-monzodiorite.
The highest-grade copper mineralisation in the Hugo North Deposit is related to a zone of 
intense stockwork to sheeted quartz veins. The high-grade zone is centred on thin, east 
dipping quartz-monzodiorite intrusions or within the upper part of the large quartz-
monzodiorite body and extends into the adjacent basalt. In addition, moderate-to-high-
grade copper and gold values occur within quartz-monzodiorite below and to the west of 
the intense vein zone, in the Hugo North gold zone. This zone is distinct in its high gold (ppm) 
to Cu (%) ratios (0.5:1). Bornite is dominant in the highest-grade parts of the deposit (3.0%–
5.0% Cu), and is zoned outward to chalcopyrite (2.0%). At grades of <1.0% Cu, pyrite–
chalcopyrite ± enargite, tennantite, bornite, chalcocite, and rarely covellite occur, hosted 
mainly by advanced argillically altered dacite tuff.
Elevated gold grades in the Hugo North deposit occur within the up-dip (western) portion of 
the intensely veined high-grade core, and within a steeply dipping lower zone cutting 
through the western part of the quartz-monzodiorite. Quartz-monzodiorite in the lower zone 
exhibits a characteristic pink to buff colour, with a moderate intensity of quartz veining (25% 
by volume). This zone is characterised by finely disseminated bornite and chalcopyrite, 
although in hand specimen the chalcopyrite is usually not visible. The sulfides are 
disseminated throughout the rock in the matrix as well as in quartz veins. The fine-grained 
sulfide gives the rocks a black sooty appearance. The red colouration is attributed to fine 
hematite dusting, mainly associated with albite.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 500 of 519
The Hugo North Deposit is characterised by copper–gold porphyry and related styles of 
alteration similar to those at Hugo South. This includes biotite–K-feldspar (K-silicate), 
magnetite, chlorite–muscovite–illite, albite, chlorite–illite–hematite–kaolinite (intermediate 
argillic), quartz–alunite–pyrophyllite–kaolinite–diaspore–zunyite–topaz–dickite (advanced 
argillic), and sericite–muscovite zones.
The current Hugo North and Hugo South resource models were developed using industry-
accepted methods and are considered acceptable for incorporation into resource 
estimates. The updated SOT model has been developed using a 2D level-plan projection 
method. It is recommended that a wireframe solid grade shell approach be used for further 
updates. If OT LLC continue to use the 2D level-plan projection method then a separate a 
wireframe solid grade shell approach should also be prepared to allow a comparison of the 
resource estimate and provide a confirmation of the results. OreWin concurs with OT LLC's 
conclusion that the estimates for Ag, As, and Mo may require review and revision. Revision of 
the Ag estimate may even result in an increase in grade relative to the 2005 model. OT LLC 
has reported the grades for Ag from the 2012 resource model for Mineral Resources but has 
used the Ag grade from the 2005 model for Mineral Reserves.
The Mineral Resources were classified using logic consistent with the CIM definitions referred 
to in NI 43-101. The mineralisation of the Project satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into 
Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resource categories.
The Heruga project, which lies within the Javkhlant MEL, contains a large zone of porphyry 
copper–gold–molybdenum mineralisation that has been subject to ongoing systematic 
drilling by OT LLC.
The copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry-style mineralisation at Heruga is hosted in Devonian 
basalts and quartz-monzodiorite intrusions, concealed beneath a deformed sequence of 
Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The deposit is cut 
by several major brittle fault systems, partitioning the deposit into discrete structural blocks. 
Internally, these blocks appear relatively undeformed, and consist of south-east dipping 
volcanic and volcaniclastic sequences. The stratiform rocks are intruded by quartz-
monzodiorite stocks and dykes that are probably broadly contemporaneous with 
mineralisation. The deposit is shallowest at the south end (approximately 500 m below 
surface) and plunges gently to the north.
The alteration at Heruga is typical of porphyry style deposits, with notably stronger potassic 
alteration at deeper levels. Locally intense quartz–sericite alteration with disseminated and 
vein pyrite is characteristic of mineralised quartz-monzodiorite. Molybdenite mineralisation 
seems to spatially correlate with stronger quartz–sericite alteration.
Copper sulfides occur at Heruga in both disseminations and veins/fractures. Mineralised veins 
have a much lower density at Heruga than in the more northerly SOT and Hugo Dummett 
deposits.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 501 of 519
Modelling of mineralisation zones for resource estimation purposes revealed that there is an 
upper copper-driven zone and a deeper gold-driven zone of copper-gold mineralisation at 
Heruga. In addition, there is significant (100–1,000 ppm) molybdenum mineralisation in the 
form of molybdenite. Locally high gold grades (exceeding 50 g/t) appear to be associated 
with base metal ± molybdenite in late stage veins.
The Mineral Resource estimate for the Heruga deposit was prepared by Stephen Torr of 
Ivanhoe Mines under the supervision of Scott Jackson of Quantitative Group. A close-off date 
of 21 June 2009 for all survey (collar and downhole) and assay data incorporated into the 
database.
Ivanhoe created three dimensional shapes or wireframes of the major geological features of 
the Heruga deposit. To assist in the estimation of grades in the model, Ivanhoe also manually 
created three dimensional grade shells (wireframes) for each of the metals to be estimated. 
Construction of the grade shells took into account prominent lithological and structural 
features, in particular the four major sub-vertical post-mineralisation faults. For copper, a 
single grade shell at a threshold of 0.3% Cu was used. For gold, wireframes were constructed 
at thresholds of 0.3 g/t and 0.7 g/t. For molybdenum, a single shell at a threshold of 100 ppm 
was constructed. These grade shells took into account known gross geological controls in 
addition to broadly adhering to the abovementioned thresholds.
QG checked the structural, lithological, and mineralised shapes to ensure consistency in the 
interpretation on section and plan. The wireframes were considered to be properly 
constructed and honoured the drill data.
Interpolation domains were based on mineralised geology, and grade estimation based on 
ordinary kriging. Bulk density was interpolated using an inverse distance to the third power 
methodology. The assays were composited into 5.0 m downhole composites; block sizes were 
20 m x 20 m x 15 m.
QG also built a model from scratch using the same wireframes and drill data used in the 
Ivanhoe model. Gold, copper, and molybdenum were interpolated using independently 
generated variograms and search parameters. QG compared the two estimates and 
consider they are well within acceptable limits thus adding additional support to the estimate 
built by Ivanhoe.
The Mineral Resources for Heruga were classified using logic consistent with the CIM 
definitions required by NI 43–101. Blocks within 150 m of a drillhole were initially considered to 
be Inferred. A three dimensional wireframe was constructed, inside of which the nominal drill 
spacing was less than 150 m. The shape aimed to remove isolated blocks around drillholes 
where continuity of mineralisation could not be confirmed. Within the 150 m shape there 
were a small number of blocks that were greater than 150 m from a drillhole. These were 
included because it was considered that geological and grade continuity could be 
reasonably inferred within the main part of the mineralised zone. Of the total tonnes classified 
as Inferred, approximately 95% are within 150 m of a drillhole while the average distance of 
the Inferred blocks is approximately 100 m.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx

The Mineral Reserves are based on feasibility study level work carried out by OT LLC. The study 
work has been used to support project financing and meets requirements for Mineral Reserve 
reporting under the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and those of US 
Industry Guide 7. This result meets the main objective of the 2014 OTTR. OT LLC plans to 
continue to study and optimise the operation in order to maximise the value of the Mineral 
Reserve.
OT LLC identified a problem with the Ag grade in the resource model and reverted to the 
2005 Ag grade for mine planning work. As discussed in Section 14, the silver grades in the 
current resource model are lower than the 2005 model silver grades. Silver is a by-product 
and this difference has been calculated to have an NSR value of approximately $0.10/t. 
OreWin considers that this is within the accuracy of the study work and is not a material issue. 
OreWin has therefore concluded that the Mineral Reserve is valid. However it is 
recommended that OT LLC review the resource estimates for silver and that the updated 
mine planning work take account of any changes to silver and other elements.
Oyu Tolgoi is a very large project that includes four separate deposits. The long-term 
development of Oyu Tolgoi would involve the development of the resources on all deposits. 
Alternative Production Cases have been developed to provide early stage analysis of the 
development flexibility that exists with respect to later phases of the Oyu Tolgoi deposits 
(Heruga, Hugo South, and the second Lift of Hugo North). Development of these deposits will 
require separate development decisions in the future based on then prevailing conditions 
and the development experience obtained from developing and operating the initial phases 
of Oyu Tolgoi.
The extensive resources at Oyu Tolgoi provide the company with the opportunity to 
continually evaluate investment decisions as the mine progresses, deposit knowledge 
increases and economic conditions change.
The Feasibility Study for the Oyu Tolgoi Expansion project is on based on sufficient 
metallurgical testwork, and limited operating experience in the concentrator, to enable 
reasonable predictions of ore body performance when treated through the existing, as 
constructed, concentrator and an expanded concentrator.
The concentrator production data provided by OT LLC indicates a project developing from 
commissioning into production with an indication that with further operational experience 
and optimisation, that design throughputs and recoveries should be achievable.
Ongoing metallurgical testwork supported by operating experience is expected to improve 
forecast modelling, grade / recovery / throughput, parameters for future ore types and 
blends.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 503 of 519
There are limited changes to site infrastructure beyond that already established. The changes 
proposed are reasonable and in most cases are expansions of existing systems.
Ongoing hydrogeological aquifer modelling and monitoring of actual aquifer performance 
with operations is indicating that the aquifer has a greater capacity than currently licensed. 
However, the expansion does not require any additional water than that licenced, 918 L/s.

Recommendations have been stated throughout the text of the report. OT LLC has 
commenced production from the open pit and the concentrator, and the underground 
mine at Hugo North is being developed. OT LLC intends to use this experience and apply it to 
the continued study and operation of the project. OreWin concurs with this plan. The key 
recommendations for further work are:
Oyu Tolgoi is a very large project that includes four separate deposits. The long-term

The extensive resources at Oyu Tolgoi provide the company with the opportunity to 
continually evaluate investment decisions as the mine progresses, deposit knowledge 
increases and economic conditions change.
The work on the alternative production cases is not complete, in particular the definition of 
the expansion sizes and costing of the cases. It is recommended that the options be studied 
further and that the timing of the new mines be defined in more detail.
The supply of power has been recognised as being critical to the execution of Oyu Tolgoi in 
the IA. OT LLC has been given the right to import power initially but must secure power from 
sources within Mongolia from the fourth year of operation.
The PPA is now in place to allow power to be imported from Inner Mongolia. The next phase 
of the IA is for OT LLC to source power from Mongolia by the fourth year of operation in 
accordance with the terms of the IA.
In August 2014, OT LLC signed a Power Sector Cooperation Agreement (PSCA) with the GOM 
for the exploration of a Tavan Tolgoi-based independent power producer (IPP). The aim of 
the PSCA is to lay out a framework for long-term strategic cooperation between the GOM 
and OT LLC for a comprehensive energy plan for the South Gobi region. Participation in the 
PSCA meets OT LLC’s obligation in the IA to establish a long-term power supply within 
Mongolia four years from the commencement of commercial production. Signing of a PSCA 
has reset the four years obligation while the opportunity for the establishment of an IPP at 
Tavan Tolgoi is studied.
The PSCA provides a framework for a broad range of power-related issues, including the 
establishment of a power generation source, transmission lines, and power imports. The 
centrepiece of the PSCA is an open, international tender process to identify and select an IPP
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 505 of 519
to privately fund, construct, own, and operate a power plant to supply electricity, with 
Oyu Tolgoi as the primary consumer.
Full evaluation of the IPP option is expected to take 9–12 months.
OT LLC plans to actively participate in the processes of the PSCA to ensure that there is a 
timely and reliable power supply solution for Oyu Tolgoi and this approach is endorsed.
OT LLC’s strategy is to obtain approval for increases to the currently approved water reserve 
ahead of any mine expansion plans. The objective of the study will be to assess the impact if 
any of the concentrator expansion on water demand and to determine the need for 
obtaining GOM approval for any substantial increase in the approved water demand from 
the Gunii Hooloi aquifer.
The current estimate of average water demand for a concentrator expansion to 160 ktpd is 
918 L/s, which is marginally above the rate of 870 L/s that has already been approved by the 
GOM.
Long-term sales contracts have been signed for 75% of Oyu Tolgoi’s concentrate production 
in the first three years, while 50% of concentrate production is contracted for ten years 
(subject to renewals). In addition to the signed contracts, in early November 2012, OT LLC 
committed in principle, subject to the conclusion of detailed sales contracts, up to 25% of 
concentrate available for export would be made available at international terms to smelters 
in Inner Mongolia for the first ten years.
OT LLC has developed a marketing plan and currently includes consideration of the following 
factors:
  Location value to customer compared to imported material landed at Chinese ports.
  Precious metals recovery and payment.
  Length of contract.
  Percentage of off-take to smelters versus traders.
  Percentage of tonnage on contract versus spot.
  Percentage of feed for any one smelter.
  Number of smelters for a given scale of operation.
  Management of concentrate quality and volume during commissioning and ramp-up.
  Alternate off-shore logistics and costs.
  Delivery point and terms.
  Packaging.
A detailed timeline has been developed for marketing, logistics, and contract-to-cash

functions. OT LLC’s Sales and Marketing will be supported by Rio Tinto Copper Marketing, led 
by its Chief Marketing Officer. The marketing team will oversee and execute all sales and 
marketing activities on behalf of OT LLC.
The preliminary mine closure and reclamation plan includes provisions to ensure that adverse 
socio-economic impacts of mine closure are minimised and positive impacts are maximised. 
To this end, OT LLC has planned that allowances will be incorporated into the annual mine 
operations budget starting 10 years before mine closure to address the costs of:
  Lost employment by the mine workforce.
  Adverse effects on supply chain businesses and downstream businesses, affected
communities, public services, and infrastructure.
  Promoting ongoing sustainability among affected stakeholders and communities.
The details of additional socio-economic aspects of a conceptual mine closure plan have 
not yet been fully developed and are the subject of work to be done in the near future.
OT LLC has advised that it expects revisions to the project scope, which may include:
  Operations camp expansion.
  Border facilities upgrade.
  Concentrate bagging plant upgrade.

Oyu Tolgoi has been developed quickly and as a result clear audit trails for work have not at 
times been maintained. It is recommended that systems and procedures be developed and 
implemented for the storage of the latest versions of data, with accompanying 
documentation and labelling, to ensure that the most up-to-date and correct files are always 
readily available to all concerned without any possibility of mistakenly accessing and using 
incorrect data.

The geological aspects of mine design and construction are discussed below.
The present geological interpretations are acceptable for the geological and resource 
models at the levels of confidence stated. The geological interpretations and models are 
likely to change as the project proceeds to detailed mine design and construction.
From 2010–2014, OT LLC reviewed and re-evaluated much of the data collected in support of 
mine design and construction. These reviews included consideration of the additional drilling 
completed in the project area, incorporation of revised, and more detailed, structural and 
lithological interpretations, consideration of changes in interpretation of the evolution and 
genesis of Oyu Tolgoi deposits, and the results of geotechnical reviews. A number of areas 
were identified that could benefit from targeted work programmes, particularly in the areas 
of structure and rock mechanics.
The result was development of proposed work for 2014 and beyond that addressed 
geological issues that could directly affect the mine design and construction. The OT LLC 
work programme is likely to include the following:
  Continuing to incorporate reconciliation data to assess performance of resource models,
especially for the SOT deposit.
  Continuing with underground and open pit face mapping to improve geological and
structural understanding and validate the structural and geological models.
  Undertaking drill testing of structural discontinuities identified in the structural and
geotechnical reviews. The results of such testwork would be incorporated into the block 
model.
  Reviewing the updated block models to pinpoint areas where there are gaps in
knowledge concerning lithology, alteration, structure, and mineralisation that require 
targeted drill testing. Such gaps are considered to be more likely on the orebody margins 
or in areas where high-grade mineralisation is in direct contact with areas interpolated as 
waste.
  Building a 3D district geological and structural model that will assist in further exploration
and in the definition of additional drill targets in the near-mine environment.
  Evaluating future work in the Hugo South and Hugo North Lift 2 areas to further enhance
the understanding of the overall resource development strategy.
  Completing the quantification of the mineralised inventory within Heruga North.
  Continuing with exploration programmes scaled to business needs to investigate
opportunities to expand the project resource base and improve the mine development 
sequence.
The concentrator has only recently progressed from commissioning into production with 
many unit operations within the concentrator not being fully optimised for throughput and 
recovery.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 508 of 519
It would be anticipated that improvements in throughput and recovery will be achieved to 
reach and surpass design assumptions together with reduction in unit operating costs. This 
could be achieved by:
  Optimisation of grinding control through improved power splits between SAG and Ball
milling;
  Optimisation of grind size to achieve the optimum recovery / throughput economic
outcome;
  Optimisation of reagent control / type for flotation and thickener unit operations;
  Optimisation of regrind recycle and sizing for cleaner flotation;


Improved availability of equipment through gaining of operating experience and 
implementation of preventative maintenance practices; and
Improved operator and technical experience with the concentrator equipment and ore 
characteristics.
This optimisation would include ongoing circuit surveys and modelling, metallurgical testwork 
and support from reagent and equipment suppliers.
Additional work is required in the following areas to advance the design of the process plant:
  Phase 2 detailed engineering.
  Ongoing metallurgical testing programme for Hugo North and Central zone ores.
  Concentrator conversion feasibility study update.
  Pre-feasibility programme for additional resources (Heruga, Hugo South).
  Smelter studies.
  Heap leach studies.
  Magnetite recovery.
  Gravity or magnetic separation of gold from the regrind circuit.
  Other improvements to gold recovery.
  Enhanced tailings treatment to reduce water retention.
OT LLC has a programme of studies to optimise the TSF design. These include bringing forward 
the Cell 2 operation to create larger tailings deposition areas will result in higher in-place 
tailing densities and greater storage capacity. Optimisation of the TSF is also expected to 
improve tailings solids content at deposition, which is currently is lower than the design 
assumptions but it is expected that this can be brought up to the design assumption through 
optimisation of the operation of the TSF. This optimisation of the TSF will potentially provide 
cost savings over the assumptions in OTFS14.
140032014OTTRrev0.docx
Page 509 of 519
The following items are planned to be addressed by OT LLC as future work based on the 
current TSF design for Oyu Tolgoi:
  The current design needs to be optimised given the operating conditions and lower
tailings solids content at deposition.

It may be more cost effective overall to implement Cell 2 earlier than Year 5, in terms of 
the amount of embankment material required to store the tailings. Larger tailings 
deposition areas will result in higher in-place tailing densities (faster drainage and drying 
time) and greater storage capacity. This approach is to be evaluated for potential cost 
savings.
  Currently the density of concentrator thickened tailings is 1.26 t/m3 this is lower than the
design assumption of 1.45 t/m3, and this is having a potential adverse effect on the 
project water balance, higher water usage, and capacity of the tailings facility, less 
capacity of existing design. The testwork undertaken during the project design indicated 
a tailings density of 1.45 t/m3 can be achieved from the tailings thickeners. As the 
concentrator has only recently progressed from commissioning into production and 
many aspects of the concentrator have not been optimised, optimisation of thickener 
control and flocculant additions, are expected to achieve the design thickener 
underflow density. At a revised target density of 1.35 t/m3, the KCB 2011 feasibility design 
for the TSF provides for storage of 670 Mt of tailings produced over the first 18 years of 
mine life. Once operating conditions are understood, the facility will need to be 
expanded to support continued mining beyond that capacity. Designs for the three 
additional cells required to store the total 1.5 bt of tailings will be based on the deposition 
and construction experience gained in optimising the current design.
  Embankment slopes should be optimised based on observations from test fills and
conditions during the construction period. The design is currently based on assumptions 
of pore pressure response that could be conservative. The instrumentation and 
monitoring programme should be expanded to improve understanding of foundation 
performance.
  Observations made during operations with regard to beach formation and water
recovery are being evaluated to optimise the number of sub-cells in the TSF design. 
Alternately, the sub-cells may be eliminated entirely and an expanded spigot discharge 
system used to manage tailings deposition.
Achieving the design tailings density to the tailings dam will assist in:

Improvements in water return, from the tailings dam and thickener, tailings beach angles
  Steeper beach angles in the tailings dam further improving ultimate settled density in the
dam, and
  Providing improved storage capacity towards design values.
This improvements from current assumptions will achieve reduced costs for the TSF sustaining 
capital over the life of the project.
