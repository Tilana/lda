<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Belarus, Mikl&#243;s Haraszti* 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the report, the Special Rapporteur sets forth the developments in human rights 
</p>
<p>since his previous report (A/HRC/26/44). The Special Rapporteur outlines major current 
</p>
<p>concerns in detail and describes the general situation, which for the past two decades has 
</p>
<p>been characterized by a systemic denial of human rights to citizens by means of an 
</p>
<p>intentional combination of restrictive laws and abusive practices. The findings of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur during the period under review indicated that, while no substantial 
</p>
<p>reform was discernible and violations continued, the legal and administrative environment 
</p>
<p>for the enjoyment of human rights had further deteriorated, in particular with regard to the 
</p>
<p>rights to free expression, association and assembly, to just and favourable conditions for 
</p>
<p>work and to the freedom to choose one&#8217;s workplace. The Special Rapporteur concludes the 
</p>
<p>report with recommendations on improving the situation, both step-by-step and in a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive manner.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council established the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in Belarus in its resolution 20/13. The current mandate holder 
</p>
<p>assumed his functions on 1 November 2012. The Council has twice extended the mandate 
</p>
<p>for one year, in its resolutions 23/15 and 26/25. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur describes the prevailing situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in Belarus since his previous report to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/44). It covers information received up until 30 March 2015.  
</p>
<p>3. The findings of the Special Rapporteur for the period under review brought to light 
</p>
<p>the fact that the situation of human rights in Belarus has not improved, and that widespread 
</p>
<p>disrespect for human rights, in particular civil and political rights, continues. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of progress made to address the systematic and 
</p>
<p>systemic denial of human rights.  
</p>
<p>4. Important areas of human rights governance have deteriorated in Belarus, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>the legal, regulatory and administrative environment for the Internet and the media. The 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of assembly and association have been further limited by new restrictive 
</p>
<p>provisions.  
</p>
<p>5. The practice of short-term detention of activists, journalists and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders has continued and increased. Administrative and &#8220;preventive&#8221; arrests continue to 
</p>
<p>be used systematically and arbitrarily against citizens who seek to exercise independently 
</p>
<p>and freely their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p>6. Compared to previous years, fewer persons were incarcerated for long prison terms 
</p>
<p>in retaliation for their political activities; nonetheless their situation has remained 
</p>
<p>unchanged. Among them, a former presidential candidate has remained behind bars since 
</p>
<p>2011. Besides Ales Bialiatski, two political prisoners were released in 2014, albeit after 
</p>
<p>having served their full prison terms. Nothing has been done to review any of their cases or 
</p>
<p>to rehabilitate them. 
</p>
<p>7. A highly dissuasive, permission-based regime is still the main tool used to deny civil 
</p>
<p>rights and to curtail the freedoms of expression and opinion, information, association and 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly, which are all key factors in full and inclusive participation in public life. 
</p>
<p>The permission-based regime is further aggravated by the criminalization of all 
</p>
<p>unsanctioned public undertakings and organizations, aimed at dissuading participation in 
</p>
<p>and support for such associations; indeed, mere attendance at events of this type may lead 
</p>
<p>to criminal or administrative charges and discrimination in various aspects of life. 
</p>
<p>8. The judiciary continues to be fully dependent on the President, in spite of some 
</p>
<p>recent reforms. Besides the lack of independence of the courts and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies, intimidation is used against lawyers, who are forced to join the bar association 
</p>
<p>that is directly supervised by the Government.  
</p>
<p>9. Labour rights continue to be denied, and independent labour unions are suppressed. 
</p>
<p>The rights to just and favourable work conditions and to the freedom to choose one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>workplace have been further restricted by new legal provisions.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also noted that there has been little or no progress with 
</p>
<p>regard to developments welcomed in the past, such as the stated intention to establish a 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution and a parliamentary working group on the death penalty.  </p>


<p>11. The absence of a national human rights institution is one of the reasons why the 
</p>
<p>institutional setting for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country remains 
</p>
<p>deficient. In 2010, the Government accepted a recommendation made during its universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review on considering the establishment of a national human rights institution in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Paris Principles. The Special Rapporteur notes that, although according 
</p>
<p>to a report issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
</p>
<p>(http://mfa.gov.by/upload/UPR_Belarus_National_Report.pdf), discussions thereon are 
</p>
<p>ongoing, after four years Belarus has still not established such an institution.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur found no information on progress made by the 
</p>
<p>parliamentary working group on the death penalty established in 2010. In the meantime, 
</p>
<p>capital punishment continues to be used in Belarus with no guarantee of due process. In 
</p>
<p>2014, three persons were executed, and a new death sentence was pronounced on 18 March 
</p>
<p>2015.
1
 
</p>
<p>13. The unwillingness of the Government to address chronic human rights concerns and 
</p>
<p>the absolute impunity for human rights violations contribute to their perpetuation. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur has underlined the systemic and systematic nature of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in Belarus in his previous reports. The United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights had earlier concluded that deficiencies pertaining to human rights in Belarus 
</p>
<p>were of &#8220;a systemic nature&#8221; (A/HRC/20/8, para. 74). The regrettable lack of governmental 
</p>
<p>cooperation on the mandate underlines the need to report on and monitor the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>14.  It is therefore critical that the Human Rights Council maintain its scrutiny of the 
</p>
<p>serious human rights situation in Belarus, even more so in the light of the presidential 
</p>
<p>elections to be held at the end of 2015.  
</p>
<p>15. With the incumbent president having been in office for nearly 20 years and the 
</p>
<p>absence of an opposition in Parliament, there has been a pattern of mass-scale pressure on 
</p>
<p>and harassment against civil society actors in Belarus amounting to recurring violence, 
</p>
<p>specifically during or in the immediate aftermath of presidential and parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections and the announcement of their preordained outcomes. The most recent example 
</p>
<p>was the presidential election held on 19 December 2010, when more than 600 people were 
</p>
<p>detained and dozens of civil society activists, journalists, politicians and their supporters 
</p>
<p>were arrested. Several observers, researchers and human rights experts are concerned about 
</p>
<p>similar severe human rights violations in the electoral process if circumstances of free and 
</p>
<p>fair elections are not guaranteed. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur highlights the direct 
</p>
<p>correlation between a freely functioning civil society and the enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>genuine periodic elections guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with article 25 (b) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. It is also with the presidential elections in mind that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>addresses recommendations to the Government in order to protect human rights in the 
</p>
<p>context of the elections. He reiterates his readiness to cooperate with the authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>17.  Independence, impartiality and objectivity, and cooperation with all stakeholders 
are the guiding principles of the work conducted by the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 European Union delegation to the United Nations, &#8220;Statement by the Spokesperson on a death 
</p>
<p>sentence in Belarus&#8221;, 19 March 2015. </p>


<p>18. Owing to the Government&#8217;s continued refusal to cooperate with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, he has yet to have access to the country; nevertheless, he has continued to seek 
</p>
<p>the cooperation of the Government in order to engage in a constructive dialogue. He sought 
</p>
<p>meetings with the Permanent Representatives of Belarus to the United Nations in New 
</p>
<p>York and Geneva, and submitted requests for an official visit to the country. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has received no response to any of his correspondence, and again deplores that 
</p>
<p>this situation limits the collection and analysis of first-hand information from in-country 
</p>
<p>sources, including from the Government.  
</p>
<p>19. Notwithstanding such constraints, the Special Rapporteur endeavoured to collect 
</p>
<p>information from primary sources, which is crucial to ensure that his report is as accurate, 
</p>
<p>time-bound and measured as possible. He frequently undertook consultations with victims 
</p>
<p>of violations, representatives of civil society, human rights experts and diplomats. If the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur were authorized to visit the country, he would be able to develop 
</p>
<p>findings on the proclaimed successes in the sphere of economic and social rights, including 
</p>
<p>through a dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the cooperation received from many 
</p>
<p>stakeholders living in Belarus. In the present report, he refers to cases that are emblematic 
</p>
<p>of the nature of the human rights violations in Belarus. They do not, however, reflect the 
</p>
<p>full list of allegations submitted to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>21.  As in previous reporting periods, presidential decrees continue to be used as the 
main legislative mechanism in Belarus (A/HRC/23/52, para. 37; A/HRC/26/44, para. 21). 
</p>
<p>While Parliament is responsible for developing and adopting legislation, it is the 
</p>
<p>Presidential Administration that prepares the drafts. President&#8217;s decrees can overrule 
</p>
<p>existing legislation, including constitutional law, on any issue. The Special Rapporteur for 
</p>
<p>example noted this in the context of Presidential Decree No. 6 of 29 November 2013 on the 
</p>
<p>improvement of the judicial system, as confirmed by information given on the website of 
</p>
<p>the Brest Regional Court (www.oblsud.vbreste.by). 
</p>
<p>22. A recent example is Presidential Decree No. 18, which outlines how courts should 
</p>
<p>apply legislation on the recognition and execution of judgements handed down by foreign 
</p>
<p>courts and arbitral awards, issued on 23 December 2014 by the Plenary of the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court. The purpose of the decree, as described in the preamble thereto, was to ensure &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>unity of legal practice in the application of international treaties and to improve the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice during the consideration of cases concerning the recognition and 
</p>
<p>execution of judgements handed down by foreign courts or arbitrages (arbitral courts) in the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Belarus by courts of general jurisdiction of the Republic of Belarus.
&#8221;2 
</p>
<p>23.  The introduction of new or revised legislation or adoption of amendments does not 
</p>
<p>result from a consultative process, despite frequent requests by civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>to be included in the process.  
</p>
<p>24. A law on the judicial proceedings of the Constitutional Court (www.kc.gov.by), 
</p>
<p>which came into force on 17 April 2014, allows bodies other than those listed in article 116, 
</p>
<p>part 4 of the Constitution, including government bodies, other organizations and citizens 
</p>
<p>collectively or individually, to submit requests to the Court for an advisory opinion on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Belarusian Helsinki Committee et al, Analytical review of the human rights situation in Belarus, 
</p>
<p>October&#8211;December 2014 (available at http://belhelcom.org/en/node/19697), p. 15. </p>


<p>legislative acts. The Court may also initiate proceedings on its own initiative (art. 158). In 
</p>
<p>its annual report for 2014, the Court stated that it received 780 requests under the new law 
</p>
<p>and had examined three cases, of which two on labour law and one on pensions. The report 
</p>
<p>does not, however, provide disaggregated data, and the decisions of the Court are not made 
</p>
<p>public.  
</p>
<p>25.  With regard to positive developments in national legislation, the amendments to the 
law on public associations and on political parties, which came into force on 20 February 
</p>
<p>2014, allow in part for the reduction in the required number of founders from various 
</p>
<p>regions required to establish a public organization and increased requirements for the 
</p>
<p>dissolution of public associations (A/69/307, para. 45). The permission-based process itself 
</p>
<p>of registering associations has, however, not changed, allowing for arbitrary, selective and 
</p>
<p>politicized decisions on registration. 
</p>
<p>26. On 17 December 2014, the Parliament passed amendments to the law on mass 
</p>
<p>media, allowing the Government to increase significantly its pressure on the independent 
</p>
<p>media.3 The amendments provide in particular that owners of online resources are 
</p>
<p>responsible for the content posted, including material considered to be extremist 
</p>
<p>information or &#8220;other information capable of harming the national interests&#8221; of Belarus; the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Information may block access to online resources without court authorization if 
</p>
<p>two warnings have been issued within 12 months and the scope for reasons to issue 
</p>
<p>warnings has been expanded. There are also concerns that the requirement for accreditation 
</p>
<p>will be used to restrict journalists&#8217; access to information.4  
</p>
<p>27. Except for the requirement of registration, the law on mass media as amended will 
</p>
<p>also be fully applicable to online media. Specifically, authorities in Belarus have stated that 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;dissemination of information that may &#8230;pose a threat to national security may result 
</p>
<p>in the blocking of websites.&#8221;5  
</p>
<p><b> III. Engagement with the international human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>28. Over the years, various international human rights mechanisms have made 
</p>
<p>recommendations to bring legislation, policies and practice into line with the commitments 
</p>
<p>of Belarus under international human rights law. The implementation of these 
</p>
<p>recommendations remains very limited. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes that two national consultations were held in 2014 with 
</p>
<p>the aim of implementing the recommendations from the first universal periodic review of 
</p>
<p>Belarus, to which only registered non-governmental organizations were invited to attend. 
</p>
<p>Follow-up documents were not made available to the public.6 The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>notes that, in the preparation of the second review of Belarus, only registered non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations were consulted. 
</p>
<p>30. Since the previous report of the Special Rapporteur, a number of cases have been 
</p>
<p>filed under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights. At its 112th session, in October 2014, the Human Rights Committee adopted views 
</p>

<p>on 12 communications with regard to Belarus, most of which regarding the freedoms of 
</p>
<p>association, assembly and expression.7 
</p>
<p>31.  Belarus has continued to challenge the registration of cases filed under the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol on procedural grounds. To date, the Human Rights Committee has not been 
</p>
<p>satisfied by the measures taken by the State party to give effect to its recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption by Belarus of the optional reporting 
</p>
<p>procedure of the Human Rights Committee.
 
 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur encourages Belarus to respond positively to the requests by 
</p>
<p>special procedures to visit the country, including the Special Rapporteur on torture<b> </b>and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Independence of the judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>34. Although Presidential Decree No. 6 of November 2013, aimed at reforming the 
</p>
<p>judicial system of Belarus, was a welcome step, It was reported that, as at the end of 2014, 
</p>
<p>none of the changes removing the powers established in the Code of Judicial System and 
</p>
<p>Status of Judges had been effectively introduced.8  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the extensive powers of the General 
</p>
<p>Directorate for Relations with Legislative and Judicial Bodies and Issues of Citizenship and 
</p>
<p>Pardon, included within the Presidential Administration, which submits proposals regarding 
</p>
<p>the appointment and dismissal of judges and other related judicial functions for the 
</p>
<p>President&#8217;s consideration.9 The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
</p>
<p>lawyers has recommended that a body similar to models found in other countries under the 
</p>
<p>title of Judicial Council, Council of Judges or Supreme/High Council of Judges be 
</p>
<p>established in Belarus (see E/CN.4/2001/65/Add. 1). The Special Rapporteur encourages 
</p>
<p>the implementation of that recommendation and the establishment of such a body, which 
</p>
<p>would be composed mainly of judges and perform the functions currently carried out by the 
</p>
<p>General Directorate.  
</p>
<p>36.  The Special Rapporteur notes the positive development represented by the adoption 
</p>
<p>on 20 December 2013 of Order No. 11, which is aimed at increasing transparency in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>judicial system and ensuring the dissemination of information on the work of the courts, 
</p>
<p>and encourages the courts to adopt the provisions of the Order.10  
</p>
<p>37. In particular, the process for appointing judges should be as transparent as possible. 
</p>
<p>The executive authorities continue to play a significant role in the appointment of judges. 
</p>
<p>The majority of judges are also often appointed for a short tenure, a fact that increases their 
</p>
<p>dependence on the executive authorities that appoint them.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the authorities of Belarus to make public the 
</p>
<p>guidelines they use for the selection and appointment of judges. While decrees relating to 
</p>
<p>the appointment of judges are public, the criteria used to reach these decisions remain 
</p>
<p>unknown to both the general public and candidates for judicial office.11 
</p>
<p>39. Since January 2007, the Code of Judicial Systems and Status of Judges has required 
</p>
<p>judges to be appointed for a term of five years; judges may also be appointed for a further 
</p>
<p>term, or indefinitely.12 The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that this has led to fewer 
</p>
<p>judges being appointed to tenured positions, and the negative impact this could have on 
</p>
<p>judicial independence. 
</p>
<p>40. With regard to the dismissal of judges, the President retains extensive powers to 
</p>
<p>dismiss a sitting judge without taking into considerations any further opinions, and &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>apply a disciplinary penalty on judges without any public or legally defined procedure of 
</p>
<p>examination&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p><b> B. Independence of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>41. United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review, 
</p>
<p>have repeatedly called upon Belarus to respond to the concerns of defence lawyers and to 
</p>
<p>address the pattern of intimidation against lawyers and of interference in their work (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/15/16, paras. 50 and 98.26). The continued failure to address this issue has had a 
</p>
<p>chilling effect on the independence of lawyers.14 Like other special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the frequent targeting of lawyers working 
</p>
<p>on human rights cases (A/68/276, para. 97). He reiterates his call upon Belarus to restore 
</p>
<p>the licences of lawyers revoked after they represented candidates in the 2010 presidential 
</p>
<p>elections.15  
</p>
<p>42. Domestic legislation, including Presidential Decree No. 12, undermines the 
</p>
<p>independence of the legal profession by subordinating lawyers to the control of the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice and introducing obligatory membership in a State-controlled bar association. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur calls upon Belarus to take all appropriate measures, including a review 
</p>
<p>of the Constitution and laws, to meet the international minimum standards as set out in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers so as to ensure that judges and lawyers are 
</p>
<p>independent of any political or other external pressure.16  
</p>
<p><b> C. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur notes that Belarus has yet to make declarations under 
</p>
<p>articles 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment and to accede to the Optional Protocol thereto. Taking note of the 
</p>
<p>recent amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, he calls 
</p>
<p>upon Belarus to implement the recommendations made by the Committee against Torture
17
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and to integrate fully a definition of torture in accordance with the Convention into all 
</p>
<p>relevant legislation. 
</p>
<p>44. An effective mechanism for the investigation of complaints of torture by prisoners 
</p>
<p>or detainees is still lacking in Belarus. Officials accused of engaging in torture or ill-
</p>
<p>treatment are not suspended while investigations are conducted. Furthermore, there are 
</p>
<p>reports that complaints cannot be submitted to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office from places of 
</p>
<p>detention and that complainants are punished by solitary confinement or other measures of 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological maltreatment. With regard to prosecuting alleged acts of torture, 
</p>
<p>to date there has been no successful prosecution in the domestic courts of individuals 
</p>
<p>accused of torture or order to compensate victims for the harm caused.18
 
 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to develop an independent and 
</p>
<p>effective mechanism to facilitate the submission of complaints by victims of torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment to public authorities in accordance with the recommendations made by the 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture.19
 
 
</p>
<p>46. The human right defender Ales Bialiatski was released by the authorities in June 
</p>
<p>2014. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, while in custody, Mr. Bialiatski was 
</p>
<p>subjected to psychological and physical pressure while deprived of liberty and to repeated 
</p>
<p>arbitrary forms of disciplinary punishment for allegedly violating the rules of the penal 
</p>
<p>colony. Punishment included limited access to relatives, lawyers, correspondence and 
</p>
<p>communications, and practices that could be viewed as amounting to ill-treatment or even 
</p>
<p>torture.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that as Belarus moves towards the next 
</p>
<p>presidential election in 2015, it is worrying that none of the previously alleged cases of 
</p>
<p>torture of political candidates, activists and human rights defenders while in detention has 
</p>
<p>been clarified by the authorities. These cases include allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>of the 2010 presidential candidates Andrei Sannikau, after his arrest on 19 December 2010,

<p>and Ales Mikhalevich, at the high security prison in January 2011 (A/69/307, para. 71). 
</p>
<p>Another case is that of Ihar Tsikhanyuk from the human rights organization Lambda, which 
</p>
<p>protects the rights of LGBTI persons. In 2012, Mr. Tsikhanyuk was reportedly taken to a 
</p>
<p>police station where he was punched, abused and threatened with violence. 20 To date, there 
</p>
<p>has been no investigation into these cases or attempts to bring those responsible to justice. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prison conditions  
</b></p>
<p>48. Article 62 of the Constitution and article 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
</p>
<p>codify the legal right of citizens of Belarus to legal assistance and counsel. Despite this 
</p>
<p>legal safeguard, the Special Rapporteur recognizes the continued complaints of detainees 
</p>
<p>that they are often denied prompt access to counsel while in detention.21 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also notes similar complaints relating to prompt access to 
</p>
<p>physicians. While there is legislation in place that provides for the medical examination of 
</p>
<p>injured detainees by health-care workers, care may only be accorded at the discretion of the 
</p>
<p>head of the facility. Appealing a refusal of examination can take more than 10 days during 
</p>
<p>which time the physical harm caused might be healed. Furthermore, detainees are required 
</p>
<p>to cover the cost of such medical examinations from their own personal funds, creating a 
</p>
<p>disadvantage for individuals without any such funds.22  
</p>
<p>50. Detainees have also lodged complaints relating to their inability to contact family 
</p>
<p>members while in detention, as exemplified through the experiences of the political 
</p>
<p>prisoners Mikalai Statkevich and Ihar Alinevich. Both reported that letters had been 
</p>
<p>rejected by prison censorship, and that letters from and to family members were not being 
</p>
<p>delivered.23  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur received information that, in October 2014, the Department 
</p>
<p>for the Execution of Judgments of the Ministry of the Internal Affairs had issued a permit 
</p>
<p>for Platforma Innovation, a non-governmental organization, to visit penitentiary institutions 
</p>
<p>in Belarus.24 This is a welcome development. The Special Rapporteur stresses the 
</p>
<p>importance of unfettered access to all places of detention, which should include police cells, 
</p>
<p>detention centres, security service premises, administrative detention areas, detention units 
</p>
<p>of medical and psychiatric institutions and prisons. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Mahiliou Human Rights Center, the 
</p>
<p>only human rights organization with a representative who is a member of the public 
</p>
<p>supervisory commission monitoring penal institutions, is under constant pressure to cease 
</p>
<p>activities by the authorities.25

<p><b> E. Arbitrary arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur received credible allegations of a persistent and expanding 
</p>
<p>practice of preventive arrests, administrative arrests and arbitrary detention of citizens in 
</p>
<p>the period immediately preceding important political or social events. This practice has 
</p>
<p>been used in Belarus since 2006,26 and has become systemic. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. According to documented information provided by a non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization, all records with regard to the administrative prosecution of protestors and 
</p>
<p>opposition representatives were broken in the first half of 2014. Most cases were associated 
</p>
<p>with preventative arrests before and after conducting peaceful demonstrations or gatherings 
</p>
<p>on civil and political rights (A/69/307, para. 66). The policy continued throughout the year, 
</p>
<p>characterized by the use of repeated short-term &#8220;preventive&#8221; and administrative arrest of 
</p>
<p>members of human rights organizations.  
</p>
<p>55. There is an emerging pattern in the misuse of these measures to discourage public 
</p>
<p>civic activism in the whole of society; for example, Pavel Vinogradov, an activist from 
</p>
<p>youth organization Zmena, was arrested 15 times in 2014. The most common reasons for 
</p>
<p>arrest of activists were for &#8220;swearing in public&#8221;, &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; or &#8220;failure to obey police 
</p>
<p>officers orders&#8221;, or all three charges simultaneously, which leads to cumulative sanctions.  
</p>
<p>56. At least 37 political activists were arrested before the World Ice Hockey 
</p>
<p>Championship held in Minsk in May 2014. All of those arrested had been involved in 
</p>
<p>protest actions, and included representatives of various social and political groups, such as 
</p>
<p>Malady (Young) Front, web activists, and members of football fan clubs.27 
</p>
<p>57. Prior to the World Ice Hockey Championship, local authorities also &#8220;cleansed&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Minsk of what were referred to as &#8220;asocial elements&#8221;, namely, homeless persons, sex 
</p>
<p>workers, and individuals suffering from alcoholism. While the exact number of persons 
</p>
<p>subjected to this practice is not known, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that at least 
</p>
<p>350 prostitutes had been subjected to administrative arrest during this period of time.28  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also received reports that, in 2014, eight activists had been 
</p>
<p>subjected to preventive detention prior to the annual demonstration Chernobyl Way, held 
</p>
<p>on the anniversary of the Chernobyl power plant disaster.29  
</p>
<p>59. The activists and former political prisoners Zmitser Dashkevich and Alexander 
</p>
<p>Frantskevich were each sentenced to 25 days of administrative arrest, covering both 
</p>
<p>Chernobyl Way and the World Ice Hockey Championships.30  
</p>
<p>60. Administrative prosecutions also concern other spheres of public life and events. In 
</p>
<p>January 2015, fans of a local football team in Salihorsk were detained for holding an 
</p>
<p>unauthorized fireworks show.31
 
It was also reported that, on several occasions, similar 
</p>
<p>arrests were made at rock concerts. 
</p>
<p>61. The above-mentioned arrests and detentions are justified under section 17.1 of the 
</p>
<p>Code of Administrative Offences, referred to deliberate acts that violate public order.

<p>Individuals concerned are often not informed of the charges against them, nor are their 
</p>
<p>rights explained, and families are not informed of their detention.32 
</p>
<p>62. Furthermore, in the court hearings of such administrative cases, only the testimony 
</p>
<p>of police officers is used as the basis for court rulings in the case of preventive detentions. 
</p>
<p>Any witnesses brought by the defence are ignored. Hearings are held in closed sessions. 
</p>
<p>Issues concerning the lodging of appeals to the initial decisions of the court were also 
</p>
<p>reported.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Imprisonment of political opponents, human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b>and activists 
</b></p>
<p>63. During the period under review, several long-term political prisoners were released. 
</p>
<p>Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center, who was sentenced in 2011 on 
</p>
<p>charges of tax evasion, was released in June 2014 after having served three years of his 
</p>
<p>four-and-a-half-year sentence. The Special Rapporteur welcomes his release. He also notes 
</p>
<p>the release of two political prisoners, Vasil Parfiankou and Eduard Lobau, in December 
</p>
<p>2014, although after they had served their full sentences. None of them was rehabilitated, 
</p>
<p>nor were their cases reviewed. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for the immediate 
</p>
<p>and unconditional release of all other opponents and activists whose sentences appear to be 
</p>
<p>politically motivated, and for their full rehabilitation.33 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that, since June 2014, the list of 
</p>
<p>individuals having been or being held in detention on politically motivated charges include 
</p>
<p>Evgeniy Vaskovich, Igor Olinevich, Vasily Prokopenko and Mikalai Statkevich, Ihar 
</p>
<p>Alinevich, Mikalai Dziadok, Artisom Prakapenka and Yury Rubtsou.34 
</p>
<p>65. The 2010 presidential candidate Mikalai Statkevich remains in detention, serving six 
</p>
<p>years in prison on charges of organizing mass riots, personal violence and resistance to 
</p>
<p>public agents.35 On 12 August 2014, Andrey Bondarenko, an advocate for prisoner rights 
</p>
<p>from Platforma Innovation, a non-governmental organization, was sentenced to three years 
</p>
<p>in prison for hooliganism.36 On 22 December 2014, Yury Rubtsou began serving an 18-
</p>
<p>month sentence, convicted of insulting a judge during an administrative hearing, which was 
</p>
<p>held in closed session.37 An activist from Gomel, he was first arrested in November 2013 
</p>
<p>during a demonstration for wearing a T-shirt on which was written &#8220;Lukashenko, go 
</p>
<p>away!&#8221;. He has since been repeatedly sentenced to terms of administrative detention. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>66. There has been no progress in solving the outstanding cases of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance dating back to 1999 and 2000, when Viktar Hanchar, a former member of 
</p>
<p>Parliament, and his associate, Anatol Krasouski, as well as Yury Zakharenko, former 
</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior, and Dimitry Zavadsky, an investigative journalist, were abducted.

<p>All were noted political opponents of the President. According to numerous testimonies and 
</p>
<p>accounts collected by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Committee, the disappearances, some of which were committed on busy 
</p>
<p>streets, were assisted by actual and former members of the law enforcement agencies. The 
</p>
<p>authorities merely notify the relatives of the victims every three months that there is &#8220;no 
</p>
<p>result&#8221; in any of the cases and extend the investigation for a further three months. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call that the fate of the disappeared persons 
</p>
<p>urgently be investigated, given that, until the cases are solved, trust in the judiciary and the 
</p>
<p>public authorities cannot be restored. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>68.  Since 2010, 10 people &#8211; Andrei Zhuk, Vasil Yuzepchuk, Andrei Burdyka, Aleh 
Hryshkavets, Ihar Mialik, Uladzislau Kavaliou, Dzmitry Kanavalau, Rygor Yuzepchuk, 
</p>
<p>Pavel Sialiun and Alyaksandr Hrynou &#8211; have been executed in Belarus.38 In 2014 alone, 
</p>
<p>there were three executions &#8211; of Alyaksandr Hrynou, Pavel Syalun and Rygor Yuzepchuk &#8211; 
</p>
<p>after a period of 24 months with no executions.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at a new death sentence that was handed down 
</p>
<p>on 18 March 2015 by the Rechytsa district court against Siarhei Ivanou at the end of a trial 
</p>
<p>which had been held in camera.39 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that death sentences continue to be 
</p>
<p>implemented while individual appeals in these cases have been registered with the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee, and the Government has been informed that emergency proceedings 
</p>
<p>regarding these cases have been launched.40 When Alyaksandr Hrunou was executed in 
</p>
<p>November 2014, his case was pending before the Committee, which subsequently 
</p>
<p>expressed its concern that Belarus had &#8221;executed a person whose complaint was still under 
</p>
<p>consideration by the Committee&#8221;.41  
</p>
<p>71. Pavel Syalun and Rygor Yuzepchuk were executed in April 2014.42 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes the statement by Pavel Syalun&#8217;s mother, who was informed of the 
</p>
<p>execution only when she came to visit her son at the prison, where she was told that &#8220;He 
</p>
<p>has departed, in accordance with his sentence&#8221; (see A/HRC/26/NGO/113, p. 2). Similarly, 
</p>
<p>the mother of Alyaksandr Hrunou learned of the execution days after it took place, when 
</p>
<p>she received a parcel with his clothes from the penitentiary.  
</p>
<p>72. The establishment in December 2012 of a parliamentary working group on the death 
</p>
<p>penalty was viewed by the Special Rapporteur as a promising development (A/HRC/26/44, 
</p>
<p>para. 70). However, according to information available, there has not been any progress to 
</p>
<p>date.

<p>73.  During a press conference held in Minsk on 29 January 2015, reported by the 
</p>
<p>agency Minsk Novosti, the President spoke out once again in favour of the death penalty, 
</p>
<p>stating that he was &#8220;increasingly inclined to believe that, for wilful killing, we should put a 
</p>
<p>person against the wall&#8221;.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that those subject to the death penalty in 
</p>
<p>Belarus are being denied a fair trial,
 43 that the date and time of executions are not reported, 
</p>
<p>the bodies of the executed are not returned to relatives and the location of the burial site is 
</p>
<p>not disclosed.44  
</p>
<p>75. At its universal periodic review in 2010, Belarus accepted to respect minimum 
</p>
<p>standards with regard to the death penalty (see A/HRC/15/16, para. 97.23). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Freedom of opinion and expression  
</b></p>
<p>76. During the period under review, major legal changes further aggravated the situation 
</p>
<p>of the right to free expression and media pluralism, and repressions against independent 
</p>
<p>journalists and publishers continued. 
</p>
<p>77. The law on mass media has had a negative impact on freedom of expression on the 
</p>
<p>Internet; the authorities arbitrarily block websites containing information that they consider 
</p>
<p>is a threat to State interests. Several Internet sites were blocked on 19 December 2014, prior 
</p>
<p>even to the announced date of entry into force of the new legislation. Access was 
</p>
<p>permanently or temporarily cut to a great number of information websites (including 
</p>
<p>belapan.com, belapan.by, naviny.by, belaruspartisan.org, charter97.org, udf.by, 21.by, 
</p>
<p>gazetaby.com and zautra.by) without any reason given.45
 
 
</p>
<p>78. On 27 March 2015, Belarusian Internet providers blocked Charter97, 
</p>
<p>Belaruspartisan and Viasna, the most important civic news websites. The blocking notice 
</p>
<p>referred to Presidential Decree No. 60 of 2010.46  
</p>
<p>79. The amendments have also had an impact on traditional mass media. Distributors of 
</p>
<p>printed media, including bookshops, and broadcasters must register with the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Information. Other domestic legislation, such as criminal provisions and anti-extremism 
</p>
<p>laws, are being used to restrict freedom of expression. In particular, the Council of 
</p>
<p>Ministers adopted resolution No. 810 on 21 August 2014, in which it created an expert 
</p>
<p>committee on evaluation of information products for signs of extremism. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned about the potentially broad interpretations of &#8220;extremism&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;extremist materials&#8221; in the implementation of the resolution.47  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur also expresses concern at the ongoing attacks on journalists 
</p>
<p>of the independent print and Internet media who face arbitrary arrests, warnings and 
</p>
<p>criminal convictions, as well as administrative prosecutions.

<p>81. In the first half of 2014, the authorities arbitrarily detained at least 17 journalists. 
</p>
<p>Charges included &#8220;hooliganism&#8221;, while penalties included courts imposed fines and up to 
</p>
<p>10 days of detention.  
</p>
<p>82. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the State Secretary Committee continued to issue 
</p>
<p>warnings to Belarusian journalists for cooperating with media registered in a foreign 
</p>
<p>country, mostly on the grounds that they had worked without accreditation.48 In 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office issued warnings to six local freelance journalists because they worked 
</p>
<p>with foreign media outlets.49  
</p>
<p>83. On 2 December 2014, a freelance journalist, Andrei Myaleshka from Grodno, was 
</p>
<p>fined 6 million roubles &#8211; the third fine in 2014 for the &#8220;illegal exercise of journalism in 
</p>
<p>Belarus&#8221; &#8211; for his work with Radio Razyja, which broadcasts to Belarus from Poland.50 On 
</p>
<p>25 September 2014, Maryna Malchanava in Bobruisk was fined for the publication of an 
</p>
<p>article on the website of BelsatTV, a satellite television channel.51 Tamara Shchepetkina is 
</p>
<p>awaiting trial for similar charges.52 
</p>
<p>84. Despite the requests made for many years by both Radio Razyja and Belsat for 
</p>
<p>official accreditation of their journalists in Belarus, they have constantly received refusals 
</p>
<p>from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 4 September 2014, the Supreme Court prohibited 
</p>
<p>BelsatTV from using the trademark &#8220;Belsat&#8221; when broadcasting to the territory of Belarus 
</p>
<p>and on the channel website.53  
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur notes that, on 16 September 2014, police inspected the 
</p>
<p>apartment of journalist Ales Burakou and seized his computer equipment, reportedly in 
</p>
<p>response to the publication of an article by him on the website of broadcaster Deutsche 
</p>
<p>Welle without accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.54 
</p>
<p>86. In June 2014, the Representative on Freedom of the Media of the Organization for 
</p>
<p>Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), commenting on the court decision against 
</p>
<p>Andrei Myaleshka, expressed concern at the increasing number of fines imposed on 
</p>
<p>Belarusian journalists for work without accreditation.55 
</p>
<p><b>  J. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur notes that the authorities in Belarus have continued to adopt 
</p>
<p>further restrictions on public gatherings, including by broadening the definition of &#8220;mass 
</p>
<p>events&#8221;; establishing criminal liability for organizing such events in violation of the law; 
</p>
<p>new restrictions on where demonstrations may be held; and banning the dissemination of 
</p>
<p>information about public gatherings until the authorities have approved them.56  
</p>
<p>88. The broadening of the legal interpretation of mass events is a cause for grave 
</p>
<p>concern. For example, &#8220;unsanctioned events&#8221; that trigger administrative liability include

<p>distributing printed materials or carrying out photo shoots. A further restriction is the 
</p>
<p>requirement to complete an application process for such events. Individuals have often been 
</p>
<p>detained and fined for participating in unregistered events.57 There have also been reports of 
</p>
<p>cases of detention and prosecution for participating in previously approved events.58  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur notes reports that the authorities in Belarus banned more 
</p>
<p>than 10 peaceful assemblies scheduled for Human Rights Day 2014.59  
</p>
<p>90. On 27 July 2014, Aliaksandr Makaeu was detained by police officers for having 
</p>
<p>raised a white-red-white flag for the release of political prisoners during the public prayer 
</p>
<p>on Nezalezhnasci square in Minsk.60 In November 2014, on the traditional commemoration 
</p>
<p>day of <i>Dziady</i>, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Christian Party, Yuri Belenki, was 
</p>
<p>charged with having violated the prescribed procedure for the organization of processions, 
</p>
<p>despite the fact that the procession had been authorised by the Minsk city executive 
</p>
<p>committee.61 On 22 January 2015, some 15 people lit candles and laid flowers at the 
</p>
<p>monument of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko in Minsk. Participants were detained 
</p>
<p>and five people were sentenced to administrative arrests from five to 15 days.62 
</p>
<p><b> K. Freedom of association and human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>91. Since the establishment of the mandate on the situation of human rights in Belarus, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur has noted that, in Belarus, the right to freedom of association is 
</p>
<p>severely restricted in law and practice and that violations of that right have become 
</p>
<p>systematic.  
</p>
<p>92. At its universal periodic review in 2010, Belarus accepted various recommendations 
</p>
<p>relating to improving its observance of freedom of association and legal conditions for the 
</p>
<p>activities of civil society. Despite this, there have been no improvements with regard to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association in Belarus; indeed, since 2010, new legal acts and laws have been 
</p>
<p>adopted that restrict freedom of association and virtually disable civil activism.63  
</p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur commends Belarus for the amendments adopted on 20 
</p>
<p>February 2014 to the law on public associations and on political parties, which reduced the 
</p>
<p>number of founders from various regions required to establish a public organization, and 
</p>
<p>also increased requirements for their dissolution. However, these improvements hardly 
</p>
<p>compensate for the numerous administrative hurdles obstructing civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>from functioning.  
</p>
<p>94. Three main restrictions effectively cripple the right to freedom of association: the 
</p>
<p>permission-based rules on registration; the ensuing widespread refusal of registration; and 
</p>
<p>the criminalization of unregistered civil activities and funding. All public activities and 
</p>
<p>events require prior authorization by different government levels. The registration of a civil 
</p>
<p>society organization is a legal prerequisite for any activities conducted by it. Registration is

<p>permission- rather than notification-based, putting all decisions at the discretion of the 
</p>
<p>authorities. The process of applying for registration is also highly obstructive, involving the 
</p>
<p>requirement to meet a number of complicated and cumbersome administrative 
</p>
<p>requirements, lengthy procedures, lack of transparency, and the selective application of 
</p>
<p>laws and regulations. A common feature of these time-consuming and costly procedures is 
</p>
<p>that their unnecessarily strict requirements allow for a discriminatory refusal of registration 
</p>
<p>by the authorities. Civil society groups are repeatedly and arbitrarily denied registration on 
</p>
<p>various grounds, many of which not even mentioned in the relevant law or regulations. 
</p>
<p>95. As an illustrative example, in September and November 2014, the Department of 
</p>
<p>Justice of the Mahiliou Regional Executive Committee repeatedly applied to the Regional 
</p>
<p>Court for a suspension of the activities of the Mahiliou Human Rights Centre, which has 
</p>
<p>been engaged in human rights activities for 17 years. The reasons given were &#8220;failure to 
</p>
<p>provide documents required for the registration of changes regarding the legal address&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>that their actual office space was 0.3 m
2
 less than specified in the official documents. On 17 
</p>
<p>March 2015, the court resumed the consideration of the lawsuit filed by the Department of 
</p>
<p>Justice to close down the organization, and dismissed the case only after a new landlord 
</p>
<p>gave guarantees that he would provide a legal address.64 
</p>
<p>96. Participation in the activities of unregistered associations is criminalized by law, 
</p>
<p>under which persons involved in unregistered groups may be sentenced to up to two years 
</p>
<p>of imprisonment. In addition, unregistered non-governmental organizations are forbidden 
</p>
<p>from receive funding. The described cumulatively forbidding set of regulations is often 
</p>
<p>used for targeted harassment and persecution of human rights activists. In particular, laws 
</p>
<p>on taxation in relation to funding are used to bring criminal charges, as was the case with 
</p>
<p>Ales Bialiatski, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for administering 
</p>
<p>foreign funding for Viasna. 
</p>
<p>97. Administrative harassment, warnings and threats are routinely used to intimidate 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders with the aim to prevent them from carrying out their activities. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the recent expulsion of the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson of the Centre for Legal Transformation (LawTrend), Elena Tonkacheva, from 
</p>
<p>Belarus on 21 February 2015, and the ban on her re-entry to the country for three years. A 
</p>
<p>deportation order was issued against the human rights defender following the cancellation 
</p>
<p>of her residence permit on 30 October 2014 &#8211; an administrative decision based on alleged 
</p>
<p>speed limit violations reported while she was driving her car (see A/HRC/28/63/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 383).65 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that Viasna, one of the largest non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations in the country, has consistently been denied registration since 
</p>
<p>2003. 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur also notes the death threats received by Leanid Sudalenka, a 
</p>
<p>human rights defender in Gomel.66
 
The Special Rapporteur calls upon the authorities in 
</p>
<p>Belarus to conduct a full investigation into these death threats and to afford Mr. Sudalenka 
</p>
<p>protection as stipulated by the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.

<p>101. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms that Belarus must comply with its international 
</p>
<p>obligations concerning freedom of association and create conditions to guarantee that 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders may do their work in a safe and secure environment.  
</p>
<p><b> L. Elections 
</b></p>
<p>102. In the light of the forthcoming presidential elections due in 2015, it is particularly 
</p>
<p>worrying that the rights to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections are not 
</p>
<p>guaranteed in Belarus (A/68/276, para. 115). 
</p>
<p>103. Amendment to electoral laws to ban election boycotts were passed by the Council of 
</p>
<p>the Republic on 15 November 2013.67 The Special Rapporteur calls for the repeal of this 
</p>
<p>amendment and for a reform focusing on ensuring transparency and public participation, 
</p>
<p>and key preconditions for free and fair elections in the Electoral Code, in particular: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; A guarantee of independence of election commissions, including through their 
</p>
<p>pluralistic composition 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Transparent vote counting, including a detailed procedure for full and open 
</p>
<p>observation by election commission members and other stakeholders 
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur also highlights the fact that respect for the freedoms of 
</p>
<p>assembly, association and expression and the rule of law are the cornerstone of free and full 
</p>
<p>participation in democratic societies and the precondition for free and fair elections. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Trade unions 
</b></p>
<p>105. Belarus has for many years been advised to bring its legislative framework on trade 
</p>
<p>unions and strikes into line with the obligation to ensure the freedom of activity of trade 
</p>
<p>unions and the rights to strike, to organize and to collective bargaining.68 In the annual 
</p>
<p>Global Rights Index released on 19 May 2014 by the International Trade Unions 
</p>
<p>Confederation (ITUC), which rates working conditions in countries according to 97 
</p>
<p>indicators, Belarus ranked among the 24 &#8220;worst countries in the world to work in&#8221;, in 
</p>
<p>category 5 (&#8220;No guarantee of rights&#8221;).69 
</p>
<p>106. As in the case of associations, the registration and formation of trade unions is 
</p>
<p>impeded. Without registration, trade union activities are banned and the trade union itself 
</p>
<p>faces dissolution. At the 103rd session of the International Labour Organization (ILO), in 
</p>
<p>June 2014, the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, in an observation 
</p>
<p>on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), noted &#8220;with 
</p>
<p>deep regret&#8221; that, despite numerous requests by the ILO supervisory bodies, there had been 
</p>
<p>no tangible measures taken in this regard, and urged the Government to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>registration of trade unions in practice. It also took note of further allegations of anti-union 
</p>
<p>discrimination and interference in public sector enterprises (Granit and the Babruysk plant 
</p>
<p>of tractor parts and units) and requested information on allegations of violations of ILO 
</p>
<p>Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, including the denial of the right to hold pickets and 
</p>
<p>demonstrations, the deregistration of a primary trade union affiliated to the Radio and

</p>
<p>107.  Article 30 of Law No. 141-3 on municipal electric transport and the metro system, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 5 May 2014, forbids strikes in that transport sector. A similar provision was 
</p>
<p>included in amendments to the law on railway transport adopted in December 2014. 70 
</p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteur notes that Aliaksandr Varankin, Mikalai Zhybul, Aliaksandr 
</p>
<p>Hramyka and Aleh Shauchenka, members of the Belarusian Free Trade-Union who were 
</p>
<p>fired from the Babruysk plant of tractor parts and units, came before the Babruysk city 
</p>
<p>court on 18 December 2014 charged with participating in an &#8220;unsanctioned mass event&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(referring to the hunger strike). The judge fined them for their participation in it.71  
</p>
<p><b> N. Just and favourable conditions of work 
</b></p>
<p>109. On 15 December 2014, Presidential decree No. 5 on strengthening the requirements 
</p>
<p>for managers and employees of organizations was signed. The Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned that the decree introduces new disciplinary action and further grounds for 
</p>
<p>dismissal and suspension from work, and expands the grounds for early employer-initiated 
</p>
<p>termination of contracts.72 
</p>
<p>110. As noted by the mandate holder in previous reports, short-term contracts are the rule 
</p>
<p>rather than the exception in various sectors in Belarus. A large proportion of workers (up to 
</p>
<p>90 per cent &#8211; apart from public service and some industrial sectors) are in a precarious 
</p>
<p>situation, threatened with non-renewal of contract, in violation of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Such contracts subject workers to 
</p>
<p>pressure, threats and discrimination (A/HRC/26/44, para. 107).  
</p>
<p>111. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requested Belarus to revise 
</p>
<p>the system of short-term labour contracts, to abolish forced labour of persons with 
</p>
<p>substance addiction, to ensure the free exercise of rights of trade unions and to guarantee 
</p>
<p>social protection mechanisms (see E/C.12/ BLR/CO/4-6). Belarus should implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by the Committee and enshrine in its legal system the principle of 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination in employment on all grounds, in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>standards.  
</p>
<p><b> O. Forced labour  
</b></p>
<p>112. On 20 October 2014, the authorities in Belarus announced a plan to introduce 
</p>
<p>measures against sponging (<i>tuneyadstvo</i>).73 &#8220;Spongers&#8221; are labelled as those that either do 
</p>
<p>not work at all or do not work officially according to government data. A draft decree &#8221;on 
</p>
<p>stimulation of employment of citizens&#8221;, presented to the Council of Ministers on 19 March 
</p>
<p>2014, provides for taxes on all employable citizens who are not employed and punitive 
</p>
<p>measures against those who do not work.74 The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
</p>
<p>impact of such a scheme on vulnerable persons in society and its contravention of 
</p>

<p>conditions and to forced labour.  
</p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports of individuals who had been 
</p>
<p>forced to work in circumstances unrelated to their occupations or situations, including 
</p>
<p>conscripts, inmates in detention facilities and graduates. The general working population is 
</p>
<p>submitted to a system of <i>subbotniks</i> imposed by authorities. In theory, participation in such 
</p>
<p>work is voluntary, even though, in practice, non-participation results in negative 
</p>
<p>repercussions, such as the non-renewal of employment contracts and the revocation of 
</p>
<p>monthly bonuses (A/HRC/26/44, para. 112). 
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur recalls that ILO regards the prohibition of forced labour as 
</p>
<p>the cornerstone of international labour law. 
</p>
<p><b> P. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>115. Although the general principles of equality and non-discrimination are guaranteed 
</p>
<p>by article 22 of the Constitution, there is no specific anti-discrimination law or legal 
</p>
<p>provisions encompassing direct and indirect discrimination. A definition of discrimination 
</p>
<p>is found only in the Labour Code.75 As has been indicated in previous reports, courts do not 
</p>
<p>accept discrimination as a basis for lawsuits (see A/HRC/23/52, para. 96). 
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the authorities to develop a comprehensive anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination law in accordance with international standards.

</b></p>
<p>117. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called upon 
</p>
<p>Belarus to consider adopting a law on gender equality or comprehensive anti-discrimination 
</p>
<p>legislation, including a clear definition of all forms of discrimination against women, and to 
</p>
<p>put in place a comprehensive policy to overcome stereotypical attitudes about the roles and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society (see CEDAW/C/BLR/CO/7, 
</p>
<p>paras. 12 and 18 (a)). Participation in political and public life and in decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes, wage disparities, and access to the labour market on an equal footing are 
</p>
<p>recurrent challenges.76 
</p>
<p>118. With regard to policies to ensure gender equality, including within the framework of 
</p>
<p>the fourth National Plan of Action on Gender Equality (2011-2015), the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes the efforts currently under way, but also the recommendations made to the authorities 
</p>
<p>on increasing financial resources for the implementation of the Plan of Action and for the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of the National Council on Gender Policy (see CEDAW/C/BLR/CO/7, paras. 
</p>
<p>11-12).
 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>119. During the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence in 2013, Belarus launched 
</p>
<p>a nationwide public awareness campaign entitled &#8220;A house without violence&#8221; aimed at 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>preventing domestic violence.77 In its national report prepared for the second cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review, Belarus reported that a definition of domestic violence had been 
</p>
<p>introduced into the Law on Basic Actions for the Prevention of Crime adopted on 4 January 
</p>
<p>2015. The Special Rapporteur calls for the prompt adoption of the draft law on domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, which will provide for the rights of victims to assistance, protection and remedies.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>120. Efforts have been made for persons with disabilities, in particular with regard to the 
</p>
<p>accessibility of public infrastructure. Persons with disabilities continue to face physical and 
</p>
<p>regulatory barriers, and challenges with regard to access to education and employment, 
</p>
<p>including reasonable accommodation in the workplace, as well as stereotyping. 
</p>
<p>121. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the draft presidential decree on signing the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as reported in the national report 
</p>
<p>prepared for the second cycle of the universal periodic review, and encourages Belarus to 
</p>
<p>ratify the Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto.  
</p>
<p><b>3. Roma</b>  
</p>
<p>122. As raised by the Special Rapporteur in previous reports (see A/HRC/26/44, para. 
</p>
<p>125),
 
</p>
<p>discrimination faced by the Roma is widespread, including in the fields of 
</p>
<p>employment and education. Human rights defenders report having received complaints 
</p>
<p>from the Roma community with regard to cases of unreasonable and arbitrary detention by 
</p>
<p>law enforcement bodies.78  
</p>
<p><b>4. LGBTI persons  
</b></p>
<p>123.  Although same-sex relationships are not illegal in Belarus, homophobic discourse is 
widespread, including in the media. There is no law to protect sexual minorities from 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and homophobic violence is not considered a hate-based crime, even though 
</p>
<p>cases of harassment, discrimination and attacks against LGBTI persons are frequent 
</p>
<p>(A/69/307, para. 84).
 
In May 2014, a young man was attacked while leaving a gay club in 
</p>
<p>Minsk. As a result of the assault, he spent a month in a coma and suffered irreversible 
</p>
<p>injuries. The court convicted the assailant for involuntary homicide to two years and eight 
</p>
<p>months and refused to consider any circumstances of hate crime based on sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation, even though witnesses testified to the homophobic intent of the perpetrator.79 
</p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the particular challenges facing 
</p>
<p>LGBTI defenders, who suffer double discrimination and are frequent targets of violence 
</p>
<p>and abuse, including by law enforcement authorities (A/69/307, para. 84).
 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Persons living with HIV/AIDS 
</b></p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteur takes note of information on efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p>including on the fact that antiretroviral therapy is provided through State funds80 and that 
</p>
<p>harm reduction programmes have been introduced, including opiate substitution therapy.81 
</p>
<p>He also draws attention, however, to the need to prohibit discrimination and to repeal or 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS (E/C.12/BLR/CO/4-6, para. 24). 
</p>
<p><b> Q. Cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>126.  In his previous report, the Special Rapporteur raised concerns about the limited use of the 
Belarusian language in education and cultural life (A/HRC/26/44, para. 126). He is encouraged by the 
</p>
<p>increase in the use of the Belarusian language in public life. He notes for example that, on 21 January 
</p>
<p>2015, the Minister for Education reported on plans to foster the use of the Belarusian language in 
</p>
<p>education, including the teaching of geography and history in schools in Belarusian.82 In its annual 
</p>
<p>address in January 2015, the Constitutional Court spoke out in favour of publishing legislative acts in 
</p>
<p>both Russian and Belarusian. 83 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The findings of the Special Rapporteur during the period under review 
</b></p>
<p><b>revealed that there had been no significant improvement in the overall situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in Belarus since his previous report to the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, the conditions with regard to certain rights have further deteriorated as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>result of the adoption of new restrictive provisions, adding up to a long-standing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing regime of structural limitations to the enjoyment of the civil and political 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and the freedoms that are enshrined in the Constitution and in the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments of Belarus. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>The Special Rapporteur observes with concern a situation where Belarus 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches another presidential election without having addressed the shortcomings 
</b></p>
<p><b>in its human rights governance, which in the past had led to recurring violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>around such constitutive civic events.  
</b></p>
<p>129. <b> Besides the absence of cooperation with the mandate, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>notes that many recommendations made by United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>have neither been fully implemented nor followed up on. The shortcomings that lead 
</b></p>
<p><b>to persistent and systemic violations of human rights should be addressed promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>through swift and effective institutional responses in order to contribute to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening of the national human rights protection system. With this in mind, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take measures to implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensively all the recommendations made by the United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms </b>&#8211;<b> the treaty bodies, the special procedures, the universal periodic review, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and those made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>again reiterates his readiness to cooperate fully with the Government in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with his mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>In the light of the above situation, the recommendations made by the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur in his previous report to the Human Rights Council and in his reports to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the General Assembly remain valid. Building on those recommendations,</b>84<b> the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur wishes to add the recommendations below.</b> 
</p>
<p>131. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Belarus: 
</b></p>

</p>

</p>
<p> 84 See A/HRC/23/52, para. 119; A/HRC/26/44, para. 139; A/68/276, para. 118; and A/69/307, para. 93. </p>


<p><b>(a) Develop a national human rights plan of action to ensure follow up to 
</b></p>

<p><b>system, in broad consultation with all human rights-promoting civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, regardless of their registration status, and the general public. The plan 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be comprehensive in scope, reflect the interdependence and indivisibility of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, include specific timelines and benchmarks for implementation, and be 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on the close cooperation of the Government with Parliament, civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, the United Nations system and the international community for its 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation. The Government should also establish a consultative mechanism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as a national coordinating committee, open to civil society, to conduct the 
</b></p>
<p><b>process;</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish a national human rights institution in accordance with the

</b></p>
<p><b>Presidential Decree No. 6, and take further action to remove legal and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles to ensure the independence of the judiciary, in accordance with the Basic 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>(d) Repeal the amendments to laws on elections and referendums of 15

</p>
<p><b>(i) Create independent election commissions through pluralistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>composition;

<p><b>(ii) Ensure a transparent vote count in elections, including for its full and 
</b></p>
<p><b>open observation by election commission members and other stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Create space for effective and full participation in public life and 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision making processes, peaceful dissent and dialogue, by fully respecting the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as preconditions for free and fair 
</b></p>
<p><b>elections. To that end review, amend and repeal if necessary all laws, in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the international human rights mechanisms, with the aim 
</b></p>
<p><b>to comply with the Constitution and international standards;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(f) Repeal the recent provisions of the law on mass media that extend 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictions on freedom of expression to Internet-based media, and also repeal 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations that grant the Government powers to sanction content in the press or to 
</b></p>
<p><b>block Internet resources;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(g) Protect human rights defenders and journalists from harassment,

<p><b>and thorough investigation, prosecution and punishment of any such acts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Release all political opponents, human rights defenders and activists who 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been subjected to criminal charges without conditions, and ensure their full 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation, and cease using administrative and criminal charges in retaliation for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the exercise of their political and other rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Refrain from handing down death sentences and establish an immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its permanent abolition;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Develop a comprehensive anti-discrimination law in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards, addressing direct and indirect discrimination;  </b></p>


<p><b>(k) Amend or repeal legislation not in conformity with international labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards, including the right of workers to organize themselves, abolish forced and 
</b></p>
<p><b>involuntary labour, ensure the free exercise of rights of trade unions, and guarantee 
</b></p>
<p><b>social protection mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Broaden the scope of cooperation with the United Nations, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to undertake 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities reflecting all the recommendations stemming from the human rights system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Recognize and extend full cooperation to the mandate holder by
