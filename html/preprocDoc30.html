Summary of Facts
1. The Complainant, Michael Majuru (hereinafter called the Complainant), submitted this communication
against the Republic of Zimbabwe, (hereinafter called the Respondent State), a State Party to the African
Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter). The Complainant is a citizen of the
Respondent State and is currently residing in the Republic of South Africa.
2. The Complainant submits that the Respondent State has committed gross violations of human rights and
fundamental freedoms against him through acts committed by the Minister of Justice, Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs and the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) under the Office of the President and
Cabinet.
3. The Complainant alleges further that in committing the gross violations, the aforementioned
organisations, individuals and organs of the state were acting in the course and scope of their employment
as Respondent State's agents.
4. The Complainant submits further that his rights were abused because of his role as a presiding judge in
a case in which the Associated Newspaper Group of Zimbabwe (ANZ), a publishing house in the
Respondent State, sought to challenge, before the Administrative Court, the Respondent State's act on
banning ANZ from publishing its two newspapers, the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday. The
matter was lodged before the Administrative Court on or about 23rd September 2003 and he presided over
the matter.
5. The Complainant states that following his decision in favour of the ANZ, he became a target of human
rights abuses brought upon him by agents of the Respondent State and recounts the chronology of events
that depict incidents in which the Respondent State allegedly violated his human rights.
6. The first incident is reported to have occurred on or about 24th September 2003. It is alleged that the
Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, the Hon. Patrick Chinamasa invited the Complainant's
workmate, who was also a judge at the Administrative Court (Justice Chipo Machaka) to his office to issue
instructions that the matter relating to the ANZ case that was to be presided over by the Complainant
should be conducted in a manner that the said Minister was going to dictate. Justice Machaka was
instructed by the Minister to convey these instructions to the Complainant, with an order that Complainant
should comply with such orders.
7. It is further alleged that the Minister also instructed that the Administrative Court should delay the court
proceedings until February 2004, noting that the ANZ did not deserve impartial treatment by the Judiciary
because it was a front of western nations and 'other imperialists'. Secondly, Justice Machaka is alleged to
have been told that if the ANZ were granted its application for urgent appeal hearing and thereafter allowed
publication at that stage this would jeopardise continuing negotiations between ZANU PF and the
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), (the biggest opposition party in Zimbabwe), which according to
the Minister, had reached a delicate stage. As proof of this delicate relationship between ZANU PF and
MDC, Justice Machaka was shown a draft constitution agreed upon between the two parties and some
other supporting documents.
8. The Complainant submits that the he disregarded the aforesaid instructions and upon considering the
ANZ's application on its merits ruled in favour of the ANZ by granting the application for an urgent appeal
hearing on or about 27th September 2003. From 15th to 19th October 2003, the Complainant presided over
the appeal hearing between the two parties. He adjourned the matter for judgement to 24th October 2003.
9. Subsequently, the Complainant states that he was summoned by Enoch Kamushinda, a suspected
member of the CIO for a meeting at Kamushinda's office on 22nd October 2003. This information was
conveyed through another CIO operative with instructions that the Complainant should dismiss the ANZ
appeal. As a reward for dismissing the ANZ appeal, Kamushinda promised the Complainant a fully
developed farm in Mashonaland West Province.
10. The Complainant further states that on 23rd October 2003 at around 21:00 hours, the Minister of
Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hon. Patrick Chinamasa, telephoned and enquired from the
Complainant whether he had finalised the judgement in the ANZ matter and what decision he had reached.
The Complainant advised him that he was in the process of finalising the judgement and that he was going
to allow the appeal. The Complainant states that the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said
decision and further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant.
1

11. The Complainant claims that he went ahead to deliver the judgement in favour of ANZ at about 1600
hours on 24rd November 2003. Subsequently, at about 21:30 hours, Hon. Chinamasa in an angry
telephone call to the Complainant, accused the latter of pre-determining the matter and berated him for
delivering a judgement dictated by British agents and other imperialist forces.
12. Subsequently, the Media and Information Commission (MIC) appealed to the Supreme Court against
the decision of the Administrative Court. ANZ on the other hand decided to approach the Administrative
Court seeking an order that its original decision be rendered operative notwithstanding the institution of an
appeal by the MIC.
13. The Complainant claims that upon the lodging of this application by the ANZ, the Complainant was
placed under immense pressure from agents of the Respondent State urging him to desist from dealing
with the matter. The Complainant claims that the Respondent sent members of the CIO to track, trial and
monitor the Complainant's movements and interactions with other people.
14. The Complainant alleges that on several occasions he was approached by Ben Chisvo, a suspected
CIO informer, a former ruling ZANU PF Councillor of the City of Harare and also a war veteran. Chisvo
sought to persuade the Complainant to rescue himself from presiding over the matter, claiming that the
case was serious and sensitive and that President Mugabe did not want the ANZ to be registered. Chisvo
further indicated that the President had set up a team led by a senior assistant commissioner of Zimbabwe,
Changara, to monitor the proceedings in the ANZ matter and confirmed that the Complainant was being
monitored by state security agents.
15. On 23rd November 2003, at around 23:00 hours, the Complainant received a telephone call from
Chisvo in which he claimed that his car had had a puncture close to the Complainant's residence and
requested for assistance. Upon meeting the Complainant, Chisvo demanded to know whether the former
would preside over the ANZ matter or excuse him as previously ordered. The Complainant informed Chisvo
that he would be presiding over the ANZ matter.
16. The Complainant further alleges that, on 24th November 2003, following the Complainant's
postponement on the ANZ matter upon the request of the two parties to the case, he received a telephone
call from Hon. Chinamasa at around 21:00 hours. The Complainant states that the Minister alleged that he
had information linking the Complainant to British agents and other imperialists and that the Complainant
was under investigation for these alleged links with the British agents and imperialists. The Minister also
indicated that he was aware through his informants that the ANZ was going to succeed in the second
matter which was pending before the Complainant and advised him that the Minister of Justice had also
phoned her ordering her to meet him at his office the following morning. She informed the Complainant that
the Minister wanted to be advised on how the Complainant intended to decide the ANZ matter in order for
him to brief the Cabinet that morning. Soon after the telephone call from Justice Machaka, the Minister
telephoned the Complainant once again ordering that they meet the following morning at his office at 08:00
hours.
17. On 25th November 2003, the Complainant met with the Minister as instructed. The Minister wanted to
know what the Complainant's decision in the ANZ matter would be but the Complainant declined to inform
stating that he had not yet heard the parties' arguments on the matter and was therefore in no position to
know the outcome. The Complainant alleges that the Minister informed him that the Police Commissioner
Augustine Chuchuri had approached him previous night with information that the Complainant was under
investigation for colluding with British agents over the ANZ matter and was considering arresting him.
18. The Minister is also reported to have shown the Complainant the Herald newspaper which carried an
article on its front page alleging that the Complainant was under probe over the ANZ matter. The Minister
also produced an affidavit, which he said had been obtained from Chisvo by the Police Commissioner. In
the said affidavit, Chisvo had made statements to the effect that the Complainant had informed Chisvo that
the ANZ matter was predetermined.
19. The Complainant claims that as a result of such sustained and relentless pressure he had no other
option but to excuse himself from the matter. Notwithstanding the recusal, the Complainant remained under
surveillance by state security agents.
20. The Complainant states that on 1st December 2003, he received a telephone call from a member of the
legal fraternity and the Police informing him that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him
and that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the
Respondent's orders.
21. The Complainant alleges that fearing for his safety and security; he decided to go into hiding until 9th
December when he fled to South Africa, where he remains in exile.
2

22. The Complainant submits that he is not the only member of the Judiciary who has been persecuted but
that there is a systematic, consistent and sustained pattern of interference with the Judiciary by the
Executive in the Republic of Zimbabwe.

Complaint
23. The Complainants allege that Articles 3, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 26 of the African Charter on Human
and Peoples' Rights have been violated.
24. The Complainant requests that the African Commission should:1. Urge the Respondent State to institute an inquiry and investigation that should result in the
Government of Zimbabwe bringing those who perpetrated the violations to justice;
2. Order the Respondent State to pay compensation for the physical pain, psychological trauma, loss
of earnings and job and access to family suffered by the Complainant.

Procedure
25. The Communication is dated 2th November 2005 and was sent by email to the Secretariat, and was
received on 8th November 2005.
26. On 17th November 2005, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Communication and informed the
Complainant that the communication would be scheduled for consideration by the African Commission at
its 38th Ordinary Session.
27. At its 38th Ordinary Session held from 21st November to 5th December 2005 in Banjul, The Gambia, the
African Commission considered the communication and decided to be seized of it.
28. By Note Verbale dated 8th December 2005, the Secretariat transmitted a copy of the communication to
the Respondent State by DHL and requested it to forward its submissions on admissibility within 3 months.
The Complainant was also requested to send his submissions on admissibility within 3 months.
29. By letter and Note Verbale dated 20th March 2006, the parties to the communication were reminded to
forward their written submissions on admissibility of the communication.
30. On 3rd April 2006, the Secretariat received submissions on admissibility of the communication from one
Gabriel Shumba. By letter dated 12th April 2006, the Secretariat of the African Commission wrote to Gabriel
Shumba informing him that the communication had been brought before the African Commission by
Michael Majuru who had never made any indication to the African Commission that Gabriel Shumba could
make representations on his behalf. This letter was also copied to the Complainant Michael Majuru.
31. As at the 40th Ordinary Session there had been no reply from the Complainant. The communication
was therefore deferred to the 41st Ordinary Session pending the reply of the Complainant and Mr Shumba,
as well as the Respondent State's submission on admissibility.
32. By letter and Note Verbale dated 11th December 2006, written to the Complainant and Respondent
State respectively, the parties were informed by the Secretariat, about the decision of the African
Commission during its 40th Session, to consider the admissibility of the communication during its 41st
Session. The parties were asked to send their submissions on admissibility within 3 months of receiving the
letters.
33. The Complainant sent an email on 18th December 2006, confirming that Zimbabwe Exiles Forum to
which Gabriel Shumba is the Executive Director are his agents in the matter and that the Secretariat should
acknowledge submissions made by them.
34. By Note Verbale dated 4th January 2007, the Secretariat reminded the Respondent State of the
Commission's decision during its 40th Ordinary Session, and asked them to make their submissions on
admissibility within 3 months of receipt of the notification. Another reminder by way of a Note Verbale dated
10th April 2007 was also sent to the Respondent State.
35. On 24th April 2007, the Secretariat received the Respondent State's submission on admissibility. The
Respondent State's submission was forwarded to the Complainant by email and he was asked to make
additional submissions (if any), in order to address some important points which were raised by the
Respondent State in its submission.

3

36. During its 41st Ordinary Session, the African Commission decided to defer consideration of the
communication to its 42nd Ordinary Session for its decision on admissibility.
37. By letter ACHPR/LPROT/COMM/308/2005/ZIM/TN dated 20th July 2007 and by Note Verbale

the African Commission to defer consideration of the communication to its 42th Ordinary Session.
38. At its 42nd Ordinary session held in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, the Commission considered this
communication and decided to defer further consideration into the 43rd Ordinary Session due to lack of
time.
39. By Note Verbale of 19th December 2007 and letter of the same date, the Secretariat of the Commission
notified both panics of the Commission's decision.

Law
Admissibility
Complainant's submission on admissibility

40. The Complainant submitted that he has local standing before the African Commission as the
communication is brought by himself, a citizen of Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this matter.
Regarding compatibility, the Complainant submitted that the communication raises a prima facie violation of
the African Charter committed by the Respondent State. He submitted further that the evidence he has
submitted reveals that the communication is not based exclusively on news disseminated by the mass
media, adding that it is based on first hand evidence - including reports by reputable human rights
organisations.
41. On the exhaustion of local remedies, the Complainant submitted that the onus is on the State to
demonstrate that remedies are available, citing the Commission's decisions in the cases of 71.921 and
147.95-149.96,2 . The Complainant added that he remedy in his particular circumstance is not available
because he cannot make use of it that he was forced to flee Zimbabwe for fear of his life and that of his
immediate family. Because of his work as a judge of the Administrative Court. That he fled to the Republic
of South Africa following threats of arrest and unspecified harm by the Respondent State.
42. The Complainant drew the Commission's attention to its decision on 215.983 , where the Commission
held that a Complainant's inability to pursue local remedies following his flight for fear of his life to Benin,
and was subsequently granted asylum was sufficient to establish a standard for constructive exhaustion of
local remedies. He concluded by noting that considering the fact that he was no longer in the Respondent
State's ternary where remedies could be sought. And that he fled the country against his will due to threat
to his life; remedies could not be pursued without impediments.
43. The Complainant also challenged the effectiveness of the remedies noting that remedies are effective
only where they offer a prospect of success. He claimed the Respondent State's reaction to court rulings
that go against it is well documented by reputable international and African NGOs, noting that the
Respondent State treats court rulings that go against it with indifference and disfavour, and that he does
not expect that in his case, any decision of the court would be adhered to. He said there was a tendency in
the Respondent State to ignore court rulings that went against it and added that the Zimbabwe Lawyers for
Human Rights had documented at least 12 instances where the State had ignored court rulings since 2000.
He cited the ruling of the High Court in the Commercial Farmers Union, the Mark Chavunduka and Ray
Choto cases, where, in the latter case, the duo were allegedly abducted and tortured by the army. He
concluded that given the prevailing circumstances and the nature of his complaint and the Respondent
State's well publicised practice of non-enforcement of court decisions, his case had no prospect of success
if local remedies were pursued and according to him, not worth pursuing. Finally, the Complainant
submitted that he could not have exhausted local remedies as any such exhaustion would have to comply
with the States Liabilities Act which prevents the Complainant from suing the Respondent State after the
expiration of two months of the date of the incident complained of, no prior notice has been given.
44. The Complainant further submitted that the communication was submitted 22 months after the violation
because he hoped that the situation in the country would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies.
He said there is instead a deterioration of the situation and hope of improvement is highly unlikely in the
near future, adding that "continuing to wait whilst the Complainant is undergoing tremendous psychological
torture and suffering attributable to his persecution will undoubted cause irreparable harm". The
4

Complainant added that since he fled to South Africa he has been undergoing psycho-therapy and was not
in a position to submit his communication to the Commission.
45. The Complainant indicated other reasons that prevented him from submitting his complaint on time,
including the fact that the judiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily
speak out and take positions against the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have
left Zimbabwe because of persecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was
afraid for the lives of members of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him and
that he was unable to submit immediately for want of resources and facilities, noting that the submission
was made possible through the assistance and support of well wishers.
46. Finally, Complainant further submitted that the communication had not been before any other
international body for settlement as required by Article 56(7).
Respondent State's submission on admissibility

47. The Respondent State briefly restated the facts of the communication and indicated that it will attend to
the matters of fact, pertaining to the complaint "in order to put the communication in proper perspective".
The State submitted that the Complainant was appointed to the Office of Administrative Court President in
terms of Section 79
× 79 Judicial authority (1) The judicial authority of Zimbabwe shall vest in-- (a) the Supreme Court; and (b)
the High Court; and (c) such other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court as may be
established by or under an Act of Parliament. (2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall not be construed as
preventing an Act of Parliament from-- (a) vesting adjudicating functions in a person or authority other than
a court referred to in subsection (1); or (b) vesting functions other than adjudicating functions in a court
referred to in subsection (1) or in a member of the judiciary. [Section as substituted by section 10 of Act 30
of 1990 - Amendment No. 11] 79A Judiciary
The judiciary of Zimbabwe shall consist of-- (a) the Chief Justice, who shall be the head of the judiciary;
and (b) the judges of the Supreme Court; and (c) the Judge President and the other judges of the High
Court; and
(d) persons presiding over other courts subordinate to the Supreme Court and the High Court that are
established by or under an Act of Parliament. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11] 79B Independence of judiciary
In the exercise of his judicial authority, a member of the judiciary shall not be subject to the direction or
control of any person or authority, except to the extent that a written law may place him under the direction
or control of another member of the judiciary. [Section as inserted by section 10 of Act 30 of 1990 Amendment No. 11]
of the Constitution at Zimbabwe, read together with the Administrative Court Act. The State added that
while performing his functions as a Magistrate, Presidents of the Administrative Court are not judges, noting
that in essence, the Complainant was not a judge.
48. According to the State, the Complainant was supposed to be in a court in Bulawayo, but due to his poor
health and his relationship with the Minister of Justice, he was appointed to the Administrative Court in
Harare. The State noted that Complainant was a sick man throughout his whole duration at the court and
added that "in fact from the time of his appointment as a Court President, the Complainant used to travel to
South Africa to seek medical attention".
49. The State claims that Complainant applied for two weeks vacation from 9th to 31st December 2003 and
went to South Africa for medical attention. That he then tendered his resignation on 14th January 2004. The
State observed that even though the letter has a Zimbabwean address, an examination of the delivery slip
showed that it had been dispatched from South Africa. The State concluded that the above circumstances
which show how Complainant left the country do not amount to forced flight as he claims.
50. The State questioned why Complainant would take steps to regularise his absence from office by
applying for vacation leave and tender his resignation to the Minister who was threatening him. Without
producing any document title, the State added that it is apparent from the documents available that he was
maintaining dialogue with a government which he claims was persecuting him. The State observed further
that the letter of resignation even showed the address Complainant was residing and "assuming the
government of Zimbabwe really wanted his life, it would have used the address he had volunteered to track
him". The State concluded by stating that the truth is that [the] "Complainant was never threatened by
5

anyone, anywhere both within and outside Zimbabwe".
51. On the admissibility of the communication, the State argued that the communication be declared
inadmissible for non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter.
52. The State argued that the communication is not compatible as required by Article 56(2) of the Charter,
as it makes general allegations without substantiating, adding that, for a complaint to be compatible with
the Charter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter. According to the
State, the facts raised in the communication do not raise any violation of the Charter, noting that "basically
the facts and issues in dispute do not fall within the rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the
Commission".
53. On the exhaustion of local remedies under Article 56(5), the State submitted that local remedies were
available to the Complainant, citing section 24
× 24 Enforcement of protective provisions (1) If any person alleges that the Declaration of Rights has been,
is being or is likely to be contravened in relation to him (or, in the case of a person who is detained, if any
other person alleges such a contravention in relation to the detained person), then, without prejudice to any
other action with respect to the same matter which is lawfully available, that person (or that other person)
may, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), apply to the Supreme Court for redress. [Subsection as
amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (2) If in any proceedings in the High Court or
in any court subordinate to the High Court any question arises as to the contravention of the Declaration of
Rights, the person presiding in that court may, and if so requested by any party to the proceedings shall,
refer the question to the Supreme Court unless, in his opinion, the raising of the question is merely frivolous
or vexatious. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10] (3) Where in
any proceedings such as are mentioned in subsection (2) any such question as is therein mentioned is not
referred to the Supreme Court, then, without prejudice to the right to raise that question on any appeal from
the determination of the court in those proceedings, no application for the determination of that question
shall lie to the Supreme Court under subsection (1). [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of
1981 - Amendment No. 2] (4) The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction-- (a) to hear and determine
any application made by any person pursuant to subsection (1) or to determine without a hearing any such
application which, in its opinion, is merely frivolous or vexatious; and
b) to determine any question arising in the case of any person which is referred to it pursuant to subsection
(2);
and may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the
purpose of enforcing or securing the enforcement of the Declaration of Rights:
Provided that the Supreme Court may decline to exercise its powers under this subsection if it is satisfied
that adequate means of redress for the contravention alleged are or have been available to the person
concerned under other provisions of this Constitution or under any other law. [Subsection as amended by
section 20 of Act 23 of 1987 - Amendment No. 7 and by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]
(5) If in any proceedings it is alleged that anything contained in or done under the authority of any law is in
contravention of section 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 or 22 and the court decides, as a result of hearing the parties,
that the complainant has shown that the court should not accept that the provision of the law concerned is
reasonably justifiable in a democratic society on such of the grounds mentioned in section 16(7), 17(2),
19(5), 20(2) and (4), 21(3) or 22(3)(a) to (e), as the case may be, as are relied upon by the other party
without proof to its satisfaction, it shall issue a rule nisi calling upon the responsible Minister to show cause
why that provision should not be declared to be in contravention of the section concerned. (6) If in any
proceedings it falls to be determined whether any law is in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, the
Attorney-General shall be entitled to be heard by the court on that question and if in any such proceedings
any law is determined by the court to be in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, then, whether or not
he has exercised his right to be heard in those proceedings, the Attorney-General shall have the like right
with respect to an appeal from that determination as if he had been a party to the proceedings. (7) Where
any law is held by a competent court to be in contravention of the Declaration of Rights, any person
detained in custody under that law shall be entitled as of right to make an application to the Supreme Court
for the purpose of questioning the validity of his further detention, notwithstanding that he may have
previously appealed against his conviction or sentence or that any time prescribed for the lodging of such
an appeal may have expired. [Subsection as amended by section 9 of Act 15 of 1990 - Amendment No. 10]
(8) A written law may confer upon the Supreme Court powers additional to those conferred by this section
for the purpose of enabling the Supreme Court more effectively to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it
by this section. [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2] (9) A written
6

law may make provision with respect to the practice and procedure-- (a) of the Supreme Court in relation to
the jurisdiction and powers conferred upon it by or under this section; and (b) of subordinate courts in
relation to references to the Supreme Court under subsection (2);
including provision with respect to the time within which any application or reference shall or may be made
or brought. [Subsection as amended by section 13 of Act 25 of 1981 - Amendment No. 2]
of the Constitution of Zimbabwe which provides the course of action to be taken where there is human
rights violation. The State added that there is no evidence to prove that the Complainant pursued local
remedies. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, where one is engaged in acts that
violate the rights of another person, that other person can obtain an interdict from the court restraining the
violator from such act.
54. On the effectiveness of the remedies, the State submitted that the Constitution provides for the
independence of the judiciary in the exercise of its mandate in conformity with both the UN Principles on an
Independent Judiciary and the African Commission's Guidelines on the Right to Fair Trial.
55. The State dismissed the Complainant's argument that his case is similar to those brought by Sir Dawda
Jawara / The Gambia and Rights International (on behalf of Charles Baridorn Wiwa) / Nigeria, adding that
in the latter cases, there was proof of real threat to life, the State went further to indicate instances where
the government has implemented court decisions that went against it.
56. The State further indicated that in terms of Zimbabwe law, it is not a legal requirement for a
Complainant to be physically present in the country in order to access local remedies, adding that both the
High Court Act and the Supreme Court Act permit any person to make an application to either court through
his/her lawyer. The State added that in the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case, the victims were
tortured by State agents and they applied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom
and succeeded in their claim. The State concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing
remedies in a similar manner.
57. The State further submitted that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay
the Complainant his pension benefits and argued that the excuse raised by the Complainant of lack of
resources to enable him submit his complaint on time is therefore without merit adding that he could have
instructed his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on his behalf.
58. According to the State, the Complainant sought to mislead the Commission by claiming that under the
State Liabilities Act, claims against the State are prescribed within a period of sixty days. The State
indicated that section 6 of the Act is clear that the sixty days is in respect of a notice of intention to sue. The
Act prescribes that a summons against [the] State in certain matters must be delivered sixty days after the
notice of intention to sue, and according to the State, this would actually work well for the Complainant,
adding that the period of proscription of claims is three years and Complainant's claim was not yet three
years and thus not prescribed.
59. The State also submitted that the complaint does not conform to Article 56(6) of the Charter indicating
that the communication should be lodged within a reasonable time after exhaustion of local remedies, but
where Complainant realises that local remedies shall be unduly prolonged, he/she must submit the
complaint to the Commission immediately. According to the State, although the Charter does not specify
what constitute a reasonable time, the Commission should get inspiration from the other jurisdictions,
including the Inter-American Commission which has fixed six months as reasonable time, adding that even
the draft protocol merging the African Court of Justice and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights
provides for six months.
60. The State argued that the communication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which
according to the State "was filed well out of time". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking
psycho therapy treatment, the State argued that [the] Complainant had been the centre of attraction in
South Africa since 2004, demonising the Respondent State, adding that articles published by [the]
Complainant in the South African press do not show someone with a psychological ailment. The State
added that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert diagnosis of how such condition
was acquired. On [the] Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the State argued that he had his
pension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the Commission.
61. The State concluded its submissions by noting that "no cogent reasons have been given for the failure
to pursue local remedies or remedies before the Commission within a reasonable time", and as such the
communication should be declared inadmissible.

Competence of the African Commission

62. In the present communication, the Respondent State raises a question regarding the competence of the
African Commission to deal with this communication. The State avers that: "... basically the facts and
issues in dispute do not fall within the rationae materae and rationae personae of the jurisdiction of the
Commission". This statement thus challenges the competence of the African Commission to deal with this
communication. The Commission will thus, first deal with the preliminary issue of its competence raised by
the Respondent State.
63. Black's Law Dictionary defines rationae materae as "by reason of the matter involved; in consequence
of, or from the nature of, the subject-matter". While rationae personae is defined as "By reason of the
person concerned; from the character of the person".4
64. Given the nature of the allegations contained in the communication, such as allegations of violation of
personal integrity or security, intimidation and torture, the Commission is of the view that the
communication raises material elements which may constitute human rights violation, and as such, it has
competence rationae materae to deal with the matter, because the communication alleges violations to
human rights protected in the Charter. With regards to the Commission's competence rationae personae,
the communication indicates the name of the author, an individual, whose rights under the African Charter,
the Respondent State is committed to respecting and protecting. With regards to the State, the Commission
notes that Zimbabwe, the Respondent State in this case, has been a State Party to the African Charter
since 1986. Therefore, both the Complainant and the State have locus standi before the Commission, and
the Commission thus has competence rationae personae to examine the communication.
65. Having decided that it has competence rationae materae and rationae personae, the African
Commission will now proceed to pronounce on the admissibility requirements and the contentious areas
between the parties.
Decision of the African Commission on admissibility

66. The admissibility of communications before the African Commission is determined by the requirements
of Article 56 of the African Charter. This article provides seven requirements which must all be met before
the Commission can consider and declare a communication admissible. It one of the
conditions/requirements is not met the Commission shall declare the Communication inadmissible, unless
the Complainant provides justifications why any of the requirements could not be met.
67. ln the present communication, the Complainant avers that his complaint meets the requirements under
Articles 56 (1) to (4), (6) and (7). He admits that he did not attempt to comply with the requirement provided
under Article 56.5 dealing with the exhaustion of local remedies, but added that given the nature of his
case, and the circumstances under which he left the Respondent State, and is living in South Africa, the
exception rule under this sub-section of Articles 56, should be invoked.
68. The State on the other hand argues that the Complainant thus not complied with the provisions of
Articles 56(2), (5) and (6) of the Charter, and urges the Commission to declare the communication
inadmissible, based on non-compliance with these requirements.
69. The African Commission will thus examine each of the provisions under Article56 of the African Charter,
whether it is disputed of not, as the African Commission has a responsibility to ensure that every
requirement in Article 56 has been fulfilled before admitting a communication.
70. The requirements under Article 56 of the Charter are meant to ensure that a communication is properly
brought before the Commission, and seek to sieve frivolous and vexatious communications before they
reach the merits stage. Thus declaring a communication admissible does not mean the Slate Party
concerned has violated the provisions of the Charter. It simply means that the communication meets the
requirements necessary for it to be considered on the merits. As indicated earlier, for a communication to
be declared admissible, it must meet all the requirements under Article 56. Therefore, it a party contends
that another party has not complied with one of the requirements, the Commission must pronounce itself on
the contentious issues between the parties, as well as the non-contentious issues.
71. Article 56(1) of the African Charter provides that communications will be admitted if they indicate their
authors, even if they request anonymity. In the present case the author of this communication is identified
as Michael Majuru, he has also not requested that his identity be hidden. The respondent State has also
been cleared identified as the Republic of Zimbabwe. Therefore the provision of Article 56(1) has been
adequately complied with.

8

72. Article 56(2) of the African Charter provides that a communication must be compatible with the Charter
of the OAU (now Constitutive Act of the African Union) or with the African Charter on Human and Peoples'
Rights In the present communication, the Respondent State argues that the communication does not
comply with this requirement. The State asserts in this regard that, for a complaint to be compatible with the
Charter or the Constitutive Act, it must prove a prima facie violation of the Charter.
73. Compatibility denotes 'in compliance' or 'in conformity with' or 'not contrary to' or 'against'.5 In the
present communication, the Complainant alleges among others, violations of his right to personal integrity
and being subjected to intimidation, harassment and psychological torture lie alleges further that agents of
the intelligence service of the Respondent State constantly harassed him and prevented him from
exercising his duties freely. These allegations do raise a prima facie violation of human rights. In particular,
the right to the security of the person or personal integrity and the fight to work under satisfactory condition
as stipulated in the Charter. In the jurisprudence of this Commission, Complainants need not specify which
articles of the Charter have been violated, or even which right is being invoked, so long as they have raised
the substance of the issue in question. That, in the view of the Commission, has been established in this
case. Based on the above, the African Commission is satisfied that the requirement of Article 56(2) of the
African Charter has been sufficiently compiled with.
74. Article 56(3) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted if they are not written in
disparaging or insulting language directed against the State concerned and its institutions or to the
Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). In the present case, the communication sent by the
Complainant, does not, in the view of the, African Commission, contain any disparaging or insulting
language, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(3) has been fulfilled.
75. Article 56(4) of the Charter provides that the communication must not be based exclusively on news
disseminated through the mass media. This communication was submitted by the Complainant himself and
gives an account of his personal experience with the law enforcement agents of the Respondent State. As
a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(4) has also been met.
76. Article 56(5) of the Charter provides that a communication will be admitted only after all local remedies
have been exhausted. The Respondent State contends that the Complainant has not brought his case
before the courts of the State in compliance with this provision of the Charter. The State argues that there
are sufficient and effective local remedies available to the Complainant in the State, and the Complainant
has not sought these remedies before bringing the present communication before the Commission. On the
other hand, the Complainant argues that since he had to flee the country due to fear for his life, he could
not come back to the country to pursue these local remedies.
77. The rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies is to ensure that before proceedings are brought
before an international body, the State concerned must have the opportunity to remedy the matter through
its own local judicial system. This prevents the international tribunal from acting as a court of first instance,
rather than as a body of last resort.6
78. Three major criteria could be deduced from the practice and Jurisprudence of the Commission in
determining compliance with this requirement namely: the remedy must be available, effective and
sufficient.
79. ln 147.95-149.96, the Commission stated that "a remedy is considered available if the petitioner can
pursue it without impediment: it is deemed effective if it offers a prospect of success, and it is found
sufficient if it is capable or redressing the complaint". In 147.95-149.96, which both parties have cited, the
Commission held that "the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in
practice, failing which, it will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. ... Therefore, if the applicant
cannot turn the judiciary of his country because of fear for his life (or even those of his relatives), local
remedies would be considered to be unavailable to him".
80. The Complainant in the present communication on claims that he left his country out of fear for his life
due to intimidation, harassment and undue influence in the exercise of his duties. The Complainant has
also alleged a history of non-compliance with the orders of the court of the Respondent, and alleges that a
human rights NGO in Zimbabwe - the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, has documented 12 cases
since the year 2000, where the State has ignored court rulings that go against it. According to the
Complainant, it is noteworthy that although local remedies may be available in the Respondent State, there
is no assurance of its effectiveness or its implementation due to the fact that if the court rules in favour of
the Complainant, there is no guarantee that the ruling will be complied with by the State.
81. The Complainant cited the African Commission's decisions in the Jawara case and the cases of
Alhassan Abubakar v Ghana7 and Rights International v Nigeria8 in which he said the Commission found
9

that the Complainants in these cases could not be expected to pursue domestic remedies in their country
due to the fact that they had fled their country and were in fact residing outside their country at the time the
communications were brought before the Commission.
82. Having studied the Complainant's submissions, and comparing it with the above cases cited in support
of his claim, this Commission is of the opinion that the above cases cited by the Complainant are not similar
to his case. In the Jawara case for example, the Complainant was a former Head of State who had been
overthrown in a military coup. Mr Jawara alleged that after the coup, there was, "blatant abuse of power
by.... the military junta". The military government was alleged to have initiated a reign of terror, intimidation
and arbitrary detention. He further alleged the abolition of the Bill of Rights as contained in the 1970
Gambia Constitution by Military Decree No. 30/31, ousting the competence of the courts to examine or
question the validity of any such Decree. The communication alleged the banning of political parties and of
Ministers of the former civilian government from taking part in any political activity. The communication
further alleged restrictions on freedom of expression, movement and religion. These restrictions were
manifested, according to the Complainant, by the arrest and detention of people without charge,
kidnappings, torture and the burning of a mosque.
83. In the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission concluded that "the Complainant in this case had been
overthrown by the military, he was tried in absentia former Ministers and Members of Parliament of his
government have been detained and there was terror and fear for lives in the country. There is no doubt
that there, was a generalised fear perpetrated by the regime as alleged by the Complainant. This created
an atmosphere not only in the mind of the author but also in the minds of right thinking people that returning
to his country at that material moment, for whatever reason would be risky to his life. Under such
circumstances, domestic remedies cannot be said to have been available to the Complainant". The
Commission finally noted that, "it would be an affront to common sense and logic to require the
Complainant to return to his country to exhaust local remedies".
84. In the 103.93 case, it should be recalled that Mr Alhassan Abubakar was a Ghanaian citizen who was
arrested by the Ghanaian authorities in the 1980s for allegedly cooperating with political dissidents. He was
detained without charge or trial for over 7 years until his escape from a prison hospital on 19th February
1992 to Côte d'lvoire. After his escape, his sister and wife who had been visiting him in Côte d'lvoire, were
arrested and held for two weeks in an attempt to get information on the Complainant's whereabouts. The
Complainant's brother informed him that the police have been given false information about his return, and
have on several occasions surrounded his house, searched it, and subsequently searched for him in his
mother's village.
85. In the early part of 1993, the UNHCR in Côte d'lvoire informed the Complainant that they had received
a report on him from Ghana assuring that he was free to return without risk of being prosecuted for fleeing
from prison. The report further stated that all those detained for political reasons had been released. [The]
Complainant on the other hand maintained that there is a law in Ghana which subjects escapees to
penalties from 6 months to 2 years imprisonment, regardless of whether the detention from which they
escaped was lawful or not. On the basis of the above, the Commission held that "considering the nature of
the complaint it would not be logical to ask the Complainant to go back to Ghana in order to seek a remedy
from national legal authorities. Accordingly, the Commission does not consider that local remedies are
available for the Complainant".
86. In Rights International9 , the victim, a certain Mr Charles Baridorn Wiwa, a Nigerian student in Chicago
was arrested and tortured at a Nigerian Military Detention Camp in Gokana. It was alleged that Mr Wiwa
was arrested on 3rd January 1996 by unknown armed soldiers in the presence of his mother and other
members of his family and remained in the said Military detention camp from 3rd to 9th January 1996. While
in detention, Mr Wiwa was horsewhipped and placed in a cell with forty-five other detainees. When he was
identified as a relative of Mr Ken Saro −Wiwa he was subjected to various forms at torture. Enclosed in the
communication was medical evidence of Mr Wiwa's physical torture. After 5 days in the detention camp in
Gokana, Mr Wiwa was transferred to the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) in Port Harcourt. Mr Wiwa was
held from 9-11 January 1996, without access to a legal counsel or relatives, except for a five minutes
discussion with his grandfather. On 11th January 1996, Mr Wiwa and 21 other Ogonis were brought before
the Magistrate Court 2 in Port-Harcourt, charged with unlawful assembly in violation of Section 70 of the
Criminal Code Laws of Eastern Nigeria 1963. Mr Wiwa was granted bail, but while out on bail some
un-known people believed to be government agents abducted him and threatened his life by forcing him
into a car in Port-Harcourt. On the advice of human rights lawyers, Mr Wiwa fled Nigeria on 18th March
1996 to Cotonou Republic of Benin, where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees declared him a
10

refugee. On September 17th 1996, the US government granted him refugee status and he has been
residing in the United States since then.
87. In this case, the African Commission declared the communication admissible on grounds that there was
lack of available and effective domestic remedies for human rights violations in Nigeria under the military
regime. It went further to assert that "the standard for constructive exhaustion of domestic remedies is
satisfied where there is no adequate or effective remedy available to the individual. In this particular case,
Mr Wiwa was unable to pursue any domestic remedy following his flight for fear of his life to the Republic of
Benin and the subsequent granting of refugee status to him by the United States of America".
88. The present communication brought by Mr Michael Majuru should also be differentiated from Gabriel
Shumba v Republic of Zimbabwe10 . In the Shumba case, the Complainant alleged that, he, in the
presence of 3 others, namely Bishop Shumba, Taurai Magayi and Charles Mutama was taking instructions
from one of his clients, a Mr John Sikhala, in a matter involving alleged political harassment by members of
the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). Mr John Sikhala is a Member of Parliament from the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), which is an opposition party in Zimbabwe. At about 11:00 pm riot police
accompanied by plain-clothes policemen and personnel identified to be from the Central Intelligence
Organisation (CIO) stormed the room and arrested everyone present. During the arrest, the Complainant's
law practising certificate, diary, files, documents and cell phone were confiscated and he was slapped and
kicked several times by, among others, the Officer in Charge of Saint Mary's Police Station.
89. The Complainant and the others were taken to Saint Mary's Police Station where he was detained
without charge and denied access to legal representation. He was also denied food and water. The
Complainant claimed that on the next day following his arrest he was removed from the cell, a hood was
placed over his head and he was driven to an unknown location where he was led down what seemed like
a tunnel to a room underground. The hood was removed, he was stripped naked and his hands and feet
were bound in a foetal position and a plank was thrust between his legs and arms. While in this position,
the Complainant was questioned and threatened with death by about 15 interrogators. The Complainant
further alleged that he was also electrocuted intermittently for 8 hours and a chemical substance was
applied to his body. He lost control of his bodily functions, vomited blood and he was forced to drink his
vomit. The Complainant submitted a certified copy of the medical report describing the injuries found on his
body. Following his interrogation, at around 7pm of the same day, the Complainant was unbound and
forced to write several statements implicating him and several senior MDC members in subversive
activities. At around 7:30pm he was taken to Harare Police Station and booked into a cell. On the third day
of his arrest, his lawyers who had obtained a High Court injunction ordering his release to court were
allowed to access him. The Complainant was subsequently charged under section 5 of the Public Order
and Security Act that relates to organising, planning or conspiring to overthrow the government through
unconstitutional means. He then fled Zimbabwe for fear of his life.
90. In the above cases, there is one thing in common - the clear establishments of the element of fear
perpetrated by identified state institutions fear which in the 147.95-149.96 case, the Commission observed
that "it would be reversing the clock of justice to request me complainant to attempt local remedies".
91. In the communication under consideration however, Mr Michael Majuru alleges that he fled the country
for fear of his life, that he was intimidated and harassed by the Minister of Justice and by suspected state
agents. He also indicated that he received "a telephone call from a sympathetic member of the legal
fraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case against him and that he was to
be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for defying the Respondent's orders".
92. In this communication, it is clear that the Complainant has simply made general accusations and has
not corroborated his allegations with documentary evidence, sworn affidavits or testimonies of others. He
claims the Minister sent an Instruction through a colleague of his but there is no way of ascertaining this
fact. The applicant was the President of the Administrative Court, and has not show how the instruction
purportedly sent by the Minister through the Complainant's colleague, who the Commission is not told the
kind of influence he had over the Complainant, could have or did intimidate him. Apart from the direct
telephone call the Complainant claims he received from the Minister on 23rd October and 24th November
2003, all the alleged threats intimidations and harassment he claims, were perpetrated by persons he
suspects were government agents. Most of his allegations are unsubstantiated. For example, he indicated
in paragraph 2.5.4.7 of his submissions that "the Minister expressed his displeasure with the said decision
and further attempted to unduly influence and/or threaten the Complainant". He fails to show how this
attempted influence or threat by the Minister was carried out.

11

93. It is further observed by the Commission that the alleged threat or pressure claimed by the Complainant
to have been meted by Enoch Kamushinda, who the complainant himself refers to as a suspected Central
Intelligence Organisation (CIO) operative, has not been substantiated: neither has the purported pressure
and entrapment alleged to have been made by Mr Ben Chisvo who according to the Complainant, is a
suspected CIO informer. Furthermore, the Complainant alleged he received a telephone call from a
sympathetic member of the legal fraternity and the police that the Respondent State was fabricating a case
against him, and that he was to be arrested and incarcerated on unspecified charges as punishment for
defying the Respondent's orders. All the above allegations are not substantiated take the latter for example,
what if the "sympathetic member of the legal fraternity" was a hoax? What if he was acting on his own or
wanted to benefit from the misfortune of the Complainant? His or her name is not even known.
94. It is not possible for the Commission to determine the level of intimidation or harassment that is needed
to instil fear in a person to force that person to flee for their life. However, in the instant case, there is no
concrete evidence to link the Complainant's fear to the Respondent State.
95. It is therefore the opinion of the Commission that the Complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated
that his life or those of his close relatives were threatened by the Respondent State, forcing him to flee the
country, and as such, cannot hold that the Complainant left the country due to threats and intimidation from
the State.
96. However, the question is, having left the country, could the Complainant still have exhausted local
remedies or better still is he required to exhaust local remedies?
97. The first test that a local remedy must pass is that it must be available to be exhausted. The word
"available" means "readily obtainable", [/quote]"accessible"[/quote]11 ; or "attainable, reachable on call, on
hand ready, present; ... convenient, at one's service, at one's command, at one's disposal, at one's beck
and call"12 . According to the African Commission, a remedy is considered to be available if the petitioner
can pursue it without impediments or if he can make use of it in the circumstances of his case.13 In the
present communication, the question to be asked is whether there were remedies available to the
Complainant even from outside the Respondent State?
98. The State indicates that in terms of its laws, a Complainant need not be physically present in the
country in order to access local remedies, adding that both the High Court Act and the Supreme Court Act
permit any person to make an application to either court through his/her lawyer. In support of this, the State
cited the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka case where the victims were tortured by state agents and they
applied for compensation while they were both in the United Kingdom and succeeded in their claim. The
State concluded that the Complainant is not barred from pursuing remedies in a similar manner. The State
further argues that since his resignation, the government of Zimbabwe continues to pay the Complainant
his pension benefits which he could have used to instruct his counsel in Zimbabwe to attend to his claim on
his behalf.
99. The Complainant does not dispute the availability of local remedies in the Respondent State, but
argues that in his particular case, having fled the country for fear of his life, and now out of the country,
local remedies are not available to him.
100. The African Commission holds the view that having failed to establish that he left the country
involuntarily, and the view of the fact that in Zimbabwe law, one need not be physically in the country to
access local remedies; the Complainant cannot claim that local remedies were not available to him.
101. The Complainant argues that even if local remedies were available, they were not effective because
the State has the tendency of ignoring court rulings taken against it, citing among others, the High Court
decision in the Commercial Farmers Union and the Ray Choto and Mark Chavhunduka cases, and added
that the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights has documented at least 12 instances where the state has
ignored court rulings since 2000.
102. The Rules of Procedure of the African Commission provide that "the Commission shall determine
questions of admissibility pursuant to Article 56 of the Charter"14 . Generally the rules require applicants to
set out in their submissions the steps taken to exhaust domestic remedies. They must provide some prima
facie evidence of an attempt to exhaust local remedies. The Human Rights Committee has stated that the
mere fact that a domestic remedy is inconvenient or unattractive, or does not produce a result favourable to
the petitioner does not, in itself, demonstrate the lack of exhaustion of all effective remedies.15 In the
Committee's decision on A v Australia16 , it held that [quote]"mere doubts about the effectiveness of local
remedies or prospect of financial costs involved did not absolve the author from pursuing such remedies"17
. In Article 19 v Eritrea, the Commission held that "it is incumbent on the Complainant to take all necessary
steps to exhaust, or at least attempt the exhaustion of local remedies. It is not enough for the Complainant
12

to cast aspersion on the ability of the domestic remedies of the State due to isolated incidences". The
European Court of Human Rights on its part has held that even if the applicants have reason to believe that
available domestic remedies and possible appeals will be ineffective, they should seek those remedies
since "it is generally incumbent on an aggrieved individual to allow the domestic courts the opportunity to
develop existing rights by way of interpretation".18
103. From the above analysis, this Commission is of the view that the Complainant ignored to utilise the
domestic remedies available to him in the Respondent State, which had he attempted, might have yielded
some satisfactory resolution of the complaint.
104. Article 56(6) of the Charter provides that "Communications received by the Commission will be
considered if they are submitted within a reasonable period from the time local remedies are exhausted, or
from the date the Commission is seized with the matter ..." The Respondent State contends that the
present communication on was not submitted on time by the Complainant, as required by the African
Charter.
105. The present communication was received at the Secretariat of the Commission on 8th November 2005
(even though dated 2nd November 2005). It was considered for seizure by the Commission in November
2005, that is, two years after the Complainant allegedly fled from the country. The Complainant never
approached the courts of the Respondent State. He left the country in December 2003 and only seized the
Commission twenty two months later. The Complainant submits without substantiating that he had been
undergoing psychotherapy while in South Africa, and also indicated that he did not have the financial
means to bring the case before the Commission. He also stated that he had hoped the situation in the
country would improve to enable him utilise domestic remedies but there was instead a deterioration.
106. The Commission notes that the Complainant is not residing in the Respondent State and notes further
that the Complainant indicated that he was prevented from submitting his complaint on time, because the
judiciary abides by a code of conduct in terms of which they do not ordinarily speak out and take positions
against the establishment, noting that out of eight or so members who have left Zimbabwe because of
persecution, he is the only one who was speaking out. He added that he was afraid for the lives of
members of his immediate family that were at risk of persecution because of him.
107. The State on its part argues that "no cogent reasons have been given for the failure to pursue local
remedies or remedies before the Commission within reasonable time". The State submits that the
communication was submitted 22 months after the alleged violation, which according to the State "was filed
well out of time". On Complainant's submission that he had been seeking psycho-therapy treatment, the
State argued that Complainant had been the centre of attraction in South Africa since 2004 demonising the
Respondent State adding that articles published by the Complainant do not show someone with a
psychological aliment. The State added that no proof had been given of the alleged treatment or an expert
diagnosis of having such condition was acquired. On Complainant's claim that he had no resources, the
State argued that he had his pension benefits which he could have used to submit his complaint to the
Commission.
108. The Charter does not provide for what constitutes "reasonable period". However, the Commission has
the mandate to interpret the provisions of the Charter19 and in doing so; it takes cognizance of its duty to
protect human and peoples' rights as stipulated in the Charter. The provisions of other international
regional instruments like the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the
Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, are almost similar and state that they > 20 , after this period
has elapsed the Court/Commission will no longer entertain the communication.
109. The Commission is urged in Articles 60 and 61 of the Charter to consider as subsidiary measures to
determine the applicable principles of law "other general or special international instruments, laying down
rules expressly recognised by member states of the African Union." Going by the practice of similar
regional human rights instruments, such as the inter-American Commission and Court and the European
Court, six months seem to be the usual standard. This not withstanding, each case must be treated on its
own merit. Where there is good and compelling reason why a Complainant could not submit his/her
complaint for consideration on time, the Commission may examine the complaint to ensure fairness and
justice.
110. In the present communication, the arguments advanced by the Complainant as impediments for his
late submission of the complaint do not appear convincing. The complainant does not supply the
Commission with medical proof to indicate he was suffering from mental problems, he does not indicate
what gave him the impression that things might improve in Zimbabwe, alter he himself noted in his
complaint that since 2000 there has been documented evidence to show that things were deteriorating,

including the fact that the government does not respect court judgments. Even if the Commission accepts
that he fled the country and needed time to settle, or that he was concerned for the safely of his relatives,
twenty two (22) months after fleeing the country is clearly beyond a reasonable man's understanding of
reasonable period of time. The African Commission thus holds that the submission of the communication
was unduly delayed and thus does not comply with the requirements under Article 56(6) of the Charter.
111. Article 56(7) of the African Charter provides that the communication must not deal with cases which
have been settled by the States, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations, or the Charter of
the OAU or the African Charter. In the present case, this case has not been settled by any of these
international bodies, and as a result of this, the requirement of Article 56(7) has been fulfilled by the
Complainant.

Holding

The African Commission finds that in the present communication, that is, Communication 308/05 - Michael
Majuru/Zimbabwe, the Complainant has not complied with sub-sections (5) and (6) of Article 56 of the
African Charter, and thus declares the communication inadmissible.
Adopted at the 44th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights,
10th - 24th November 2008, Abuja, Nigeria.
