<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to El Salvador from 23 to 31 
August 2010. She held meetings with stakeholders in San Salvador and La Libertad. She 
thanks the Government of El Salvador for its hospitality and collaboration in organizing 
meetings with relevant Government officials and for its cooperation before, during and after 
the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In San Salvador, the Special Rapporteur met with the First Lady in her capacity as 
Secretary of the Secretariat of Social Inclusion and with Government ministers. She held 
meetings with representatives of the Office of the Attorney-General, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security 
(including the General Direction for Migration), the National Civil Police, the Procurator 
for the Protection of Human Rights, the Office of the Procurator-General, the Ministry of 
Public Health and Social Assistance, the Ministry of Governance (Direction of Public 
Spectacles, radio and television), the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Tourism, the 
National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children and the National 
Institute for the Advancement of Women.   
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with members of the Legislative Assembly 
(Commission for Family, Women and Children), the Supreme Court of Justice and the 
National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited three centres for children, including a protection 
centre and two detention centres, and a home for victims of trafficking, run by the National 
Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children, and the Attention Centre for 
Women, run by the National Institute for the Advancement of Women.  
</p>
<p>5. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur also met with members of civil society and 
the media, a representative of the national telecoms regulator (SIGET), and international 
technical partners in San Salvador. The Special Rapporteur thanks the United Nations 
country team for engaging with her on ongoing child protection issues and programmes in 
the country, and particularly the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator for its 
valuable assistance and support.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is also grateful for the opportunity to meet and have 
exchanges with children currently in care centres, non-governmental organization 
programmes and detention centres. 
</p>
<p>7. In a previous report (A/HRC/9/21), the Special Rapporteur identified the objectives 
of her mandate. With those objectives in mind, the aim of the visit was to explore the 
incidence of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in El Salvador and to 
examine the initiatives and measures taken by the Government and civil society to combat 
and prevent these phenomena, including by examining root causes and the child protection 
system in general.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur conducted her visit at a time of considerable domestic and 
international engagement and momentum regarding the issue of the rights of the child. The 
law on the comprehensive protection of childhood and adolescence was adopted in March 
</p><p>2009. At the international level, the situation in El Salvador had recently been reviewed by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child with regard to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child and the optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography (2010), the Human Rights Committee (2010), the Committee against Torture 
(2009), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (2008), and 
had been reviewed by the Human Rights Council under the universal periodic review </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4

</p>
<p>mechanism (2010). The Government also received a follow-up visit from the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against in women, its causes and consequences, in March 2010. 
The Special Rapporteur sought to provide assistance to the Government and civil society to 
implement, on the one hand, recent recommendations made by the above-mentioned 
mechanisms, and on the other, policies and programmes related to commercial sexual 
exploitation of children and the implementation of the new child protection law<i>. </i> 
</p>
<p>9. Throughout her visit, the Special Rapporteur solicited the views of all stakeholders 
regarding the situation of the rights of the child in the country and on the measures that had 
yielded success, as well as on those that needed to be strengthened, with a view to making 
targeted conclusions and recommendations to be followed up effectively by the 
stakeholders encountered.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Context 
</b></p>
<p>10. The internal armed conflict fought from 1980 to 1992 mainly between the 
Government (ruled by the right-wing party Partido de Conciliaci&#243;n Nacional) and leftist 
guerrilla units, led by the Frente Farabundo Mart&#237; para la Liberaci&#243;n Nacional (FMLN), 
was rooted in socio-economic inequalities and military repression.1 The conflict was 
brought to an end by the peace agreement of 16 January 1992, in which the Government 
and the FMLN indicated their intention to provide for military and political reforms to &#8220;end 
the armed conflict by political means as soon as possible, promote democratization of the 
country, guarantee full respect for human rights and reunify Salvadoran society&#8221;.2 
</p>
<p>11. After five consecutive presidential terms of the Alianza Republicana Nacionalista, 
voters elected an FMLN candidate and independent journalist, Mauricio Funes, as President 
on 15 March 2009, by a clear margin of 2.4 per cent, embracing his message of <i>cambio 
seguro</i>  (safe change).  
</p>
<p>12. Common crime and security are still significant challenges in El Salvador, rendering 
children vulnerable to a wide range of violence and illegal practices. Government officials 
attribute problems to the activities of <i>maras </i>(gangs) and have introduced initiatives that 
include the anti-gang act, approved by decree 158 on 9 October 2003, and the more recent 
anti-gang bill of September 2010, which renders gang membership illegal. The proliferation 
of small and light weapons is a major source of insecurity in El Salvador. It is estimated 
that 450,000 weapons currently circulate in the country. Indeed, the high number and 
availability of weapons in El Salvador exposes women and children to a higher risk of 
violence.  
</p>
<p>13. In 2006, 43.83 per cent of the country&#8217;s population was less than 18 years of age 
(51.13 percent boys and 48.87 per cent girls). The homicide rate in 2009 was 70.9 per 
100,000. The homicide rate for the 16-17 year-old age group is significantly higher, at 
153.8 homicides per 100,000 persons. Additionally, in 2009, 12.3 per cent of all homicides 
were of children. According to recent statistics, 44 per cent of the population has at one 
time been victim of a crime and tends to avoid public spaces. 
</p>
<p>14. According to some reports, one third of El Salvador&#8217;s population of 7,185,218 
currently lives in the United States of America, and accounts for approximately $70 billion 
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>in remittances. Movements of people, including children, across borders in Central America 
and through to the United States thus represents a significant reality. Salvadorian children 
have been smuggled to the United States also for the purpose of reuniting them with their 
parents, often through the use of &#8220;coyotes&#8221;<i>. </i>According to various stakeholders, in such 
circumstances, children are particularly vulnerable to falling into the hands of organized 
crime networks and can easily become victims of trafficking or other forms of commercial 
sexual exploitation. Another challenge is that, even if Salvadorian children are found en 
route, it is often difficult to reintegrate them into a comprehensive and protective 
environment back in the country, as the children themselves insist that they will try to leave 
again.  
</p>
<p>15. Following the financial crisis, the Government encouraged investment in the 
country. Investments were injected into the northern part of the country, including in the 
tourism sector and in the development of ecological projects. Policies focus on encouraging 
local tourism, technical assistance and training, and encouraging the growth of small 
enterprises, targeting Salvadorians living abroad.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>16. El Salvador is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the two 
optional protocols thereto, on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography3 
and on the involvement of children in armed conflict; the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Optional Protocol thereto; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto.  
</p>
<p>17. El Salvador is not a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
and the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization.  
</p>
<p>18. El Salvador has ratified the Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) and the Worst 
Forms of Child Labour Convention<b> </b>(No. 182) of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), as well as the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol). 
</p>
<p>19. A national committee to follow up on recommendations of international human 
rights mechanisms is currently being established. It will be composed of various 
institutions, including a national council of childhood and adolescence (to<b> </b>be established 
pursuant to the new comprehensive protection law), the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
representatives of municipal councils, the Secretariat of Social Inclusion, the Supreme 
Court and representatives of the legislative assembly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The Government recognizes the extradition of nationals on the basis of the second and third clauses of 
</p>
<p>article 28 of the Constitution. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>reported that the committee would have a consultative role and the capacity to formulate 
policies to follow-up on recommendations made by international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>20. At the regional level, El Salvador is a member of the Organization of American 
States and has ratified the Inter-American Convention on the International Traffic in 
Minors and the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication 
of Violence against Women.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation analysis  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p>21. Given the nature of the phenomena of the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography, the true scope of these practices in El Salvador is difficult to measure. 
Nevertheless, all stakeholders met by the Special Rapporteur stated that the phenomena of 
the sale of children, trafficking of children for sexual and for labour exploitation, child 
prostitution, child sex tourism and pornography were on the increase. The Office of the 
Procurator-General reported that, in 2005, there were 15 investigations into cases of 
trafficking in children, and 20 investigations in 2006. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
these statistics are not disaggregated by sex and by form of exploitation (for example, sale 
for purposes of economic or sexual exploitation).  
</p>
<p>22. The Government provided the statistics for the period from 2007 to September 2009 
in the table below:

</p>
<p><b>Total 47 4 Unspecified 68 37 4 220 9
</b></p>
<p>23. The number of child victims of trafficking reported by the National Institute for the 
Comprehensive Development of Children is almost three times the number reported by the 
Office of the Attorney-General<i>.</i> The figures reported by the Institute reflect the number of 
children admitted to its shelters and programmes, although these numbers exclude children 
who have not reported a crime or who have not been placed in such shelters and 
programmes. Of the 220 cases reported, only seven related to male children; the vast 
majority of cases involved adolescent girls of 12 to 18 years of age. With regard to 
prosecution, the Special Rapporteur highlights the fact that, of the 37 cases brought before 
the lower courts in 2008, only four actually led to conviction. 
</p>
<p>24. The substantial difference in the number of cases presented by each institution 
highlights the lack of reliable data about the extent of the problem. The Special Rapporteur 
observes that the information available is incomplete, and that the classification and 
definition of the information managed seems to vary from one institution to the other. The 
divergence in data available is due to the absence of a centralized, standardized information 
system that can also analyse trends and be available to and shared by all relevant </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>institutions. This divergence may also be explained by overlapping and links between the 
concepts of sex trafficking, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the 
worst forms of child labour and sexual slavery. 
</p>
<p>25. According to a variety of relevant actors, commercial sexual exploitation of children 
is still largely tolerated in El Salvador. There is no legal age of consent for sexual 
intercourse; the social perception tends to be based on whether the child&#8217;s body is &#8220;ready&#8221; 
for sexual intercourse rather than whether the child has reached 18 years of age. 
Furthermore, stakeholders repeatedly informed the Special Rapporteur that child victims of 
commercial sexual exploitation rarely report the crime owing to a variety of factors, 
including fear of reprisal from the perpetrator and a lack of confidence in the police and 
justice system. Other factors explaining low rates of reporting include limited knowledge of 
laws and the rights of the child, social tolerance for certain practices, local and regional 
organized crime networks, the weakness of mechanisms monitoring high-risk areas, such as 
cyber caf&#233;s, brothels and blind spots on borders, and the limited number of accessible 
complaint and reporting mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>26. Interestingly, the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights, the national human 
rights institution, reported that it had recently increased its attention to cases of trafficking 
and smuggling in persons, areas where complaint levels are low. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn that the General Directorate for 
Migration was working in collaboration with the National Civil Police and the Office of the 
Attorney-General on mapping trafficking routes with a view to better orient their work and 
tackle the issue of trafficking in persons, including children. The mapping exercise is 
intended to localize victims and perpetrators, as well as &#8220;hot zones&#8221; of trafficking in and 
around the country.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur recalls the numerous and interlinked factors making 
children vulnerable to sale and to sexual exploitation, such as prostitution and child 
pornography. Poverty, dysfunctional families, unemployment, social tolerance, gender 
discrimination, drug and alcohol abuse and a climate of insecurity (such as gangs), the 
transnational dimension of the phenomenon, easy access to information communication 
technologies, the level of organization of crime/trafficking networks (&#8220;coyotes&#8221;), the 
increase in regular and irregular migration flows, the proliferation of the tourism industry 
and the development of a market for the sex industry are all significant, daunting 
challenges.  
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, the physical, mental and social consequences on children are not 
sufficiently taken into account, owing to insufficient follow-up mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal and regulatory framework 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Constitution of El Salvador (1983) is the highest ranking legal authority (art. 
246). According to the Constitution, it is the duty of the State to ensure to its inhabitants the 
enjoyment of liberty, health, culture, economic welfare and social justice (art. 1). It 
guarantees the rights and freedoms of the person and the citizen, which are recognized, 
observed and protected by the State (art. 2). Furthermore, article 32 recognizes that the 
family is the bedrock of society and should enjoy State protection. The State promulgates 
the necessary legislation and establishes the appropriate bodies and services for the 
integration, welfare and the social, cultural and economic development of the family. 
Article 34 establishes the right of children to live in family and environmental conditions 
that allow for their integral development, which should be safeguarded by the State. Article 
35 recognizes that there will be special jurisdiction to process children and adolescents in 
conflict with the law.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>31. The law on the comprehensive protection of childhood and adolescence was adopted 
on 27 March 2009. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, only parts I and III of the 
law had come into force. The Special Rapporteur was informed that part II was scheduled 
to come into force in January 2011, to allow relevant stakeholders more time to ensure that 
the law could be implemented effectively.4 In addition to setting out certain rights, the law establishes a national, comprehensive child protection system (see paragraphs 67-73 
below). In October 2008, a new penal procedural code was approved, although its 
implementation was postponed a second time to January 2011. The code includes at least 
20 provisions relating to the protection of children and adolescents who participate in penal 
proceedings, either as victims or witnesses, with the objective of preventing the 
victimization of children.  
</p>
<p>32. Late in 2003, the Commission on the Family, Women and Children of the 
Legislative Assembly proposed reforms to the chapter of the Criminal Code dealing with 
sexual offences, to cover behaviour constituting forms of commercial sexual exploitation of 
children. In July 2004, criminal legislation and procedure were reformed in order to 
harmonize national legislation with the Palermo Protocol. The reform resulted in the 
introduction of the offence of trafficking in persons in article 367 (<i>b</i>) and of the related 
aggravating circumstances in article 367 (<i>c</i>). The offences of pornography and the use of 
minors in pornography were also introduced (Criminal Code, arts. 172 and 173). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>33. Article 367 of the Criminal Code provides that anyone who, on their own behalf or 
on behalf of a transnational organization, engages in the sale of persons for any purpose 
whatsoever will be liable to imprisonment for a term of four to eight years. If the sale 
involves Salvadorian women or children, the sentence may be increased by up to one third 
of the maximum applicable penalty. 
</p>
<p>34. Pursuant to article 56 of the new protection law, the sale and trafficking of children 
are considered to be a form of economic exploitation. The State has the obligation to 
eradicate all practices that affect the dignity and personal integrity of children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution  
</b></p>
<p>35. Numerous provisions of the Criminal Code cover the phenomenon of sexual 
exploitation of children. Article 170 of the Criminal Code, on &#8220;incitement to prostitution&#8221;, 
applies in certain circumstances, providing that anyone who, by coercion or by taking 
advantage of a situation of need, incites a person under 18 years of age to engage in or 
continue to practice prostitution will be liable to imprisonment for a term of two to four 
years. In other cases, the sexual exploitation of children may be classified as a form of 
coercion, covered under article 153 of the Criminal Code. It provides that anyone who, by 
means of force, compels another person to perform, tolerate or omit some action will be 
liable to imprisonment for a term of one to three years. 
</p>
<p>36. Inducement of a child younger than 18 years of age to engage in prostitution or the 
facilitation, promotion or encouragement of prostitution of a child under 18 years of age is 
punishable by imprisonment of a term of two to four years (art. 169). Furthermore, anyone 
who pays or promises to pay in cash or kind a person under 18 years of age or a third party 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Further to the partial enforcement of the law, two commissions were established, under the leadership 
</p>
<p>of the National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children, mainly to review the 
institutional mechanisms proposed in part II. As a result, in December 2010, a significant number of 
recommendations to review the law were presented to the President of the Republic, who forwarded 
them to the Legislative Assembly for review.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>to have the minor perform sexual or erotic acts is liable to imprisonment for a term of three 
to eight years (art. 169 (<i>a</i>)).  
</p>
<p>37. Child prostitution is also punishable as an aggravated form of trafficking in persons 
(articles 367 (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of the Criminal Code).  
</p>
<p>38. Article 55 of the new protection law provides that all children have the right to be 
protected from sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexual exploitation is defined as any form of 
sexual abuse for payment in cash or in kind, with or without an intermediary, and with or 
without the intervention of a pimp.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>39. Article 172 of the Criminal Code prohibits the dissemination, sale or exhibit of 
pornographic material to children under 18 years of age. Article 173 of the Criminal Code 
provides that the use of a child under 18 years of age for exhibitionistic or pornographic 
purposes or shows is punishable by a term of imprisonment of six months to two years and 
a fine of 30 to 60 days&#8217; wages. Possession of pornographic material featuring images of 
children under 18 is also prohibited and punishable by imprisonment for a term of two to 
four years (art. 173 (<i>a</i>)). 
</p>
<p>40. Article 55 of the new protection law provides that the use, procuring or offering of 
children for prostitution or for production of pornography should be considered cases of 
sexual abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Transfer or removal of organs of children for profit 
</b></p>
<p>41. The recruitment, transport, transfer, sheltering or harbouring of a child for the 
purposes of organ removal is considered &#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; and thus punishable by 
imprisonment for four to eight years (article 367 (<i>b</i>) of the Criminal Code).  
</p>
<p>42. Article 147 (<i>b</i>) prohibits the extraction and transplant of human organs or tissue 
without due authorization as required by the Health Code and<b> </b>is punishable by 
imprisonment for four to eight years. 
</p>
<p>43. The removal of human organs or tissue, for profit or not, is considered to be 
economic exploitation of children, pursuant to article 56 of the new protection law.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Trafficking in children 
</b></p>
<p>44. Article 367 (<i>b</i>) of the Criminal Code provides that anyone who, for the purposes of 
obtaining some financial benefit, recruits, transports, transfers, shelters or harbours persons, 
within or outside national territory, in order to engage in any activity related to sexual 
exploitation or to keep them in forced labour or service or practices similar to slavery, or 
for the purposes of organ removal, fraudulent adoption or forced marriage, is liable to 
imprisonment for four to eight years. Where the victim is less than 18 years of age, the 
offence is punishable by the maximum applicable penalty increased by up to one third of 
the maximum. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Adoption of children 
</b></p>
<p>45. Pursuant to article 194 II (1) of the Constitution, the Office of the Procurator-
General is required to protect the family as well as the persons and interests of minors and 
other persons without legal capacity.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was informed that amendments were being brought to the 
Family Code, the Family Court Procedure Act, the Office of the Procurator-General 
Organization Act and the Act establishing the National Institute for the Comprehensive </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>Development of Children. The amendments were being brought to ensure that the relevant 
institutions based adoption procedures on the best interests of the child; emphasized the 
right of the child to remain in his or her family of origin; gave preference to national 
adoptions over inter-country ones; provided accurate information and advice on adoption 
and its effects to those whose consent and agreement are required, and provided thorough 
pre- and post-adoption support; and spelled out the responsibilities of the officials involved 
in the process and establish an office to handle the administrative proceedings related to the 
adoption process (see paragraphs 53-56 below).5  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Juvenile Offenders Act, amended in 2006, sets forth measures relating to the 
placement of juveniles in conflict with the law. Courts and specialized branches of the 
judiciary that deal with minors have also been strengthened, and a social reintegration 
programme for juvenile offenders is being implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Unaccompanied minors 
</b></p>
<p>48. The General Directorate for Migration informed the Special Rapporteur about 
pending legislative proposals to the immigration law on care and assistance of 
unaccompanied migrant children. 
</p>
<p>49. Pursuant to a number of regional agreements, every child requires a passport to 
travel, as set out in the manual on rules and procedures for free movement in the region. 
The manual stipulates that, as of 1 August 2006, minors who are nationals of Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador or Nicaragua and who are travelling without their parents must have 
a valid passport, a special passport or a special travel document with a photograph, with 
authorization to leave the country signed by the child&#8217;s father or mother (if not present), 
duly certified by the competent authority.  
</p>
<p>50. The General Directorate for Migration reported that, in 2009, 7,000 Salvadorian 
children had been prevented from leaving the country by control mechanisms at land and 
sea borders.  
</p>
<p>51. While some agreements exist (for example with Mexico, regulating the date and 
time of repatriation of a Mexican minor arriving in El Salvador), the repatriation of 
unaccompanied minors arriving in El Salvador is currently not entirely regulated. Some 
measures are in place, such as receiving children in a special room at the airport, and 
establishing contact with the State of which the minor is a national. Nevertheless, most 
stakeholders insisted that clearer procedures were needed. According to the General 
Directorate for Migration, the law is currently being reviewed to include a section on the 
repatriation of unaccompanied children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>52. The National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children is the 
agency responsible for the protection of children. It currently carries out its work through a 
network of three regional and 10 local offices and provides shelter and care for victims by 
means of protection and prevention programmes. It runs a total of 12 protection centres and 
four social reintegration centres (for minors in conflict with the law), as well as a shelter for 
child victims of trafficking. In the community, the Institute provides psychosocial and legal 
services to child victims of crime and their families.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>53. Adoption procedures in El Salvador are handled collaboratively by the National 
Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children and the Office of the Procurator-
General<i>,</i> which both function as the central authority pursuant to the Hague Convention. 
The Office of the Procurator-General operates as the Public Defender of the State, and is an 
independent institution with a variety of functions. Its mandate includes &#8220;defending the 
family, people and the interests of minors and other people who have judicial incapacity&#8221;, a 
function performed by 17 assistant attorneys. It includes the Adoptions Bureau (of which 
the National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children is also a part), the 
Family Unit and the Unit for Psychosocial Assistance and Prevention.  
</p>
<p>54. The adoption procedure comprises an administrative stage followed by a judicial 
stage. During the administrative stage, the National Institute for the Comprehensive 
Development of Children assesses the child&#8217;s capacity to adapt and suitability for adoption. 
The procedure aims to investigate and assess the conditions and situation of children 
declared to have been physically or emotionally abandoned by their biological families, or 
children considered suitable for adoption because their families are not able to assure their 
welfare. The Office of the Procurator-General is responsible for assessing the capacity of 
those families wishing to adopt the child. Once a child is deemed &#8220;adoptable&#8221;, a placements 
committee within the Office selects an adoptive family, which must then be validated by a 
judge. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in recent years, family courts have given 
priority to national adoptions over international adoptions as a result of the foster family 
mechanism. A large majority of foster parents have tended to become the adoptive family.  
</p>
<p>55. The adoptions bureau of the Office of the Procurator-General reported that, in 2009, 
there were 159 adoptions, 110 of which were national. Of the 49 files for international 
adoptions, only 21 were completed, owing to administrative delays resulting from 
incomplete files.  
</p>
<p>56. Regarding law enforcement, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that, 
throughout 2011, 4,600 additional persons would be hired by the National Civil Police, 
which would then count a total of over 28,500 staff. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the increasingly decentralized methods of working, including by dispatching 
officers at the local level who are accessible to children within their communities. The 
police added that collaboration with the Office of the Attorney-General must be 
strengthened at the local level.  
</p>
<p>57. The Ministry of Tourism reported that there are approximately 400 tourism officers 
across the country who come under the jurisdiction of the National Civil Police. These 
officers are responsible for keeping order and providing tourist information and orientation, 
and serve as guides for citizens and tourists. However, there is no legal basis to allow 
tourist officers to inspect and monitor motels, hotels, restaurants and bars to detect cases of 
child sex tourism. If they do see a case, they may report it, and are involved in prevention 
activities.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also met with members of the National Institute for the 
Advancement of Women, who reported on a shift in the Institute&#8217;s operations since 2009, 
from providing direct care to child victims of commercial sexual exploitation to 
involvement in policymaking and, most notably, prevention of commercial sexual 
exploitation. The Institute increasingly collaborates with the Ministry of Education on the 
means of integrating a gender perspective into education and developing strategies to tackle 
the culture of sexism within schools. It is also involved in combating the culture of violence 
against women and girls. According to the Institute, a study conducted in 2007/08 on the 
profile of girl victims of commercial sexual exploitation showed that 80 per cent of girls in 
care and assistance programmes had been victims of sexual abuse or assault, often within 
the home. For this reason, the Institute insisted that combating commercial sexual 
exploitation, including child pornography, implied combating domestic violence. </p>

</p>
<p>59. Within the Supreme Court, a specialized unit monitors youth justice and has been 
implementing a plan to link community-based social services and comprehensive care 
programmes with juvenile criminal justice services for the enforcement of non-custodial 
sentences since 2008.6 In addition, measures taken by the Sala de la Penal of the Supreme 
Court include the installation of Gesell chambers, specialized training of forensic 
psychologists in child victim interviewing techniques, development of a specialized manual 
documenting crimes and offences related to child commercial sexual exploitation, and a 
guide for the use of Gesell chambers. The Special Rapporteur was also pleased to learn that 
health care is provided to child victims of sexual exploitation free of charge. 
</p>
<p>60. The Ministry of Labour provided information about the political will to eradicate the 
worst forms of child labour in El Salvador. In cooperation with ILO, the Ministry 
implemented a national strategic plan on the eradication of the worst forms of child labour 
(2006-2009). The policy of decentralizing services, at the heart of numerous national 
policies, including the national policy on youth, translated into the creation of seven new 
labour offices across the country. Additional work scholarships were granted, in 
collaboration with local authorities.  
</p>
<p>61. A temporary centre for foreign unaccompanied minors arriving to El Salvador was 
created in 2009 with the collaboration of the National Institute for the Comprehensive 
Development of Children. The centre serves as a shelter and provides temporary care and 
protection, with a view to repatriating children to their countries of origin. Despite a request 
by the Special Rapporteur to visit the shelter, scheduling and organizational issues 
prevented the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Inter-agency collaboration 
</b></p>
<p>62. A number of institutions are members of the Coordinating Commission of the 
Justice Sector (Technical Executive Unit), a permanent mechanism that develops policies in 
the area of justice. Institutions include the Office of the Attorney-General, the Office of the 
Procurator-General, the President of the National Judicial Council, the President of the 
Judiciary, and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. The Unit was heavily involved in 
the development of the new comprehensive protection law.  
</p>
<p>63. Three main institutional mechanisms currently work on issues relating to the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur: a working group (<i>mesa</i>) on commercial sexual 
exploitation of children was established in 2004, comprising 23 different institutions 
(Government and civil society) and coordinated by the Ministry of Labour; a committee on 
the worst forms of child labour, established in 2005, comprising representatives of State 
institutions, workers and the private sector; and the National Committee to Combat Human 
Trafficking, also established in 2005, and coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The Special Rapporteur did not meet with the members of the above-mentioned working 
group owing to organizational difficulties. 
</p>
<p>64. The National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking prepares the national plan of 
action to combat human trafficking; establishes priority areas to combat and prevent human 
trafficking and to rescue and provide services for victims; integrates and coordinates efforts 
aimed at investigating and preventing such crimes and provides services for the victims 
through national institutions and international organizations; and publicizes efforts to 
combat the practice.

</b></p>
<p>65. Recognizing that essentially the same institutions are represented in each of the 
above mechanisms, the Secretariat for Social Inclusion7 expressed the importance of 
redefining the institutional approach to tackling commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the new integrated child protection 
system pursuant to the new protection law would address previous incoherencies and 
duplication of efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Integrated system of child protection 
</b></p>
<p>66. The law on the comprehensive protection of childhood and adolescence defines the 
&#8220;integrated system of child protection&#8221; as a coordinated set of organs, entities or institutions 
(public or private), whose policies, plans and programmes have the objective of ensuring 
the full enjoyment of the rights of the child (art. 103). The system comprises, inter alia<i>,</i> a 
national council of childhood and adolescence, the National Institute for the 
Comprehensive Development of Children, <i>comit&#233;s locales</i> (local committees), <i>juntas de 
protecci&#243;n</i> (protection boards), the Office of the Procurator-General and the Procurator for 
the Protection of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>67. The new protection law foresees the creation of a national council of childhood and 
adolescence, which will be an autonomous institution with legal personality. The primary 
functions of the council will be the design, approval and monitoring of the national policy 
on the protection of children and adolescence (yet to be adopted), coordinating the national 
protection system, and effective advocacy for the rights of children and adolescents. At the 
time of the visit, the council had yet to be established. The First Lady stated that the 
Secretariat for Social Inclusion may serve as its Secretary.  
</p>
<p>68. The National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children would then 
be the implementing organ of the child protection system. In addition to promoting the 
national policy (yet to be adopted), the Institute is also responsible for developing 
protection, assistance and education for children whose rights have been violated or 
threatened; providing services for the implementation and monitoring of protective 
measures for children (upon judicial or administrative authority); and developing plans and 
preventive programs for the protection of children in their family and those in state care 
institutions (law on the comprehensive protection of childhood and adolescence, art. 180).  
</p>
<p>69. At the local level, the <i>comit&#233;s locales</i> will be responsible for implementing and 
disseminating national policy, developing local policies and plans for the rights of the child 
and reporting alleged threats and violations of the rights of the child committed by health-
care institutions and associations for the protection and care of children. 
</p>
<p>70. The <i>juntas de protecci&#243;n</i> are units to be created within each Department in the 
country, responsible for establishing and ensuring the implementation of administrative 
measures of protection of rights that are threatened or violated, as well as recording the 
protective measures ordered.  
</p>
<p>71.  A shared care network (<i>red de atencion compartida</i>) would also be created, to be 
led by the National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children, for the 
coordination of care and assistance services.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the above child-centred institutional initiatives. 
She encourages the Government to ensure that emphasis is placed on local efforts to detect 
and address violations of the rights of the child.

</p>
<p><b> 3. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>73. The national human rights institution in El Salvador is the Office of the Procurator 
for the Protection of Human Rights, which was established by the 1992 peace agreements. 
The Procurator was accredited with &#8220;A status&#8221; by the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 
2006.8 The Special Rapporteur met with, inter alia, the Procurator and the Deputy 
Procurator for Children&#8217;s Rights. There are four regional representations of the Office.  
</p>
<p>74.  The main functions of the Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human 
Rights include addressing cases of human rights violations (upon receipt of a complaint or 
on its own initiative); assisting victims of alleged human rights violations; formulating 
conclusions and recommendations; conducting inspections of prisons and detention centres; 
submitting proposals for new human rights laws and issuing opinions on draft laws 
concerning human rights; promoting, inter alia, the signature and ratification by the State of 
human rights treaties; and proposing measures to prevent violations of human rights. In this 
regard, the Office of the Procurator reported that it frequently collaborates with the Office 
of the Attorney-General and the National Civil Police. Complaints are often submitted to 
the Office of the Procurator by the National Institute for the Comprehensive Development 
of Children or by non-governmental organizations, following which the Office conducts an 
investigation. According to the Office, children themselves rarely submit complaints to it. 
In this regard, the Procurator informed the Special Rapporteur that the Office would like to 
increase training of personnel and adapt offices to be more child-friendly to encourage 
more children to submit complaints in a safe, protective environment guaranteeing their 
rights to privacy and confidentiality.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Policies and programmes to address the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policies to address the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>75. El Salvador adopted a national plan for the eradication of the worst forms of child 
labour (2006-2009), which included a strategic plan against the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p>76. In February 2010, the National Institute for the Comprehensive Development of 
Children presented a national policy for the comprehensive protection of children, yet to be 
adopted.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur learned of numerous national policies adopted since the new 
Government took office in 2009, such as the five-year national plan of development 
guaranteeing human rights (2009-2014), which includes national policies on  youth, 
women, security and social inclusion.  
</p>
<p>78. The national youth policy, adopted in August 2010, was the result of a national 
dialogue that included the participation of youth from 262 municipalities across the 
country. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the child rights-based approach of the policy 
and the participatory approach that led to its elaboration. 
</p>
<p>79. The Government has also adopted a national policy on combating trafficking in 
persons in 2008 and a national plan of action to combat trafficking in persons (2009-2012), 
the latter based on prevention, prosecution, protection and legislation. Members of the 
National Committee to Combat Trafficking in Persons with whom the Special Rapporteur

</b></p>
<p>met stated, however, that the plan of action has proven to be insufficient to adequately 
tackle the phenomenon. They noted that awareness of trafficking in persons as a crime was 
still relatively poor among the general public and that more vigorous efforts of 
communicating this message must be taken.  
</p>
<p>80. All stakeholders reiterated the need to strengthen institutions at the local level and 
their involvement in tackling commercial sexual exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consultative and participatory process 
undertaken among all relevant actors, including children, with a view to implementing parts 
of the new comprehensive protection law and recommendations made by international 
human rights mechanisms and to strengthening institutions implementing the national child 
protection strategy in 2011 at the central and local levels. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Investigation and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Office of the Attorney-General, which is part of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
undertakes penal investigations and prosecution. Represented in all departments across the 
country, its specialized units include the trafficking unit, a unit for minors and women, a 
support unit, a multidisciplinary team and a unit for minors in conflict with the law.  
</p>
<p>83. The trafficking unit covers prosecutions related to trafficking in persons (for labour 
or sexual exploitation), smuggling of persons and the transfer of organs. The unit for 
women and minors investigates crimes committed against women and children, including 
sexual abuse. Regional officers of the Office of the Attorney-General (there are 19 regional 
representatives) are trained in working with women and child victims of abuse, and in how 
to undertake investigations of child pornography. The unit works in close coordination with 
the National Civil Police. The Office is required to set up mechanisms to protect children 
from double victimization, by (a) taking evidence in advance of judicial proceedings, and 
(b) not calling victims to appear in court, in compliance with the Witness Protection 
Regime Act. 
</p>
<p>84. A major challenge for investigations into cases of child pornography is the gathering 
of evidence from Internet service providers who do not save information for very long. The 
Office of the Attorney-General reported that, by the time it requests saved data from the 
providers, that information had usually already been erased. Training of officers within the 
unit on detecting online child pornography and gathering of evidence has begun. A 
cybercrime unit is being established within the National Civil Police. The authorities 
regretted that they currently do not have jurisdiction to monitor cybercaf&#233;s.  
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern over information received that rates of 
conviction of offenders are low compared to the number of investigations conducted.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Assistance to child victims of exploitation and abuse  
</b></p>
<p>86. Hotlines are accessible to child victims or witnesses.  The National Institute for the 
Comprehensive Development of Children runs 12 protection centres and four detention 
centres for children in conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur visited a temporary crisis centre for children run and housed 
by the National Civil Police. She welcomed the child-friendly spaces, such as interview 
rooms, and the child rights-based approach to care. She was informed that the Police would 
like to open three more such centres across the country. In 2010, two additional centres 
were built: one in San Miguel, inaugurated in December 2010, and one in Santa Ana.  
</p>
<p>88. The shelter for girl victims of trafficking run by the National Institute for the 
Comprehensive Development of Children has a staff of 12, and can accommodate up to 15 
girls. The average age of the victims is between 14 and 16 years, and the average stay is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>about 9 to 10 months. Services provided include psychological assistance, schooling, sports 
activities and vocational training. The girls tend to stay at the shelter during the course of 
legal proceedings against traffickers. 
</p>
<p>89. Current assistance programmes visited by the Special Rapporteur face numerous 
challenges. Some stakeholders regretted the absence of a shelter for boys. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur heard repeated calls for increased diversity in activities available to 
child victims. While sports and leisure activities are offered, a greater number of options 
available to girls could encourage their development and creativity. Furthermore, 
vocational training offered is often not commensurate with the job market, making it 
difficult for girls to find sustainable employment once they leave. Lastly, stakeholders 
regretted that current assistance programmes tend to treat child victims as if they were in 
conflict with the law, needing to be placed in custody and protected. Stakeholders 
expressed the need to find alternative models of protection for child victims of trafficking 
for sexual exploitation, which may include keeping children within the community or with 
their families while still guaranteeing their safety. 
</p>
<p>90. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to a centre for girls run by the National 
Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children and to a detention centre for 
boys, she learned of increasing numbers of youths in conflict with the law. The main crimes 
committed by those currently in detention include extortion, homicide, drug possession, 
illicit association with criminal organizations and weapons possession. Challenges include 
the insufficient number of trained personnel to address the complex situation of these 
children, and the fact that families are often not or minimally involved in the lives of their 
children once they are placed in detention. Representatives expressed the need to find 
alternative placement for these youths in the community, with adequate psychological, 
medical and legal assistance. They also highlighted the need to increase the diversity of 
programmes available to those in detention, and encourage the creation of cooperatives and 
small businesses to stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit of the young.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur also visited the attention centre for women run by the 
National Institute for the Advancement of Women, which receives girls less than 18 years 
of age who are victims of sexual abuse or neglect. The centre, which operates as a 
temporary shelter, received 15 minors between January and August 2010, including three 
boys less than 4 years of age who came in with their mothers. Main causes included sexual 
abuse, neglect and domestic violence. The shelter has a capacity of 25, and adolescent girls 
often make up 60 per cent of shelter residents. There are five full-time staff members, three 
social workers and three support staff. Girls are often referred to the shelter by the Office of 
the Attorney-General, although girls sometimes check into the shelter themselves. For its 
part, the Institute often refers cases to the Office for criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p>92. One major challenge faced by the National Institute for the Advancement of Women 
is the fact that the shelter was designed to receive women victims of domestic violence; the 
model of care and assistance provided is not always tailored for girls under 18, as the centre 
does not turn girls away. Another challenge regards the follow-up and reintegration of 
women and girls after they leave the shelter, including finding appropriate and sustainable 
work opportunities. Furthermore, the shelter is the only one of its kind in El Salvador. The 
Institute Director reported that she had requested that more such shelters be opened, but 
funding was lacking.  
</p>
<p>93. Virtually all stakeholders declared that more shelters were needed to provide 
comprehensive, integrated services, offering a life project, treating the children as subjects 
of rights, and providing adequate psychosocial, medical and legal services. Such 
programmes must offer alternatives (varied activities and professional and vocational 
training) suited to the national labour market. Some civil society organizations are currently </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>developing guidebooks for assistance and care centres on how to design &#8220;life projects&#8221; for 
child victims of, inter alia, commercial sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>94. Several actors agreed that ensuring restitution for victims of crime was complex. 
The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear that the Government is reviewing the 
model for reparation of child victims of crime. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Prevention, capacity-building and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Prevention 
</i></p>
<p>95. The five-year national plan on development guaranteeing human rights (2009-2014) 
focuses on the fight against poverty and access to housing, as well as to education, health 
and decent work. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the plan, as it focuses on access to 
rights and creating conditions that can address the root causes of the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children. The Government has also embarked on a fight against corruption 
and impunity, which can lead to improvements in, inter alia, investigation and prosecution 
of offenders of commercial sexual exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p>96. Measures to encourage access to quality education could go a long way to 
addressing the situation of children vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation. The 
Special Rapporteur learned about two recent initiatives launched by the Ministry of 
Education. Firstly, the Ministry has encouraged the development of early childhood 
education by providing services for infants from age 0 to 3, in order to close the gap and 
provide services from birth until the age of 18. Secondly, as of 2011, there will be 22 
&#8220;inclusive schools&#8221; throughout the territory, which are public schools intended to 
accommodate all children, including disabled and gifted children, street and working 
children from linguistic, ethnic or cultural minorities and children from other disadvantaged 
or marginalized areas or groups. The Government hopes to establish 100 such schools 
across the country by 2015. More generally, the Ministry of Education informed the Special 
Rapporteur about seven pilot projects to increase coverage and quality of education across 
the country. They include increased distribution of educational material and the training of 
staff. The latter, which used to be provided by civil society on an ad hoc basis, is now 
provided by the Multidisciplinary Committee on Education.  
</p>
<p>97. The Ministry of Education&#8217;s initiative to ensure that each child in El Salvador 
receives school materials and school clothes has reportedly reached 1,300,000 children, and 
has reportedly led to a decrease in delinquency and an increase in enrolment rates . 
</p>
<p>98. One of the causes of school dropouts in El Salvador is early pregnancy; in 2009, 
there were reportedly 3,000 teenage pregnancies. While sexual and reproductive education 
exists in schools, the authorities admitted that they would like to see it strengthened, despite 
some opposition. In addition, greater efforts need to be made to raise awareness of teachers 
that pregnancy should not prevent girls from pursuing their studies. 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur also learned about research undertaken into commercial 
sexual exploitation carried out by the ILO International Programme on the Elimination of 
Child Labour as part of its subregional project on combating commercial sexual 
exploitation, and analysis of the demand for commercial sexual exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Capacity-building 
</i></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about numerous trainings offered to 
relevant officials, including the police, the National Institute for the Comprehensive 
Development of Children, teachers, tourism officers and hotel staff. She also welcomes the 
existence of a national school dedicated to training professionals and other actors working 
on child protection.  </p>

<p>101. All stakeholders expressed an urgent need for strengthened technical expertise on 
detecting and identifying cases of online child pornography, particularly in identifying 
children.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Awareness-raising  
</i></p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a large number of awareness-raising 
campaigns on commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking in persons, in schools and to 
professionals working in the area (teachers, Government officials, including of the 
Directorate General for Migration, the National Civil Police, the Office of the Attorney-
General and the Ministry of Tourism). Campaigns are undertaken by the media and by 
governmental departments in cooperation with civil society organizations on topics such as 
the rights of the child, trafficking and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>103. Efforts were also made to promote the rights of the child and human rights in 
general. The campaign entitled &#8220;Vamos a la Escuela&#8221; (&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to school&#8221;) (2009-2014) 
promotes the right of children to education. El Salvador receives human rights didactic 
materials and curricula as a result of an agreement with the Inter-American Institute for 
Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur learned that human rights are mainstreamed 
throughout the curriculum. Since 31 July 2010, El Salvador has shared experience and 
advice on how to teach and integrate human rights in education with Uruguay and Costa 
Rica.  
</p>
<p>104. The Government has also launched the Piensa (&#8220;Think&#8221;) campaign to raise 
awareness in schools about safe Internet use, and encourages teachers and parents to take 
and promote effective prevention measures in schools and homes. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Child participation 
</b></p>
<p>105. According to the Ministry of Education, school councils currently do not have 
parents or students represented. Youths at schools requested a forum through which they 
could participate and be heard. As a result, the Ministry is expected to review its policy 
regarding school councils to provide for child participation.  
</p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the process of consultation with children and 
youth in the elaboration of policies, particularly the national policy on youth. She was 
impressed by the participation of children in the audit and strategic planning undertaken in 
2009 regarding the work and functioning of the National Institute for the Comprehensive 
Development of Children. Children are involved in peer-to-peer education and awareness-
raising initiatives, as well as training on trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Complaints mechanisms / monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>107. Students are encouraged to use complaints boxes provided in all public schools in 
the event that their rights have been violated, including to report cases of sexual assault. 
The &#8220;step by step&#8221; campaign raises awareness about the need to denounce cases of violence 
within schools. The 911 hotline allows citizens to call in and report emergencies. 
</p>
<p>108. The National Civil Police also reported on a bureau at their offices that receives and 
follows up on complaints of violence within the family or of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>109. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur observes the absence of child-friendly 
complaint and reporting mechanisms at the local/municipal level that could allow children 
to report violations while guaranteeing their privacy and confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>110. As mentioned above, the Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human 
Rights receives and may submit complaints, inspects institutions, promotes the rights of the 
child and cooperates with key Government institutions and other national human rights </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>institutions in the region. Nevertheless, children are not represented, and accessibility by 
children to the institution is limited, and could benefit from increased information-sharing 
and local presences as well as increased human and financial resources.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>7. Involvement of the private sector </b></p>
<p>111. The Ministry of Tourism reported on a programme to improve the quality of services 
provided in the tourism sector, in cooperation with regional and international partners. 
More specifically, the programme aims to raise awareness of personnel in small- and 
medium-sized enterprises, such as tourism agencies, small hotels and tour operators, about 
the commercial sexual exploitation of children and trafficking of children. The objective is 
to encourage small- and medium-sized enterprises to sign on to a code of conduct to combat 
and prevent child sex tourism.  
</p>
<p>112. The Ministry of Governance informed the Special Rapporteur about an ethics 
committee within the National Advertising Council, composed of members of the media 
and of private enterprises, which decides which materials may be published and produced, 
and are thus tasked with self-regulating the industry. Furthermore, a media observatory is 
currently being established by the Ministry of Governance and the National Institute for the 
Advancement of Women. Among other things, the Observatory will be responsible for 
gathering and analysing statistics on the form and nature of programming and reporting.  
</p>
<p>113. The Internet is not currently regulated in El Salvador. While SIGET has the 
jurisdiction to regulate programmes on cable television, it does not have the legal 
jurisdiction to monitor and/or regulate Internet usage. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
is concerned that Internet service providers, mobile phone operators, search engines and 
other relevant private sector actors have not adopted a code of conduct and do not have the 
legal obligation to report violations, block access to sites, or retain material for a specific 
period of time for the purposes of investigation and legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>8. International and regional cooperation </b></p>
<p>114. The Police reported that collaboration with the International Criminal Police 
Organization (INTERPOL) is strong, and that collaboration with their police counterparts 
in the region is also quite strong, including regarding the sharing of information. The 
INTERPOL liaison officer of the National Civil Police reported that, in 2004, a working 
group to combat sexual abuse on the Internet in Latin America was created at the regional 
bureau of INTERPOL in San Salvador, and that the police officers all received training.  
</p>
<p>115. El Salvador has signed two bilateral memorandums of understanding on trafficking 
in persons, with: 
</p>
<p> (a) Mexico, on the protection of persons, especially women and children, who 
are victims of trafficking or smuggling (17 May 2005);  
</p>
<p> (b) Guatemala, on the protection of victims of trafficking in persons and migrant-
smuggling (18 August 2005). 
</p>
<p>116. A plan of action was elaborated under each memorandum envisaging joint measures 
for preventing and combating trafficking in persons and caring for victims, the three areas 
in which the phenomenon of trafficking must be addressed.  
</p>
<p>117. A regional conference was held in 2008 regarding legal gaps in repatriation, and 
highlighted the need for guiding principles.  
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur also met with key international technical partners in El 
Salvador. International partners have supported a regional project since 2003 on the 
prevention of commercial sexual exploitation, for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>Panama. Partners informed the Special Rapporteur that divergent national laws have posed 
challenges to an effective regional approach to tackling the phenomena. As a result, the 
Member States of the Sistema de la Integraci&#243;n Centramerica, the institutional framework 
of regional integration in Central America, which includes El Salvador, have encouraged 
harmonization of legislation related to commercial sexual exploitation of children and to 
share good practices. 
</p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur notes some challenges encountered by international 
technical partners in El Salvador with regard to coordination and sharing of information, 
and on how to cooperate with and integrate civil society in relevant initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the significant domestic momentum inside El 
Salvador to promote human rights, and particularly the rights of the child, including 
the mobilization and involvement of all relevant actors, reflecting a strong political 
will to improve the situation of children in the country. While the true extent of the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography remains unknown, the 
Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the consultative and integrated process involved 
in the adoption of the law on the comprehensive protection of childhood and 
adolescence and in the elaboration of the strategy, which aims to guarantee the rights 
of children at the national and local levels. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to pursue its efforts with a view to ensuring the full implementation of 
the law and the strategy in 2011. She is assured that every effort will be made in this 
regard.

and on the profile of buyers and clients of child prostitution and child pornography; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Increase information, consultation and participation of children in all 
matters affecting them. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Regarding the independent monitoring of the situation of children&#8217;s</b> <b>rights, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establish a child-friendly complaint mechanism guaranteeing safety and 
confidentiality, accessible at the local level, either within the Office of the Procurator 
for the Protection of Human Rights or as a separate mechanism; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure the representation and accessibility of children to the Office of 
the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights, in accordance with general 
comment No. 2 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Government should also continue efforts to strengthen the participation of 
children by expanding child-friendly spaces for the exchange of information and 
consultation, and systematically incorporate child participation in processes of 
designing and following up on activities, programmes and strategies relating to the 
rights of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Regarding allocation of resources, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure the allocation of sufficient human and material resources at the 
central and local levels; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>

<p><b> (b) Continue pursuing partnerships with the private sector, the United 
Nations and international donors, non-governmental and international organizations, 
in particular by building a concerted and coordinated partnership framework. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>Regarding corporate responsibility, the Government should continue to pursue 
partnerships with the private sector, particularly tourism and travel agencies, 
Internet service providers, telecommunication companies and banks, in all efforts to 
combat the sexual exploitation of children, including child sex tourism and the 
exploitation of children online by adopting a code of conduct.  
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>With regard to international and regional cooperation, the Government should 
also continue to pursue cooperation through technical and logistical assistance on 
themes such as combating cybercrime, trafficking and transnational organized crime 
by sharing information relating to the detection of crimes, the identification of child 
victims and the prosecution of offenders.
