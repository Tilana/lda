<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation noted that, after the founding of the Lao People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic 40 years ago, the implementation of the two strategic tasks of national 
</p>
<p>safeguarding and development had always had the ultimate goal of creating conditions for 
</p>
<p>the multi-ethnic Lao people to live in peace, freedom and prosperity so that they could fully 
</p>
<p>enjoy their human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. He reported that the Government had attached importance to the recommendations 
</p>
<p>made in the 2010 UPR review, highlighting that the national report, the outcome report and 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first UPR cycle had been translated into Lao and distributed 
</p>
<p>among government officials, stakeholders and the general public. The Government also 
</p>
<p>tasked the relevant line ministries and State organizations to implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations related to their respective roles and functions. Many of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations had been integrated into the Seventh Five-year National Socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>Development Plan 2011&#8211;2015, and were being implemented through laws, policies, 
</p>
<p>strategies and action plans. </p>


<p><b>4</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Government established the National Steering Committee on Human Rights in 
</p>
<p>2012, which led the preparation of the national report for the current review with the 
</p>
<p>participation of all relevant Government agencies. Stakeholder consultations were held with 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations, international non-governmental organizations and international 
</p>
<p>development partners. 
</p>
<p>8. He emphasized the fact that the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic had continued to 
</p>
<p>improve its governance and public administration to be more effective, transparent, 
</p>
<p>accountable and participatory and to provide better services to the people. The Government 
</p>
<p>was currently implementing the Legal Sector Master Plan on the Development of the Rule 
</p>
<p>of Law by 2020, taking into account the Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels. In 
</p>
<p>strengthening the rule of law, the National Assembly had adopted or amended more than 
</p>
<p>100 laws in the political, judicial, national defence, public security, economic, social, 
</p>
<p>cultural and environmental domains.  
</p>
<p>9. He further noted that the constitutional amendment process was transparent and 
</p>
<p>participatory. Inputs from the consultations were being studied and considered by the 
</p>
<p>National Drafting Committee. The final draft amended Constitution would be made 
</p>
<p>available for comments and inputs from the public.  
</p>
<p>10. The Government attaches importance to the prevention and combating of corruption 
</p>
<p>through the implementation of the Law on Anti-Corruption, other related laws and legal 
</p>
<p>instruments, particularly the decree on the declaration of assets for government officials at 
</p>
<p>all levels.  
</p>
<p>11. He added that most of the Millennium Development Goals had been achieved or 
</p>
<p>were on track to be achieved by the end of 2015, and that most of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first UPR cycle, especially those related to economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>such as the rights to health, education, food, housing, land, and the right to development 
</p>
<p>and poverty reduction, had been progressively realized.  
</p>
<p>12. He also emphasized that the Government had put in place a policy governing the 
</p>
<p>judicial sector in efforts towards ensuring the rule of law, equality before the law and the 
</p>
<p>court, due process of law and fair trial.  
</p>
<p>13. He highlighted that the rights to freedoms of expression, assembly and association 
</p>
<p>were guaranteed in the Constitution, laws and decrees. Violation of these fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms constituted a criminal offence punishable by the penal law. Likewise, freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief was also protected in the Constitution and laws, especially the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister&#8217;s Decree 92.  
</p>
<p>14. He stated that the Government had continued to improve prison conditions and 
</p>
<p>attached importance to training prison officials on international norms and principles 
</p>
<p>concerning prison management and the treatment of offenders.  
</p>
<p>15. He noted that the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities were 
</p>
<p>protected and promoted through the implementation of the relevant constitutional 
</p>
<p>provisions and specific laws, decrees, national stratergies and action plans.  
</p>
<p>16. He stressed that, in the national processes for making, applying and enforcing laws, 
</p>
<p>treaty obligations were taken into consideration and, in case of conflict between treaty 
</p>
<p>obligations and national legislation, the treaty obligation shall prevail.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government attaches importance to raising awareness of and disseminating 
</p>
<p>information concerning human rights treaties and the UPR recommendations, and to 
</p>
<p>developing the capacity of government officials and stakeholders to implement them.  </p>


<p>18. Moreover, the Government extended its goodwill cooperation by providing 
</p>
<p>information and clarification to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>respect of their queries, questions or issues of interest concerning human rights practices in 
</p>
<p>the country.  
</p>
<p>19. At the regional level, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic has contributed to the 
</p>
<p>development of human rights in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 
</p>
<p>terms of institution-building and standard-setting. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
</p>
<p>actively participates in the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, the 
</p>
<p>ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and 
</p>
<p>Children and has contributed to the drafting of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, the 
</p>
<p>ASEAN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and the ASEAN 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Children.  
</p>
<p>20. In addition to the institutionalized bilateral human rights dialogue with a number of 
</p>
<p>States, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic has exchanged views and experiences on 
</p>
<p>human rights with some other countries to share good practices on human rights 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>21. He added that, despite the achievements made, the country faced a number of 
</p>
<p>constraints and challenges, including unexploded ordnance, underdeveloped infrastructure, 
</p>
<p>natural disasters, disease outbreaks, limited human resources and budget constraints. 
</p>
<p>22. To overcome these challenges and constraints, the Government has set priorities 
</p>
<p>focusing on socioeconomic development and poverty reduction, the rule of law, the 
</p>
<p>improvement of governance, continuing efforts to achieve the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals, continuing efforts on unexploded ordnance clearance, the improvement of public 
</p>
<p>health service, education and the protection of women, children and other vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups. 
</p>
<p>23. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic is considering the ratification of additional 
</p>
<p>human rights conventions, including the International Convention for the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) and the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICRMW). 
</p>
<p>The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic will continue to disseminate information on human 
</p>
<p>rights and translate human rights obligations and commitments into national policies, laws, 
</p>
<p>strategies, programmes and projects. It will also consider inviting special rapporteurs to 
</p>
<p>visit on a case-by-case basis. An invitation will be soon sent to the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
</p>
<p>right to non-discrimination in this context to visit the country in the course of 2015.  
</p>
<p>24. He noted Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic&#8217;s candidacy for membership of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council for the period 2016&#8211;2018, highlighting that, if elected, it would do 
</p>
<p>its utmost to contribute to the effectiveness and efficacy of the Council, and would continue 
</p>
<p>to make concerted efforts to better the human rights of the Lao people.
