<p><b>  28</b>/&#8230;  <b>Birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition 
everywhere as a person before the law 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person 
</p>
<p>before the law, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other 
</p>
<p>relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the obligation of States to register all children, without discrimination of 
</p>
<p>any kind, immediately after birth, as provided for in the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
</p>
<p>Families and other relevant international instruments to which they are party, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of a human rights-based approach to birth registration, 
</p>
<p>based on international human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed to 
</p>
<p>promoting and protecting human rights, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
</p>
<p>other treaty-based bodies towards universal birth registration, such as through 
</p>
<p>recommendations widely addressed to States in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in which they call upon States to ensure the registration of all children immediately 
</p>
<p>after birth, and without discrimination of any kind, the most recent being Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 69/157 of 18 December 2014 and Council resolution 22/7 of 21 March 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of birth registration, including late birth registration and 
</p>
<p>provision of documents of proof of birth, as a means of providing an official record of the 
</p>
<p>existence of a person and the recognition of that individual as a person before the law, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that unregistered individuals may have limited or no access to 
</p>
<p>services and enjoyment of all the rights to which they are entitled, and taking into 
</p>
<p>consideration that registering a person&#8217;s birth is a vital step towards the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of all his or her human rights, and that persons without birth registration are 
</p>
<p>more vulnerable to marginalization, exclusion, discrimination, violence, statelessness, 
</p>
<p>exploitation and abuse, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that free birth registration and free or low-fee late birth registration are 
</p>
<p>part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital 
</p>
<p>statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies 
</p>
<p>intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development 
</p>
<p>goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the efforts made at the regional level to achieve universal birth 
</p>
<p>registration, including within the 2015&#8211;2024 Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Decade 
</p>
<p>for Asia and the Pacific, and the Decade on Civil Registration 2015&#8211;2024 in Africa, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that non-governmental organizations, professional associations, 
</p>
<p>media, the private sector and other members of civil society, including those involved in 
</p>
<p>public-private partnerships, can also contribute to the improvement and promotion of 
</p>
<p>community awareness of birth registration in a manner that reflects national priorities and 
</p>
<p>strategies, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the fact that, despite ongoing efforts to increase the 
</p>
<p>global rate of birth registration, approximately 230 million children under the age of 5 
</p>
<p>worldwide are still not registered, according to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reminds</i> States of their obligation to register births without discrimination of 
</p>
<p>any kind and irrespective of the status of the parents of the child, and also reminds States 
</p>
<p>that birth registration should take place immediately after birth, and that late birth 
</p>
<p>registration should be limited to those cases that would otherwise result in a lack of 
</p>
<p>registration; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition everywhere 
</p>
<p>as a person before the law,1 which documents the wide range of barriers to access to 
</p>
<p>universal birth registration, as well as the good practices adopted by States in fulfilling their 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure birth registration; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to establish or strengthen existing institutions at all levels 
</p>
<p>responsible for birth registration and the preservation and security of such records, to 
</p>
<p>ensure adequate training for registration officers, to allocate sufficient and adequate human, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>technical and financial resources to fulfil their mandate, and to increase, as needed, the 
</p>
<p>accessibility of birth registration facilities, either by increasing the number or through other 
</p>
<p>means, such as mobile birth registration officials in rural areas, paying attention to the local 
</p>
<p>community level, promoting community awareness and working to address the barriers 
</p>
<p>faced by vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities, in their access to birth 
</p>
<p>registration; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to take all appropriate measures to permanently store 
</p>
<p>and protect civil registration records and to prevent the loss or destruction of records due to 
</p>
<p>emergency or armed conflict situations; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to ensure free birth registration, including free or 
</p>
<p>low-fee late birth registration, by means of universal, accessible, simple, expeditious and 
</p>
<p>effective registration procedures, without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to raise awareness of birth registration continuously at the 
</p>
<p>national, regional and local levels, including by engagement in collaboration with all 
</p>
<p>relevant actors in public campaigns that raise awareness of the importance of birth 
</p>
<p>registration for effective access to services and the enjoyment of human rights; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to ensure that lack of birth registration or documents of 
</p>
<p>proof of birth does not constitute an obstacle to access to and the enjoyment of relevant 
</p>
<p>national services and programmes, in accordance with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> States to identify and remove physical, administrative, procedural and 
</p>
<p>any other barriers that impede access to birth registration, including late registration, paying 
</p>
<p>due attention to, among others, those barriers relating to poverty, disability, gender, 
</p>
<p>nationality, displacement, illiteracy and detention contexts, and to persons in vulnerable 
</p>
<p>situations; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Invites</i> States and other relevant stakeholders to work towards ensuring 
</p>
<p>universal birth registration through, inter alia, the exchange of good practices and technical 
</p>
<p>assistance, including through the universal periodic review and other relevant mechanisms 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> States to request technical assistance, if required, from relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes and other relevant stakeholders in 
</p>
<p>order to fulfil their obligation to undertake birth registration as a means of respecting the 
</p>
<p>right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes and 
</p>
<p>other relevant stakeholders to cooperate with States in providing technical assistance, upon 
</p>
<p>request, and calls upon them to ensure that persons with no birth registration are not 
</p>
<p>discriminated against in any of their programmes; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of international cooperation in supporting national 
</p>
<p>efforts to ensure universal birth registration; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to identify and actively pursue 
</p>
<p>opportunities to collaborate with the United Nations Statistics Division and other relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, funds and bodies, as well as other relevant stakeholders, in order 
</p>
<p>to strengthen existing policies and programmes aimed at universal birth registration and 
</p>
<p>vital statistics development, and to ensure that they are based on international standards, 
</p>
<p>taking into account best practices, and are implemented in accordance with relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations, and also requests the High Commissioner to prepare 
</p>
<p>a report on efforts made in this regard, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its 
</p>
<p>thirty-third session; </p>


<p>15. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue in accordance with its annual programme of 
</p>
<p>work.
