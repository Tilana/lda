<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/25, and the General Assembly, in its 
resolution 65/19, requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), in consultations with Member States and other relevant 
stakeholders, to launch preparations for the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary 
of the Declaration on the Right to Development. Within this framework, the Council, in its 
decision 16/117, decided to hold a panel during its eighteenth session on the theme &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>way forward in the realization of the right to development: between policy and practice&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and requested OHCHR to prepare a summary of the panel discussions for submission to the 
Working Group on the Right to Development at its twelfth session and to the Human 
Rights Council at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the panel 
</b></p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was held on 14 September 2011, in Geneva. The panel was 
moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council and opened by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. The panellists were Ariranga G. Pillay, Chairperson 
of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Virginia Dandan, independent 
expert on human rights and international solidarity; and Joseph K. Ingram, President/CEO 
of the North-South Institute, Canada. The presentations of the panellists were followed by 
an interactive discussion, which was divided into two slots of 60 minutes (45 minutes for 
comments and questions from the floor, followed by 15 minutes for comments and replies 
by panellists). The interactive discussion was opened by the Permanent Representative of 
Sri Lanka and newly appointed Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on the Right 
to Development, Tamara Kunanayakam. 
</p>
<p>3. The focus and objectives of the panel discussion were to enhance understanding of 
the contribution and potential of the Declaration on the Right to Development to thinking, 
policy and practice on development; to reflect on how the right to development could be 
implemented in the context of contemporary political, social, environmental and financial 
challenges; and to contribute to the shaping of future work on the effective implementation 
of the right to development. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Opening and contributions by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening statement, the High Commissioner recalled that the programme of 
commemoration of OHCHR for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development was premised on four simple messages: that development was a 
human right for all; that this right belonged to everyone; that it responded to contemporary 
challenges; and that all must act together in making the right to development a reality for 
everyone. Real development was about freedom from fear and freedom from want for all, 
without discrimination. Any successful development policy included a human rights 
approach that could shed light on critical vulnerabilities, clarify entitlements, duties and 
responsibilities of rights holders and duty-bearers, and delineate accountability mechanisms 
for actions and inactions. The constituent elements of the right to development were rooted 
in the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Rights and 
other United Nations instruments, and included the right to self-determination, to full 
sovereignty over natural wealth and resources, to participation, fair distribution of benefits, 
as well as to remedies for inequity. This right entailed a people-centred development policy 
for constant improvement of the well-being of all.  </p>


<p>5. The High Commissioner stressed that, in an interdependent world, it was imperative 
that all find solutions together and jointly commit to implementing them. While the primary 
responsibility rested with States, the realities of globalization demanded the engagement of 
all stakeholders. She announced that, in view of the need for policy coherence based on the 
holistic approach enshrined in the Declaration, and at the initiative of OHCHR, several 
agencies of the United Nations system and other international organizations had endorsed a 
statement in support of policy coherence in the implementation of the right to development 
(see annex). In conclusion, the High Commissioner expressed her hope that the panel 
discussion would help to bridge the gap between human rights and development in policy 
and in practice, and that the anniversary year would lead to renewal and revival of the 
commitment of all to the Declaration to live up to its promise and potential to raise millions 
from poverty to dignity.  
</p>
<p>6. The first speaker on the panel, Mr. Pillay, focused on how existing human rights 
mechanisms could contribute more actively to the realization of the right to development, 
the relevance of which was underscored by contemporary development challenges. 
Although the Declaration on the Right to Development did not itself create any legal 
obligations, it was a legitimate reference by which to hold Governments at least politically 
accountable as the international norm crystallized into law. Several elements of the 
Declaration found clear resonance with provisions in human rights treaties, and the 
relevance of the right to development to the work of treaty bodies was unassailable. 
Reiterating the twenty-fifth anniversary statement of chairpersons of treaty bodies, he 
highlighted the salient elements of the Declaration, including the holistic definition of 
development and the indivisibility of all human rights, and pointed to similarities and complementarities between the Declaration and the human rights treaties and reflected in 
related jurisprudence. The right to development could therefore be realized by adhering to 
international human rights standards, including the principles of non-discrimination, 
participation, accountability and transparency, which could be used to monitor progress 
towards the realization of the right to development by means of appropriate criteria, such as 
those being currently considered by the Working Group on the Right to Development. 
States parties to those treaties must live up to their obligations and implement the 
recommendations made by the treaty bodies so that the human rights situation at the 
national level was improved.  
</p>
<p>7. With regard to the international arrangements necessary to create a favourable 
environment for the realization of the right to development, Mr. Pillay cited the anniversary 
statement of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recalled that 
this right established a specific framework within which the duty to provide international 
cooperation and assistance had to be implemented. 
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Dandan cited the report of her predecessor, in which the value and significance 
of international solidarity in an interdependent world and how it may guide the progressive 
development of international law on human rights and international solidarity had been 
underlined. She went on to express her view of international solidarity as a bridge across 
differences and opposites, connecting to each other diverse peoples and countries with their 
heterogeneous interests, in mutually respectful, beneficial and reciprocal relations, imbued 
with the principles of human rights, equity and justice. While noting the varying opinions, 
including opposition to international solidarity, she expressed her belief that it was a human 
right, as well as her commitment to submit to the Human Rights Council a draft declaration 
on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity before the end of her term.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Dandan noted with appreciation the work of the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, and supported in particular the 
recommendations relating to pilot testing the right to development criteria with regional 
consultations and linking them to the universal periodic review. She also noted with </p>


<p>appreciation the background report of the High Commissioner submitted to the Social 
Forum and its emphasis on peoples&#8217; participation in development, and related this to her 
own experience on the right to development, especially in the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and in her own work with indigenous communities in the 
Philippines. Referring to the links between the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Declaration on the Right to Development and the all-important 
factor of people&#8217;s participation, she made specific reference to articles 1 and 2 of the 
Covenant and articles 1 and 2 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>10. After 25 years since the adoption of the Declaration, it was important to ask what 
efforts had been made to find out directly how the enjoyment of the right to development 
was experienced by people in the realities of everyday life. To move effectively from policy 
to practice, it was critical to listen to the voice of people, so that policy could be informed 
by their genuine participation, which was the essence of the right to development. Ms. 
Dandan referred to a bilateral project between the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission focusing on three selected 
indigenous communities in the Philippines and counterpart Maori communities in New 
Zealand. She supported the view that gaps in the implementation of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development could be filled by looking at good practices such as the above-
mentioned project. Many diverse territories were in the midst of great changes, and it was a 
formidable task to seek and highlight good practices that might not be formally labelled as 
human rights-based approaches to development, but nonetheless gave effect to the 
principles of the right to development. She found the locus of hope among peoples and 
individuals who could be, and in fact were, the primary agents of change, and who had the 
right to shape their own destiny. 
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Ingram commenced his presentation by introducing his organization, the oldest 
independent development think tank in Canada. He pointed out that implementing the right 
to development was no easy task, and that it was easier to affirm in principle than to apply 
in policies and resource allocation. His organization&#8217;s research focused on the identification 
of how a holistic vision of human rights and real world government resource decisions 
could best be reconciled. National policymakers would rarely seek decisions based on 
rights alone. Consultations with indigenous peoples had added political and financial costs 
to Government and private companies. In this context, free, prior and informed consent and 
the right to self-determination had been an important part of their research. In considering 
how this concept could be used to encourage active and meaningful participation, Mr. 
Ingram stated that mere consultations were not enough. In order to be more beneficial, the 
rights of indigenous peoples to say no to projects that affected them should be respected. 
Capacity strengthening of indigenous peoples was also crucial. He gave an example where 
guides were developed on the use of free, prior and informed consent and the participation 
of indigenous peoples, environment impact assessment, and benefit-sharing of the outputs 
of mining. In general, indigenous peoples were not against development, although 
development came in many forms. Some communities prioritize such small-scale projects 
as mining and farming, while others preferred large-scale ones, as long as their rights were 
upheld and they could share in the benefits. 
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Ingram further stated that corporate social responsibility alone was not sufficient 
to ensure responsible and sustainable development. His organization was also broadening 
its research to include private sector frameworks. North-South Canada was currently 
engaged in an expert project to measure quantitatively the progressive realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Results could be used by citizens to hold their 
Governments accountable. </p>


<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>13. Following the presentations by the panellists, the President of the Human Rights 
Council called on Ms. Kunanayakam to speak prior to other interventions from the floor. 
Ms. Kunanayakam stated that the dialogue should help to lessen the divide between policy 
and practice. Globalization created interdependence among States, hence the increasing 
need for international solidarity. The global economic, political and environmental crisis 
and their effects on developing countries had enhanced the need to cooperate, which was 
the essence of the right to development. There was a need for firm and time-bound 
commitments, resources and technical exchange between countries. Quoting Mahatma 
Gandhi who said that &#8220;poverty is the worst form of violence&#8221;, Ms. Kunanayakam stated 
that poverty must end through the creation of an appropriate environment to realize the 
right to development. The enjoyment of human rights was only possible if States created an 
enabling environment. International institutions should function in a transparent and 
accountable manner in close consultation with Member States. Human rights were 
universal, and the Human Rights Council had the responsibility to promote both economic, 
social and cultural rights and civil and political rights. OHCHR had a vital role to play to 
ensure equal treatment of both types of rights. Ms. Kunanayakam recommended that the 
Council should identify concrete ways and means to put policy into practice, especially in 
the removal of obstacles to the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>14. Several delegations acknowledged the work of OHCHR in relation to 
commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to 
Development. They shared the view that the anniversary was a cause for reflection of what 
had been achieved and what was still lacking, in both legal and practical aspects. The 
anniversary was the appropriate time to make an assessment and to rechart the challenge 
that lay ahead. In the face of the challenges posed by chronic political dynamics, the 
Declaration on the Right to Development gave a hint of how these challenges could be 
overcome. The Declaration provided a legal, political and moral instrument that could 
contribute to the achievement of global, sustainable development goals. Many of the 
elements in the Declaration were also contained in legally binding instruments, to which 
States parties were bound. There was a need to draw on the lessons of the 25 years since the 
Declaration was adopted in formulating actions for the future.  
</p>
<p>15. Reaffirming their commitments to the right to development, several delegations 
emphasized that the right to development was an overarching, umbrella right, needed to 
realize all other rights. The right to development offered the capacity for synthesis, in 
which civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on 
the other, could be implemented. The right to development was the foundation to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals and was an enabling framework for human rights and 
development in which international solidarity was essential. This right was also a right of 
nations, universal and an integral part of human rights. It was the most important right and 
must be given continued attention. Without codification of this right into a legally binding 
instrument and on a par with other rights, there would be a hole in its application.  
</p>
<p>16. A view was expressed in support of the right to development as a uniting rather than 
a dividing concept. There was a need for theoretical work to define and explain why the 
right to development was a universal right. Issues regarding the definition of the right to 
development should be adequately addressed and resolved first before discussing the issue 
of a binding legal instrument. Concerns remained with regard to the direction of 
discussions; for example, the discussions and the resolution on the right to development at 
the General Assembly should not include unrelated elements. 
</p>
<p>17. A question was raised about the prospects of political acceptability of the right to 
development. Some delegates supported non-binding standards and recommended that it </p>


<p>should be more operational through cooperation with the Human Rights Council and the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>18. It was stressed that, while the right to development was far from being 
operationalized and realized, the agenda remained highly relevant. Waves of changes 
arising from the global crisis and stirrings in the Arab world constituted challenges and 
must be responded to from a shared duty to cooperate to create favourable conditions for 
the right to development. Some delegations considered that the right to development 
contained principles to which all could subscribe, despite the changes arising from the 
global crisis. 
</p>
<p>19. Having noted the slow progress in the realization of the right to development, 
several delegations recommended that the international community should take concrete 
steps in both policy and practice. Achieving the right to development required collective 
action, and international cooperation was a key strategy and should provide an enabling 
environment. Despite progress, the implementation of the right to development was 
impeded by many factors that required joint efforts by the international community. The 
international community should support an enabling environment for development, 
including through the removal of obstacles to the realization of the right to development. In 
this regard, it was noted that pressures, sanctions, embargoes, conflicts and foreign 
occupation were all obstacles to the realization of the right to development and not 
conducive to helping countries to promote human rights and pursue sustainable 
development. 
</p>
<p>20. According to some speakers, financial and economic institutions had failed the 
world. There was a need for reform in global governance, transparency and accountability 
at the international level. Concerns of developing countries had to be heard in global 
forums. The prevailing economic order was unjust and exploitative in favour of developed 
countries, and the markets of advanced economies were largely inaccessible to poor 
countries. This situation had to be addressed through a global coordinated effort, involving 
particularly multilateral financial, trade and development institutions. Global partnerships 
for development should be strengthened among the United Nations, the private sector and 
civil society. It was also recommended that new financial mechanisms should be set up to 
fight poverty. 
</p>
<p>21. Speakers referred to the failure of aid policy and pointed to the need for a more 
pragmatic approach, the need to consider what should be the give-and-take in providing for 
development and how we provide for the poorest. Funding for development assistance is a 
policy tool in international cooperation. International aid programmes, debt cancellation, 
provision of loans and other social programmes should be implemented with due attention 
to the right to development. International development cooperation without conditionalities 
could strengthen international relations. South-South cooperation must also be addressed in 
the context of development assistance. Developed countries had to have the political will to 
provide resource and technical aid. Developing countries had to broaden their tax base, 
fight corruption and mobilize their resources to realize the right to development. The 
challenge was the unequal level of development within and between countries.  
</p>
<p>22. Some delegates argued that the right to development was not about charity but 
empowerment. States had the primary responsibility for their own economic development, 
and an enabling environment for the right to development had to be supported by a 
democratic Government. The right to development was an individual right, and it was only 
when all human rights are promoted and improved that the right to development could be 
realized. Good governance, the rule of law, anti-corruption measures and participation were 
important. While international cooperation was important, effective national policies at the 
national level were also crucial to create an enabling environment at the international level. </p>


<p>There was a need to turn commitments to actions at the national level. National economic 
development plans should be rights-based and human-centred. 
</p>
<p>23. Some speakers emphasized that the effective implementation of the right to 
development required multidisciplinary dialogue and policy coherence. Human rights are 
not the rewards of development but are rather critical factors in achieving them. Peace and 
security, development and human rights were all required. States had the right to 
international cooperation; development may be a right but it was not equivalent to 
economic growth. Sustained poverty reduction was required. Poor people should have 
power and voice, institutions had to create mechanisms for accountability and transnational 
mechanisms had to operate in transparency. 
</p>
<p>24. In order to eliminate discrimination, several delegations emphasized, the 
international community should focus on vulnerable groups, ensure equal dignity and 
eliminate politicization. Vulnerable groups should be placed at the centre of attention, 
especially when solving problems of inadequate security for citizens, lack of opportunities 
for young people and imbalances in domestic development. There was a need for a shared 
and equitable stake in the outputs of development. 
</p>
<p>25. Development was a right; its definition was elaborate and there was no need to re-
visit it. There was a need for affirmative action for States that had not achieved their 
development needs. Some delegations stressed that development should be multifaceted, 
inclusive, sustainable and equitable. Development should be seen as a citizen&#8217;s revolution 
</p>
<p>for a dignified life and the full satisfaction of all human needs. It should be comprehensive 
and involve the fair distribution of benefits, where the human person was the main 
participant and beneficiary.  
</p>
<p>26. Many speakers pointed out that the human person should be at the centre of 
development. Economic, social and cultural rights, on the one hand, and civil and political 
rights, on the other, were equally necessary for the right to development to be achieved. 
The indivisibility of all human rights and human beings should be at the heart of 
development since the aim was to improve their well-being. States had to invest in 
strengthening democratic processes and good governance, which integrate social inclusion. 
They should also invest in ensuring the progressive realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights and reduce poverty, including by means of collective international action. 
Making justiciable economic, social and cultural rights would contribute to the practical 
realization of the right to development and the Millennium Development Goals. There was 
a need to raise awareness among the population that they should be able to claim their 
rights. 
</p>
<p>27. Some delegates considered that the right to development should be the key priority 
of the work and object of more in-depth debates of the Human Rights Council with a view 
to identify essential elements in the development of public policies. The Council and 
OHCHR should advocate the incorporation of all human rights, including the right to 
development, in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This link should 
be realized even though the twenty-fifth anniversary being celebrated was also fraught with 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>28. Both national and international institutions shared the moral obligation to free 
people from poverty. Delegates pointed to the &#8220;lack of commitment&#8221; to the right to 
development by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and international 
financial institutions. Further thought had to be given to how to bring these organizations 
on board, especially when designing development programmes that integrated right to 
development considerations. The launching of an impact assessment exercise was 
suggested to measure the extent to which United Nations activities had incorporated the 
right to development. All relevant stakeholders were called upon to make recommendations </p>


<p>on how to better involve international organizations in solving the crisis in Africa and 
reaching the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>29. Expressing their support for the work of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, many delegations hoped that the Working Group would make progress in its 
deliberations on the future course of action aimed at the effective, meaningful and practical 
realization of the right to development. In this respect, calls were made for appropriate 
measures so that the right to development did not remain just a pious goal and subject to 
antagonism between North and South. A question was raised with regard to the steps that 
should be taken next to advance the right to development agenda.  
</p>
<p>30. Some speakers stated that it was important to build on the work of the high-level 
task force on the implementation of the right to development. The right to development 
could complement other rights and be made operational on the basis of the 
recommendations made by the task force. In this context, it was noted that, when further 
developing the criteria and sub-criteria, the rights of women should be reflected in the 
indicators, as should the balance between national and international responsibilities. The 
view was also expressed that the indicators warranted serious consideration. This exercise 
should not duplicate the work done by the World Bank and other international 
organizations with regard to the monitoring of the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Comments and replies by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>31. Responding to questions, Mr. Pillay stated that there were complementarities 
between the right to development and treaty bodies provisions. Many of the elements of the 
right to development were reflected in human rights treaty provisions; States that had 
ratified these treaties were bound to comply with them. In effect, they would need to 
comply with the right to development. Examples included the human rights principles of 
non-discrimination, transparency and accountability, as well as economic, social and 
cultural rights and civil and political rights. Some elements of the right to development 
were realized when human rights under international standards were realized. Minimum 
core obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights were needed to tackle issues 
of poverty, housing and health; when these obligations were met, the right to development 
would also be furthered. He added that corruption, poor governance and the absence of the 
rule of law were all barriers to the realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Dandan stated that the answer to questions lay in action, through the integration 
of human rights into policies and monitoring political responsibility. In a perfect world as 
much as in an imperfect one, political will and action were essential. She recommended that 
the right to development criteria developed by the high-level task force should be included 
in the universal periodic review. States should turn good words into good practices at the 
national level. This was not an easy task and would require concrete actions. The first step 
to address the theme of the panel was to look where good practices could be found. These 
good practices and models could be then studied and applied in other places. The right to 
development involved the integration of a human rights approach to development policy, 
implementation and evaluation, and the key lay in action. 
</p>
<p>33. Mr. Ingram referred to the need to have the World Bank and development 
institutions see economic, social and cultural rights as instruments of development. 
International solidarity was important in that it ensured the balance of national and 
international responsibilities. Multilateral solutions and cooperation were needed, 
especially at a time of global crisis when Governments were moving away from 
international cooperation and focusing more on the national level. This was a disturbing 
trend at a time when aid was most needed. He added that, given that the Millennium </p>


<p>Development Goals were global targets that dealt with averages and aggregates, the poorest 
and marginalized were not taken into account. There was therefore a need for other 
instruments to reach the poorest. The Millennium Development Goals were necessary but 
insufficient. In this context, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights was an important instrument. Even though the World Bank was not a signatory to 
the international instruments, its member Governments were, and they should influence the 
Bank to include the right to development. The primary contemporary challenge to the right 
to development was the intensification of demand for resources; for example, African 
countries rich in minerals were a target for exploitation. Resource-rich areas were usually 
inhabited by indigenous peoples, who were increasingly affected by the exploitation of 
those areas. There was a need for a win/win sharing of benefits among the Government, 
companies, indigenous peoples and local communities. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concluding remarks by the moderator 
</b></p>
<p>34. The moderator closed the panel discussion by thanking all present. She remarked on 
the importance of adhering to human rights standards, ensuring that the rights of vulnerable 
groups were promoted, the need to mobilize resources to enable participation and that free, 
prior and informed consent should be obtained by both Governments and business entities 
before commencing development projects. </p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement made by agencies of the United Nations system 
and other international organizations in support of policy 
coherence in the implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>As the United Nations family commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development, we reaffirm the vision of the 
Charter of the United Nations for a world in larger freedom, based on peace and security, 
development and human rights.  
</p>
<p>Since 1986, the Declaration has provided normative underpinnings for a human-
centred approach to development. Human development and human rights are embedded 
and reinforce each other conceptually and in practice, helping to secure the well-being and 
dignity of all people.  
</p>
<p>An effective global partnership for development, underpinned through human rights-
based policy coherence and coordination at all levels, is the very foundation for achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals in 
an equitable and sustainable manner.  
</p>
<p>Looking at development as a comprehensive process aiming to improve the lives of 
all peoples around the world our work is guided by key human rights principles of non-
discrimination, equality, participation, transparency and accountability, as well as 
international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>Recognizing the political commitments made in the 2010 MDG outcome document,a 
which reaffirms the importance of respect for all human rights, including the right to 
development, States also resolved to work together for the promotion of the economic and 
social advancement of all peoples. 
</p>
<p>The United Nations development system and its partners continue to embrace and 
promote this vision around the world by supporting the development of national capacities 
under the principles of national ownership and social, economic and environmental 
sustainability. We resolve to contribute to building resilient and responsive institutions and 
promoting policy coherence in the spirit of a meaningful global partnership for 
development. 
</p>
<p>Together, we are committed to carrying this vision forward and to making the right 
to development a reality for all.
