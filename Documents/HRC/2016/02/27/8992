<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health visited the headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline, one of the 
world&#8217;s leading research-based pharmaceutical companies, in June 2008 for substantive 
interviews with the company&#8217;s senior management. 
</p>
<p> In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous reports, he examined States&#8217; responsibilities in 
relation to access to medicines. However, enhancing access to medicines is a shared 
responsibility. The Millennium Development Goals recognize that pharmaceutical companies 
have a responsibility to improve access to medicines. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur outlines the responsibilities of pharmaceutical 
companies, including innovator, generic and biotechnology companies, with regard to the right 
to health in relation to access to medicines. From the perspective of the right to health, the 
Special Rapporteur reviews some GlaxoSmithKline policies regarding access to medicines, 
especially in relation to developing countries. Besides highlighting some good practices, the 
Special Rapporteur outlines some of the obstacles impeding the company&#8217;s attempts to improve 
access, such as failing health systems, and makes numerous recommendations addressed to 
GlaxoSmithKline, pharmaceutical companies in general, States and others. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is most grateful to GlaxoSmithKline management for inviting him 
to prepare the present report and for their cooperation throughout the mission. </p>

<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to  
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health on  
                          his mission to GlaxoSmithKline 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Constitution of the World Health Organisation (WHO) affirms that the highest 
attainable standard of health is a fundamental human right of every human being. The Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights lays the foundations for the international framework for the right 
to health. This human right is now codified in numerous national constitutions, as well as legally 
binding international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (E/CN.4/2003/58). 
</p>
<p>2. Although medical care and access to medicines are vital features of the right to health, 
almost two billion people lack access to essential medicines, leading to immense avoidable 
suffering. Improving access to essential medicines could save 10 million lives each year, four 
million of them in Africa and South-East Asia. Gross inequity is a shocking feature of the world 
pharmaceutical situation (A/61/338). 
</p>
<p>3. Between 2002-2008, the Special Rapporteur regularly scrutinized States&#8217; duties and 
practice in relation to access to medicines (see also A/61/338; E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2; 
E/CN.4/2005/51/Add.3; E/CN.4/2004/49/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>4. On numerous occasions over the last six years, Ministers, senior public officials, civil 
society and others have informed the Special Rapporteur that, when endeavouring to implement 
the right to health, States encounter many obstacles. Among the obstacles they have mentioned, 
one was the policies of some pharmaceutical companies, including excessively high prices for 
medicines. While the Special Rapporteur has been on country missions, however, Ministers and 
senior public officials have also acknowledged that the pharmaceutical sector has an 
indispensable role to play in relation to the right to health and access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>5. Enhancing access to medicines is a shared responsibility. If access to medicines is to be 
improved, numerous national and international actors have a vital role to play. The Millennium 
Development Goals recognize that pharmaceutical companies are among those sharing this 
responsibility. Goal 8, a global partnership for development, has a number of targets e.g. &#8220;In 
cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable, essential drugs in 
developing countries&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>6. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur engaged in many discussions on access to 
medicines with numerous parties, including pharmaceutical companies. These substantive 
discussions took place at symposia and workshops, as well as informal visits to pharmaceutical 
companies. They also occurred in clinics, hospitals and civil society consultations during the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country missions. These discussions were informed by the voluminous 
literature on access to medicines. During these discussions, the human rights duties of States in 
relation to access to medicines were reasonably clear, and these duties are now explored in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s various reports (see para. 3). However, it became apparent that the nature </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>and scope of pharmaceutical companies&#8217; human rights responsibilities in relation to access to 
medicines were not clear. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, for example, 
confirms that the private business sector has responsibilities regarding the realisation of the right 
to health, but it has not taken further steps to specify these responsibilities.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>7. In a recent report, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises observed: 
&#8220;Companies need to adopt a human rights policy. Broad aspirational language may be used to 
describe respect for human rights, but more detailed guidance in specific functional areas is 
necessary to give those commitments meaning&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5, para. 60). The Special Rapporteur 
strongly supports this point of view. It is very important that we move from the general to the 
specific. 
</p>
<p>8. Building on the general lessons learned in recent years, this report considers the 
right-to-health responsibilities of business enterprises in relation to one specific sector: the 
pharmaceutical industry. It focuses on one specific pharmaceutical company: GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK). Moreover, it gives particular attention to aspects of one crucial part of GSK&#8217;s portfolio: 
access to medicines, especially in relation to developing countries. The report aims to promote 
the transition from the general and abstract to the specific and operational. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur approached GSK with a view to undertaking this report because 
it is regarded as one of the leading exponents of corporate social responsibility in the 
pharmaceutical sector. It was anticipated that a review of GSK&#8217;s policies would be especially 
instructive, enabling the Special Rapporteur to identify good practices, as well as the obstacles 
facing such a company. 
</p>
<p>10. After some months of research on GSK, the Special Rapporteur visited the company&#8217;s 
headquarters in London on 2 and 3 June 2008, and also had numerous teleconferences with 
senior management officials based in Europe and USA in June and July 2008. 
</p>
<p>11. The programme of the visit to GSK&#8217;s headquarters was prepared with the company&#8217;s 
management team. The Special Rapporteur discussed with Dr Jean-Pierre Garnier, the 
former Chief Executive Officer; Mr Peter Bains, Senior Vice President; Dr Lynn Marks, 
Senior Vice President; Ms Julia King, Vice President; Dr Justine Frain, Vice President; 
Mr Robert Court, Vice President; and Mr Jon Pender, Director, Government Affairs. The 
Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to speak with Sir Christopher Gent, Chairman of 
GSK and its Corporate Responsibility Committee.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur also met with Mr Charles Clift and Mr Saul Walker from the 
UK Department for International Development (DFID). In early June 2008, he had the benefit 
of a half-day consultation on GSK with representatives of civil society organizations and 
academia working on access to medicines issues. Later, there were a number of bilateral 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  CESCR, general comment 14, para. 42. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>consultations with civil society organizations and academics working in this field. While these 
consultations focused on the policies and practices of GSK, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission 
was also informed by the numerous, wide-ranging consultations he undertook between 
2002-2008, including visits to clinics and hospitals in several developing countries (see 
paras. 3 and 6). 
</p>
<p>13. This report is primarily based on the company&#8217;s public, official policies and programmes 
provided by staff members based at GSK&#8217;s headquarters, as well as independent commentaries 
on those policies and programmes. The Special Rapporteur neither visited GSK&#8217;s country 
offices, nor checked the degree to which the company&#8217;s policies and programmes are 
implemented on the ground, nor scrutinised the role of GSK&#8217;s subsidiaries. These are important 
limitations because headquarters may adopt more progressive positions than country offices are 
willing to implement, and some vital issues (e.g. on patents and court cases) may be decided 
locally. Nonetheless, a company&#8217;s public, official policies and programmes are important and 
demand scrutiny from the right-to-health perspective. This report should be seen as one step in 
the long journey towards the sustained application of the right to health to the pharmaceutical 
sector. 
</p>
<p>14. As the Special Rapporteur prepared for the mission to GSK&#8217;s headquarters, he was revising 
the draft Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to 
Medicines that were placed in the public domain for consultation between September 2007 and 
May 2008. The Guidelines were not finalised when the mission to GSK&#8217;s headquarters took 
place in June 2008. The final version of the Guidelines was published in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s report of August 2008 to the General Assembly (A/63/263). The mission and 
Guidelines influenced each other, but this report does not explicitly apply the Guidelines to 
GSK. However, for those interested in the application of the right to health to the pharmaceutical 
sector, the Guidelines and this report (especially the next chapter) should be read together. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is very grateful to GSK&#8217;s senior management for their invitation to 
review the company&#8217;s policies and programmes regarding access to medicines and for their 
cooperation throughout the mission. He is also very grateful to all those in GSK, DFID, civil 
society and elsewhere, who gave him the benefit of their expertise. 
</p>
<p><b>II. RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE FIELD OF THE RIGHT  
TO HEALTH OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES  
IN RELATION TO ACCESS TO MEDICINES 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report of September 2006 makes some general observations 
about the right-to-health responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies in relation to access to 
medicines and those remarks will not be repeated here (A/61/338). The present chapter looks 
more closely at the scope and content of these right-to-health responsibilities. It begins to move 
beyond broad, generalised, aspirational human rights language of limited operational utility, 
towards &#8220;more detailed guidance in specific functional areas&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5, para. 60). This 
chapter is not specific to GSK. Because access to medicines is a shared responsibility, whether or 
not a pharmaceutical company is able to fully discharge all its right-to-health responsibilities will 
sometimes depend upon States, donors and others fulfilling their human rights responsibilities. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Framework of the Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises has recently provided &#8220;a framework to 
anchor the business and human rights debate&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5). His framework has three core 
principles, the second of which is &#8220;the corporate responsibility to respect human rights&#8221; 
(para. 51). According to the Special Representative, this responsibility requires &#8220;due diligence&#8221; 
which has a number of elements, for example, the company must have a human rights policy and 
use impact assessments in appropriate cases. The Special Representative confirms that the 
corporate responsibility to respect &#8220;is not merely a passive responsibility for firms but may entail 
positive steps&#8221; (para. 55). Crucially, the responsibility to respect is the &#8220;baseline responsibility&#8221; 
that applies to all companies, in all sectors, in all countries (para. 24). As the Special 
Representative observes, &#8220;companies may have additional responsibilities, for example, where 
they perform certain public functions&#8221; (para. 24). Also, according to the Special Representative, 
&#8220;human rights-related due diligence is determined by the context in which a company is 
operating, its activities, and the relationships associated with those activities&#8221; (para. 25). These 
last two points are important. A company may have human rights responsibilities beyond what 
the Special Representative regards as its &#8220;baseline responsibility&#8221;; and the &#8220;human rights-related 
due diligence&#8221; expected of a company is contextual. The Special Representative also explains 
that the corporate responsibility to respect human rights is based in &#8220;social expectations - as part 
of what is sometimes called a company&#8217;s social licence to operate&#8221; (para. 54). 
</p>
<p>18. While the Special Representative&#8217;s focus is the &#8220;baseline&#8221; human rights responsibility of 
all companies, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s focus is the right-to-health responsibilities of 
pharmaceutical companies. What are the &#8220;expectations&#8221; that society may legitimately have of a 
pharmaceutical company? What are the terms of a pharmaceutical company&#8217;s &#8220;social licence to 
operate&#8221;? These are complex questions, not least because the pharmaceutical sector encompasses 
a range of diverse companies, including innovator, generic and biotechnology companies. For 
example, the &#8220;social expectations&#8221; of a company holding a patent on a life-saving medicine are 
different from a pharmaceutical company that does not hold such a patent (see below). 
</p>
<p>19. When approaching these important issues, it is logical to seek guidance from the right to 
health. Fundamentally, this human right is concerned with the dignity and well-being of 
individuals and communities. It is an integral part of the international bill of human rights. Every 
country in the world has affirmed, in one treaty or another, the right to health. Moreover, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and others have developed a framework for 
analysing or &#8220;unpacking&#8221; the right to health with a view to making it easier to understand and 
apply. Crucially, by enhancing access to medicines, a company is making a major contribution to 
the realisation of the right to health. For these reasons, when considering the &#8220;social 
expectations&#8221; and &#8220;social licence to operate&#8221; of pharmaceutical companies, it is instructive to 
examine this compelling, fundamental human right.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Right to health framework and pharmaceutical companies in general 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (and others) developed the 
right-to-health framework as a tool to better grasp the duties of States. Of course, the human 
rights responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies are not identical to the human rights duties of 
States e.g. a State&#8217;s human rights duty includes enacting appropriate legislation and, obviously, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>such a responsibility cannot fall upon private businesses. Nonetheless, the framework provides a 
useful tool for clarifying the right-to-health responsibilities of non-State entities. These 
responsibilities reflect society&#8217;s &#8220;expectations&#8221; of pharmaceutical companies and they should be 
read into the &#8220;social licence to operate&#8221; of these companies. As emphasised in chapter I, many of 
these responsibilities are shared with States and others. Also, pharmaceutical companies have 
other responsibilities e.g. to enhance shareholder value. Here, however, the focus is on the 
right-to-health responsibilities of all pharmaceutical companies, including innovator, generic and 
biotechnology companies.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><i>A human rights policy statement integrated throughout the company 
</i></p>
<p>21. The right to health must be consistently integrated across all relevant policies, programmes 
and projects of a pharmaceutical company, including those relating to pricing, intellectual 
property, research and development, clinical trials, and marketing. An important pre-condition 
for such integration is the company&#8217;s adoption of a human rights policy statement that expressly 
recognizes the importance of human rights generally, and the right to health in particular. 
Pharmaceutical companies should use impact assessments to help them ensure that their human 
rights policy is consistently integrated across all of the company&#8217;s activities (A/HRC/8/5, 
paras. 60-62). 
</p>
<p><i>Availability 
</i></p>
<p>22. All pharmaceutical companies must do all they reasonably can to ensure that medicines are 
available in sufficient quantities in the countries where they are needed. While this responsibility 
is discussed below in the particular context of patent holders (para. 35), it must be emphasised 
that research and development in the pharmaceutical sector has inadequately addressed the 
priority health needs of developing countries and that all pharmaceutical companies have a 
responsibility to take reasonable measures to redress this historic imbalance. For example, they 
should either provide in-house research and development for neglected diseases, or support 
external research and development for such diseases. Sometimes known as &#8216;diseases of the 
developing world&#8217;, neglected diseases are those that mainly afflict the poorest people in the 
poorest countries (E/CN.4/2006/48/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><i>Accessibility 
</i></p>
<p>23. In addition to being available, medicines must also be accessible. Accessibility has various 
dimensions, for example, medicines must be accessible in all parts of a country, including remote 
rural areas as well as urban centres. Of course, the responsibility to ensure access in all rural and 
urban areas does not fall exclusively on pharmaceutical companies, but they must do all they 
reasonably can. For example, pharmaceutical companies should ensure that medicines are 
packaged appropriately for different local climates.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Pharmaceutical companies have responsibilities arising from other human rights, such as the 
</p>
<p>labour rights of their employees, but this report focuses on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; right to 
health responsibilities. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>24. Medicines must be affordable (i.e. financially accessible) to all, including those living in 
poverty. Medicines are often too expensive for poor communities in developing countries. In 
addition to the price charged by the manufacturer, other factors determining the final price paid 
by the patient include import tariffs, freight costs, VAT, and the mark-up added by wholesalers 
and retailers. While the State has a responsibility in relation to these other factors, 
pharmaceutical companies must ensure that their prices are affordable to as many individuals 
and communities as possible. In this regard pharmaceutical companies must put in place a 
differential pricing policy not only between countries but also within the same country 
(e.g. market segmentation). Of course, a generic company has a right-to-health responsibility to 
take all reasonable steps to make a medicine it is producing as widely accessible as possible. 
</p>
<p>25. Reliable information about medicines should be accessible. A pharmaceutical company 
should take effective measures to ensure that all statutory and other information bearing upon a 
medicine&#8217;s safety and possible side effects are easily accessible so individuals can take informed 
decisions about its possible use (also see Transparency below). 
</p>
<p><i>Acceptability 
</i></p>
<p>26. As well as being available and accessible, medicines (and associated processes e.g. clinical 
trials) must be respectful of medical ethics, culturally appropriate and sensitive to gender and life 
cycle issues. For example, pharmaceutical companies should give proper attention to the needs 
of children and the elderly, and ensure that clinical trials observe the highest ethical and human 
rights standards, including the requirements of informed consent. 
</p>
<p><i>Quality 
</i></p>
<p>27. Pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to ensure that their medicines are of good 
quality, safe and efficacious, for example, they must comply with national and global 
manufacturing standards e.g. the current World Health Organization Good Manufacturing 
Practice Guidelines. 
</p>
<p><i>Transparency 
</i></p>
<p>28. Transparency is a cardinal human rights principle upon which several other human rights 
considerations depend, such as accountability. In the right-to-health analysis this principle is 
reflected in the requirement, already mentioned, that as much health-related information as 
possible should be accessible. For example, pharmaceutical companies and their subsidiaries 
should disclose all advocacy and lobbying positions, and related activities, at the regional, 
national and international levels, that impact, or may impact, upon access to medicines. 
Advocacy bearing upon the public sphere must be disclosed in the public sphere. Pharmaceutical 
companies should also disclose the amount they spend on research and development, and 
research and development for neglected diseases. Of course, outputs are critically important, but 
levels of investment regarding neglected diseases are a useful indicator of corporate 
commitment. Other examples of the application of the transparency principle are provided in 
chapter IV in relation to GSK&#8217;s policies. While there is a presumption in favour of the disclosure 
of information, held by the company, which relates to access to information, this presumption 
may be rebutted on limited grounds, such as respect for the confidentiality of personal health 
data collected during clinical trials.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>29. The principle of transparency not only requires that information be made publicly 
available, but also that the information be made available in a form that is accessible, 
manageable and useful. In conjunction with other companies in the sector, a pharmaceutical 
company should agree to standard formats for the systematic disclosure of company information 
and data bearing upon access to medicines, thereby making it easier to evaluate the performance 
of one company against another, as well as the performance of the same company over time. 
This will enhance public accountability and investor confidence. 
</p>
<p><i>Monitoring and accountability 
</i></p>
<p>30. Human rights empower individuals and communities by granting them entitlements and 
placing obligations (or duties or responsibilities) on others. Crucially, rights and obligations 
demand accountability: unless supported by a system of accountability they can become no more 
than window dressing. A right-to-health approach emphasises obligations and requires that all 
duty-holders be held to account for their conduct.  
</p>
<p>31. All too often, &#8216;accountability&#8217; is used to mean blame and punishment. But this narrow 
understanding of the term is much too limited. A right-to-health accountability mechanism 
establishes which health policies and practices are working and which are not, and why, with the 
objective of improving the realisation of the right to health for all. Accountability comes in many 
forms. In relation to a human right as complex as the right to health, a range of monitoring and 
accountability mechanisms is required, and the form and mix of devices will vary from one 
jurisdiction to another. 
</p><p>32. Although challenging issues remain, in recent years some pharmaceutical companies have 
made significant progress in relation to corporate social responsibility. However, there is a 
striking absence of accessible, effective, transparent and independent accountability mechanisms 
in relation to their policies and corporate social responsibility. Some reporting initiatives are 
impressive such as GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s external assurance of the access to medicines chapter in 
its Corporate Responsibility Report (2007). Nonetheless, the reporting of pharmaceutical 
companies on access to medicines is largely self-reporting, with limited exceptions such as the 
Access to Medicine Index (see chap. III). While public candid self-reporting is welcome, it is no 
substitute for monitoring and accountability by an independent body. 
</p>
<p>33. There is an urgent need to devise appropriate monitoring and accountability mechanisms to 
monitor whether or not a pharmaceutical company is doing what it is required to do in relation to 
the right to health and access to medicines. Internal mechanisms are required, such as a 
governance system that includes direct board-level responsibility and accountability for the 
company&#8217;s access to medicines policy. Also external (i.e. independent) mechanisms are needed, 
such as an Ombudsman with oversight of a company&#8217;s human rights responsibilities, including 
those relating to access to medicines. The Ombudsman, or equivalent, may have oversight of all 
pharmaceutical companies, a group of companies, or an individual company. Of course, 
pharmaceutical companies are already subject to several forms of internal and external 
monitoring and accountability, however, these mechanisms rarely monitor and hold a company 
to account in relation to its human rights responsibilities to enhance access to medicines. 
Chapter IV considers these issues in the context of GSK. </p>

<p><i>Conclusion 
</i></p>
<p>34. Many of the right-to-health responsibilities briefly considered here apply to all 
pharmaceutical companies, including innovator, generic and biotechnology companies. For 
example, all pharmaceutical companies must be respectful of medical ethics; ensure their 
medicines are of good quality, safe, efficacious, and affordable to as many people as possible; 
disclose their advocacy and lobbying positions; establish internal and external right-to-health 
monitoring and accountability mechanisms; and so on. However, some right-to-health 
responsibilities only apply to some pharmaceutical companies. The next section briefly explores 
the additional responsibilities that apply to a company, like GSK, that holds a patent for a 
life-saving medicine. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to health framework and patent-holding pharmaceutical companies 
</b></p>
<p>35. A pharmaceutical company that develops a life-saving medicine has performed a vitally 
important medical, public health and right-to-health function. By saving lives, reducing suffering 
and improving public health, it has not only enhanced the quality of life of individuals, but also 
contributed to the prosperity of individuals, families and communities. The company, and its 
employees, has made a major contribution to the realisation of the rights to life and the highest 
attainable standard of health. The &#8220;reward&#8221; for fulfilling this critically important social function 
is the grant of a patent - a limited monopoly - over the relevant medicine, enabling the company 
to make a profit, enhance shareholder value, and invest in further research and development. 
</p>
<p>36. Different commentators use different terms to describe the relationship between society 
and patent-holder. Some characterise the relationship as a &#8220;social contract&#8221;.3 Others might regard 
a patent as forming part of a company&#8217;s &#8220;social licence to operate&#8221;. Some might describe the 
relationship as fiduciary i.e. the company holds the patent - for a limited period - on trust for 
society. Whether characterised as contract, licence or trust, the company holds the patent on 
express and implied terms. Society has legitimate expectations of a company holding the patent 
on a life-saving medicine. In relation to such a patent, the right-to-health framework helps to 
clarify what these terms, and expectations, are. Because of its critical social function, a patent on 
a life-saving medicine places important right-to-health responsibilities on the patent holder. 
These responsibilities are reinforced when the patented life-saving medicine benefited from 
research and development undertaken in publicly funded laboratories. 
</p>
<p>37. Having developed a life-saving medicine, the company has a human rights responsibility to 
take all reasonable steps to make the medicine as accessible as possible, as soon as possible, to 
all those in need. Of course, the responsibility is shared with States and others. The company is 
not expected to make the medicine immediately accessible to all those in need; analogous to a 
State&#8217;s responsibility of progressive realisation, the company has to move expeditiously and 
effectively, by way of deliberate, concrete and targeted measures, to make the medicine as 
accessible as possible. What is required of the company is subject to its capacity; analogous to a 
State&#8217;s responsibility to take steps &#8220;to the maximum of its available resources&#8221;, more is required 
</p>

</p>
<p>of a powerful transnational company with global networks, than a smaller business. Given 
market realities, the company must be permitted to make a reasonable profit and enhance 
shareholder value; in other words, it must be allowed to operate a viable business model.  
</p>
<p>38. When endeavouring to make the medicine as accessible as possible to all those in need, the 
company must use all the arrangements at its disposal, including differential pricing between 
countries, differential pricing within countries (e.g. market segmentation), non-exclusive 
commercial voluntary licences, non-commercial voluntary licences, donation programmes, 
public-private partnerships, and so on. 
</p>
<p>39. Crucially, the company may not market the medicine to social group A (i.e. wealthy urban 
elites), with little or no attempt to reach social groups B-E. The patent holder of a life-saving 
medicine has a human rights responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the 
medicine is accessible to all social groups. While it cannot be expected to make an overall loss, 
the company can sometimes be expected to operate, with respect to some of its activities, on a 
not-for-profit basis, such as in relation to social group E (i.e. the rural poor). In such a case, the 
State may be required to provide a subsidy so that the company recovers its costs (e.g. freight 
and administrative charges) when making the medicine available to the rural poor on a 
not-for-profit basis. Donors may also be required to provide a subsidy, or other assistance, 
consistent with donors&#8217; human rights responsibilities of international assistance and cooperation 
in health (A/HRC/7/11/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>40. Pharmaceutical companies also have a responsibility to ensure that medicines are 
developed for children, the elderly, pregnant and lactating women, and for various climates so 
the medicines are resistant to extremes of heat and humidity. 
</p>
<p>41. In summary, there is an agreement between society and the patent holder of a life-saving 
medicine that grants privileges to, and places responsibilities on, the patent holder. The crucial 
right-to-health responsibility is to take all reasonable steps to make the medicine as accessible as 
possible, as soon as possible, to all those in need, within a viable business model. As soon as the 
new medicine is marketed at higher prices (usually in high-income countries), the patent holder 
has a right-to-health responsibility to put in place a range of mechanisms, such as differential 
pricing between and within countries, to enhance access for those who cannot afford those 
prices. These mechanisms must encompass, for example, the better-off in middle-income 
countries; the poorest in middle-income countries; and all those in low-income countries. Also, 
the patent holder has a right-to-health responsibility to develop formulations for children, the 
elderly, pregnant and lactating women, and extremes of climate. For the duration of the patent, 
only the patent holder is authorised (with limited exceptions) to take these steps. Thus, the 
agreement between society and patent holder includes a responsibility on the patent holder to 
take these steps, expeditiously and effectively, by way of deliberate, concrete and targeted 
measures. If the patent is worked without these steps being taken (i.e. without a range of 
mechanisms being put in place to enhance access, and without steps being taken to develop 
formulations for children), the patent holder is in breach of its right-to-health responsibilities. Of 
course, the success of the patent holder&#8217;s actions will sometimes depend upon States, donors and 
others in the pharmaceutical sector fulfilling their responsibilities. Nonetheless, the patent holder 
has a right-to-health responsibility to do what it can. </p>

</p>
<p><b>D.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>42. Based on the dignity and well-being of individuals and communities, as well as globally 
recognised standards, the right-to-health framework helps to clarify what is socially expected of 
all pharmaceutical companies, including innovator, generic and biotechnology companies. These 
paragraphs are not an exhaustive application of the framework to the pharmaceutical sector. 
There are other issues, such as participation, that are not included here. Moreover, the elements 
of the framework that have been considered are only briefly discussed. Some are explored 
further in chapter IV. 
</p>
<p>43. This chapter has not tried to identify which are legal and which are ethical right-to-health 
responsibilities - that is a challenge for the future. Whether the responsibilities are legal, ethical 
or both, all pharmaceutical companies have to make some critically important decisions. Have 
they done all that is reasonably possible to enhance access to those in need? What is reasonable? 
Have they been as transparent as possible? Because of the importance and complexity of these 
and related questions, there must be internal and external monitoring and accountability 
mechanisms to provide guidance to the company and others. Chapter IV returns to this critical 
issue of right-to-health monitoring and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  GLAXOSMITHKLINE:  A BRIEF INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>44. This chapter, and the next, briefly introduce GSK and signal some of its initiatives that are 
reflective of its right-to-health responsibilities. Both chapters are based on material available, 
and interviews conducted, during 2008. In February 2009, however, GSK announced a number 
of important improvements to its access to medicines strategy, including significant price 
reductions in least developed countries, a specific commitment to invest in the health systems of 
these countries, and patent pooling.<b>4</b> In April 2009, GSK and Pfizer announced their intention to 
create together a new company for the discovery and delivery of treatments for HIV. While this 
report is based on the information and interviews of 2008, there are a few brief remarks 
concerning these very recent developments. 
</p>
<p>45. GlaxoSmithKline was formed in 2000 through a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and 
SmithKline Beecham. With its headquarters in London, GSK is one of the world's leading 
research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. 
</p>
<p>46. GSK is one of the few pharmaceutical companies researching both medicines and 
vaccines for the World Health Organization&#8217;s three priority diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis 
and malaria. It produces medicines that treat six major disease areas: asthma, virus control, 
infections, mental health, diabetes and digestive conditions. In addition, it is a leader in the 
field of vaccines and is developing new treatments for cancer. GSK employs more than 
100,000 people in over 100 countries across the world. It has one of the biggest research teams 
employing over 15,000 people based at 24 sites in seven countries.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>47. The company is listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges. A Board of 
Directors and a Corporate Executive Team manage the company. In mid-2008, Andrew Witty 
became Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jean-Pierre Garnier who led the company from 2000. 
According to the figures for the year ending December 2008, the company had a turnover of over 
GBP 24,000 million and an operating profit of over GBP 7,000 million. GSK&#8217;s profitability has 
increased in recent years. The pharmaceutical sector is among the most profitable industries in 
the world and GSK one of the most profitable companies in the sector. 
</p>
<p>48. Since 1998, GSK has been a leading contributor in the fight against lymphatic filariasis. 
GSK has donated over one billion albendazole (Albenza) tablets for the treatment of this 
terrible disease. The company produces antiretroviral (ARVs) such as zidovudine (Retrovir), 
lamivudine (Epivir), combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (Combivir), abacavir sulfate 
(Ziagen) and combination of zidovudine, lamivudine and abacavir sulfate (Trizivir). At its peak, 
the company held a 40% global market share in ARVs; today, it has a global market share of 
approximately 20%. 
</p>
<p>49. Established in 1992, Positive Action is GSK&#8217;s long-term, international HIV/AIDS 
community investment programme, facilitating access to treatment by supporting HIV 
education, care and other related community initiatives. During 2007, Positive Action supported 
17 programmes in 19 countries. The programme mainly focuses on stigma reduction and 
awareness-raising. The initiative enables communities to enhance their response to HIV/AIDS 
by providing up to date information, sharing of best practice between stakeholders, and 
empowering communities affected by HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>50. GSK is currently conducting research and development into ten diseases of particular 
relevance to the developing world: bacterial meningitis, chlamydia, dengue fever, hepatitis E, 
HIV/AIDS, leishmaniasis, malaria, pandemic flu, pneumococcal diseases and tuberculosis. 
</p>
<p>51. In 2001, GSK launched Facing the Challenge focusing on: reducing prices for least 
developed countries and sub-Sahara Africa; investing in research and development for diseases 
that are particularly prevalent in the developing world; and playing a leading role in community 
activities that promote effective healthcare.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>52. GSK participates in a number of partnerships (e.g. TB Alliance), several of which are 
noted later in this report. 
</p>
<p>53. The company has been favourably ranked in various corporate social responsibility indices 
e.g. Good Global 100 Index, Global Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index and Financial Times 
Stock Exchange. In 2008, the Access to Medicine Foundation published an index ranking 
20 pharmaceutical companies on how they treat the poor and enhance access to medicines.<b>6</b> 
GSK was ranked first.

</p>
<p>54. However, GSK has also been heavily criticized. In 1998, for example, GSK&#8217;s predecessors 
and over 30 other pharmaceutical companies filed a case against the Mandela government 
challenging the validity of South Africa&#8217;s Medicines and Related Substance Act. According to 
the pharmaceutical companies the Act, which provided for compulsory licensing, parallel 
importation and other TRIPS &#8216;flexibilities&#8217;, undermined intellectual property rights. The case 
generated fierce criticism of the pharmaceutical industry and was eventually the subject of an 
out-of-court settlement. This proved to be a turning point. Shortly afterwards, the prices of 
ARVs, including GSK&#8217;s, fell from R1000 to under R100 in South Africa. In other areas, too, 
GSK has been criticized. In 2007, for example, a BBC documentary alleged that GSK provided 
misleading information about the efficacy of one of its products, Seroxat, and that 
GSK-employed ghost writers influenced 'independent' academics.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p><i>Obstacles to improving access to medicines 
</i></p>
<p>55. There are major barriers to enhancing access to medicines in developing and developed 
countries. The barriers are especially formidable in low-income countries. Some of these 
obstacles are rooted in poverty: the poor cannot afford even the cheapest medicines. In some 
countries, taxes and tariffs, as well as cultural factors, such as stigma and discrimination, impede 
access to medicines. Some of these obstacles make it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to 
enhance access to medicines. Obviously, some barriers cannot be tackled by the pharmaceutical 
sector alone. Here it is only possible to mention some of the obstacles that impede GSK&#8217;s 
attempts to enhance access to medicines: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Weak health systems</i>: chronic under-investment has led to a lack of clinics and 
hospitals, poor distribution networks for medicines, low numbers of trained health workers, and 
so on. Failing and collapsing health systems are a very major obstacle to enhancing access to 
medicines; 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>Weak regulatory environments</i>: an efficient, competent and fair regulatory 
environment is important to the pharmaceutical industry. When the enforcement of 
pharmaceutical legislation is weak, counterfeiters thrive and poor quality medicines are 
commonplace; 
</p>
<p> (c) <i>Corruption</i>: is endemic in some medicine supply systems. Unofficial &#8220;fees&#8221; are 
required for customs clearance, counterfeit medicines are permitted to circulate, and so on; 
</p>
<p> (d) <i>Distribution channels</i>: another key challenge facing GSK is the lack of effective 
distribution channels. In many cases, intermediaries impede access to medicines. For example, 
they may create an artificial scarcity of medicines and add excessive mark-ups making drugs 
unaffordable to those living in poverty;  
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p> (e) <i>Reference pricing</i>: some high-income and middle-income countries try to use, as 
benchmarks for the prices at which they buy, the preferential prices offered to low-income 
countries; 
</p>
<p> (f) <i>Leakage</i> <i>or diversion</i>: some drugs priced for developing countries have found their 
way into the European market. In European pharmacies, for example, a dose of Combivir sells 
for about GBP 3.80. Under an agreement with GSK, a dose of Combivir in Africa sells at the 
cost price of about GBP 0.40. However, tablets sold in Africa have appeared in the European 
markets.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>56. Because there is uncertainty about the scale and nature of reference pricing and diversion, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends that research be undertaken to establish firm facts. If 
differential pricing between and within countries is to become more widespread, it is very 
important that data and information on reference pricing and diversion is current, detailed and 
reliable. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RIGHT TO HEALTH ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>57. This chapter briefly considers a selection of GSK&#8217;s policies through the right-to-health lens 
set out in chapter II. Numerous important issues, like clinical trials, are omitted for lack of space. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Pricing 
</b></p>
<p>58. States, pharmaceutical companies and others have a right-to-health responsibility to do all 
they reasonably can to ensure that medicines are accessible to all (see chapter II). One critical 
dimension of access is affordability. GSK has a number of price reduction initiatives, including 
the following.<b>9</b>  
</p>
<p><i>Not-for-profit prices 
</i>59. GSK, whose portfolio includes ARVs and anti-malarial treatments, has made a 
commitment to increase access by providing these medicines to Least-Developed Countries 
(LDCs), and all of sub-Saharan Africa, at not-for-profit (NFP) prices. NFP prices are also 
available to countries included in the U.S. President&#8217;s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR), as well as eligible projects of The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria. According to GSK, NFP prices are sustainable prices i.e. the company covers its costs, 
including insurance and freight.<b>10</b> NFP prices are not dependent upon the size of the order.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><i>Preferential pricing 
</i>60. On a case-by-case basis, GSK negotiates preferential prices for ARVs with middle-income 
countries.<b>11</b> Also, GSK has had a policy for some years whereby its vaccines are available at 
preferential prices to some developing countries using a tiered pricing system. Prices are linked 
to gross national incomes as defined by the World Bank, size of an order, and length of a 
particular supply contract.<b>12</b> In 2008, GSK shipped 1.1 billion vaccines and 79% of these went to 
the developing world. 
</p>
<p><i>Tearing down the barriers 
</i></p>
<p>61. GSK&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility Report (2007) explains that the company is piloting a new 
approach to marketing medicines in middle-income countries. Called Tearing down the barriers, 
the approach has some similarities with GSK&#8217;s preferential pricing policy for vaccines (see 
preceding paragraph). It considers the different socio-economic groups within middle-income 
countries: &#8216;A&#8217; represents the wealthiest section of society and &#8216;E&#8217; the poorest. While hitherto 
GSK&#8217;s marketing has focused on the &#8216;A/B&#8217; categories, Tearing down the barriers is piloting 
ways of enhancing access to the &#8216;C/D&#8217; sections of the market e.g. tiered pricing within, as well as 
between, countries; gauging the relationship between price and volume for selected products in 
some middle-income countries; differential branding strategies; and local sourcing or 
manufacturing designed to address cost issues.<b>13</b> Interestingly, Tearing down the barriers is 
absent from the GSK&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility Report (2008) published in early 2009, 
although the company still seems to be pursuing the general approach e.g. relevant pilot 
programmes remain in place. 
</p>
<p><i>Patient assistance programmes and discount cards 
</i></p>
<p>62. Like other pharmaceutical companies, GSK has introduced Patient Assistance  
Programmes (PAPs) and discount cards in the USA to help patients without insurance.  
PAPs provide prescription medicines free, or at minimal cost, to patients without insurance.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Comments, conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. More than 80 countries benefit from GSK&#8217;s NFP prices for ARVs and anti-malarial 
medicines.<b>15</b> Since the introduction of preferential pricing for ARVs in 1997, GSK has reduced 
the price several times, including in February 2008. On this occasion, GSK introduced

</p>
<p>significant new price reductions averaging 21% across a range of ARVs.<b>16</b> The most significant 
reduction (almost 40%) was for abacavir sulfate oral solution (Ziagen), which WHO 
recommends for use within resource-limited settings. Combination of zidovudine and lamivudine 
(Combivir) was reduced by 17% to US 0.54 cents per day.<b>17</b> Of course, these price reductions are 
commendable and consistent with GSK&#8217;s right-to-health responsibilities. Crucially, generic 
competition played a vital role in driving down these prices. In most cases, generic companies 
have pushed their prices below the NFP prices of innovator companies. 
</p>
<p>64. Tearing down the barriers is (or was) a promising initiative with the potential of enhancing 
access to medicines for many people, especially those in socio-economic groups C/D, in 
middle-income countries. As explained in paragraph 61, Tearing down the barriers is absent 
from GSK&#8217;s latest literature but its general approach appears to remain part of the company&#8217;s 
strategy. GSK&#8217;s pilots will need careful study (i.e. actual volume, prices, results) to understand 
the approach&#8217;s implications for enhancing access across different socio-economic groups.  
</p>
<p>65. GSK is exploring ways of enhancing access to its cervical cancer vaccine, Cervarix, in 
developing countries where most deaths from cervical cancer occur.<b>18</b> Today, however, Cervarix 
remains very costly (approximately UD$300) in both developed and developing countries, 
meaning it is largely unaffordable where it is most needed. As the patent holder of a life-saving 
medicine, GSK has a right-to-health responsibility to do all it reasonably can to put in place, as a 
matter of urgency, mechanisms that enhance access to Cervarix in middle-income and 
low-income countries (see para. 41). Access to medicines being a shared responsibility, others 
must also do all they can to help GSK enhance access to Cervarix.  
</p>
<p>66. GSK deserves credit for significantly reducing some of its prices, including the reductions 
announced a few weeks ago, and enhancing access to medicines. Such measures are reflective of 
its right-to-health responsibilities. However, some prices remain beyond the reach of many 
millions of people for whom the medicine is literally a matter of life and death. The price of 
Cervarix, for example, remains a cause of deep concern. The Special Rapporteur urges GSK to 
take all reasonable measures to ensure that its medicines, including vaccines such as Cervarix, 
are affordable to people living in middle-income and low-income countries.  
</p>
<p>67. Commercial interests and right-to-health requirements are sometimes aligned. Entering a 
new market may be good for a company&#8217;s business and also required by its right-to-health 
responsibility to take all reasonable steps to enhance access to medicines. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the approach signalled in Tearing down the barriers that includes tiered 
pricing within, as well as between, countries. He strongly encourages GSK to include, in its 
strategy, access to category E (the poorest section of society). He calls on States, donors and 
others to work closely with GSK to ensure access to medicines of those living in poverty.

</p>
<p>68. Although GSK publishes the prices of ARVs and other medicines, such as anti-malarials, 
the price offers to some (e.g. the private sector and pharmacies) are still not disclosed. Greater 
transparency of pricing policies, and their rationales, will enhance monitoring and help ensure 
better access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>69. When calculating NFP prices for LDCs, GSK and other pharmaceutical companies are 
urged to use their marginal costs i.e. the additional costs incurred by the company in making the 
medicine available in LDCs, such as the additional manufacturing cost generated by providing 
the additional volume, freight charges, and so on. However, the calculation of marginal costs 
should exclude, for example, research and development for the medicine, marketing in the 
developed world, as well as a return for shareholders. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur calls on States to adopt WHO recommendations requiring 
Governments to remove tariffs and taxes on medicines.<b>19</b> Such tariffs and taxes are 
State-imposed obstacles to the realisation of the right to health.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Patents and licensing 
</b></p>
<p>71. The right to health requires a company that holds a patent on a life-saving medicine to use 
all the arrangements at its disposal to make the medicine as accessible as possible (see para. 41). 
Here the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main focus is on patents and licences.  
</p>
<p>72. GSK endorses the industry position that patent protection stimulates and fundamentally 
underpins research and development and is not an obstacle to access to medicines. The company 
supports the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and 
acknowledges the Agreement&#8217;s flexibilities, such as compulsory licences and the 31(f) solution 
to allow compulsory licences for export. In August 2007, for example, GSK became the first 
company to grant consent under the 31(f) agreement for supply to Rwanda and it agreed to waive 
royalties. 
</p>
<p>73. Decisions on whether to take action to uphold GSK&#8217;s intellectual property rights in the 
event of infringement, as well as the nature of any action, are taken on a case-by-case basis.<b>20</b> 
GSK reserves the right to encourage countries to introduce more demanding protection of 
intellectual property interests than those required by TRIPS, such as additional limitations on 
compulsory licensing. It argues that such provisions are &#8220;innovation friendly&#8221; and good for the 
national economy.<b>21</b> GSK Philippines lobbied against the Philippines&#8217; House of Representatives 
passing the Cheaper Medicines Bill that aimed to incorporate TRIPS flexibilities into the 
country&#8217;s intellectual property code.<b>22</b>

<p>74. In 2006, GSK offices in Thailand and India were subject to demonstrations against the 
company&#8217;s patent applications for combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (Combivir). GSK 
decided to abandon such patent applications wherever they existed. 
</p>
<p><i>Commercial and non-commercial voluntary licences 
</i></p>
<p>75. GSK considers granting voluntary licences on a case-by-case basis. While GSK does not 
believe that voluntary licences are a universal solution to tackling HIV/AIDS or diseases in 
general,<b>23</b> it granted its first voluntary licence in October 2001 for manufacturing and sale of 
ARVs to Aspen Pharmacare, sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s largest generics company. The licence now 
covers both public and private sectors across sub-Saharan Africa. In 2006, GSK granted its 
eighth voluntary licence for its ARVs in Africa. In 2008, GSK&#8217;s licensees supplied over 
250 million tablets of their versions of lamivudine (Epivir) and combination of zidovudine and 
lamivudine (Combivir) compared to 180 million in 2007. These voluntary licences are granted 
on a NFP basis that includes a royalty (4%-5%) for administrative purposes. GSK and Pfizer 
have declared that voluntary licences such as these will form part of the access strategy of their 
new specialist HIV company. 
</p>
<p>76. While most voluntary licences to date have been to supply ARVs to countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, GSK recently signed an agreement with Simcere, a Chinese company, to 
manufacture zanamivir (Relenza) in China, for sale in China, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and 
all 50 LDCs. Zanamivir (Relenza) is an anti-viral for influenza.<b>24</b> This is one example of a 
voluntary licence granted by GSK whereby it receives commercial benefits from the generic 
manufacturer. 
</p>
<p><i>Patent pooling 
</i></p>
<p>77. GSK considers voluntary patent pools, with appropriate safeguards, as one mechanism for 
fostering research and development for neglected diseases. One of the company&#8217;s improvements 
to its access to medicines strategy, announced in February 2009, is the creation of its own patent 
pool. 
</p>
<p><b>Comments, conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78. GSK&#8217;s use of commercial and non-commercial voluntary licences has significantly 
enhanced access to some medicines, while the company&#8217;s recent announcement on patent 
pooling is commendable. 
</p>
<p>79. However, GSK is not using voluntary licensing enough. Consistent with a company&#8217;s 
responsibility to enhance shareholder value, commercial voluntary licences generate revenue for 
the patent holder. Non-exclusive licences are more likely to enhance access than exclusive 
licences: an exclusive licence may replace GSK&#8217;s monopoly with the monopoly of a local

</p>
<p>licensee. Of course, a voluntary licence must include appropriate safeguards, for example, 
requiring that the medicines meet the standards of quality, safety and efficacy signalled in 
paragraph 27. They should also include any necessary transfer of technology. The terms of the 
licences should be disclosed. When discussing with GSK, sometimes one had the impression that 
commercial voluntary licences were seen as inconsistent with the current intellectual property 
regime. Of course, this is not the case. Commercial voluntary licences respect, and depend upon, 
today&#8217;s intellectual property regime. 
</p>
<p>80. During one high-level interview in GSK&#8217;s headquarters, it was acknowledged that there 
was some reluctance to issue more commercial voluntary licences. While the explanation offered 
for this reluctance was lack of trust, it was also recognized that it was time to give such licences 
renewed consideration. However, if GSK is to enter into a commercial voluntary licence, it has 
to be confident that its commercial interests are adequately safeguarded. It has to be able to trust 
generic manufacturers and States&#8217; regulatory environments. If its licence is broken, GSK can 
seek damages and other remedies in the courts. Understandably, however, this is small comfort 
to GSK. If there is a real risk that it will end up in the courts, GSK cannot be blamed for 
declining to enter into a voluntary licence (see also paras. 107 and 108).  
</p>
<p>81. It is critically important that GSK enters into more commercial and non-commercial 
voluntary licences across a range of medicines and markets. Generic and innovator companies, 
States, international organisations, and others, must do all they can to create an environment that 
facilitates the issuance of such licences. 
</p>
<p>82. Although GSK is not usually considered to be an industry hardliner on intellectual property 
issues, some of its positions, such as those in India, Thailand and Philippines, undermine its 
leadership position. The Special Rapporteur urges GSK to respect the right of countries to use, to 
the full, TRIPS flexibilities and encourages GSK to make a public commitment not to lobby for 
TRIPS &#8216;plus&#8217; standards.  
</p>
<p>83. Today, there are serious attempts to find new ways to generate research and development 
other than by way of patents. GSK and all pharmaceutical companies are urged to engage 
positively with these initiatives. All parties are encouraged to respond constructively to GSK&#8217;s 
recent announcement on patent pooling.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Research and development:  neglected diseases and paediatric formulations 
</b></p>
<p>84. The right to health not only requires that existing medicines are accessible, but also that 
much needed new medicines and their formulations are developed and thereby become available 
to those who need them. Like other human rights, the right to health has a particular 
pre-occupation with disadvantaged and vulnerable individuals, communities and populations. 
For this reason, the right to health requires the development of medicines for e.g. neglected 
diseases, children, the elderly, pregnant and lactating women, and for various climates (see 
chap. II). In this section, the focus is on neglected diseases and paediatric formulations. 
</p>
<p>85. The record confirms that research and development has not addressed the priority 
health needs of low-income countries. Although some pharmaceutical companies are taking 
active measures to reverse this trend, research into these diseases remains fragmented and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>neglected.<b>25</b> Also, there is relatively little knowledge about the effects certain medicines can have 
on children, partly because fewer clinical trials are conducted on children than adults. As 
alternatives to missing paediatric formulations, healthcare workers and parents often use 
fractions of adult dosages, or prepare makeshift prescriptions of medicines by crushing tablets or 
dissolving portions of capsules in water. These alternatives may be unsafe for children. In short, 
there is an urgent need to develop paediatric formulations of medicines. 
</p>
<p>86. Surveying the history of research and development, it appears that the primary reference 
point has been the health of some better-off men living in temperate climates. 
</p>
<p>87. GSK undertakes research and development into diseases of the developing world, 
including WHO&#8217;s three priority diseases of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. It has drug 
development programmes regarding leishmaniasis and helminths. In addition to its work on 
vaccines, GSK has approximately 19 pharmaceutical research and development projects, some of 
them collaborative, targeting diseases of particular relevance to the developing world. GSK has a 
dedicated drug discovery unit in Tres Cantos, Spain, with about 100 full-time scientific staff 
(half supported by external partners such as TB Alliance), which leads research and development 
in malaria and tuberculosis. A research center in North Carolina, USA, leads GSK&#8217;s research on 
new therapies for HIV/AIDS. GSK&#8217;s facility in Rixensart, Belgium, undertakes research and 
development on vaccines, including for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. 
</p>
<p>88. The company has developed a number of ARV liquid formulations for children, available 
at NFP prices in the world&#8217;s poorest countries. The company is also committed to support four 
paediatric clinical trials in resource-poor countries to determine how to enhance access to 
HIV/AIDS treatment for children. In 2007, GSK gained approval from the European Medicines 
Agency for new scored tablets for Epivir, Combivir and Ziagen. A scored tablet can be broken 
into two smaller doses simplifying treatment for children. GSK has confirmed that the new 
company to be created by GSK and Pfizer will enhance research efforts into treatments and 
formulations for children living with HIV. 
</p>
<p>89. Recently, GSK and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative have announced collaborative 
research targeting the most neglected diseases, such as visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar). All 
new medicines developed through public-private partnerships are made available to the 
developing world at reduced prices. 
</p>
<p><b>Comments, conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the increased attention into neglected diseases. The 
work done by GSK and some other companies, as well as philanthropic institutions and civil 
society organisations, to promote research into these diseases is commendable. It is imperative 
for the success of these initiatives that States, especially donor countries, participate fully and 
contribute financially and technologically so as to ensure sustained research into neglected 
diseases. A joint effort of the international community is needed to ensure scientific advances 
result in new treatments that help control and eradicate diseases of the developing world.

</p>
<p>91. However, the gravity and scale of the problem continues to dwarf the global response to 
neglected diseases. The neglect of poverty-related diseases, that maim and kill the world&#8217;s most 
disadvantaged individuals, communities and populations, continues to be one of the most serious 
human rights issues confronting the world today. 
</p>
<p>92. Recently, there have been attempts to devise new research and development models that 
would reward innovation but also generate new medicines for those living in developing 
countries. The Special Rapporteur encourages GSK to play a leadership role in these endeavours 
as they evolve.  
</p>
<p>93. Given the critically important social function of the pharmaceutical sector, as well as the 
gravity and scale of the challenge, all pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to take 
reasonable measures to redress the historic neglect of poverty-related diseases. This 
responsibility is not confined to innovator companies. All pharmaceutical companies should 
either provide in-house research and development for neglected diseases, or support external 
research and development for such diseases. 
</p>
<p>94. While GSK deserves credit for taking a leadership position within the industry with respect 
to neglected diseases, it is extremely important that it invests more and collaborates more 
effectively. Consistent with the right-to-health requirement of transparency, the Special 
Rapporteur urges GSK and other pharmaceutical companies to disclose their investment in 
research and development for neglected diseases, as well as their investment in research and 
development overall. 
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur encourages GSK and other companies to consistently make their 
compound libraries available for screening for neglected diseases. 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur urgently calls on GSK and other companies to attach a much 
higher priority to the development and manufacture of paediatric formulations of their 
medicines, and to disclose the scale of their investment. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>97. Accountability, which includes monitoring and redress, is a vital feature of all human 
rights, including the right to health (see chap. II).  
</p>
<p>98. In addition to national courts and tribunals (e.g. employment tribunals), GSK&#8217;s existing 
internal and external (or independent) accountability mechanisms include the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Board of Directors and its Committees e.g. the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
</p>
<p>&#8226; GSK&#8217;s publicly available reports, reviews and quarterly results, including its annual 
Corporate Responsibility Report 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Annual General Meeting 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A company department that audits GSK&#8217;s systems and processes e.g. sales and 
marketing </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Internal whistle-blowing procedure 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Integrity Helpline for &#8220;interested outside parties&#8221; who may wish to report alleged 
misconduct 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Independent ethical review committee on the company&#8217;s clinical trials 
</p>
<p>&#8226; PricewaterhouseCoopers&#8217; annual audits of GSK&#8217;s financial statements 
</p>
<p>99. Bureau Veritas, an independent third party, externally assured the information supplied in 
the access to medicines section of GSK&#8217;s Corporate Responsibility Report (2007). While on 
mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed that Bureau Veritas asked GSK for clarification of 
some passages in the draft section and requested that textual changes be made. Also, they 
recommended that GSK &#8220;should provide greater detail on the governance, accountability and 
management structures for access to medicines and the relationship with external stakeholders.&#8221; 
GSK responded to these recommendations as part of its Corporate Responsibility Report (2008). 
Inexplicably, GSK did not subject its 2008 Report to external assurance.  
100. GSK has actively participated in independent evaluation exercises, such as <i>Investing in 
Life</i>, Oxfam&#8217;s 2007 review of pharmaceutical companies&#8217; approach to access to medicines, as 
well as the recent Access to Medicine Index. Launched by the Access to Medicine Foundation, 
the Index considers the efforts of the world&#8217;s largest pharmaceutical companies, inter alia, to 
help solve the global medicines crisis. The Index scores companies according to their 
performance on a wide range of criteria; as already observed, GSK scored better than any other 
company. 
</p>
<p>101. GSK&#8217;s research and development strategy for diseases of the developing world was 
subject, in 2003, to external review by an advisory board comprising public health and  
scientific experts from both developing and developed countries. Although an important  
step in the right direction, this review did not include all those dimensions that are important 
from a right-to-health perspective. Moreover, it has not been repeated since 2003. 
</p>
<p><b>Comments, conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur has not closely examined all the accountability mechanisms noted 
in paragraph 98. He welcomes the external assurance of some passages in GSK&#8217;s Corporate 
Responsibility Report (2007); all pharmaceutical companies should emulate this development as 
a matter of urgency. He greatly regrets GSK&#8217;s failure to subject its recent Corporate 
Responsibility Repor<i>t</i> (2008) to external assurance.  
</p>
<p>103. The most striking feature of the accountability mechanisms briefly signalled in the 
preceding paragraphs is that they rarely, if ever, monitor and hold GSK to account in relation to 
its right-to-health responsibilities. None, for example, assesses whether or not GSK is doing all it 
reasonably can, within a viable business model, to enhance access to medicines for all. While the 
external assurance of the Corporate Responsibility Report (2007) is commendable, it checked 
whether or not the information was accurate and sufficiently detailed, it did not assess if GSK 
was fulfilling its right-to-health responsibilities. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>104. Some of the accountability mechanisms mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are 
indispensable, such as those designed to ensure financial probity and shareholder confidence. 
But they provide insufficient independent scrutiny of the critically important medical, public 
health and right-to-health functions of GSK. They do not independently assess, for example, 
whether or not GSK is fulfilling its responsibilities as a patent holder of life-saving medicines. 
Understandably, GSK robustly defends, in the courts and elsewhere, its privileges as a patent 
holder, but where are the independent mechanisms to check that it fulfils its corresponding 
responsibilities as the patent holder of life-saving medicines? To its credit, GSK is committed to 
upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In its human rights statement it says: 
&#8220;As a marketer of pharmaceutical products with life saving and enhancing properties, we will 
strive to make them as widely available as possible while running our business in a sustainable 
way&#8221;, but there are no independent mechanisms designed to monitor and hold GSK to account 
for this important medical, public health and right-to-health commitment.  
</p>
<p>105. Whether its right-to-health responsibilities are legal, ethical or both, GSK must strengthen 
its accountability in relation to access to medicines. GSK should consider, for example, 
appointing an independent Ombudsman with oversight of the company&#8217;s right-to-health 
responsibilities relating to access to medicines. GSK should also work with like-minded 
companies to establish an independent mechanism to monitor and hold accountable the relevant 
companies in relation to access to medicines and the right to health. GSK should also consider 
working with an association of pharmaceutical companies with a view to establishing such a 
mechanism. As one step in the right direction, it may wish to establish an independent 
mechanism that focuses on one particular dimension of access to medicines and the right to 
health, such as disclosure of information (see para. 28). Critically, GSK needs an accountability 
mechanism that uses right-to-health standards and is independent, accessible, transparent, and 
effective.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>This report includes numerous conclusions and recommendations for GSK, all 
pharmaceutical companies, States, international organisations and others - and they will 
not be repeated here.</b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>A member of the senior management of an innovator pharmaceutical company 
recently remarked to the Special Rapporteur that the company&#8217;s patents were &#8220;its crown 
jewels&#8221;. The image was revealing. In one sense, the image is legitimate - patents are 
immensely valuable. In another sense, the image reflects a profound misunderstanding of 
the role of a company that develops a life-saving medicine. As discussed in chapter II, such 
a company has performed a critically important social, medical, public health and 
right-to-health function. While the company&#8217;s &#8220;reward&#8221; is the grant of a limited monopoly 
over the medicine, enabling it to enhance shareholder value and invest in further research 
and development, the company also has a right-to-health responsibility to take all 
reasonable steps to make the life-saving medicine as accessible as possible, as soon as 
possible, to all those in need. For a limited period, the company holds the patent for 
society - but the patent must be worked, so far as possible, for the benefit of all those who 
need it. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/12/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>108.<b> The status of innovator companies would be immeasurably enhanced if they did not 
see, and treat, patents as their &#8220;crown jewels&#8221;. Companies must grasp, and publicly 
recognize, their critically important social function and right-to-health responsibilities. 
They must demonstrably do everything possible, within a viable business model, to fulfil 
their social function and human rights responsibilities. Presently, this is not happening. If it 
were to happen, it would not only greatly enhance companies&#8217; status but also pressurize 
States, generic manufacturers and others to provide the environment that companies need 
if they are to enter into arrangements, such as commercial voluntary licences, that enhance 
access to medicines for all.  
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> In 2008, the Special Rapporteur presented to the General Assembly Human Rights 
Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines (A/63/263). 
These provide detailed guidance for all pharmaceutical companies on their right-to-health 
responsibilities, as well as society&#8217;s legitimate &#8220;expectations&#8221; of the pharmaceutical sector.
