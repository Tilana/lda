<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Brunei Darussalam was held at the 9th 
meeting on 2 May 2014. The delegation of Brunei Darussalam was headed by Pehin Dato 
Lim Jock Seng, Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At its 14th meeting held on 
6 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Brunei Darussalam. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Brunei Darussalam: Morocco, Romania and 
Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of

universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Brunei Darussalam was honoured to once again engage with the 
Working Group for the second cycle of the UPR. It referred to its report which highlighted 
Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s ongoing work to improve the welfare of its people and to protecting 
the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women, children, persons with disabilities and the 
elderly. The report also included its responses to the 33 recommendations made during the 
first cycle. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation reiterated that the core policy of His Majesty&#8217;s Government was to 
be people-centred in all aspects, in terms of material as well as spiritual needs. The people 
of Brunei Darussalam enjoyed living in a peaceful and harmonious environment, the 
hallmark of the 30 years of its full independence, which would continue as the State strived 
to realize by 2035, its National Vision of being a nation with highly educated, skilled and 
successful citizens, who will attain a high quality of life in a dynamic and sustainable 
economy. 
</p>
<p>7. His Majesty&#8217;s deep dedication towards the welfare of his people ensured the 
provision of a first-class education system; quality health services, as well as adequate </p>


<p>housing. Citizens and residents alike continued to enjoy the generous subsidies granted by 
the Government for several essential commodities such as fuel, gas, water, rice and sugar. 
</p>
<p>8. Education remained one of the top priorities, accounting for nearly 13 per cent of the 
national budget. The provision of free, quality education from early childhood to tertiary-
level, equally accessible to both boys and girls, was further enhanced. Scholarships to study 
in the country and abroad were granted to eligible students. Brunei Darussalam had attained 
one of the highest literacy rates in the region. Technical and vocational qualification 
opportunities were provided for its people to acquire the necessary skills to increase their 
competitiveness and improve their self-development. Its efforts were in line with the 
Education for All goals of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), and the country ranked 34 out of 127 countries in the 
organization&#8217;s most recent development index. Brunei Darussalam had also worked with 
the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and UNESCO to complement its legislation 
on the nine-year compulsory education currently in place through enhancing the Early 
Childhood Care and Education Programme. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation highlighted that as Brunei Darussalam was a small nation, the health 
of its people was vital to its development. His Majesty&#8217;s Government therefore placed great 
importance on the provision of a comprehensive health care system. Free medical health 
care was provided for citizens. The delegation was proud that Brunei Darussalam had 
achieved many of the targets set by the World Health Organization. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government had adopted an environmental policy direction and strategies in 
implementing its National Development Plan for a healthy environment. The delegation 
was pleased that one of the country&#8217;s most valuable assets was its clean air. Brunei 
Darussalam was home to well-preserved, pristine rainforests with a rich biodiversity, its 
national pride for future generations. Together with the international community, it shared 
the responsibility to save the Earth from global warming. It also cooperated with Malaysia 
and Indonesia in the Heart of Borneo project, whereby about 58 per cent of the island&#8217;s land 
mass has been protected in an effort to preserving the planet. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that His Majesty&#8217;s strong commitment to his people was 
apparent in good times and in times of need. His Majesty&#8217;s continuous concern for the well-
being of his people was demonstrated during the flash floods in some parts of the country, 
in early 2014, when His Majesty personally visited the affected areas to ensure that the 
authorities had responded immediately and efficiently to secure the safety of those 
concerned. Also, a considerable amount of resources had been allocated to relief and repair 
efforts and a budget of about US$55 million had been earmarked for flood mitigation 
measures. 
</p>
<p>12. Those were just some of the efforts Brunei Darussalam had made in promoting and 
protecting the bigger aspects of human rights, in line with the Millennium Development 
Goals. It had achieved almost all of the targets set, especially in eradicating extreme 
poverty. The country ranked 30 out of 187 countries in the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report 2013. It would continue to strive towards 
accelerating development and looked forward to supporting the post-2015 development 
agenda. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation highlighted the efforts of His Majesty&#8217;s Government in protecting 
vulnerable groups in the country. A number of measures had been put in place, such as 
introducing new legislation, amending existing ones and setting up special committees to 
further ensure their rights, included the adoption of the Children and Young Persons Act, 
which led to the establishment in 2010 of a juvenile justice system aimed at ensuring 
appropriate judicial procedures for young offenders. </p>


<p>14. Support was provided for less privileged children through benefits, proper care and 
guidance. Several welfare programmes had been initiated, including the provision of shelter 
homes; an education allowance; as well as various funds for orphans, such as the Crown 
Prince Fund for Orphans. 
</p>
<p>15. Women constituted over half of the country&#8217;s workforce and had actively 
contributed to the development of the country as well as the maintenance of peace and 
security. An increasing number of women held professional posts in various fields, and 
many of them had attained high-level positions in the public and private sectors, such as 
Ambassador-at-Large, Attorney General, Deputy Minister, members of the Legislative 
Council, senior officials in Ministries and entrepreneurs, to name but a few. The 
Government&#8217;s commitment to promoting gender equality was clearly evident in its national 
policies that were applicable to all community sectors. As a result, it had reached a 
remarkable literacy rate of over 95 per cent for girls. In 2013, the Global Gender Gap 
Report of the World Economic Forum  placed Brunei Darussalam in 6th place in terms of 
estimated earned income; 12th place in terms of enrolment in tertiary education; and 17th 
place for wage equality. The rights of women were further protected through legislation 
such as the Islamic Family Law Act and the Married Women Act. 
</p>
<p>16. The welfare of the elderly population continued to be safeguarded through strong 
family and cultural values. In addition to care by their families, the elderly also benefitted 
from a significant social safety net in the form of a monthly pension for all citizens and 
permanent residents who had reached the age of 60. This pension was non-contributory and 
non-means-tested. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government continued to protect the rights of persons with disabilities through 
various efforts, including the provision of monthly allowances, which were also supported 
and complemented by various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) concerned with the 
welfare of persons with specific disabilities. 
</p>
<p>18. Brunei Darussalam, as a monarchy and an Islamic State, continued to uphold the 
institution of the family as the dominant aspect of its culture. The concept of the large 
extended family had long been established and constituted the social safety net. In 2012, the 
first Sunday in May was declared National Family Day to commemorate the importance of 
the family unit. Brunei Darussalam was a close-knit society that was distinctly communal 
and cohesive. Festive occasions such as Eid, Chinese New Year and Christmas were 
celebrated by all members of the diverse community. Relatives and friends exchanged 
visits, good wishes and gifts, which encouraged tolerance among the ethnic and religious 
groups. 
</p>
<p>19. Religious tolerance and understanding were very important. Brunei Darussalam 
became a member of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Group of Friends in 2012 
and participated in several inter-faith dialogues. 
</p>
<p>20. Under the Constitution, Islam was the official religion of Brunei Darussalam, and its 
values and teachings continued to be the way of life for its people. As such, the activities of 
the society revolved around its Malay culture and Islamic faith. Non-Muslims may practise 
their religions in peace and harmony, as provided for in the Constitution. Sharia law had 
been in existence in Brunei Darussalam since the reign of the first monarch in the 14th 
century. The objective of sharia law was to create a society where religion, life, intellect, 
property and lineage were preserved and protected. As an Islamic nation with a strong sense 
of responsibility, in 2013, Brunei Darussalam introduced the Sharia Penal Code Order, 
which would be applied in parallel with the existing civil law. The Order would come into 
effect in phases. 
</p>
<p>21. Brunei Darussalam held the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) in 2013, with the theme &#8220;Our People, Our Future Together&#8221;, and </p>


<p>initiated the implementation of the 2012 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, including the 
publication of a book on the Declaration and its translation into all the ASEAN languages. 
Furthermore, the 23rd ASEAN Summit, held in October 2013, adopted the ASEAN 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Children and the 
Declaration on Strengthening Social Protection. Brunei Darussalam continued to support 
the work of the relevant ASEAN bodies related to human rights. The progress made by 
ASEAN over the past year demonstrated Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s commitment to working 
together with its neighbours and partners, especially in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation reaffirmed Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s commitment to its international 
obligations and indicated that Brunei Darussalam would be ratifying the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in the near future. In 2012, Brunei Darussalam 
submitted its combined initial and second periodic reports to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and its combined second and third periodic 
reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2013. The delegation stated that 
Brunei intended to withdraw its reservations to Article 20, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) relating to the protection of a child without a 
family, and Article 21 (a) on adoption, and that it was working towards ratifying the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC). Furthermore, in support of global efforts towards 
abolishing child labour and as recommended during the first UPR cycle, in 2011, it ratified 
the International Labour Organization (ILO) Minimum Age Convention (No. 138). 
</p><p>23. Brunei Darussalam appreciated the values of peaceful co-existence, mutual respect 
and cooperation and would continue to welcome technical assistance from international 
partners and, at the same time, play its part in providing assistance, including financial 
support, capacity-building and technical cooperation, through various means, such as the 
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and 
the Enrichment Projects for ASEAN. Brunei Darussalam offered scholarships to foreign 
students to pursue higher-level education in its various academic institutions; to date, nearly 
400 scholarships had been awarded to students from over 63 countries. It also actively 
contributed to the initiatives of several United Nations bodies such as World Health 
Organization (WHO), UNICEF, UN-Women and United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
(UNRWA). Brunei would continue to lend its support in the best way it could. 
24. The delegation further highlighted that, being a small State of 400,000 people, 
Brunei Darussalam had very limited human resources and would appreciate assistance with 
capacity-building from international organizations.

human rights.

sections 4 and 6 respectively. Section 4 of the Brunei Nationality Act (Cap. 15) spells out 
the categories of persons who can acquire nationality by operation of law. Section 6 
provides for the acquisition of nationality for a minor by way of registration, upon

section 6 of the Act, children of Bruneian women married to foreign nationals may be 
accorded Brunei nationality upon application.
