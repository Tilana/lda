HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST

Dallas, Texas, August 19, 2016 – Southwest Bank, as Trustee of the Hugoton Royalty Trust
(NYSE: HGT) (the “Trust”), today declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of
beneficial interest of $0.006639 per unit, payable on September 15, 2016, to unitholders of record
on August 31, 2016. The following table shows underlying gas sales and average prices

(a) Sales volumes are recorded in the month the trust receives the related net profits income.
Because of this, sales volumes may fluctuate from month to month based on the timing of
cash receipts.
XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it has deducted budgeted development costs of
$50,000, production expense of $1,356,000 and overhead of $395,000 in determining the royalty
payment to the Trust for the current month.
Other
The current month distribution includes a one-time reimbursement under the Oklahoma
conveyance of approximately $450,000 related to operated overhead corrections for the period
January 2014 through May 2016.
The current month distribution includes additional gathering fees of approximately $500,000 for
the period December 2015 through May 2016 related to a gas purchase contract change that
includes production from properties underlying the Oklahoma conveyance.
Excess Costs
XTO Energy has advised the trustee that continued lower gas prices caused costs to exceed
revenues on properties underlying the Kansas and Wyoming net profits interests. However, these
excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyance.
Reserves
The prior month distribution included a deduction of approximately $274,000 related to fully
replenishing the administrative expense reserve to $1,000,000. The reserve will allow the trust to
pay its obligations should any extraordinary events or expenses occur, especially with
commodity prices at the current level. The trustee will continue to evaluate and revise the reserve
as necessary.

Statements made in this press release regarding future events or conditions are forward looking
statements. Actual future results, including development costs and future net profits, could differ
materially due to changes in natural gas prices and other economic conditions affecting the gas
industry and other factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.
