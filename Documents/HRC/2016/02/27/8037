<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth 
session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Ghana was held at the 4th 
meeting on 23 October 2012. The delegation of Ghana was headed by Ebo Barton Odro, 
Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Minister for Justice. At its 10th meeting, held on 29 
October 2012, the Working Group adopted the report on Ghana. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Ghana: Angola, Norway and Qatar. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Ghana: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation given in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/GHA/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/GHA/2 and Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/GHA/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Ghana through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Ghana conveyed greetings from the President, John Dramani 
Mahama, and paid tribute to the late John Evans Atta Mills, former President of the 
Republic of Ghana, who died on 24th July 2012, for his commitment and contribution to 
peace, not only in Ghana but in Africa as a whole. He was a strong advocate for human 
rights, due process and the rule of law. He also valued the independence of the judiciary 
and other institutions and worked tirelessly to promote these principles. 
</p>
<p>6. Ghana&#8217;s obligation to uphold the human rights of its people is enshrined in the 1992 
Constitution, which provides for the establishment of institutions charged, inter alia, with 
safeguarding the human rights of the people of Ghana, guaranteeing the people&#8217;s access to 
</p>
<p>justice, ensuring the independence of the Media, and empowering the people to contribute 
to the governance and development of the country. 
</p>
<p>7. The National Report for Ghana&#8217;s review sets out some developments since the first 
UPR in May, 2008. The delegation acknowledged the significant contributions of the 
bilateral and multilateral partners by way of budgetary and technical support. Ghana is 
mindful of the effects of the global economic crises on its development partners. Ghana is, 
however, still committed to its development programmes, particularly in matters affecting 
health, education, housing and delivery of other basic services. </p>


<p>8. The delegation also acknowledged the important and significant contribution of civil 
society in ensuring that human rights issues remained high on the Government&#8217;s agenda, 
and in the public consciousness. In the preparation of the national report, Ghana ensured the 
active participation of not only the relevant government institutions, but civil society as 
well. The Ministry of Justice held several meetings and interactions with the Government 
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and collated information gathered for the 
report. Additionally, it collaborated with the National Human Rights Institution (CHRAJ), 
and held informal consultations with civil society organizations. A final meeting was held 
on 20 July 2012 with all stakeholders to validate the report. 
</p>
<p>9. At the first review on 8th May, 2008, Ghana accepted 22 recommendations. 
Progress made in the implementation of the recommendations is clearly set out in the 
national report. The delegation highlighted recent salient developments. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government, in its White Paper to the Report of the Constitutional Review 
Commission, has accepted the recommendation of the Commission to abolish the death 
penalty. Given that it is an entrenched provision of the Constitution, it will have to be 
subjected to a referendum. It is, however, worth mentioning that no executions have taken 
place in Ghana since 1993. 
</p>
<p>11. Since the passing of the Persons with Disability Act, 2006 (Act 75) and the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Ghana 
has established the National Council on Persons with Disability. This Council will evolve 
policies and strategies to enable persons with disability to enter and participate in the 
mainstreaming of the national development process. 
</p>
<p>12. The Mental Health Bill has also been passed into an Act of Parliament.  The Act 
seeks, inter alia, to promote access to basic mental health care in an environment free from 
restrictions, and prevent the abuse of people with mental disorders. 
</p>
<p>13. With regards to the rights of women and children, the Ministry of Women and 
Children&#8217;s Affairs (MOWAC) plays a lead role in the promotion and development of the 
</p>
<p>rights of women and children. Following the passage of the Domestic Violence Act and the 
establishment of the Domestic Violence Secretariat, the Ministry has developed a national 
policy and plan of action to support the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act. 
</p>
<p>14. A number of training, sensitization and awareness-raising programmes on domestic 
violence and discriminatory practices against women have been held for the general public, 
traditional authorities/queen mothers, the media, the police and other stakeholders. The 
Domestic Violence Act has been translated into six major Ghanaian languages, namely 
Nzema, Ga, Twi, Hausa, Ewe and Dagbani, and copies of the translated, abridged and 
simplified versions of the Act are distributed to institutions and the public and key 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. Ghana is committed to ensuring equal rights of women in matters related to property 
and inheritance. There are currently two Bills before Parliament:  the Property Rights of 
Spouses Bill, and  the Intestate Succession Amendment Bill. The Ministry of Justice, 
MOWAC and some civil society organizations are engaging the Parliamentary Select 
Committee on Gender and Children to have the Bills passed speedily into law. 
</p>
<p>16. Concerning access to justice for the vulnerable, the delegation reported that special 
courts have been set up at the High Courts to deal with human rights cases. These are called 
Human Rights Courts. Additionally, a Gender-Based Violence Court has been set up as a 
pilot project to deal with domestic violence cases, with a view to improving women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>access to justice. 
</p>
<p>17. The national Legal Aid Programme under the Ministry of Justice continues to 
provide legal aid for indigent persons, including women. However, participation by lawyers </p>


<p>is not adequate and this constitutes a challenge to the Government&#8217;s Legal Aid Programme. 
Government and the Ghana Bar Association are collaborating to address the problem. In the 
meantime, the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) 
continues to provide mediation services for women to actualize their right to access justice. 
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Justice is also focused on implementing the Remand Review Project 
of the Justice for All Programme, instituted in 2007. This has led to an increase in the 
release of the number of remand prisoners who have outstayed their remand warrants, 
resulting in a significant reduction in the remand population. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to health, as noted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health on 
his recent visit, Ghana has made significant progress in the health-related Millennium 
Development Goals. In 2011, the Ghana Aids Commission launched the National HIV 
Strategic Plan 2011-2015, which is aimed at enhancing the implementation of the national 
response to dealing with HIV and AIDS. Various educational campaigns aimed at 
addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, as well as the rights of the most-at-risk 
populations (MARPs) and persons living with HIV. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to education, there has been a steady increase in female enrolment in 
schools, which could be attributed to the increased awareness programmes, community 
mobilization and sensitization at the basic school level. The inclusion of lessons and 
activities on education as a human right in the school curriculum, the use of fliers, posters, 
durbars, drama as well as radio and TV discussions, have increased children&#8217;s awareness of 
</p>
<p>their right to education. Other interventions by government and NGOS to increase 
enrolment and retention of females in schools to bridge the gender gap include scholarships 
to needy girls to enable them to access secondary education and the introduction of a quota 
system by the public universities. Challenges however remain, with inadequate 
infrastructure and information and communication technology (ICT) facilities. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation stressed that Ghana is committed to addressing corruption in all its 
forms, in particular in the public sector. Ghana is<b> </b>mindful of the debilitating effects of 
corruption on the socio-economic development of Ghana. Consequently, a workplan for the 
execution of an anti-corruption project has been prepared in collaboration with 
stakeholders. A National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) has been laid before 
Parliament for adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the interactive dialogue, 76 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>23. Bulgaria noted the establishment of a Domestic Violence Secretariat and a national 
policy to combat domestic violence. Bulgaria noted the commitment of Ghana to equal 
participation; however it expressed concern over the lack of a legal framework for 
affirmative action policy. Bulgaria made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>39. Estonia recognized the importance of human rights in Ghana&#8217;s domestic policy. It 
appreciated the standing invitation to United Nations Special Procedures. Estonia expressed </p>

</p>
<p>Ghana on Internet freedom but deplored low access. Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Ethiopia congratulated Ghana on ratification of CRPD and the recognition of female

</p>
<p>63. The delegation then addressed (advance) questions it had received from the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Mexico, Germany, Slovenia, Spain, Luxembourg and 
Canada. 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to measures to ensure that victims of violence are not obliged to pay the 
cost of their medical examination (Czech Republic), Ghana emphasized that the Domestic 
Violence Act provides for free medical care for victims of violence. The Police Hospital in </p>


<p>Accra offers free medical treatment and the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit 
(DOVVSU) also pays for other medical services. Additionally, the Ministry of Women and 
Children&#8217;s Affairs (MOWAC) has set up a fund to assist victims of domestic violence 
</p>
<p>abuse which would soon become operational. 
</p>
<p>65. On the status of the Right to Information Bill, (Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Netherlands), the delegation reported that it is currently being considered by Parliament. 
The Bill is in line with the international standard for freedom of expression in that it 
provides for maximum disclosure in relation to governance. It also provides for restrictions 
regarding public safety and national security inter alia. It is likely to be passed next year. 
</p>
<p>66. On the issue of trokosi and witch camps (Germany), the delegation emphasized that 
the issue of violence against persons suspected of practising witchcraft is a challenge, given 
that it deals with entrenched beliefs, which makes it difficult to eradicate through 
legislation. Although the Ghanaian Criminal Offences Act criminalizes lynching, 
maltreatment and other human rights abuses, extensive education in these areas is needed 
and is ongoing. There is also the need to protect those who have been forced to flee their 
homes, as well as make life more comfortable for them in refugee camps. 
</p>
<p>67. The practice of trokosi has been criminalized by the Criminal Offences Act. This is 
also a practice firmly rooted in the cultural beliefs of a few communities. Ghana is 
committed to continuing the extensive educational campaigns and consultations already in 
progress to change the mind-sets of persons who indulge in these practices. 
</p>
<p>68. With regard to steps taken to promote an improved dialogue and relationship 
between mining companies, security forces and mining communities (the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), the delegation acknowledged that the mining 
industry in Ghana has witnessed some challenges in recent times, notably illegal mining 
and its attendant environmental hazards and dissatisfaction among the mining communities, 
which finds expression in conflict. To adequately address these problems, Parliament 
passed six sets of regulations in June 2012, to give full effect to the Minerals and Mining 
Act. 
</p>
<p>69. Ghana is furthermore committed to ensuring that businesses in the mining sector as 
well as in the other sectors of the economy give due regard to human rights issues in their 
operations. Ghana welcomes the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights for 
implementing the United Nations Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework as it will help 
the country address protection gaps in respect of business-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>70. Regarding the country&#8217;s National Reconciliation Commission (Mexico), the 
delegation stated that this Commission was set up to provide a platform for victims of 
human rights abuses to share their painful experiences and seek reparation. The 
Commission recommended reparations to victims in the form of monetary awards which 
have been fully paid. Some also had confiscated properties returned to them. Those who 
still feel dissatisfied have the right to petition the Attorney General. 
</p>
<p>71. As to what is being done about the situation in the prisons (Germany), the delegation 
reported that several interventions have been put in place to improve conditions in the 
prisons. The amount allocated for feeding of each prisoner has been increased from 
US$0.40 to US$1.00. In addition, a percentage of foodstuffs produced on prison farms 
across the country is used to supplement the rations of the inmates. 
</p>
<p>72. All prisoners are classified as indigents under the National Health Insurance Scheme 
(NHIS) and thus enjoy free registration, enabling them to access good health-care services 
under the Scheme. Prisoners who contract communicable diseases are sent to a health 
facility for care. Recently the Ministry of Health has directed that doctors should be 
attached to the various prisons. </p>


<p>73. To deal with congestion in the country&#8217;s prisons, Government in 2011 completed the 
construction of a maximum security prison with a holding capacity for 2,000 inmates, at 
Ankaful in the Central Region. Inmates from other prisons are being moved to the new 
prison facility to ease the congestion. 
</p>
<p>74. As regards the measures to address the gaps in coverage of the NHIS (Slovenia), the 
Government is presently exploring alternative means of financing the NHIS. 
</p>
<p>75. Concerning whether Ghana will end its policy of non-equal treatment of 
homosexuals and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in general 
(Germany) and how Ghana will apply the principle of non-discrimination in relation to the 
issue of homosexuality, (the Netherlands), the delegation emphasized that Ghana does not 
have a policy of non-equal treatment of its citizens. The Constitution entrenches the 
fundamental principles of non-discrimination and equality. It also guarantees the freedom 
of religion and the rights of persons to practise that religion. The Constitution also provides 
for the legislature to enact laws that further the social cohesion and economic development 
of the people. 
</p>
<p>76. On the CAT recommendation to criminalize marital rape, the delegation highlighted 
that the rape provision in the Criminal Offences Act does not make any distinction among 
women. It is applicable to all females above sixteen, married or unmarried, and nor are 
perpetrators of the offence of rape defined to exclude spouses. Section 42(g), which made 
marriage a defence to rape, has now been expunged from the statute. 
</p>
<p>77. On the measures to protect victims of child trafficking (Spain), the Government, 
together with MOWAC, the Department of Social Welfare and civil society organizations, 
has stepped up sensitization efforts in the rural communities and areas of high risk. A 
number of training programmes have also been undertaken by the Ministry of the Interior, 
Ghana Immigration Service and Ghana Police Service to equip them with the skills and 
capacities needed to detect, deter and prevent child trafficking. MOWAC has also 
constructed a number of shelters for victims of trafficking and continues to solicit support 
from the private sector and other concerned actors. 
</p>
<p>78. As to measures to combat the high maternal mortality rate (Luxembourg), the 
delegation indicated that some women do not attend hospitals due to financial constraints 
and that the Government has made medical treatment for pregnant women free, which has 
gone a long way to decreasing the number of maternal deaths. There is also increased 
education of women and training of traditional birth attendants to provide safe maternal 
care during pregnancy and delivery. Additionally, comprehensive abortion care is being 
carried out by the Ministry of Health to ensure that no woman dies from unsafe abortion. 
</p>
<p>79. Concerning the outcome of the review process, including the establishment of the 
Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit of the Ghana Police Service (DOVVSU), the 
adoption of a strategic plan and the progress achieved so far (Canada), the delegation stated 
that DOVVSU has undertaken a number of activities intended to sensitize the public on the 
need to respect women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, to desist from violent conduct and resolve 
</p>
<p>internal disputes through peaceful means. Significant strides have been made in advancing 
women&#8217;s social, economic, civil and political rights. Participation of women in public life 
has also improved. It is worth noting that the Speaker of Parliament and the Chief Justice 
are women. 
</p>
<p>80. Ratification of OP-CAT and the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, on the involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC), and on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC), has been approved 
by Cabinet, and will soon be considered by Parliament for ratification. </p>


<p>81. Poland thanked Ghana for its informative national report and noted its efforts to 
ensure better protection of human rights, including in the area of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
