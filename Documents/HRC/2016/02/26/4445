<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  On 4 June 2010, during its fourteenth session, the Human Rights Council held a 
panel discussion on the protection of journalists in armed conflict, pursuant to its resolution 
13/24. In the resolution, the Council further requested the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner (OHCHR) to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the International Committee of 
the Red Cross and all concerned parties and stakeholders, including relevant press 
organizations and associations and United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>2.  The panel discussion aimed to: (a) draw the attention of the international community 
to the dangers faced by journalists in armed conflict; (b) take an inventory of international 
frameworks and agreements applicable to journalists and the media in situations of armed 
conflict and the status of their implementation; and (c) contribute to the development of an 
appropriate response by the Human Rights Council.   
</p>
<p>3. The panel discussion was chaired by Mr. Alex Van Meeuwen (Belgium), President 
of the Human Rights Council; moderated by Mr. Hisham Badr (Egypt), Vice-President of 
the Human Rights Council; and opened by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Ms. Kyung-wha Kang. The panellists were: Mr. Frank La Rue, Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Mr. 
Robin Geiss, legal adviser in the Legal Division of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC); Mr. Mogens Schmidt, Deputy Assistant of the Director-General for 
Communication and Information and Director of the Division for Freedom of Expression, 
Democracy and Peace at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO); Mr. Osama Saraya, Editor-in-Chief of <i>Al Ahram</i> newspaper; Mr. 
Omar Faruk Osman, President of the Federation of African Journalists, an organization 
affiliated with the International Federation of Journalists; and Ms. Hedayat Abdel Nabi, 
President of the Press Emblem Campaign.  
</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to Council resolution 13/24, the present summary has been prepared by 
OHCHR.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her opening remarks, 
commended the Council for placing the important issue of the protection of journalists in 
armed conflict high on its agenda, and underscored the vital role played by journalists 
amidst the so-called &#8220;fog of war&#8221; to keep the world informed about the truth and facts 
unfolding on the ground. However, she noted that despite unequivocal norms enshrined in 
international humanitarian and human rights law guaranteeing their protection, deliberate 
attempts to target journalists in areas of ongoing conflict continued to increase. As such 
attacks were committed with impunity, the Deputy High Commissioner stressed that other 
would-be abusers were encouraged to follow suit. Noting that the erosion in the observance 
of the international norms highlighted the need to take proactive measures to ensure they 
would be fully respected and implemented, she called for the development of a common 
approach to protect journalists in armed conflict not only across United Nations entities, but 
in the international community as a whole. 
</p>
<p>6.  Mr. Frank La Rue, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, emphasized that under international human rights 
</p>
<p><b>2</b>  </p>


<p>law, States have a threefold obligation to respect, protect and fulfil all individuals&#8217; right to 
freedom of expression, and when violations occur, to fully investigate such acts, to 
prosecute persons responsible, and to provide victims with effective remedy. Emphasizing 
that such human rights obligations continued to apply during times of armed conflict 
alongside international humanitarian law, the Special Rapporteur noted that they were also 
applicable in situations of internal disturbances and tensions where there might be use of 
force, but the threshold of armed conflict had not yet been crossed. In his view, the main 
problem with regard to continuing attacks against journalists lay not in the lack of 
international legal standards and norms, but in the lack of vigorous implementation of the 
existing rules. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concerns that the perpetrators of 
attacks against journalists and other media professionals had enjoyed total impunity in 94 
per cent of cases recorded in 2009, while the percentage of cases in which even some 
partial measure of justice had been obtained was minimal. He underscored that in only 2 
per cent of the cases of attacks against journalists in 2009 had the offences been tried before 
the competent authorities and the perpetrators and instigators prosecuted. Stressing that 
preventing impunity functioned as the most important deterrent against the repetition of 
such attacks, he stressed the necessity of exploring ways to improve compliance with 
existing norms, and encouraged the Council to continue its deliberation on that pressing 
topic in its future sessions. The Special Rapporteur also suggested that the Council 
undertake an in-depth study on the issue.  
</p>
<p>7.  Mr. Robin Geiss of ICRC expressed concerns that experiences from recent armed 
conflicts showed that, in addition to being exposed to dangerous situations because of the 
nature of their work, media professionals were increasingly prone to becoming victims of 
direct attacks in violation of international humanitarian law. He further noted that 
intentional attacks against journalists, as civilians, constituted a war crime under the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court. Since images and news could have a decisive 
impact on the outcome of armed conflicts in the information era, he emphasized that the 
obstruction of journalists&#8217; tasks in times of armed conflict was alarmingly frequent, ranging 
from denial of access, censorship and harassment, to arbitrary detention and direct attacks 
against media professionals. While it might appear that international humanitarian law does 
not provide much protection for journalists at first sight, the panellist stressed that as 
civilians, journalists in fact enjoyed comprehensive protection against direct attacks, 
arbitrary detention, and internment during armed conflict. He also stated that the most 
serious deficiency was the lack of vigorous implementation of existing rules, and of 
systematic investigation, prosecution and sanction of violations, rather than a lack of rules. 
In that regard, he stressed the role that ICRC plays to protect journalists, in particular by 
making the rules regarding the protection of journalists and civilians in armed conflict more 
widely known and better respected, and asserted that improved compliance with existing 
rules should be the foremost objective.  
</p>
<p>8.  Mr. Mogens Schmidt of UNESCO observed that the number of journalists killed 
when reporting from conflict and war zones had risen steadily since 2002, but also noted 
that there had also been a radical increase in the killing of media professionals during times 
of peace. He stressed that the safety of journalists was an issue that affected all, and that 
every aggression against a journalist was an attack on the most fundamental freedoms. 
According to the panellist, one of the aggravating factors that made it difficult to ensure the 
protection of journalists in conflict and war zones was that currently many conflicts were 
not only fought between States, but involved insurgents and terrorists who did not respect 
international humanitarian or human rights law. To enhance their protection, the panellist 
underscored the need for media staff to receive safety and first aid training, so that they 
would be prepared to confront the risks inherent in war zones, and so that they could learn 
how to behave appropriately in the face of danger, and how to deal with the effects of 
traumatic events. He also emphasized that media staff must be appropriately equipped and 
</p>
<p> <b>3 </b></p>


<p>insured, and that a personal follow-up should be provided to them after completion of a 
dangerous assignment. Additionally, he stated that Governments and their military and 
security services could contribute to the safety of media staff by providing valuable 
information on the safety conditions in the field and by giving appropriate instructions to 
the troops on the rights of media staff.  
</p>
<p>9.  Mr. Osama Saraya of <i>Al Ahram</i> newspaper stated that the conflict in Iraq shed the 
most light on the issue of the protection of journalists in areas of armed conflict, as more 
than 280 journalists had been killed during the conflict. He pointed out that none of the 
persons guilty of killing those journalists had been brought to justice. The panellist stated 
that journalists were the intermediary for truth, and killing a journalist expanded the 
scourge and further complicated the conflict itself. In addition, he drew the attention of the 
Council to the fact that death was not the only result of the phenomenon of attacks against 
journalists, as many journalists who had worked in situations of armed conflict, including 
his colleagues, lived with trauma and could not function in the workplace due to physical 
and mental scars and injuries. The panellist also underlined that many of the current 
conflicts were intractable with some of them lasting for decades, which often fed terrorism 
and terrorist groups that imposed their own laws in the conflict zones. He therefore stressed 
that a firm solution must be found to such conflicts, and that news agencies intending to 
cover a conflict situation must factor in terrorism and organized crime as well. He also 
emphasized that international cooperation should prioritize technical assistance to 
developing countries in that field, so as to enable local journalists to do their job and to 
enjoy the protection by the State. Finally, the panellist expressed his continuing 
commitment to seek new and innovative ways to ensure the protection of journalists.  
</p>
<p>10.  Mr. Omar Faruk Osman of the Federation of African Journalists provided an 
overview of the safety and security situation of journalists in Africa, and stated that their 
predicament was further complicated by the fact that they had to face not only repressive 
Governments, but also armed gangs and militias. He also underlined that the political will 
to end the culture of impunity was almost nonexistent, which in turn perpetrated crimes 
against journalists. He further stressed that human rights could not be guaranteed in the 
absence of press freedom and freedom of expression, while freedom of expression could 
not exist when journalists were not protected and suffered death or violence for telling the 
truth. Emphasizing that there were already sufficient legal standards in place, the panellist 
stressed that neither the Federation of African Journalists nor the International Federation 
of Journalists supported the notion of a new international law to agree on a press emblem. 
He underlined that journalists had already accepted insignia which were universally known, 
and thus a new emblem would do little more than raise new concerns about Governmental 
control over the licensing of journalists. While welcoming the adoption of Security Council 
resolution 1738 (2006) on the protection of journalists in armed conflict, the panellist 
stressed that the Human Rights Council should develop a mechanism to encourage States to 
transpose the resolution into their national legislation.  
</p>
<p>11.  Ms. Hedayat Abdel Nabi of the Press Emblem Campaign noted that the panel 
discussion coincided with the sixth anniversary of the creation of the Campaign, which had 
been established by a group of journalists in Geneva for the protection of journalists in 
armed conflict and dangerous situations. Stressing the difference between journalists who 
were present in armed conflicts by choice, and civilians who were present in such situations 
by accident, the panellist underscored the need to rethink, or revise, existing rules. In that 
regard, she referred to ideas presented by the Press Emblem Campaign in December 2007, 
including, inter alia, the adoption of an internationally recognized press emblem to identify 
journalists; the guarantee of unhindered, unfettered and uninterrupted Internet services by 
the authorities concerned; the establishment of mechanisms of inquiry into attacks against 
journalists; the establishment of &#8220;media corridors&#8221; by parties to a conflict to protect 
journalists and media installation; and the establishment of a compensation fund and an 
</p>
<p><b>4</b>  </p>


<p>insurance scheme. The panellist called on the Council to develop guidelines for the 
protection of journalists, which would lead to a global compact, either through the creation 
of a working group of the Advisory Committee of the Council, or by setting up an ad hoc 
intergovernmental working group.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Dangers and risks faced by journalists in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>12.  Several delegations expressed concern that journalists were deliberately targeted in 
areas of ongoing armed conflict as a result of their role in exposing human rights abuses 
and atrocities, corruption or unpopular opinions or situations. It was noted that such attacks 
constituted a violation not only of the journalists&#8217; right to freedom of expression, but also of 
the public&#8217;s right to receive information or the truth, which is an essential component of 
any democratic society. It was further emphasized that common dangers and risks faced by 
journalists in armed conflict included killings, abductions, hostage-taking, arbitrary arrests 
and detention, enforced or involuntary disappearances and acts of harassment and 
intimidation. One speaker also noted that, due to the work that they did, journalists were 
often suspected as spies during armed conflict, and either eliminated or used deliberately as 
&#8220;bargaining chips&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>13. In their statements, several delegations and speakers noted that such dangers and 
risks faced by journalists were exacerbated by the complexity of current armed conflicts, as 
they were no longer limited to two regular armies fighting each other, and multiple non-
State actors were involved, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish civilians from 
non-civilians in such asymmetric conflicts. Additionally, new weapons and methods of 
warfare were used, and the frontline of conflicts was often ill-defined and changed 
frequently.  
</p>
<p>14. It was further noted by several delegations that journalists were often targeted even 
in situations where there was no armed conflict, for example where organized crime was 
prevalent. In addition, a view was also expressed that journalists must also be protected by 
the occupying forces in situations of occupation.  
</p>
<p>15. Many delegations also expressed concern that only rarely were attacks against 
journalists investigated and persons responsible brought to account, thus perpetrating an 
environment of impunity. In that regard, it was noted that in the past 12 years more than 
1,100 journalists and media staff had been killed in the course of duty, yet almost none of 
those cases had been investigated or prosecuted, even in cases of targeted killings.   
</p>
<p><b> B. International norms and standards applicable to journalists in armed 
conflict and their implementation  
</b></p>
<p>16. Many delegations referred to the provisions in international humanitarian law which 
guarantee the protection of journalists either as embedded journalists or as civilians. In the 
case of the former, many delegations highlighted that as stipulated in article 4, section A, 
paragraph 4, of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Third 
Geneva Convention of 1949), embedded journalists or war correspondents are entitled to 
prisoner of war status when they fall into the power of the enemy. In the case of non-
embedded journalists, it was noted that, as stipulated in article 79 of the Protocol Additional 
to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and Relating to the Protection of Victims of 
International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), journalists engaged in dangerous professional 
missions in areas of armed conflict must be considered as civilians and enjoy the 
</p>
<p> <b>5 </b></p>


<p>corresponding guarantees and protection under international humanitarian law. Although 
Protocol I applies only to situations of international armed conflict, several delegations 
noted that the protection of journalists as civilians was considered to be a norm of 
customary international law, and thus it also applied to situations of non-international 
armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>17. While noting that journalists were protected as civilians under international 
humanitarian law unless and for such time as they took direct part in hostilities, several 
delegations stressed that performing tasks in the conduct of their profession, such as 
recording videos, taking photographs or recording information, did not constitute direct 
participation in hostilities.  
</p>
<p>18.  Several delegations concurred with the panellists that an intentional attack against 
journalists, as civilians, constituted not only a violation of international humanitarian law 
and international human rights law, but also a war crime under the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>19.  Many delegations also highlighted the importance of Security Council resolution 
1738 (2006), in which the Security Council condemned intentional attacks against 
journalists, media professionals and associated personnel and called upon all parties to put 
an end to such practices. In addition, several delegations noted that as civilians, journalists 
also enjoyed protection under other Security Council resolutions on the protection of 
civilians during armed conflict, including resolution 1894 of 2009. However, several 
delegations also expressed concern that the recommendations outlined in those Security 
Council resolutions had yet to be fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>20.  In addition to Security Council resolutions on the protection of journalists and 
civilians during armed conflict, some delegations also noted the relevance of the Medell&#237;n 
Declaration on securing the safety of journalists and combating impunity, adopted by the 
participants of the UNESCO conference on press freedom, safety of journalists and 
impunity in 2007.  
</p>
<p>21. While a view was expressed for the need to reevaluate existing norms and 
conventions due to the changes in the nature of modern warfare, most delegations stressed 
that existing protection afforded to journalists under international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law was sufficient, but that the instruments were not being 
implemented on the ground.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Proposals to enhance the protection of journalists in armed conflict and 
recommendations to the Human Rights Council  
</b></p>
<p>22. In order to enhance the protection of journalists in armed conflict, several 
delegations emphasized the importance for States to train their armed forces, security 
personnel and other law enforcement agencies to protect journalists, as well as to support 
concrete safety training of journalists in conflict areas. The need to enhance the safety and 
security of United Nations personnel who worked to protect journalists and other civilians 
in armed conflict was also raised. 
</p>
<p>23. Many delegations and speakers stressed the obligation of States and the international 
community to ensure that all attacks against journalists were promptly investigated, and that 
those found responsible were brought to justice in accordance with international fair-trial 
standards. The importance of establishing prevention mechanisms to support the safety of 
journalists and criminal justice reform to support effective investigations and prosecutions 
of attacks and killings against journalists was also emphasized. It was also noted that 
putting an end to impunity was the best way to protect journalists and media professionals.  
</p>
<p><b>6</b>  </p>


<p>24.  Some delegations recommended that the Human Rights Council play a 
complementary and supportive role to the work of the Security Council and other 
international bodies and organizations to protect journalists in armed conflict, by focusing 
on human rights aspects of violence against journalists around the world, such as violations 
of the right to freedom of expression, arbitrary arrest and detention and reprisals against 
journalists. Delegations and panellists also stressed that documentation of violations, for 
example through the Human Rights Council, the Security Council and UNESCO, played a 
key role in overcoming cultures of impunity and ensuring accountability. Suggestions were 
also made to have a comprehensive report to document attacks on journalists worldwide, 
and for the United Nations Secretary-General to present a specific report on the 
implementation of Security Council resolution 1738.  
</p>
<p>25. Some delegations also welcomed the report on the issue of protection of journalists 
submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and encouraged the Special 
Rapporteur to enhance his cooperation with human rights treaty monitoring bodies and 
other organizations, including regional organizations and non-governmental organizations, 
to promote the rights of journalists to perform their job in a safe as possible environment in 
areas of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>26. Noting that the creation of robust democratic institutions and adequate judicial and 
administrative mechanisms enhanced the ability of States to protect and secure the rights of 
all individuals, including journalists, a recommendation was also made to the Human 
Rights Council to assist States emerging from armed conflict to rebuild their legal and 
institutional frameworks and to create conditions to promote and protect the right to 
freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>27.  Several delegations also noted the need to address the protection of journalists in all 
situations, not limited to armed conflict, and suggested that the Human Rights Council 
consider holding a further panel discussion on that topic as follow-up.  
</p>
<p>28. In his concluding remarks, the Vice-President of the Council stated that the panel 
was an exceptional opportunity to bring to light the perils encountered by journalists in 
armed conflict. He noted that the recommendations formulated through the panel should 
serve as guidance in devising concrete action, including an appropriate response by the 
Human Rights Council.
