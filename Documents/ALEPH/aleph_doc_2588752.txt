FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF 
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF LEGACY RESERVES LP
THIS FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF
LEGACY RESERVES LP dated as of June 17, 2014, is entered into by and among Legacy
Reserves GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the General Partner, and any other
Persons who become Partners in the Partnership or parties hereto as provided herein. In
consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
Section 1.1 Definitions.
The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the
contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.
“Accredited Investor” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 501(a) promulgated
under the Securities Act.
“Acquisition” means, as the context requires, (a) any transaction in which any Group Member
acquires (through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of investment)
control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or business of another Person for the
purpose of increasing, over the long term, the production of the oil and natural gas properties
owned by the Partnership Group or the operating capacity of other assets owned by the
Partnership Group, in each case from the production or operating capacity of the Partnership
Group existing immediately prior to such transaction or (b) the assets acquired in any transaction
described by clause (a) hereof.
“Additional Book Basis” means, with respect to any Adjusted Property, the portion of any
remaining Carrying Value of such Adjusted Property that is attributable to positive adjustments
made to such Carrying Value determined in accordance with the provisions set forth below in this
definition of Additional Book Basis. For purposes of determining the extent to which Carrying
Value constitutes Additional Book Basis:
(a)    Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property as a result of
either a Book-Down Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be deemed to offset or decrease that
portion of the Carrying Value of such Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive
adjustments made thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event.
(b)    If Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a result of a Book-
Down Event and the Carrying Value of other property is increased as a result of such Book-Down
Event, an allocable portion of any such increase in Carrying Value shall be treated as Additional
Book Basis; provided, that the amount treated as Additional Book Basis pursuant hereto as a
result of such Book-Down Event shall not exceed the amount by which the Aggregate Remaining
Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event exceeds the remaining
1
Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnership’s Adjusted Property after such Book-
Down Event (determined without regard to the application of this clause (b) to such Book-Down
Event).
“Additional Book Basis Derivative Items” means any Book Basis Derivative Items that are
computed with reference to Additional Book Basis. To the extent that the Additional Book Basis
attributable to all of the Partnership’s Adjusted Property as of the beginning of any taxable period
exceeds the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of the beginning of such period
(the “Excess Additional Book Basis”), the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items for such period
shall be reduced by the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items determined without regard to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis
bears to the Additional Book Basis as of the beginning of such period. With respect to a
Disposed of Adjusted Property, the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items shall be the amount
of Additional Book Basis taken into account in computing gain or loss from the disposition of
such Disposed of Adjusted Property; provided that the provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall apply to the determination of the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
attributable to Disposed of Adjusted Property.
“Adjusted Capital Account” means, with respect to any Partner, the balance in such Partner’s
Capital Account at the end of each taxable period of the Partnership after giving effect to the
following adjustments:
(a)    credit to such Capital Account any amounts such Partner is (x) obligated to restore under the
standards set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) or (y) deemed obligated to
restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and
1.704-2(i)(5); and
(b)    debit to such Capital Account the items described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5) and 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6).
The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
The “Adjusted Capital Account” of a Partner in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be the
amount that such Adjusted Capital Account would be if such Partnership Interest were the only
interest in the Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on which such
Partnership Interest was first issued.
“Adjusted Operating Surplus” means, with respect to any period, (a) Operating Surplus generated
with respect to such period; (b) less (i) the amount of any net increase in Working Capital
Borrowings (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of any net increase in Working Capital
Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect to that period; and
(ii) the amount of any net decrease in cash reserves (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of
any net decrease in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for
Operating Expenditures with respect to such period not relating to an Operating Expenditure
made with respect to such period; and (c) plus (i) the amount of any net decrease in Working
Capital Borrowings (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of any net decrease in Working
Capital Borrowings in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) with respect to that
period; (ii)
2
the amount of any net increase in cash reserves (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of any
net increase in cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) for Operating
Expenditures with respect to such period required by any debt instrument for the repayment of
principal, interest or premium; and (iii) the amount of any net decrease made in subsequent
periods in cash reserves for Operating Expenditures initially established with respect to such
period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in Adjusted Operating Surplus in
subsequent periods pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above. Adjusted Operating Surplus does not
include that portion of Operating Surplus included in clause (a)(i) of the definition of Operating
Surplus.
“Adjusted Property” means any property the Carrying Value of which has been adjusted pursuant
to a Revaluation Event.
“Affiliate” means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person
in question. As used herein, the term “control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement,
the General Partner and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any IDR Holder, on the other, shall
not be considered Affiliates solely as a result of such IDR Holder owning Incentive Distribution
Units.
“Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Units” has the meaning assigned to such term in Section
5.11(a).
“Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments” means, as of the end of any taxable period, the
sum of the Remaining Net Positive Adjustments of all the Partners.
“Agreed Allocation” means any allocation, other than a Required Allocation, of an item of income,
gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.1, including a Curative Allocation
(if appropriate to the context in which the term “Agreed Allocation” is used).
“Agreed Value” of (a) a Contributed Property means the fair market value of such property or
other consideration at the time of contribution and (b) an Adjusted Property means the fair market
value of such Adjusted Property on the date of the Revaluation Event, in each case as
determined by the General Partner. The General Partner shall use such method as it determines
to be appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of Contributed Properties contributed to
the Partnership in a single or integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis
proportional to the fair market value of each Contributed Property.
“Agreement” means this Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of
Legacy Reserves LP, as it may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to time.
“Alternative Form Consideration” means cash, securities or other property or assets (including
any combination thereof).
“Applicable Period” means with respect to determining the amount of Available Cash for
distribution to (i) the Unitholders or IDR Holders, as applicable, any Quarter ending prior to the
Liquidation Date, and (ii) the Series A Holders or Series B Holders, any month ending prior to the
Liquidation Date.
3
“Arrears” means, with respect to Preferred Distributions for any monthly period, that the full
cumulative Preferred Distributions, as applicable, through the most recent Preferred Distribution
Payment Date have not been paid on the Preferred Units Outstanding as of such monthly period.
“Associate” means, when used to indicate a relationship with any Person, (a) any corporation or
organization of which such Person is a director, officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the
owner of 20% or more of any class or series of voting stock or other voting interest; (b) any trust or
other estate in which such Person has at least a 20% beneficial interest or as to which such
Person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (c) any relative or spouse of such
Person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same principal residence as such Person.
“Available Cash” means, with respect to any Applicable Period:
(c)    the sum of (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group (or the Partnership’s
proportionate share of cash and cash equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly
owned) on hand at the end of such Applicable Period and (ii) all additional cash and cash
equivalents of the Partnership Group (or the Partnership’s proportionate share of cash and cash
equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand on the date of
determination of Available Cash with respect to such Applicable Period resulting from Working
Capital Borrowings made subsequent to the end of such Applicable Period, less
(d)    the amount of any cash reserves established by the General Partner (or the Partnership’s
proportionate share of cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) to (i)
provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership Group (including reserves for
future capital expenditures including drilling and acquisitions and for anticipated future credit
needs of the Partnership Group), (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security
agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Group
Member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject, (iii) provide funds for Series A
Payments or Series B Payments or (iv) provide funds for distributions under Section 6.3 with
respect to any one or more of the next four Quarters; provided, however, that disbursements
made by a Group Member or cash reserves established, increased or reduced after the end of
such Applicable Period but on or before the date of determination of Available Cash with respect
to such Applicable Period shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or
reduced, for purposes of determining Available Cash, within such Applicable Period if the
General Partner so determines.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Available Cash” with respect to the Applicable Period in which
the Liquidation Date occurs and any subsequent Applicable Period shall equal zero.
“Beneficial Owner” has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under
the Exchange Act, except that in calculating the beneficial ownership of any particular “person”
(as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), such “person” will be deemed to
have beneficial ownership of all securities that such “person” has the right to acquire by
conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such right is currently exercisable or is
4
exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition. The terms “Beneficially Owns”
and “Beneficially Owned” have correlative meanings.
“Board of Directors” means the board of directors or managers of a corporation or limited liability
company, as applicable, or if a limited partnership, the board of directors or board of managers of
the general partner of such limited partnership, as applicable.

depletion, or gain or loss with respect to an Adjusted Property).
“Book-Down Event” means a Revaluation Event that gives rise to a Net Termination Loss.
“Book-Tax Disparity” means with respect to any item of Contributed Property or Adjusted
Property, as of the date of any determination, the difference between the Carrying Value of such
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property and the adjusted basis thereof for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as of such date. A Partner’s share of the Partnership’s Book-Tax Disparities in all of
its Contributed Property and Adjusted Property will be reflected by the difference between such
Partner’s Capital Account balance as maintained pursuant to Section 5.5 and the hypothetical
balance of such Partner’s Capital Account computed as if it had been maintained strictly in
accordance with U.S. federal income tax accounting principles.
“Book-Up Event” means a Revaluation Event that gives rise to Net Termination Gain.
“Business Day” means Monday through Friday of each week, except that a legal holiday
recognized as such by the government of the United States of America or the State of Texas shall
not be regarded as a Business Day.

such Capital Account would be if such Partnership Interest were the only interest in the
Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on which such Partnership Interest was
first issued.
“Capital Contribution” means any cash, cash equivalents or the Net Agreed Value of Contributed
Property that a Partner contributes to the Partnership; or that is contributed or deemed contributed
to the Partnership on behalf of a Partner (including, in the case of an underwritten offering of

“Capital Improvement” means any (a) development of, or addition or improvement to, capital
assets owned by any Group Member, (b) construction of new, or acquisition or replacement of
existing, capital assets by any Group Member or (c) capital contribution by any Group Member to
a Person that is not a Subsidiary in which such Group Member has, or after such capital
contribution will have, an equity interest to fund such Group Member’s pro rata share of the cost
of the development of, or addition or improvement to, capital assets owned by such Person, or
the construction of new, or acquisition or replacement of existing, capital assets by such Person,
in each case if such development, addition, improvement, construction, acquisition or
replacement is made to increase, over the long term, the production levels of the oil and natural
gas properties of
5
the Partnership Group or such Person or the operating capacity of the other assets of the
Partnership Group or such Person, in each case from the production or operating capacity of the
Partnership Group or such Person, as the case may be, existing immediately prior to such
development, addition, improvement, construction, acquisition or replacement.

of the development of, or addition or improvement to, capital assets owned by such Person, or
the construction of new, or acquisition or replacement of existing, capital assets by such Person,
in each case if such development, addition, improvement, construction, acquisition or
replacement is made to maintain, over the long term, the production levels of the oil and natural
gas properties of the Partnership Group or such Person or the operating capacity of the other
assets of the Partnership Group or such Person, in each case existing immediately prior to such
development, addition, improvement, construction, acquisition or replacement.
“Carrying Value” means (a) with respect to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, the
Agreed Value of such property reduced (but not below zero) by all depreciation, Simulated
Depletion, amortization and cost recovery deductions charged to the Partners’ Capital Accounts
in respect of such property, and (b) with respect to any other Partnership property, the adjusted
basis of such property for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all as of the time of determination;
provided, however, that the Carrying Value of any property shall be adjusted from time to time in

employee, manager, member, general partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of

34
ARTICLE IV
CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF 
PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
Section 4.1    Certificates.
Upon the Partnership’s issuance of Partnership Securities to any Person and subject to Section
16.2(b) with respect to Series A Preferred Units, Section 17.2(b) with respect to Series B
Preferred Units and Section 6.7(h) with respect to Incentive Distribution Units, the Partnership
may issue one or more Certificates in the name of such Person evidencing the number of such
Partnership Securities being so issued. In addition, (a) upon the General Partner’s request, the
Partnership shall issue to it one or more Certificates in the name of the General Partner
evidencing its interests in the Partnership and (b) upon the request of any Person owning any
other Partnership Securities, the Partnership shall issue to such Person one or more Certificates
evidencing such Partnership Securities. Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the
Partnership by the Chairman of the Board, President or any Executive Vice President or Vice
President and the Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the
General Partner. No Certificate shall be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by
the Transfer Agent; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this
Section 4.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Partnership Securities may be certificated or
uncertificated as provided in the Delaware Act, provided further, that if the General Partner elects
to issue Partnership Securities in global form, the Certificates shall be valid upon receipt of a
certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the Partnership Securities have been duly
registered in accordance with the directions of the Partnership.
Section 4.2    Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.
(a)    If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the appropriate officers of
the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall
countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate, or shall deliver other evidence of
the issuance of uncertificated Partnership Securities, evidencing the same number and type of
Partnership Securities as the Certificate so surrendered.
(b)    The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute
and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign, a new Certificate, or shall deliver other
evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Partnership Securities, in place of any Certificate
previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:
(i)    makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, that a
previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen;
(ii)    requests the issuance of a new Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Partnership Securities, before the General Partner has notice that the Certificate
has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim;
35
(iii)    if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a bond, in form and
substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety or sureties and with fixed or open
penalty as the General Partner may direct to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General
Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged
loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and
(iv)    satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General Partner.
If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable period of time after he
has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner
Interests represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the General Partner
or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Limited Partner shall be precluded from
making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such
transfer or for a new Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Partnership
Securities.
(c)    As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Partnership Securities, under this Section 4.2, the General Partner may require the
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer
Agent) reasonably connected therewith.
Section 4.3    Record Holders.
The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the Partner with respect to
any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to, or interest in, such Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person, regardless of
whether the Partnership shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided
by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Without limiting
the foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing
corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other
representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as
between the Partnership on the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such
representative Person shall be the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest.
Section 4.4    Transfer Generally.
(a)    The term “transfer,” when used in this Agreement with respect to a Partnership Interest, shall
be deemed to refer to a transaction (i) by which the General Partner assigns its General Partner
Interest to another Person and includes a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law or otherwise or (ii) by which
the holder of a Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited Partner Interest to another Person
who is or becomes a Limited Partner, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, exchange or any
other disposition by law or otherwise, including any transfer upon foreclosure of any pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.
36
(b)    No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except in accordance with
the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any transfer or purported transfer of a
Partnership Interest not made in accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void.
(c)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a disposition by any
stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the General Partner of any or all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of the General Partner.
Section 4.5    Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests.
(a)    The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the Partnership a register in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe and subject to the provisions of
Section 4.5(b), the Partnership will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner
Interests. The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of
registering Partnership Securities and transfers of such Partnership Securities as herein
provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers of Certificates evidencing Limited Partner
Interests unless such transfers are effected in the manner described in this Section 4.5. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by
a Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate officers of the
General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Units,
Preferred Units and Incentive Distribution Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver,
in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the
holder’s instructions, one or more new Certificates, or shall deliver other evidence of the
issuance of uncertificated Limited Partner Interests, evidencing the same aggregate number and
type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered.
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.9, the General Partner shall not recognize any
transfer of Limited Partner Interests until the Certificates, or other evidence of issuance of
uncertificated Limited Partner Interests, evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are
surrendered for registration of transfer. No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for
such transfer; provided, that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate, or other
evidence of the issuance uncertificated Limited Partner Interests, under this Section 4.5, the
General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto.
(c)    Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5, (ii) Section 4.3, (iii) Section 4.8, (iv)
with respect to any class or series of Limited Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement of
designations or amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or series, (v) any
contractual provisions binding on any Limited Partner and (vi) provisions of applicable law
including the Securities Act, Partnership Interests shall be freely transferable.
Section 4.6    Transfer of the General Partner’s General Partner Interest.
(a)    Subject to Section 4.6(c), prior to March 31, 2016, the General Partner shall not transfer all
or any part of its General Partner Interest to a Person unless such transfer (i) has been approved
by the prior written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units
(excluding any Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates) or (ii) is of
37
all, but not less than all, of its General Partner Interest to (A) an Affiliate (other than an individual)
of the General Partner or (B) another Person (other than an individual) in connection with the
merger or consolidation of the General Partner with or into another Person or the transfer by the
General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to another Person (other than an individual).
(b)    Subject to Section 4.6(c), on or after March 31, 2016, the General Partner may transfer all or
any part of its General Partner Interest without Unitholder approval.
(c)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another Person or replacement
of the General Partner pursuant to Section 10.3 shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee or
successor (as applicable) agrees to assume the rights and duties of the General Partner under
this Agreement and to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including Section 13.4(c),
(ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer or replacement would not
result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner or of any limited partner or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii)
such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of
the partnership or membership interest of the General Partner as the general partner or managing
member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of a transfer or replacement pursuant to
and in compliance with this Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as applicable) shall, subject
to compliance with the terms of Section 10.3, be admitted to the Partnership as a General Partner
immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner Interest, and the business of the
Partnership shall continue without dissolution.
Section 4.7    Transfer of Incentive Distribution Units.
No IDR Holder may transfer any of its Incentive Distribution Units without the prior written
approval of the General Partner.
Section 4.8    Restrictions on Transfers.
(a)    Except as provided in Section 4.8(c), but notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article
IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then
applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state
securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii)
terminate the existence or qualification of the Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation or (iii) cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so
treated or taxed).
(b)    The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership Interests if it
determines, with the advice of counsel, that such restrictions are necessary or advisable to (i)
avoid a significant risk of the Partnership becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise
becoming taxable as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) preserve the uniformity
of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may
impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement; provided, however, that any amendment
that would
38
result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any class or series of Limited Partner Interests
on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class or series of Limited Partner
Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being
effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such
class or series.
(c)    Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall preclude the
settlement of any transactions involving Partnership Interests entered into through the facilities of
any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading.
(d)    The transfer of IDR-Related Units shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by Section
6.7(g).
Section 4.9    Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees.
(a)    If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or local law or regulation
that the General Partner determines would create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of
any property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the nationality, citizenship or
other related status of a Limited Partner, the General Partner may request any Limited Partner to
furnish to the General Partner, within 30 days after receipt of such request, an executed
Citizenship Certification or such other information concerning his nationality, citizenship or other
related status (or, if the Limited Partner is a nominee holding for the account of another Person,
the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such other Person) as the General Partner
may request. If a Limited Partner fails to furnish to the General Partner within the aforementioned
30-day period such Citizenship Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of
such Citizenship Certification or other requested information the General Partner determines that
a Limited Partner (or, if the Limited Partner is a nominee holding for the account of another
Person, such other Person) is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership Interests owned by such
Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.10.
In addition, the General Partner may require that the status of any such Limited Partner be
changed to that of a Non-citizen Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be
substituted for such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of his Limited Partner
Interests.
(b)    The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Limited Partner Interests
held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees, distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes
of Partners (including the General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those
of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the matter.
(c)    Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have no right to receive a
distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof,
and the Partnership shall provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen
Assignee’s share of any distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen Assignee of his
Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive his share of such distribution in kind).
39
(d)    At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible Citizen, a Non-
citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner, request that with respect to any
Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.10,
such Non-citizen Assignee be admitted as a Limited Partner, and upon approval of the General
Partner, such Non-citizen Assignee shall be admitted as a Limited Partner and shall no longer
constitute a Non-citizen Assignee and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the
Limited Partner in respect of the Non-citizen Assignee’s Limited Partner Interests.
Section 4.10    Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees.
(a)    If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish a Citizenship Certification or other information
requested within the 30-day period specified in Section 4.9(a), or if upon receipt of such
Citizenship Certification or other information the General Partner determines, with the advice of
counsel, that a Limited Partner is not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited
Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such Limited Partner is an
Eligible Citizen or has transferred his Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen
and who furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for
redemption as provided below, redeem the Limited Partner Interests of such Limited Partner as
follows:
(i)    The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date fixed for redemption,
give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner, at his last address designated on the records of
the Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The notice
shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable
Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption
price will be made upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, or
other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Redeemable Interests, and that on and after the
date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the Limited Partner would
otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made.
(ii)    The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the
Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be as of the date fixed for
redemption) of Partnership Interests of the class or series to be so redeemed multiplied by the
number of Partnership Interests of each such class or series included among the Redeemable
Interests. The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or
by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption
price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal annual installments
of principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.
(iii)    Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner, at the place specified in the notice of
redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank, or other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Redeemable Interests, the Limited Partner or his duly authorized representative
shall be entitled to receive the payment therefor.
40
(iv)    After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute Outstanding
Partnership Interests; provided, however, that pursuant to Section 7.11, in the sole discretion of
the General Partner, Incentive Distribution Units may be held by the Partnership in treasury.
(b)    The provisions of this Section 4.10 shall also be applicable to Partnership Interests held by
a Limited Partner as nominee of a Person determined to be other than an Eligible Citizen.
(c)    Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of redemption from
transferring his Partnership Interest before the redemption date if such transfer is otherwise
permitted under this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner
shall withdraw the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Partnership Interest
certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that he is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee
fails to make such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the
original redemption date.
ARTICLE V
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND 
ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
Section 5.1    Organizational Contributions.
In connection with the formation of the Partnership under the Delaware Act, the General Partner
made an initial Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the amount of $1, for a 0.1% General
Partner Interest in the Partnership and was admitted as the General Partner of the Partnership,
and the Organizational Limited Partner made an initial Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
the amount of $999 for a 99.9% Limited Partner Interest in the Partnership and was admitted as a
Limited Partner of the Partnership. As of the Closing Date, simultaneously with the admission of
the Initial Limited Partners as limited partners of the Partnership, the interest of the Organizational
Limited Partner was redeemed; and the initial Capital Contribution of the Organizational Limited
Partner was refunded and the Organizational Limited Partner ceased to be a limited partner of
the Partnership. Ninety-nine and nine tenths percent of any interest or other profit that may have
resulted from the investment or other use of such initial Capital Contributions was allocated and
distributed to the Organizational Limited Partner, and the balance thereof was allocated and
distributed to the General Partner.
Section 5.2    Contributions by the General Partner.
(a)    On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the General Partner
contributed to the Partnership a 0.1% undivided interest in all of the Founder Contributed Assets
in exchange for a number of General Partner Units constituting .1001% of the Units issued to the
Limited Partners.
(b)    Upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership, the
General Partner may, in exchange for a proportionate number of General Partner Units, make
additional Capital Contributions in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
quotient determined by dividing (A) the General Partner’s Percentage Interest by (B) 100 less the
41
General Partner’s Percentage Interest times (ii) the amount contributed to the Partnership by the
Limited Partners in exchange for such additional Limited Partner Interests. Except as set forth in
Article XII, the General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital
Contributions to the Partnership.
Section 5.3    Contributions by Founding Investors, the Initial Purchaser and Accredited Investors.
(a)    On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Founding Investors
contributed in the aggregate a 99.9% undivided interest in all of the Founder Contributed Assets.
In exchange for such Capital Contributions by the Founding Investors, the Partnership issued
Units to such Founding Investor in the amount set forth for such Founding Investor in the
Contribution Agreement.
(b)    On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchaser
contributed to the Partnership cash in an amount equal to the Issue Price per Unit sold in the
Initial Offering, multiplied by the number of Units specified in the Purchase Agreement purchased
by the Initial Purchaser at the Closing Date. In exchange for such Capital Contribution by the
Initial Purchaser, the Partnership issued Units to the Initial Purchaser in an amount equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the cash contribution to the Partnership by the Initial Purchaser
by (ii) the Issue Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering. Upon the exercise of the Over-Allotment
Option, the Initial Purchaser contributed to the Partnership cash in an amount equal to the Issue
Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering, multiplied by the number of Units purchased by the Initial
Purchaser at the Option Closing Date. In exchange for such Capital Contribution by the Initial
Purchaser, the Partnership issued Units to the Initial Purchaser in an amount equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the cash contributions to the Partnership by the Initial Purchaser
on the Option Closing Date by (ii) the Issue Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering.
(c)    On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, each Accredited Investor
contributed to the Partnership cash in an amount equal to the Issue Price per Unit sold in the
Initial Offering, multiplied by the number of Units specified in the Purchase Agreement purchased
by such Accredited Investor at the Closing Date. In exchange for such Capital Contribution by
each Accredited Investor, the Partnership issued Units to each Accredited Investor in an amount
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the cash contribution to the Partnership by such
Accredited Investor by (ii) the Issue Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering. Upon the exercise of
the Over-Allotment Option, each Accredited Investor contributed to the Partnership cash in an
amount equal to the Issue Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering, multiplied by the number of
Units purchased by such Accredited Investor at the Option Closing Date. In exchange for such
Capital Contribution by each Accredited Investor, the Partnership issued Units to each
Accredited Investor in an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the cash
contributions to the Partnership by such Accredited Investor on the Option Closing Date by (ii) the
Issue Price per Unit sold in the Initial Offering.
(d)    No Partnership Interests were issued or issuable as of or at the Closing Date other than (i)
the Units issuable pursuant to Section 5.3(a), Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c) in an aggregate
number equal to 18,292,683 Units (after giving effect to the redemption of Units
42
pursuant to the Initial Offering) and (ii) the Units to be issued or issuable under the Legacy
Reserves LP Long-Term Incentive Plan as described in the Offering Memorandum.
Section 5.4    Interest and Withdrawal.
No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled
to the withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions
made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be considered as
such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either
as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such return
shall be a compromise to which all Partners agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the
Delaware Act.
Section 5.5    Capital Accounts.
(a)    The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership
Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such
owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method
acceptable to the General Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with
respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions made by the Partner with respect to such Partnership Interest; provided that the
initial Capital Account of the initial holder of a Preferred Unit with respect to such Preferred Unit
shall equal the Stated Liquidation Preference irrespective of the amount paid by such holder for
such Preferred Unit, and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain
exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net
Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made to the Partner with
respect to such Partnership Interest; provided, that the Capital Account of a holder of Series A
Preferred Units shall not be reduced by the amount of Series A Distribution it receives and the
Capital Account of a holder of Series B Preferred Units shall not be reduced by the amount of
Series B Distribution it receives and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in
accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant
to Section 6.1. For Capital Account purposes, the Incentive Distribution Units issued on the
Effective Date shall, whether vested or unvested, be treated as issued on such date in partial
exchange for assets acquired by the Partnership and its Affiliates pursuant to the Purchase and
Sale Agreement with a value of zero.
(b)    For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction,
Simulated Depletion, Simulated Gain or Simulated Loss which is to be allocated pursuant to
Article VI and is to be reflected in the Partners’ Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and
classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost
recovery or amortization used for that purpose), provided, that:
43
(i)    Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its
proportionate share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the
applicable Group Member Agreement or governing, organizational or similar documents) of all
property owned by (x) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated
business or other entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes of which a
Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder.
(ii)    All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a
Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if
any, shall, for purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the
time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners
pursuant to Section 6.1.
(iii)    The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction, Simulated Depletion,
Simulated Gain and Simulated Loss shall be made (except as otherwise provided in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)), (x) without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code that may be made by the Partnership and, (y) as to those items described in Section
705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items are not
includable in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership
asset pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code (including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.734-2(b)(i)) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.
(iv)    In the event the Carrying Value of Partnership property is adjusted pursuant to a
Revaluation Event, any Unrealized Gain resulting from such adjustment shall be treated as an
item of gain and any Unrealized Loss resulting from such adjustment shall be treated as an item
of loss.
(v)    Any income, gain, loss, Simulated Gain or Simulated Loss attributable to the taxable
disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to such property’s Carrying Value
as of such date.
(vi)    Any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery, amortization or Simulated Depletion
attributable to any Contributed Property or Adjusted Property shall be determined under the rules
prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)(2) as if the adjusted basis of such property
were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment.
(viii)    The Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as provided in this Agreement
for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The amount of any such adjustment
44
shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying
Value of such Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the
Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership).
(c)    (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.5(c), a transferee of a Partnership Interest
shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the
Partnership Interest so transferred.
(ii)    Subject to Section 6.7(g), upon any issuance of IDR-Related Units, the Capital Account
maintained with respect to the Incentive Distribution Units with respect to which such IDR-
Related Units were issued shall (A) first, be allocated to such IDR-Related Units received by an
IDR Holder (or former IDR Holder) in such transaction in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate quantity of IDR-Related Units received by such holder in the transaction and (y) the
Per Unit Capital Amount for a Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital
Account will be retained by such holder. In the event that such holder does not have a sufficient
Capital Account associated with the Incentive Distribution Units (or former Incentive Distribution
Units) to allocate the full Per Unit Capital Amount for a Unit to such IDR-Related Units in
accordance with clause (A) of this Section 5.5(c)(ii), the IDR-Related Units shall be subject to
Section 6.1(c)(x)(A) (including, without limitation, in the transaction in which such IDR-Related
Units are issued). If, after the application of Section 6.1(c)(x)(A) to such holder, such holder still
does not have a sufficient Capital Account associated with the IDR-Related Units, Incentive
Distribution Units or former Incentive Distribution Units to allocate the full Per Unit Capital
Amount for a Unit to its IDR-Related Units in accordance with clause (A) of this Section 5.5(c)(ii),
then immediately prior to the transfer by such holder of any IDR-Related Units, such holder’s
Capital Account in its IDR-Related Units shall (x) first be allocated to the IDR-Related Units to be
transferred to allocate the full Per Unit Capital Amount for a Unit to such IDR-Related Units to be
transferred (or as many of them as possible) in accordance with clause (A) of this Section 5.5(c)
(ii), and (y) any remaining balance shall be allocated to any other IDR-Related Units held by
such Holder. If, after the application of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5(c)(ii), such
holder wishes to transfer additional IDR-Related Units (in the same transaction as described in
the preceding sentence or otherwise) (“Excess IDR-Related Units”) but does not have a sufficient
Capital Account associated with the remaining IDR-Related Units, Incentive Distribution Units or
former Incentive Distribution Units to allocate the full Per Unit Capital Amount for a Unit to the
Excess IDR-Related Units to be transferred, Section 6.1(c)(x)(B) shall apply to such holder. If any
former Incentive Distribution Unit holder has a remaining Capital Account but holds no Units,
Incentive Distribution Units or other Partnership Securities, Section 6.1(c)(x)(C) shall apply to
such holder.
(d)    (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of
additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership
Interests for the provision of services, the issuance of IDR-Related Units, the conversion of the
General Partner’s Combined Interest to Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b) or the conversion of
Preferred Units or the exercise of another Noncompensatory Option, the Capital Account of all
Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance
(or in the case of the occurrence of a conversion of the Preferred Units or exercise of
45
a Noncompensatory Option, immediately after such conversion or exercise) shall be adjusted
upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an
actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such issuance; provided, however, that in
the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash or Contributed
Property, or in the event of an issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such
adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. Any such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall be allocated (A) if the operation of
this sentence is triggered by the conversion of the Preferred Units or exercise of a
Noncompensatory Option, first to the Partners holding Units into which the Preferred Units have
been converted (or for which a Noncompensatory Option has been exercised) until the Capital
Account attributable to each Unit is the same, and (B) any remaining Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss shall be allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1 in the same manner as
any item of gain, loss, Simulated Gain or Simulated Loss actually recognized during such period
would have been allocated. If the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of the
conversion of the Preferred Units or exercise of a Noncompensatory Option is not sufficient to
cause the Capital Account attributable to each Unit (including converted Units) to be the same,
then the Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding such Units
so as to cause the Capital Account attributable to each such Unit to be the same, in accordance
with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3). In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property (including cash or
cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests or the
conversion of the Preferred Units or exercise of a Noncompensatory Option shall be determined
by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt. In making its
determination, the General Partner may first determine the aggregate value for the assets of the
Partnership that takes into account the current trading price of the Unit, the fair market value of all
other Partnership Interests at such time, the amount of Partnership Liabilities, and, if before the
conversion of any Preferred Units (or exercise of another Noncompensatory Option), may reduce
the fair market value of all Partnership assets by the excess, if any, of the fair market value of any
Preferred Unit or other Noncompensatory Option which has not yet converted (or been exercised)
over the aggregate Capital Account attributable to such Preferred Unit or other Noncompensatory
Option to the extent of any Unrealized Gain that has not been reflected in the Partners’ Capital
Account previously, consistent with the methodology of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)
(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner may allocate such aggregate value among the individual
properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines appropriate). Absent a contrary
determination by the General Partner, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership assets
(including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a Revaluation Event shall be the value
that would result in the Capital Account for each Unit that is Outstanding prior to such
Revaluation Event being equal to the Event Issue Value.
(ii)    In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any
distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Carrying Value of all Partnership property
shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss the aggregate fair market value of all
46
Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall
(A) in the case of a distribution other than one made pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined in
the same manner as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating
distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined by the Liquidator using such method of
valuation as it may adopt.
Section 5.6    Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities.
(a)    Subject to any approvals required by Series A Holders pursuant to Section 16.5(b)(ii), by
Series B Holders pursuant to Section 17.5(b)(ii) and by IDR Holders pursuant to Section 6.7(h),
the Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and
appreciation rights relating to the Partnership Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time
and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions
as the General Partner shall determine in its sole discretion, all without the approval of any
Limited Partners. The Partnership may reissue any Incentive Distribution Units held by the
Partnership in treasury for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such
Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall
determine in its sole discretion, all without the approval of any Limited Partners.
(b)    Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the Partnership pursuant to
Section 5.6(a) may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more series of any such classes,
with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the General Partner, including
(i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii) the right to share in
Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv)
whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership
Security; (v) whether such Partnership Security is issued with the privilege of conversion or
exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and
conditions upon which each Partnership Security will be issued, evidenced by certificates, or
other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Partnership Securities, and assigned or
transferred; (vii) the method for determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership
Security; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership
matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such
Partnership Security.
(c)    The General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take all actions that it determines
to be necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership Securities and
options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this
Section 5.6, (ii) the conversion of the General Partner Interest or any Incentive Distribution Units
into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any applicable IDR Holder Agreement, (iii)
the admission of additional Limited Partners and (iv) all additional issuances of Partnership
Securities. The General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the
holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities being so issued. The General Partner shall
do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all
things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of
Partnership Securities or in connection with the conversion of the General Partner Interest into
Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule,
47
regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National
Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Securities are listed or admitted to
trading.
(d)    No fractional Partnership Securities shall be issued by the Partnership.
Section 5.7    [Reserved].
Section 5.8    Limited Preemptive Right.
Except as provided in this Section 5.8 and in Section 5.2(b), no Person shall have any
preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any Partnership
Security, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. The General Partner shall
have the right to purchase Partnership Securities from the Partnership whenever, and on the
same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Securities to any Person to the extent
necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner, with respect to the
General Partner Interest, equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such
Partnership Securities; provided, however, that the number of any Series A Preferred Units or
Series B Preferred Units issued by the Partnership from time to time that the General Partner
shall have a right to purchase pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall equal the product of (a) the
aggregate Percentage Interest of the General Partner and its Affiliates multiplied by (b) the
number of Series A Preferred Units or Series B Preferred Units, respectively, so issued.
Section 5.9    Splits and Combinations.
(a)    Subject to Section 5.9(d), Section 6.6 and Section 6.8 (dealing with adjustments to
distribution levels) the Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Securities
(other than Preferred Units) to all Record Holders of the same class or series of Partnership
Securities or may effect a subdivision or combination of the same class or series of Partnership
Securities so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage
Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per
Partnership Security basis or stated as a number of Partnership Securities are proportionately
adjusted.
(b)    Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities is
declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision
or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such
Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected
by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after
giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be
entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of
such calculation.
(c)    Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may
issue Certificates, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Partnership Securities, to
the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the
new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may
adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such
changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership
48
Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record
Holder of such new Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Partnership
Securities, the surrender of any Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated
Partnership Securities, held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.
(g)    The Partnership shall not issue fractional Partnership Securities upon any distribution,
subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities. If a distribution, subdivision or combination
of Partnership Securities would result in the issuance of fractional Partnership Securities but for
the provisions of this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Partnership Security shall be rounded to the
nearest whole Partnership Security (and a 0.5 Partnership Security shall be rounded to the next
higher Partnership Security ).
Section 5.10    Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests.
All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this
Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership,
except as such non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.
Section 5.11    Issuance of Units in Connection with Reset of the Minimum Quarterly Distribution
and Target Distributions.
(a)    Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.11, at any time when the Partnership (i) has made
a distribution pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(iv) for four consecutive Quarters with respect to the Units
for each such Quarter and (ii) the amount of all distributions during each Quarter within such
period did not exceed the Adjusted Operating Surplus for such Quarter, the General Partner shall
have the right to make an election (the “IDR Reset Election”) to cause the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution and the Target Distributions to be reset in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.11(e) and, in connection therewith, each IDR Holder will be entitled to receive, subject to
Section 5.6(d), a number of Units (the “IDR Reset Units”) derived by dividing (x) the average of
the aggregate amount of cash distributions made by the Partnership for each of the two full
Quarters immediately preceding the delivery by the General Partner of the Reset Notice (as
defined in Section 5.11(b)) in respect of the Incentive Distribution Units held by such IDR Holder
by (y) the average cash distribution per Unit made by the Partnership for each of the two full
Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (the total number of such Units
determined by aggregating each such quotient of each such holder is referred to herein as the
“Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Units”). The making of the IDR Reset Election in the manner
specified in Section 5.11(b) shall cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and the Target
Distributions to be reset in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.11(e) and, in connection
therewith, each IDR Holder will be entitled to receive IDR Reset Units, without any further
approval required by the General Partner or the Unitholders, at the time specified in Section
5.11(c) unless the IDR Reset Election is rescinded pursuant to Section 5.11(d). No fractional
Units will be issued upon the conversion of Incentive Distribution Units. Instead, the Partnership
shall pay the cash value of such fractional Units based on the Current Market Price (the date of
determination of which shall be as of the date that is three Trading Days prior to the date IDR
Reset Units are issued to such IDR Holder).
49
(b)    To exercise the right specified in Section 5.11(a), the General Partner shall deliver a written
notice (the “Reset Notice”) to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Units that includes
a determination of the aggregate number of IDR Reset Units that each IDR Holder may receive
per Incentive Distribution Unit.
(c)    On the fifteenth Business Day after delivery by the General Partner of the Reset Notice,
each IDR Holder will be entitled to receive the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Units; provided,
however, that the issuance of IDR Reset Units to an IDR Holder shall not occur prior to the
approval of the listing or admission for trading of such IDR Reset Units by the principal National
Securities Exchange upon which the Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such
approval is required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange.
(d)    If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Units are then traded has not
approved the listing or admission for trading of the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Units on or
before the 30th calendar day following the General Partner’s delivery of the Reset Notice and
such approval is required by the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange,
then the General Partner shall have the right to either rescind the IDR Reset Election or elect to
deliver other Partnership Interests having such terms as the General Partner may approve that
will provide (i) the same economic value, in the aggregate, as the Aggregate Quantity of IDR
Reset Units would have had at the time of the General Partner’s delivery of the Reset Notice, as
determined by the General Partner, and (ii) for the subsequent conversion (on terms acceptable
to the National Securities Exchange upon which the Units are then traded) of such Partnership
Interests into Units within not more than 12 months following the General Partner’s delivery of the
Reset Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions as determined by the General
Partner.
(e)    The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall be adjusted at the time of
the issuance of Units or other Partnership Interests pursuant to this Section 5.11 such that (i) the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be reset to equal the average cash distribution amount per
Unit for the two Quarters immediately prior to the delivery by the General Partner of the Reset
Notice (the “Reset MQD”), (ii) the First Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 115% of the
Reset MQD and (iii) the Second Target Distribution shall be reset to equal 125% of the Reset
MQD, in each case rounded to the nearest four decimals.
ARTICLE VI
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Section 6.1    Allocations for Capital Account Purposes.
For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners
among themselves, the Partnership’s items of income, gain, loss, deduction, Simulated Gain,
Simulated Loss and Simulated Depletion (computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b)) shall be
allocated among the Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided herein below.
For purposes of making allocations under this Section 6.1, a Person shall be considered as the
holder solely of the class of Partnership Interests to which such allocation relates.
50
(a)    Net Income and Net Loss.
(i)    Net Income. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 6.1(c), Net
Income for each taxable year and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into
account in computing Net Income for each taxable year shall be allocated to the Partners as
follows:
(A)    first, to the General Partner until the General Partner has been allocated cumulative Net
Income for the current and all prior taxable periods equal to the cumulative Net Loss previously
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii)(D);
(B)    second, to the Partners, in accordance with the proportions that Net Losses were previously
allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii)(B), until the Partners have been allocated
cumulative Net Income for the current and all prior taxable periods equal to the cumulative Net
Loss previously allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii)(B); and
(C)    thereafter, to the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.
(ii)    Net Losses. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 6.1(c), Net
Losses for each taxable period and all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into
account in computing Net Losses for such taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners as
follows:
(A)    first, to the Partners (other than holders of Preferred Units) in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests; provided that Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to this
Section 6.1(c)(ii)(A) to the extent that such allocation would cause any such Limited Partner to
have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable year (or increase
any existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account);
(B)    next, any such Net Losses shall be allocated to Partners (other than holders of Preferred
Units) with positive Adjusted Capital Accounts in accordance with their Percentage Interests until
such positive Adjusted Capital Accounts of such Limited Partners are reduced to zero;
(C)    then, to all Partners holding Preferred Units, in proportion to their positive Adjusted Capital
Account balances, until the Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each Preferred Unit then
Outstanding has been reduced to zero; and
(D)    thereafter, to the General Partner.
(b)    Net Termination Gains and Losses. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 6.1(c), including Section 6.1(c)(xi)(B), Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss
(including a pro rata part of each item of income, gain, Simulated Gain, loss and deduction taken
into account in computing Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss) for such taxable
51
period shall be allocated in the manner set forth in this Section 6.1(b). All allocations under this
Section 6.1(b) shall be made after Capital Account balances have been adjusted by all other
allocations provided under this Section 6.1 and after all distributions of Available Cash provided
under Section 6.4 and Section 6.5 have been made; provided, however, that solely for purposes
of this Section 6.1(b), Capital Accounts shall not be adjusted for distributions made pursuant to
Section 12.4.
(i)    Net Termination Gain (including a pro rata part of each item of income, gain, loss, and
deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain) shall be allocated:
(A)    First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Termination Gain allocated to the
General Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(i)(A) and the Net Income allocated to the General
Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)(A) for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to
the aggregate of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii)(D)
for all previous taxable periods and the Net Termination Loss allocated to the General Partner
pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii)(C) for all previous taxable periods;
(B)    Second, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage Interest and (y) to all
Unitholders holding Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partner’s
Percentage Interest, until the Capital Account in respect of each Unit then Outstanding is equal to
the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Effective Date Unit Price, and (2) the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution for the Quarter during which the Liquidation Date occurs, reduced by any distribution
pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i) with respect to such Unit for such Quarter (the amount determined
pursuant to this clause (2) is hereinafter referred to as the “Unpaid MQD”);
(C)    Third, 100% to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account
in respect of each Unit then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Effective Date
Unit Price, (2) the Unpaid MQD, and (3) the excess of (aa) the First Target Distribution less the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution for each Quarter since the Effective Date hereof over (bb) the
cumulative per Unit amount of any distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus made pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(ii) since the Effective Date hereof (the sum of
subclauses (1), (2), and (3) is hereinafter referred to as the “First Liquidation Target Amount”);
(D)    Fourth, (x) a percent equal to 13% multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is equal to
the number of Vested Incentive Distribution Units and the denominator of which is the total
authorized Incentive Distribution Units to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Units, Pro Rata
and (y) to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the
sum of the percentage applicable to subclause (x) of this clause (D), until the Capital Account in
respect of each Unit then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) the First
52
Liquidation Target Amount, and (2) the excess of (aa) the Second Target Distribution less the
First Target Distribution for each Quarter since the Effective Date hereof over (bb) the cumulative
per Unit amount of any distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus
made pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(iii) since the Effective Date hereof (the sum of subclauses (1)
and (2) is hereinafter referred to as the “Second Liquidation Target Amount”); and
(E)    Finally, (x) a percent equal to 23% multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is equal to
the number of Vested Incentive Distribution Units and the denominator of which is the total
authorized Incentive Distribution Units to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Units, Pro Rata
and (y) to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the
percentage applicable to subclause (x) of this clause (E).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this Section 6.1(b)(i), the General Partner may adjust
the amount of any Net Termination Gain arising in connection with a Revaluation Event that is
allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Units in a manner that will result (i) in the Capital
Account for each Unit that is Outstanding prior to such Revaluation Event being equal to the
Event Issue Value and (ii) to the greatest extent possible, the Capital Account with respect to the
Vested Incentive Distribution Units that are Outstanding prior to such Revaluation Event being
equal to the amount of Net Termination Gain that would be allocated to the holders of the Vested
Incentive Distribution Units pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(i) if the Capital Accounts with respect
to all Partnership Interests that were Outstanding immediately prior to such Revaluation Event
and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property were equal to zero.
(ii)    Net Termination Loss (including a pro rata part of each item of income, gain, loss, and
deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Loss) shall be allocated:
(A)    First, to the General Partner and the Unitholders, Pro Rata; provided that Net Termination
Loss shall not be allocated pursuant to this Section 6.1(b)(ii)(A) to the extent such allocation
would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end
of such taxable period (or increase any existing deficit in its Adjusted Capital Account);
(B)    Second, to the Partner holding Preferred Units, in proportion to their positive Capital
Account balances, until the Capital Account balance in respect of each Preferred Unit has been
reduced to zero; and
(C)    The balance, if any, to the General Partner.
(c)    Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, the following
special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:
(i)    Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable
period, each Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period
(and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts
53
provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any
successor provision. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c), each Partner’s Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder
shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)
with respect to such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(vi) and
Section 6.1(c)(vii)). This Section 6.1(c)(i) is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum
Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.
(ii)    Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(c)(i)), except as provided in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse
Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the
manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii),
or any successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c), each Partner’s Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder
shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c),
other than Section 6.1(c)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(vi) and Section
6.1(c)(vii), with respect to such taxable period. This Section 6.1(c)(ii) is intended to comply with
the chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(iii)    Priority Allocations. Items of Partnership gross income or gain for the taxable period, if any,
shall be allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Units, Pro Rata, until the aggregate
amount of such items allocated to the holders of Incentive Distribution Units pursuant to this
Section 6.1(c)(iii) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
cumulative amount of all Incentive Distributions made to the holders of Incentive Distribution
Units from the Effective Date to a date 45 days after the end of the current taxable period.
(iv)    Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any adjustments,
allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent
required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit
balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or
distributions as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(iv)
shall be made only if and to the extent that such partner would have a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been
tentatively made as if this Section 6.1(c)(iv) were not in this Agreement.
(v)    Gross Income Allocations. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital
Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum of (A) the amount
54
such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the
amount such Partner is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership gross
income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an
allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(v) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account after all other allocations provided for
in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if Section 6.1(c)(iv) and this Section 6.1(c)(v)
were not in this Agreement.
(vi)    Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be
allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines that the Partnership’s
Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor
requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the
General Partner is authorized to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that
does satisfy such requirements.
(vii)    Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the
Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the
Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such Partners in
accordance with the ratios in which they share such Economic Risk of Loss.
(viii)    Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the
Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the
amount of Partnership Minimum Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall
be allocated among the Partners Pro Rata.
(ix)    Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code (including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1 734-2(b)(1)) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as a result of a
distribution to a Partner in complete liquidation of such Partner’s interest in the Partnership, the
amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis)
taken into account pursuant to Section 5.5, and such item of gain or loss shall be specially
allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts
are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.
(x)    Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law.
(A)    With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of Partnership
property pursuant to Section 5.5(d) during any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or
after, the issuance of IDR-Related Units, any
55
Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that
to the nearest extent possible results in the Capital Accounts maintained with respect to such
IDR-Related Units equaling the product of (A) the aggregate quantity of such IDR-Related Units
and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Unit.
(B)    With respect to any taxable period during which an Excess IDR-Related Unit is transferred
to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the transferor, all or a portion of the remaining items of
Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the
transferor Partner of such transferred Excess IDR-Related Unit until such transferor Partner has
been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained
with respect to such transferred Excess IDR-Related Unit to an amount equal to the Per Unit
Capital Amount for a Unit.
(C)    If any former Incentive Distribution Holder has a remaining Capital Account but holds no
Units, Incentive Distribution Units or other Partnership Securities, all or a portion of the remaining
items of Partnership deduction or loss for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to such
former Incentive Distribution Holder as necessary to eliminate such Capital Account balance.
(D)    For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the
Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt
such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation,
amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement
as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section
704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the
Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such
conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided
in this Section 6.1(c)(x)(D) only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a
material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Outstanding
Limited Partner Interests or the Partnership.
(xi)    Preferred Unit Allocations.
(A)    Income of the Partnership attributable to the issuance by the Partnership of a Preferred Unit
for an amount in excess of such Preferred Unit’s Stated Liquidation Preference shall be allocated
to the Limited Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.
(B)    Net Termination Gain, if any, for the taxable period (or, to the extent necessary, items of
income or gain for the taxable period) shall be allocated to each holder of Preferred Units, in
proportion to, and to the extent of, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the Stated
Liquidation Preference with respect to such
56
holder’s Preferred Units, over (2) such holder’s existing Capital Account balance in respect of
such Preferred Units, until the Capital Account balance of each such holder in respect of its
Preferred Units is equal to the Stated Liquidation Preference with respect to such holder’s
Preferred Units.
(xii)    Curative Allocation.
(A)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the Required Allocations,
the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to
the extent possible, the net amount of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated
to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall
be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner
under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation
not otherwise been provided in this Section 6.1. In exercising its discretion under this Section
6.1(c)(xii)(A), the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that,
although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations previously made.
Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(xii)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required
Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be
inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
(B)    The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of
Section 6.1(c)(xii)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic distortions that
might otherwise result from the Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(xii)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic
distortions.
(xiii)    Corrective and Other Allocations.
In the event of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items or a Net Termination
Loss, the following rules shall apply:
(A)    Except as provided in Section 6.1(c)(xiii)(B), in the case of any allocation of Additional Book
Basis Derivative Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss),
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items shall be allocated (1) to each holder of Incentive
Distribution Units to the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to
such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to such holder and (2) to the General
Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
giving rise to such Additional Book Basis Items was allocated to the General Partner or any
Unitholder.
(B)    If a sale or other taxable disposition of an Adjusted Property, including, for this purpose,
inventory (“Disposed of Adjusted Property”) occurs other than in connection with an event giving
rise to Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss, (1) items of gross income and gain shall be
allocated (aa) away
57
from each holder of Incentive Distribution Units and (bb) to the General Partner and the
Unitholders, or (2) items of deduction and loss shall be allocated (aa) away from the General
Partner and the Unitholders and (bb) to each holder of Incentive Distribution Units, to the extent
that the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to the Disposed of Adjusted Property
(determined in accordance with the last sentence of the definition of Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items) treated as having been allocated to the General Partner and the Unitholders
pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(xiii)(B) exceed their Share of Additional Book Basis Derivative
Items with respect to such Disposed of Adjusted Property. For purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(xiii)
(B), the General Partner and the Unitholders shall be treated as having been allocated Additional
Book Basis Derivative Items to the extent that such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items have
reduced the amount of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the General Partner
and the Unitholders under the Partnership Agreement (e.g., Additional Book Basis Derivative
Items taken into account in computing cost of goods sold would reduce the amount of book
income otherwise available for allocation among the Partners). Any allocation made pursuant to
this Section 6.1(c)(xiii)(B) shall be made after all of the other Agreed Allocations have been made
as if this Section 6.1(c)(xiii) were not in this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall require
the reallocation of items that have been allocated pursuant to such other Agreed Allocations.
(C)    Net Termination Loss in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) such Net Termination Loss
and (2) the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated in such a manner,
as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible, the Capital Account balances
of the Partners will equal the amount they would have been had no prior Book-Up Events
occurred, and any remaining Net Termination Loss shall be allocated pursuant to Section 6.1(b)
hereof. In allocating Net Termination Loss pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(xiii)(C), the General
Partner shall attempt, to the extent possible, to cause the Capital Accounts of the Unitholders, on
the one hand, and holders of the Incentive Distribution Units, on the other hand, to equal the
amount they would equal if (i) the Carrying Values of the Partnership’s property had not been
previously adjusted in connection with any prior Book-Up Events, (ii) Unrealized Gain and
Unrealized Loss (or, in the case of a liquidation, actual gain or loss) with respect to such
Partnership Property were determined with respect to such unadjusted Carrying Values, and (iii)
any resulting Net Termination Gain had been allocated pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i) (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the provisions set forth in the last sentence of
Section 6.1(b)(i)).
(D)    For purposes of this Section 6.1(c)(xiii), the Unitholders shall be treated as being allocated
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to the extent that such Additional Book Basis Derivative
Items have reduced the amount of income that would otherwise have been allocated to the
Unitholders under this Agreement. In making the allocations required under this Section 6.1(c)
(xiii), the General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other methodology it determines
will satisfy the purpose of this Section 6.1(c)(xiii). Without limiting the foregoing, if an Adjusted
Property is contributed by the Partnership to another entity classified as a
58
partnership for federal income tax purposes (the “lower tier partnership”), the General Partner
may make allocations similar to those described in Section 6.1(c)(xiii)(A)-(C) to the extent the
General Partner determines such allocations are necessary to account for the Partnership’s
allocable share of income, gain, loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to the
contributed Adjusted Property in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of this Section
6.1(c)(xiii).
(E)    The provisions of this Section 6.1(c)(xiii) are intended to minimize, to the extent possible,
allocations of net taxable income to a holder of Incentive Distribution Units for any period, other
than allocations of gross income or gain pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(iii) and shall be interpreted in
a manner consistent with that intent.
(xiv)    Simulated Depletion and Simulated Loss.
(A)    In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(k), Simulated Depletion
with respect to each oil and gas property shall be allocated among the General Partner and the
Unitholders Pro Rata.
(B)    Simulated Loss with respect to the disposition of an oil and gas property shall be allocated
among the Partners in proportion to their allocable share of total amount realized from such
disposition under Section 6.2(c)(i).
Section 6.2    Allocations for Tax Purposes.
(a)    Except as otherwise provided herein, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each item of
income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as
its correlative item of “book” income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.
(b)    The deduction for depletion with respect to each separate oil and natural gas property (as
defined in Section 614 of the Code) shall be computed for federal income tax purposes
separately by the Partners rather than by the Partnership in accordance with section 613A(c)(7)
(D) of the Code. Except as provided in Section 6.2(c)(iii), for purposes of such computation
(before taking into account any adjustments resulting from an election made by the Partnership
under Section 754 of the Code), the adjusted tax basis of each oil and natural gas property (as
defined in Section 614 of the Code) shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests.
Each Partner shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted tax basis in each oil and
natural gas property, allocated as provided above, adjust such share of the adjusted tax basis for
any cost or percentage depletion allowable with respect to such property, and use such adjusted
tax basis in the computation of its cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the
disposition of such property by the Partnership.
(c)    Except as provided in Section 6.2(c)(iii), for the purposes of the separate computation of
gain or loss by each Partner on the sale or disposition of each separate oil and natural gas
property (as defined in Section 614 of the Code), the Partnership’s allocable share of
59
“amount realized” (as such term is defined in Section 1001(b) of the Code) from such sale or
disposition shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:
(i)    first, to the extent such amount realized constitutes a recovery of the Simulated Basis of the
property, to the Partners in the same proportion as the depletable basis of such property was
allocated to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.2(b) (without regard to any special allocation of
basis under Section 6.2(c)(iii));
(ii)    second, the remainder of such amount realized, if any, to the Partners so that, to the
maximum extent possible, the amount realized allocated to each Partner under this Section
6.2(c)(ii) will equal such Partner’s share of the Simulated Gain recognized by the Partnership
from such sale or disposition.
(iii)    The Partners recognize that with respect to Contributed Property and Adjusted Property
there will be a difference between the Carrying Value of such property at the time of contribution
or revaluation, as the case may be, and the adjusted tax basis of such property at that time. All
items of tax depreciation, cost recovery, amortization, adjusted tax basis of depletable properties,
amount realized and gain or loss with respect to such Contributed Property and Adjusted
Property shall be allocated among the Partners to take into account the disparities between the
Carrying Values and the adjusted tax basis with respect to such properties in accordance with
the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d).
(iv)    Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall be made by the General
Partner in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of the Agreement.
(d)    In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or
Adjusted Property, other than an oil and natural gas property (as defined in Section 614 of the
Code), items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall
be allocated for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided
under Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Sections
704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined appropriate by the General Partner (taking into
account the General Partner’s discretion under Section 6.1(c)(x)(C)); provided, that the General
Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.
(e)    The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment
under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property
(to the extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the
depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines
that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt
depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner
Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based
upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership’s
property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate
60
method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to
preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long
as such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the
Record Holders of any class, classes or series of Limited Partner Interests.
(f)    In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1250-1(f), any gain
allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable disposition of any Partnership asset shall,
to the extent possible, after taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same
extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any deductions
directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.
(g)    All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for
federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that
may be made by the Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be
adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into account those
adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.
(h)    Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, be determined for each taxable period and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be
allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which
Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month;
provided, however, that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the
Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction as determined by
the General Partner, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the National
Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the
first Business Day of the month, in which such item is recognized for federal income tax
purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation
to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder.
(i)    Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the provisions of this
Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a
nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the
Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by
the General Partner.
(j)    If Capital Account balances are reallocated between the Partners in accordance with Section
5.5(d)(i) hereof and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4), beginning with the year
of reallocation and continuing until the allocations required are fully taken into account, the
Partnership shall make corrective allocations (allocations of items of gross income or gain or loss
or deduction for federal income tax purposes that do not have a corresponding book allocation) to
take into account the Capital Account reallocation, as provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x).
Section 6.3    Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions to Record Holders.
61
(a)    Subject to Section 16.3, Section 17.3 and Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, within 45
days following the end of each Quarter commencing with the Quarter ending on June 30, 2014,
an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be distributed in
accordance with this Article VI by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected
by the General Partner. All distributions required to be made under this Agreement shall be made
subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act. This Section 6.3 shall not apply to Preferred
Units. All amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source
shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash
theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners pursuant to this Section 6.3 equals the
Operating Surplus from the first day of the Quarter in which Incentive Distribution Units are first
issued through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of
Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on such date shall, except as otherwise provided
in Section 6.5, be deemed to be “Capital Surplus.”
(b)    Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the
Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs,
other than from borrowings described in (a)(ii) of the definition of Available Cash, shall be applied
and distributed solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
12.4.
(c)    The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts
withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as a distribution of Available Cash to
such Partners.
(d)    Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by the Partnership,
directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent, only to the Record
Holder of such Partnership Interest as of the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment
shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the Partnership’s liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in such payment by

Section 6.4    Distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus.
(a)    Subject to Section 16.3 and Section 17.3, Available Cash with respect to any Quarter that is
deemed to be Operating Surplus pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3 or Section 6.5 shall be
distributed as required by Section 16.3 and Section 17.3 and then as follows:
(i)    First, to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in
respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for
such Quarter;
(ii)    Second, to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, until there has been
distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the excess of the First
Target Distribution over the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter;
(iii)    Third, (x) 87% to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, and (y) 13% to the IDR
Holders, Pro Rata, until there has been distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the excess of the Second Target Distribution over the First Target Distribution for
such Quarter; and
62
(iv)    Thereafter, (x) 77% to the General Partner and all Unitholders, Pro Rata, and (y) 23% to the
IDR Holders, Pro Rata;
provided, however, to the extent any Incentive Distribution Units are not Vested Incentive
Distribution Units or are held by the Partnership in treasury as of the Record Date for any
distribution made in accordance with this Section 6.4, the amounts distributable with respect to
such Incentive Distribution Units shall either be retained by the Partnership as a cash reserve for
any permissible Partnership use or distributed to the Unitholders, the General Partner and the
IDR Holders on an iterative basis pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) (taking into account, for the
purpose of determining whether an amount has been distributed equal to the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution or Target Distributions, all other distributions from Operating Surplus for such Quarter
pursuant to this Section 6.4); provided, further, that, if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and
Target Distributions have been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of Section
6.6(a), the distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus with respect to
any Quarter will be made solely in accordance with Section 6.4(a)(iv).
Section 6.5    Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus.
(a)    Subject to Section 16.3 and Section 17.3, Available Cash that is deemed to be Capital
Surplus pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3(a) shall be distributed as required by Section
16.3 and Section 17.3 and then as follows, unless the provisions of Section 6.3 require
otherwise:
(i)    First, 100% to the General Partner and the Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution has been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of Section
6.6(a); and
(ii)    Thereafter, 100% shall be distributed in accordance with Section 6.4 as if it were Operating
Surplus.
Section 6.6    Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels.
(a)    The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall be proportionately
adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected by a
distribution payable in Units or otherwise) of Units or other Partnership Securities in accordance
with Section 5.9 or in the event this Agreement is amended to provide for monthly, rather than
quarterly, distributions with respect to the Units. In the event of a distribution of Available Cash
that is deemed to be from Capital Surplus, the then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution
and Target Distribution, shall be reduced in the same proportion that the distribution had to the
fair market value of the Units immediately prior to the announcement of the distribution. If the
Units are publicly traded on a National Securities Exchange, the fair market value will be the
Current Market Price as of the ex-dividend date. If the Units are not publicly traded, the fair market
value will be determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner.
(b)    The Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distributions shall also be subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 5.11 and Section 6.8.
Section 6.7    Special Provisions Relating to the Incentive Distribution Units.
63
(a)    The aggregate number of Incentive Distribution Units the Partnership shall have authority to
issue shall be 1,000,000. All authorized Incentive Distribution Units are hereby issued to the
Partnership to be held in treasury and may be reissued for any Partnership purpose at any time
and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions
as the General Partner shall determine in its sole discretion, all without the approval of any
Limited Partners. At any given time, all Incentive Distribution Units that are not held by any
Person other than a Group Member will be considered held by the Partnership in treasury.
Incentive Distribution Units held by the Partnership in treasury shall be considered issued.
Incentive Distribution Units may be subject to such additional terms as provided in any
applicable IDR Holder Agreement, including with respect to their conversion, redemption,
purchase, vesting, transfer or forfeiture, as agreed by the General Partner in its sole discretion.
Incentive Distribution Units that are converted, redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by or
forfeited to the Partnership shall cease to be Outstanding, shall be deemed to be held by the
Partnership in treasury and shall be available for reissuance by the Partnership in the sole
discretion of the General Partner.
(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, an IDR Holder shall (i)
possess the rights and obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner
pursuant to Article III and Article VII and (ii) have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to
Section 5.5 and all other provisions related thereto but shall not (x) be entitled to vote on any
matters requiring the approval or vote of the holders of Outstanding Partnership Securities,
except as set forth in Section 13.3(c), Section 6.7(h) or as otherwise required by applicable law,
(y) be entitled to any distributions other than as provided in Section 6.4(a)(iii) and (iv) and Section
12.4 or (z) be allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other than as specified in this
Article VI.
(c)    In addition to rights to convert Vested Incentive Distribution Units pursuant to any applicable
IDR Holder Agreement, an IDR Holder may at any time, and from time to time, provide written
notice (the “IDR Holder Conversion Notice”) to the General Partner requesting that any Vested
Incentive Distribution Units held by such IDR Holder be converted (in whole or in part) into Units.
Upon the approval of any such conversion by the General Partner (which approval shall not be
required for a conversion to be effected during a period of 180 days after the time immediately
prior to the occurrence of an IDR Change of Control; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
such IDR Holder Conversion Notice may be delivered prior to such period), the IDR Holder will
receive a number of Units derived by dividing (i) the average of the aggregate amount of cash
distributions made by the Partnership for each of the two full Quarters immediately preceding the
delivery by the IDR Holder of the IDR Holder Conversion Notice in respect of the Incentive
Distribution Units being converted, by (ii) the average cash distribution per Unit made by the
Partnership for each of the two full Quarters immediately preceding the delivery by the IDR
Holder of the IDR Holder Conversion Notice. No fractional Units will be issued upon the
conversion of the Incentive Distribution Units. Instead, the Partnership shall pay the cash value of
such fractional Units based on the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall
be as of the date that is three Trading Days prior to the date of such conversion). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Units are converted into a right to receive equity interests in another
Person or cash, or any combination thereof, in connection with an IDR Change of Control
pursuant to which an IDR Holder Conversion Notice has been delivered, and such conversion of
Units into other equity interests or cash occurs on or before the date of the conversion of
Incentive
64
Distribution Units pursuant to this Section 6.7(c), an IDR Holder that would otherwise receive
Units pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) shall instead receive such equity interests and cash as
would be received by a Unitholder in connection with such IDR Change of Control as if it held a
number of Units equal to the number of Units such IDR Holder would have otherwise received
pursuant to this Section 6.7(c). The IDR Holder will be entitled to receive such Units or other
consideration no later than the fifteenth Business Day after the date the General Partner notifies
the IDR Holder of its approval, if required, or the consummation of the IDR Change of Control, if
applicable; provided, however, that the issuance of such Units to an IDR Holder shall not occur
prior to the approval of the listing or admission for trading of such Units by the principal National
Securities Exchange upon which the Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such
approval is required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange.
If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Units are then traded has not
approved the listing or admission for trading of such Units on or before the 30th calendar day
following the IDR Holder’s delivery of the IDR Holder Conversion Notice and such approval is
required by the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange, then each IDR
Holder shall have the right to rescind its election or the holders of a majority of the Outstanding
Incentive Distribution Units shall have the right to notify the General Partner (or its successor) that
they have elected to receive other Partnership Interests having such terms as the IDR Holder and
the General Partner (or its successor) may agree that will provide (x) the same economic value,
in the aggregate, as the Units that would have otherwise been issued to such IDR Holder would
have had at the time of the IDR Holder’s delivery of the IDR Holder Conversion Notice, and (y) for
the subsequent conversion (on terms acceptable to the National Securities Exchange upon
which the Units are then traded) of such Partnership Interests into Units within not more than 12
months following the IDR Holder’s delivery of the IDR Holder Election Notice upon the
satisfaction of one or more conditions.
(d)    The General Partner shall have the right, at any time, and from time to time, within 180 days
following the time immediately prior to the occurrence of an IDR Change in Control, to make an
election (the “Change of Control Election”) to cause the conversion of all, but not less than all, of
the Outstanding Vested Incentive Distribution Units by delivering a written notice (the “Change of
Control Election Notice”) to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Units that includes
a determination of the aggregate number of Units that each IDR Holder may receive per Incentive
Distribution Units. Upon any such conversion, each IDR Holder will be entitled to receive a
number of Units equal to (i) a number derived by dividing the greater of (A) the average of the
aggregate amount of cash distributions made by the Partnership for each of the two full Quarters
immediately preceding such election in respect of all Incentive Distribution Units held by such
IDR Holder and (B) the average of the aggregate amount of cash distributions that would have
been made by the Partnership for each of the two full Quarters immediately preceding such
election in respect of all Incentive Distribution Units held by such IDR Holder assuming that the
Partnership had distributed the Second Target Distribution per Unit over such period, by (ii) the
average cash distribution per Unit made by the Partnership for each of the two full Quarters
immediately preceding such election. No fractional Units will be issued upon the conversion of
the Incentive Distribution Units. Instead, the Partnership shall pay the cash value of such
fractional Units based on the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be as
of the date that is three Trading Days prior to the date of such conversion). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Units are converted into a right to receive equity interests in another
Person or cash, or any combination thereof, in connection with an IDR Change of Control
pursuant to which a Change of Control Election Notice has been delivered, and such conversion
of Units into other
65
equity interests or cash occurs on or before the date of the conversion of Incentive Distribution
Units pursuant to this Section 6.7(d), an IDR Holder that would otherwise receive Units pursuant
to this Section 6.7(d) shall instead receive such equity interests and cash as would be received
by a Unitholder in connection with such IDR Change of Control as if it held a number of Units
equal to the number of Units such IDR Holder would have otherwise received pursuant to this
Section 6.7(d). Each IDR Holder will be entitled to receive such Units or other consideration no
later than the fifteenth Business Day after the consummation of the IDR Change of Control;
provided, however, that the issuance of such Units to an IDR Holder shall not occur prior to the
approval of the listing or admission for trading of such Units by the principal National Securities
Exchange upon which the Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such approval is
required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange. If the
principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Units or equity interests in such other
Person are then traded has not approved the listing or admission for trading of such Units or
equity interests in such other Person on or before the 30th calendar day following the General
Partner’s delivery of the Change of Control Election Notice and such approval is required by the
rules and regulations of such National Securities Exchange, then the General Partner shall have
the right to either rescind the Change of Control Election or elect to deliver other Partnership
Interests or other equity interests in such other Person having such terms as the General Partner
may approve that will provide (x) the same economic value, in the aggregate, as the Units that
would have otherwise been issued to such IDR Holder would have had at the time of the General
Partner’s delivery of the Change of Control Election Notice, as determined by the General
Partner, and (y) for the subsequent conversion (on terms acceptable to the National Securities
Exchange upon which the Units are then traded) of such Partnership Interests into Units or equity
interests in such other Person within not more than 12 months following the General Partner’s
delivery of the Change of Control Election Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions
as determined by the General Partner.
(e)    In the event of any conversion of Incentive Distribution Units into Units in accordance with
Section 6.7(c) or Section 6.7(d), the Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar
issue or transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of such Units. However, each
participating IDR Holder shall pay any tax or duty which may be payable relating to any transfer
by such IDR Holder involving the issuance or delivery of such Units in a name other than such
IDR Holder’s name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the notation of book entry (or the
issuance of a Certificate) for such Units being issued in a name other than the IDR Holder’s
name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due
because such Units are to be issued in a name other than such holder’s name. Nothing herein
shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulation.
(f)    [Reserved].
(g)    A Unitholder holding an IDR-Related Unit shall not be issued a Unit Certificate pursuant to
Section 4.1 if the Units are evidenced by Certificates, and shall not be permitted to transfer such
Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder until such time as the General Partner
determines, based on advice of counsel, that each such Unit should have, as a substantive
matter, like intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics, in all material
respects, to the intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics of an Effective
Date Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.7(g), the General Partner
shall take
66
whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such Units in preparation for a
transfer of such Units, including the application of Section 5.5(c)(ii), Section 6.1(c)(x)(A) and
Section 6.1(c)(x)(B).
(h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the General Partner shall not
adopt any amendment to this Agreement that would adversely affect the rights, preferences,
privileges or obligations of any IDR Holder, in its capacity as an IDR Holder, in a manner
disproportionate to the effect of such amendment on the IDR Holders as a whole, without the
prior written consent of each such adversely affected IDR Holder and (ii) unless the General
Partner shall have received the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 75% of the
Outstanding Incentive Distribution Units (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all
Incentive Distribution Units, including Incentive Distribution Units that are not Vested Incentive
Distribution Units, and shall not include any Incentive Distribution Units held by the General
Partner, any Group Member or their respective controlled Affiliates), voting together as a separate
class, there shall be no (x) increase in the number of authorized Incentive Distribution Units or (y)
issuance of any Partnership Securities or other rights having terms substantially similar to
Incentive Distribution Units.
(i)    For any matter described in Section 6.7(h) or Section 13.3(c) for which the IDR Holders are
entitled to vote as a class, such IDR Holders shall be entitled to one vote per Incentive
Distribution Unit.
Section 6.8    Entity Level Taxation.
If legislation is enacted or the official interpretation of existing legislation is modified by a
governmental authority, which after giving effect to such enactment or modification, results in a
Group Member becoming subject to federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or withholding
taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes due from the Group Member prior to such enactment
or modification (including, for avoidance of doubt, any increase in the rate of such taxation
applicable to the Group Member), then the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, reduce the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target Distribution and the Second Target Distribution
by the amount of income or withholding taxes that are payable by reason of any such new
legislation or interpretation (the “Incremental Income Taxes”), or any portion thereof selected by
the General Partner, in the manner provided in this Section 6.8. If the General Partner elects to
reduce the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target Distribution and the Second Target
Distribution for any Quarter with respect to all or a portion of any Incremental Income Taxes, the
General Partner shall estimate for such Quarter the Partnership Group’s aggregate liability (the
“Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount”) for all (or the relevant portion of) such
Incremental Income Taxes; provided, however, that any difference between such estimate and
the actual liability for Incremental Income Taxes (or the relevant portion thereof) for such Quarter
may, to the extent determined by the General Partner be taken into account in determining the
Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount with respect to each Quarter in which any such
difference can be determined. For each such Quarter, the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and
Target Distributions shall be the product obtained by multiplying (a) the amounts therefor that are
set out herein prior to the application of this Section 6.8 times (b) the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) cash and cash equivalents with respect to such Quarter by (ii the sum of cash and
cash equivalents with respect to such Quarter and the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax
Amount for
67
such Quarter, as determined by the General Partner. For purposes of the foregoing, cash and
cash equivalents with respect to a Quarter will be deemed reduced by the Estimated Incremental
Quarterly Tax Amount for that Quarter.
ARTICLE VII

arrangements to all or particular assets of the Partnership, with the other party to the contract to
have no recourse against the General Partner or its assets other than its
68
interest in the Partnership, even if doing that results in the terms of the transaction being less
favorable to the Partnership than would otherwise be the case);
(vi)    the distribution of Partnership cash;
(vii)    the selection and dismissal of employees (including employees having titles such as
“president,” “vice president,” “secretary” and “treasurer”) and agents, outside attorneys,

terms of employment or hiring;
(viii)    the maintenance of insurance for the benefit of the Partnership Group and the Partners;
(ix)    the formation of, or acquisition of an interest in, and the contribution of cash or property and

contributions of cash or property to, any Group Member from time to time) subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 2.4;
(x)    the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of the Partnership, including
the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct

(xi)    the indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies to the extent
permitted by law;
(xii)    the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities Exchange and the
delisting of some or all of the Limited Partner Interests from, or requesting that trading be

Section 4.8);
(xiii)    the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of Partnership Securities (subject to
Section 16.6(f) and Section 17.6(f)), or the issuance of additional options, rights, warrants and
appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities (subject to Section 6.7(h));

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each of the Partners and each other
Person who may acquire an interest in Partnership Securities hereby (i) approves, ratifies and
confirms the execution, delivery and performance by the parties thereto of this
69
Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement, the Contribution Agreement,
the Founders Registration Rights Agreement, any Group Member Agreement of any other Group
Member and the other agreements described in the Offering Memorandum that are related to the
transactions contemplated by the Offering Memorandum; (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on
its own or through any officer of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and perform the
agreements referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the other agreements, acts, transactions
and matters described in or contemplated by the Offering Memorandum on behalf of the
Partnership without any further act, approval or vote of the Partners or the other Persons who
may acquire an interest in Partnership Securities; and (iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or
performance by the General Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate of any of them of this
Agreement or any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement (including the
exercise by the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner of the rights accorded
pursuant to Article XV) shall not constitute a breach by the General Partner of any duty that the
General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited Partners or any other Persons under this
Agreement (or any other agreements) or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity.
Section 7.2    Certificate of Limited Partnership.
The General Partner has caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act. The General Partner
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or documents that the
General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation,
qualification and operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners
have limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the Partnership may
elect to do business or own property. To the extent the General Partner determines such action to
be necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of
the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a limited
partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited partners have limited liability)
under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may elect
to do business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.4(a), the General Partner shall
not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited
Partnership, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.
Section 7.3    Restrictions on the General Partner’s Authority.
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the General Partner may not, without
written approval of the specific act by holders of all of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests or
by other written instrument executed and delivered by holders of all of the Outstanding Limited
Partner Interests subsequent to the date of this Agreement, take any action in contravention of
this Agreement, including, (i) committing any act that would make it impossible to carry on the
ordinary business of the Partnership; (ii) possessing Partnership property, or assigning any rights
in specific Partnership property, for other than a Partnership purpose; (iii) admitting a Person as a
Partner; (iv) amending this Agreement in any manner; or (v) transferring its interest as a general
partner of the Partnership.
(b)    Except as provided in Article XII and Article XIV, the General Partner may not sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership Group,
70
taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions (including by way of
merger, consolidation or other combination or sale of ownership interests of the Partnership’s
Subsidiaries) without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority; provided, however, that this
provision shall not preclude or limit the General Partner’s ability to mortgage, pledge,
hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership
Group and shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of the assets of the Partnership Group
pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the
approval of holders of a Unit Majority, the General Partner shall not, on behalf of the Partnership,
(i) except as permitted under Section 4.6, Section 11.1 and Section 11.2, elect or cause the
Partnership to elect a successor general partner of the Partnership or (ii) consent to any
amendment to the Operating Partnership Agreement or the Operating Partnership GP Agreement
or, except as expressly permitted by Section 7.9(f), take any action permitted to be taken by a
member of the Operating Partnership GP or any partner of the Operating Partnership, in either
case, that would adversely affect the Limited Partners (including any particular class or series of
Partnership Interests as compared to any other class or series of Partnership Interests) in any
material respect.
Section 7.4    Reimbursement of the General Partner.
(a)    Except as provided in this Section 7.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the General
Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general partner or managing member of
any Group Member.
(b)    The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the
General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it
makes on behalf of the Partnership Group (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and
other amounts paid to any Person including Affiliates of the General Partner to perform services
for the Partnership Group or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to the
Partnership Group) and (ii) all other expenses allocable to the Partnership Group or otherwise
incurred by the General Partner in connection with operating the Partnership Group’s business
(including expenses allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The General Partner shall
determine the expenses that are allocable to the Partnership Group. Reimbursements pursuant
to this Section 7.4 shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.7.
(c)    The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who shall have no right to
vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit
plans, employee programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and practices
involving the issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants or
appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities), or cause the Partnership to issue
Partnership Securities in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan, employee
program or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, in each case for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, any Group Member or
any Affiliate, or any of them, in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit
of the Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any
of its Affiliates any Partnership Securities that the General Partner or such Affiliates are obligated
to provide to any employees pursuant to any such employee benefit plans, employee programs
or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection with any such
plans,
71
programs and practices (including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of
Partnership Securities purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership
to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in
accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and all obligations of the General Partner under any
employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices adopted by the General
Partner as permitted by this Section 7.4(c) shall constitute obligations of the General Partner
hereunder and shall be assumed by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to
Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 or the transferee of or successor to all of the General Partner’s
General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6.
Section 7.5    Outside Activities.
(a)    After the Closing Date, the General Partner, for so long as it is the general partner of the
Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general partner or managing
member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any other partnership or limited liability
company of which the Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake
activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited partner in the Partnership)
and (ii) shall not engage or allow any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any business or activity or
incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its performance as
general partner or managing member, if any, of one or more Group Members or as described in
or contemplated by the Registration Statement or (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt
or equity securities in any Group Member.
(b)    Except as may otherwise be provided in an agreement entered into by an Indemnitee, each
Indemnitee (other than the General Partner and any of its Subsidiaries) shall have the right to
engage in businesses of every type and description and other activities for profit and to engage in
and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every type or description, whether
in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group Member, independently
or with others, including business interests and activities in direct competition with the business
and activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement or any duty expressed or implied by law to any Group Member or any Partner. Except
as may otherwise be provided in an agreement entered into by an Indemnitee, but
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging in competitive
activities by any Indemnitees (other than the General Partner and any of its Subsidiaries) in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby approved by the Partnership and all
Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of any fiduciary duty or any other obligation of
any type whatsoever of the General Partner or of any Indemnitee for the Indemnitees (other than
the General Partner and any of its Subsidiaries) to engage in such business interests and
activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership.
(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of corporate
opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Indemnitee (including the General
Partner and any of its Subsidiaries). No Indemnitee (including the General Partner and any of its
Subsidiaries) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or
other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership shall have any duty to communicate or
offer such opportunity to the Partnership, and such Indemnitee (including the General Partner
and any of its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to the Partnership, to any Limited
72
Partner or any other Person for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that
such Indemnitee (including the General Partner and any of its Subsidiaries) pursues or acquires
for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or
information to the Partnership.
(d)    Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, none of the Group Members, any Limited
Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, or the partnership relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any
Indemnitee.
(e)    The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units, Preferred Units, Incentive
Distribution Units or other Partnership Securities in addition to those acquired on the Closing
Date and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise, at their
option, all rights relating to all Units or other Partnership Securities acquired by them. For
purposes of this Section 7.5(d), the term “Affiliates,” when used with respect to the General
Partner, shall not include any Group Member.
Section 7.6    Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the Partnership or
Group Members.
(a)    The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by
the Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the General Partner may
determine; provided, however, that in any such case the lending party may not charge the
borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party
or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the
borrowing party by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an arm’s-length basis
(without reference to the lending party’s financial abilities or guarantees), all as determined by
the General Partner. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other
than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing
of such funds. For purposes of this Section 7.6(a) and Section 7.6(b), the term “Group Member”
shall include any Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group Member.
(b)    The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group Member may
borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions determined by the General Partner.
No Group Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than
another Group Member).
Section 7.7    Indemnification.
(a)    To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this
Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including
legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee;
73
provided, that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final
and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in
respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section
7.7, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful; provided,
further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be available to the General Partner
or its Affiliates (other than a Group Member) with respect to its or their obligations incurred
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement or the Contribution Agreement
(other than obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership). Any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the
Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such
indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the
Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.
(b)    To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section 7.7(a) in defending any claim,
demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior
to a determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the
Partnership of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall
be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section
7.7.
(c)    The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to
which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests entitled to vote on such matter, as a matter of law or
otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee’s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in
any other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such
capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the
Indemnitee.
(d)    The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General Partner or its
Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General Partner, its Affiliates and such other
Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted
against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnership’s
activities or such Person’s activities on behalf of the Partnership, regardless of whether the
Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the
provisions of this Agreement.
(e)    For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have requested an
Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of
its duties to the Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the
plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute “fines” within the
meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to any
employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to
be in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a
purpose that is in the best interest of the Partnership.
74
(f)    In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal liability by reason of
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.
(g)    An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.7
because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the
indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
(h)    The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the
benefit of any other Persons.
(i)    No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall in any
manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past, present or future Indemnitee to be
indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such
Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from
or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted, and provided such Person
became an Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.
Section 7.8    Liability of Indemnitees.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be
liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partners or any other Persons who
have acquired interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred
as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of
the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct
or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee’s conduct was
criminal.
(b)    Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section 7.1(a), the
General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any
of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the
General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any
such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith.
(c)    To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties (including fiduciary duties)
and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any
other Indemnitee acting in connection with the Partnership’s business or affairs shall not be liable
to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.
(d)    Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees
under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal
with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
75
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be
asserted.
Section 7.9    Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and Modification of Duties.
(a)    Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member Agreement,
whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other
hand, any resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such
conflict of interest shall be permitted and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, deemed approved
by all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member
Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by
law or equity, if the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i)
approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a majority of the Units (excluding
Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates), (iii) on terms no less favorable to the
Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv)
fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or
advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be authorized but not required in
connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval of such
resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that has not
received Special Approval. If Special Approval is not sought and the Board of Directors of the
General Partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict
of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be
presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors of the General Partner acted in good
faith, and in any proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited
Partner or any other Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging such approval, the Person
bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming such presumption.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law
or equity, the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the Offering Memorandum are
hereby approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.
(b)    Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other
action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of the
Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, any Group
Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless
another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, or such Affiliates
causing it to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in
good faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement,
any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the
Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. In order for a determination or other
action to be in “good faith” for purposes of this Agreement, the Person or Persons making such
determination or taking or declining to take such other action must believe that the determination
or other action is in the best interests of the Partnership, unless the context otherwise requires.
76
(c)    Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other
action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its
capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group
Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any fiduciary duty
or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, and the General Partner, or
such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any
other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity.
By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrase, “at the option of the General
Partner,” or some variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that the General
Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the General
Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its
Partnership Interests, it shall be acting in its individual capacity.
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General Partner and its
Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of
any asset of the Partnership Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any
Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as
may be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use.
Any determination by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall
be at its option.
(e)    Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by law, neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to
the Partnership or any Limited Partner and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of
the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other
Indemnitee. To the fullest extent permitted by law and notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary (including this Article VII) or any duty otherwise existing at law or in
equity, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any fiduciary or other
duties to Preferred Holders or IDR Holders; provided, however, that the foregoing does not
eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, without reference to the
definition of “good faith” in Section 7.9(b).
(f)    The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a
partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of actions by the general partner or managing
member of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the General
Partner pursuant to this Section 7.9.
(g)    Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict of interest is
required under this Agreement to be “fair and reasonable” to any Person, the fair and reasonable
nature of such transaction, arrangement or resolution shall be considered in the context of all
similar or related transactions.
77
Section 7.10    Other Matters Concerning the General Partner.
(a)    The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon
any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
(b)    The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management
consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act
taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of
such Persons as to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such
Person’s professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done
or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
(c)    The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations
hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or
attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers of the Partnership. Each such attorney shall, to the
extent provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to
do and perform each and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the
General Partner hereunder.
(d)    Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the Delaware Act or any
applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified, waived or limited, to the extent permitted by
law, as required to permit the General Partner to act under this Agreement and to make any
decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement, so long as such action is
reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of
the Partnership.
Section 7.11    Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities.
The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership
Securities, such Partnership Securities shall be held by the Partnership as treasury securities
unless they are expressly cancelled by action of an appropriate officer of the General Partner. As
long as Partnership Securities are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall
not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Incentive
Distribution Units that are held by the Partnership in treasury (i) shall not be allocated any items
of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to Article VI and (ii) shall neither be entitled to vote
nor be counted for quorum purposes. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities
for its own account, subject to the provisions of Article IV and Article X.
Section 7.12    [Reserved].
Section 7.13    Reliance by Third Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the
Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and any officer of the General
78
Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name of the Partnership
has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets
of the Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and
such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were the
Partnership’s sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses or other remedies that may be
available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or
any such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with
the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the
terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience
of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives. Each and
every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership by the
General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every
Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of
such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (b) the
Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized
and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document
or instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.
ARTICLE VIII
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS
Section 8.1    Records and Accounting.
The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the principal office of the Partnership
appropriate books and records with respect to the Partnership’s business, including all books
and records necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any information required to be provided
pursuant to Section 3.4(a). Any books and records maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership
in the regular course of its business, including the record of the Record Holders and assignees of
Units or other Partnership Securities, books of account and records of Partnership proceedings,
may be kept on, or be in the form of, computer disks, hard drives, punch cards, magnetic tape,
photographs, micrographics or any other information storage device; provided, that the books and
records so maintained are convertible into clearly legible written form within a reasonable period
of time. The books of the Partnership shall be maintained, for financial reporting purposes, on an
accrual basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Partnership shall not be required to keep
books maintained on a cash basis and the General Partner shall be permitted to calculate cash-
based measures, including Operating Surplus and Adjusted Operating Surplus, by making such
adjustments to its accrual basis books to account for non-cash items and other adjustments as
the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.
Section 8.2    Fiscal Year.
The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be a fiscal year ending December 31.
Section 8.3    Reports.
79
(a)    As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 120 days after the close of each fiscal year
of the Partnership, the General Partner shall cause to be mailed or made available to each
Record Holder of a Partnership Security as of a date selected by the General Partner, an annual
report containing financial statements of the Partnership for such fiscal year of the Partnership,
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including a balance sheet and statements of
operations, Partnership equity and cash flows, such statements to be audited by a firm of
independent public accountants selected by the General Partner.

Exchange on which the Partnership Securities are listed or admitted to trading, or as the General
Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

and local income tax purposes on the basis of the accrual method and a taxable year ending on
December 31. The tax information reasonably required by Record Holders for federal and state
income tax reporting purposes with respect to a taxable year shall be furnished to them within 90
days of the close of the calendar year in which the Partnership’s taxable year ends. The
classification, realization and recognition of income, gain, losses and deductions and other items
shall be on the accrual method of accounting for federal income tax purposes.
Section 9.2    Tax Elections.
(a)    The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in accordance with
applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation of the right to seek to revoke any
such election upon the General Partner’s determination that such revocation is in the best
interests of the Limited Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code if any of the Limited
Partner Interests are listed on a National Securities Exchange, the General Partner shall be
authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention whereby the price paid by a transferee of a
Limited Partner Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of such Limited
Partner Interests on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests
are listed or admitted for trading during the calendar month in which such transfer is deemed to
occur pursuant to Section 6.2(h) without regard to the actual price paid by such transferee.
(b)    Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine whether the
Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.
Section 9.3    Tax Controversies.
80
Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner is designated as the Tax Matters Partner
(as defined in the Code) and is authorized and required to represent the Partnership (at the
Partnership’s expense) in connection with all examinations of the Partnership’s affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and to expend
Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated therewith. Each Partner agrees
to cooperate with the General Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all things reasonably
required by the General Partner to conduct such proceedings.
Section 9.4    Withholding.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is authorized to take
any action that may be required to cause the Partnership and other Group Members to comply
with any withholding requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code.
To the extent that the Partnership is required or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing
authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to any Partner
(including, without limitation, by reason of Section 1446 of the Code), the General Partner may
treat the amount withheld as a distribution of cash pursuant to Section 6.3 in the amount of such
withholding from such Partner.
ARTICLE X
ADMISSION OF PARTNERS
Section 10.1    Admission of Founding Investors and Initial Limited Partners.

transferee of, or other such Person acquiring, a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee
holder or an agent or representative acquiring such Limited Partner Interests for the account of
another Person) (i) shall be admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner with respect to the
Limited Partner Interests so transferred or issued to such Person when any such transfer,

forth in this Agreement and (v) makes the consents and waivers contained in this Agreement, all

Interests and the admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this
Agreement. A Person may become a Limited Partner or Record Holder of a Limited Partner
81
Interest without the consent or approval of any of the Partners. A Person may not become a
Limited Partner without acquiring a Limited Partner Interest and until such Person is reflected in
the books and records of the Partnership as the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interest.
The rights and obligations of a Person who is a Non-citizen Assignee shall be determined in
accordance with Section 4.9.

records of the Partnership maintained for such purpose by the Partnership or the Transfer Agent.
The General Partner shall update the books and records of the Partnership from time to time as
necessary to reflect accurately the information therein (or shall cause the Transfer Agent to do so,
as applicable). A Limited Partner Interest may be represented by a Certificate, as provided in
Section 4.1.
(c)    Any transfer of a Limited Partner Interest shall not entitle the transferee to share in the profits
and losses, to receive distributions, to receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit or any similar item or to any other rights to which the transferor was entitled until the
transferee becomes a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 10.2(a).

A successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 or the transferee
of or successor to all of the General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6 who is proposed to
be admitted as a successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General
Partner, effective immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor or
transferring General Partner, pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 or the transfer of the
General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6, provided, however, that no such successor shall
be admitted to the Partnership until compliance with the terms of Section 4.6 has occurred and
such successor has executed and delivered such other documents or instruments as may be
required to effect such admission. Any such successor shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on
the business of the members of the Partnership Group without dissolution.
Section 10.4    Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership.
To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall take all steps
necessary or appropriate under the Delaware Act to amend the records of the Partnership to
reflect such admission and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this
Agreement and, if required by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an amendment to
the Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the General Partner may for this purpose, among
others, exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.6.

described in clauses (A)-(C) of this Section 11.1(a)(iv); or (E) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in
the appointment of a trustee (but not a debtor-in-possession), receiver or liquidator of the General
Partner or of all or any substantial part of its properties;
(v)    A final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code is entered by a court with appropriate jurisdiction pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary
petition by or against the General Partner; or
(vi)    (p) in the event the General Partner is a corporation, a certificate of dissolution or its
equivalent is filed for the General Partner, or 90 days expire after the date of notice to the General
Partner of revocation of its charter without a reinstatement of its charter, under the laws of its state
of incorporation; (B) in the event the General Partner is a partnership or a limited liability
company, the dissolution and commencement of winding up of the General Partner; (C) in the
event the General Partner is acting in such capacity by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, the
termination of the trust; (D) in the event the General Partner is a natural person, his death or

Partner.
If an Event of Withdrawal specified in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi)(A), (B), (C) or (E) occurs, the
withdrawing General Partner shall give notice to the Limited Partners within 30 days after such
occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of Withdrawal described in this
Section 11.1 shall result in the withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership.
(b)    Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of
Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement under the following circumstances: (i)
at any time during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight,
Central Time, on March 31, 2016, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90
days’ advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners; provided, that prior to the
effective date of such withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a
majority of the Outstanding Units (excluding Units held by the General Partner and its
83
Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an Opinion of Counsel
(“Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel”) that such withdrawal (following the selection of the successor
General Partner) would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or any
Group Member or cause any Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent
not already so treated or taxed); (ii) at any time after 12:00 midnight, Central Time, on March 31,
2016, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days’ advance notice to the
Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such notice; at any time that
the General Partner ceases to be the General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(ii) or is
removed pursuant to Section 11.2; or (iv) notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at any time
that the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days’ advance notice of its
intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified
in the notice, if at the time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the
Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the
occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner
as general partner or managing member, if any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members. If the General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), the
holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a successor
General Partner. The Person so elected as successor General Partner shall automatically
become the successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the
other Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing member.
If, prior to the effective date of the General Partner’s withdrawal, a successor is not selected by
the Unitholders as provided in this Agreement or the Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal
Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved in accordance with Section 12.1. Any
successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.
Section 11.2    Removal of the General Partner.
The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the Unitholders holding at
least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates) voting as a single class. Any such action by such holders for removal of the General
Partner must also provide for the election of a successor General Partner by the Unitholders
holding a majority of the outstanding Units voting as a single class (including Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates). Such removal shall be effective immediately following the
admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to Section 10.3. The removal of the General
Partner shall also automatically constitute the removal of the General Partner as general partner
or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If a Person is elected as a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person shall, upon
admission pursuant to Section 10.3, automatically become a successor general partner or
managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner or a managing member. The right of the holders of Outstanding Units
to remove the General Partner shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has
received an opinion opining as to the matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any
successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3.
84
Section 11.3    Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General Partner.
(a)    In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances where such
withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the General Partner by the holders
of Outstanding Units under circumstances where Cause does not exist, if the successor General
Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, the Departing
General Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of
such Departing General Partner, to require its successor to purchase its General Partner Interest
and its general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in the other Group Members and all
of its Incentive Distribution Units, if any, (collectively, the “Combined Interest”) in exchange for an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be
determined and payable as of the effective date of its departure. If the General Partner is removed
by the Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws
under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor General
Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if the business
of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is not
the former General Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to the
effective date of the departure of such Departing General Partner (or, in the event the business of
the Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of the Partnership is continued), to
purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined Interest of the
Departing General Partner. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to
receive all reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 7.4,
including any employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection
with the termination of any employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its Affiliates
(other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members.
For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Departing General Partner’s
Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General Partner
and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the effective date of such Departing
General Partner’s departure, by an independent investment banking firm or other independent
expert selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on
other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If such
parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent expert
within 45 days after the effective date of such departure, then the Departing General Partner shall
designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing
General Partner’s successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent
investment banking firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm
or other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest of the
Departing General Partner. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current trading price of Units on
any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted to trading, the value
of the Partnership’s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing General Partner, the value
of the Incentive Distribution Units held by the General Partner, if any, and the General Partner
Interest and other factors it may deem relevant.
85
(b)    If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in Section 11.3(a), the
Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall become a Limited Partner and its Combined
Interest shall be converted into Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm
or other independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without reduction in such
Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of its
successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its
transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which
the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this
Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing General Partner to Units will be
characterized as if the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined
Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Units.
(c)    If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or
Section 11.2 (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the
successor General Partner is not the former General Partner) and the option described in Section
11.3(a) is not exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner shall, at the
effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute to the Partnership cash in the amount
equal to the product of the Percentage Interest of the Departing General Partner and the Net
Agreed Value of the Partnership’s assets on such date. In such event, such successor General
Partner shall, subject to the following sentence, be entitled to its Percentage Interest of all
Partnership allocations and distributions to which the Departing General Partner was entitled. In
addition, the successor General Partner shall cause this Agreement to be amended to reflect that,
from and after the date of such successor General Partner’s admission, the successor General
Partner’s interest in all Partnership distributions and allocations shall be its Percentage Interest.
Section 11.4    [Reserved].
Section 11.5    Withdrawal of Limited Partners.
No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership; provided, however, that
when a transferee of a Limited Partner’s Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the
Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a
Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.
ARTICLE XII
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION
Section 12.1    Dissolution.
The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of additional Limited Partners or by the
admission of a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon
the removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected
pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such
successor General Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership. Subject to Section
12.2, the Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon:
86
(a)    an election to dissolve the Partnership by the Board of Directors of the General Partner that
is approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;
(b)    the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of
the Delaware Act;
(c)    an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section 11.1(a) (other than
Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and an Opinion of Counsel is received as
provided in Section 11.1(b) or Section 11.2 and such successor is admitted to the Partnership
pursuant to Section 10.3; or
(d)    at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is continued without
dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.
Section 12.2    Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After Dissolution.
Upon (a) an Event of Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as
provided in Section 11.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to select a successor to such
Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, then within 90 days
thereafter or (b) an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v)
or (vi), then, in either case, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within 180 days thereafter,
the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the business without dissolution of the
Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by appointing as a
successor General Partner a Person approved by the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless such an
election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above, the Partnership shall
dissolve and conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so
made, then:
(i)    the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier dissolved in accordance
with this Article XII;
(ii)    if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then the interest of the
former General Partner shall be treated in the manner provided in Section 11.3; and
(iii)    the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as General Partner,
effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in writing to be bound by this Agreement;
provided, that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a successor General Partner
and to continue the business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not be exercised unless
the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not
result in the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the Partnership nor any
Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be
taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue
(to the extent not already so treated or taxed).
Section 12.3    Liquidator.
87
Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section
12.2, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if
other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as
may be approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units voting as a single
class. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time
without 15 days’ prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of
removal approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units voting as a single
class. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute
Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator)
shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by the holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Units voting as a single class. The right to approve a successor or substitute
Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or
substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in
this Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may
exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers
conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the
applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than
the limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.3) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and
functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the
winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.
Section 12.4    Liquidation.
The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities,
and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the
Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:
(a)    Disposition of Assets. The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by
distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such Partner or
Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the Partners receiving the property shall
be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal to the fair market value of
the property distributed; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must
be made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the
Partnership’s assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an immediate sale or distribution
of all or some of the Partnership’s assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the Partnership’s assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners.
(b)    Discharge of Liabilities. Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator
as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts
to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution rights under Article VI, Article XVI and
Article XVII, as applicable; provided, that any accumulated and unpaid Preferred Distributions
shall be paid pursuant to this Section 12.4(b) prior to making any distribution pursuant to Section
12.4(c). With respect to any liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise
not yet due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
88
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as additional
liquidation proceeds.
(c)    Liquidation Distributions. All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge
liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with,
and to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined
after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of
distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable year of the Partnership during which
the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made
by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such occurrence).
Section 12.5    Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership.
Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in Section
12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership
and all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than
the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.
Section 12.6    Return of Contributions.
The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute
or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the
Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being
expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.
Section 12.7    Waiver of Partition.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the
Partnership property.
Section 12.8    Capital Account Restoration.
No Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon
liquidation of the Partnership.

Partnership Interests) in any material respect, (ii) to be necessary or appropriate to (A) satisfy any
requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or
regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal or state

Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or “plan asset” regulations adopted under the Employee

proposed only by the General Partner; provided, however, that the General Partner shall have no
duty or obligation to propose any amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so free of
any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and, in
declining to propose an amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law shall not be required to
act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group
Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any
other law, rule or regulation or at equity. Subject to Section 6.7(h), Section 16.5 and Section 17.5,
to the extent applicable, a proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by (a) the
General Partner, and the holders of a Unit Majority,(b) a majority of the votes cast by the holders
of Units entitled to vote on the proposed amendment at a meeting at which a quorum is present in
accordance with Section 13.9, unless a greater or different percentage is required under this
Agreement or by Delaware law. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of the
holders of a specified percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains
the text of the proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner
shall seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call a meeting
of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The General Partner shall
notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any such proposed amendments.
Section 13.3    Amendment Requirements.
(a)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no provision of this
Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned
by the General Partner) required to take any action shall be amended, altered, changed,
repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of reducing such voting
percentage unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of
holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than the
voting requirement sought to be reduced.
91
(b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no amendment to this
Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited Partner without its consent, unless such
shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an amendment approved pursuant to Section
13.3(c), or (ii) enlarge the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in
any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates without its consent, which consent may be given or withheld at its option.
(c)    Except as provided in Section 14.3 and subject to Section 16.5(b)(i) with respect to Series A
Preferred Units, Section 17.5(b)(i) with respect to Series B Preferred Units and Section 6.7(h)

authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval of any Partners as

rights or preferences of any class or series of Partnership Interests in relation to other classes or
series of Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class or series affected.
(d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for amendments pursuant to
Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall
become effective without the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units
voting as a single class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner under applicable law.
(e)    Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be amended with the
approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units.
Section 13.4    Meetings.
(a)    All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken in the
manner provided in this Article XIII.
(b)    Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited
Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of the class, classes or
series for which a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting by
delivering to the General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited
Partners wish to call a special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for which
the special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited
Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to
comply with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar requirements governing
the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the General
Partner shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly
through the Transfer Agent. A special meeting shall be held at a time and place determined by
the General Partner on a date not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the mailing of
notice of the meeting. Limited Partners shall not vote at any special meeting for the election of
directors to the Board of Directors of the General Partner or on matters that would cause the
Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business
and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners’ limited liability under the
Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.
92
(c)    (i) An annual meeting of Limited Partners for the election of directors to the Board of
Directors of the General Partner and such other matters as the Board of Directors of the General
Partner shall submit to a vote of the Limited Partners shall be held, following the first to occur of
(A) the Founding Investors ceasing to own in the aggregate 50% or more of the outstanding Units
or (B) the closing of an Initial Public Offering, in either case on the second Wednesday in May of
each year if a Business Day, and if not a Business Day, then on the next Business Day following,
at 10 a.m., or at such other date and time as may be fixed from time to time by the General
Partner at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed from time to time by
the General Partner and all as stated in the notice of the meeting. Notice of the annual meeting
shall be given in accordance with Section 13.5 not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior
to the date of such meeting.
(ii)    The Limited Partners entitled to vote at the annual meeting shall vote together as a single
class. The Limited Partners entitled to vote shall elect by a plurality of the votes cast at such
meeting persons to serve on the Board of Directors of the General Partner who are nominated in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.4(c). The exercise by a Limited Partner of the
right to elect the Directors and any other rights afforded to such Limited Partner under this
Section 13.4(c) shall be in such Limited Partner’s capacity as a limited partner of the Partnership
and shall not cause a Limited Partner to be deemed to be taking part in the management and
control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize such Limited Partner’s
limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is
qualified to do business.
(iii)    Each Limited Partner entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote for each Outstanding Unit

Directors of the General Partner or (B) by any Limited Partner who was a Record Holder of
Outstanding Units at the time of giving notice provided for in this Agreement, who is entitled to

have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the
procedures set forth above and to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
94
(vii)    This Section 13.4(c) shall not be deemed in any way to limit or impair the ability of the
General Partner, or the Board of Directors of the General Partner on behalf of the General
Partner, to adopt a “poison pill” or unitholder or other similar rights plan with respect to the
Partnership, whether such poison pill or plan contains “dead hand” provisions, “no hand”
provisions or other provisions relating to the redemption of the poison pill or plan, in each case as
such terms are used under Delaware common law.
(viii)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a majority of the Board of Directors
of the General Partner may be nominated and elected to the extent provided in the Registration
Rights Agreement.
(ix)    The General Partner shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take such action
as shall be necessary or appropriate to give effect to and implement the provisions of this Section
13.4(c), including, without limitation, amending the limited liability company agreement of the

directors or other governing body of such Subsidiary.

the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the
General Partner may set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days
before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule, regulation,

requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals
are sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the

held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a

constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be
included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at
the meeting.
Section 13.9    Quorum and Voting.
The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority in voting power of the Outstanding
Partnership Securities of the class, classes or series for which a meeting has been called
(including Outstanding Partnership Securities deemed owned by the General Partner)
represented in person or by proxy, entitled to vote at the meeting, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of Limited Partners of such class, classes or series unless. For purposes of establishing
a quorum, abstentions and broker non-votes in respect of such Outstanding Partnership
Securities shall be deemed to be Outstanding Partnership Securities present at such meeting.
However, if any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater
percentage in voting power of such Partnership Securities, in which casethen the quorum shall
be the holders of such greater percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and
held in accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of in voting power.
For all matters presented to the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Partnership Securities that
in the aggregate represent a majority of theat a meeting at which a quorum is present, for which
no minimum or other vote of Limited Partners is required by any other provision of this
Agreement, the rules or regulations of any National Securities Exchange on which the
Partnership Securities are admitted to trading, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation
applicable to the Partnership or its Partnership Interests, a majority of the votes cast by Limited
Partners holding Outstanding Partnership Securities and entitled to vote and be present in
person or by proxy at such meetingon the matter shall be deemed to constitute the act of all
Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to such action
under the provisions of this Agreement, in which
96
case. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall be deemed to not be votes cast with respect to
such matter. On any matter for which a minimum or other vote of Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Partnership Securities is provided by any other provision of this Agreement or
required by the rules or regulations of any National Securities Exchange on which the
Partnership Securities are admitted to trading, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation
applicable to the Partnership or its Partnership Interests, then the act of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Partnership Securities with voting power that in the aggregate represent at
least such greater or different percentage shall be required (with the effect of abstentions and
broker non-votes to be determined based on the applicable rule, regulation or law governing the
vote of Limited Partners required to approve such matter; provided that if the effect of abstentions
and broker non-votes is to be specified by such applicable rule, regulation or law and there is no
prevailing interpretation of such effect, then abstentions and broker non-votes shall be deemed to
not have been cast with respect to such matter; provided further, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any matter on which this Agreement requires the approval of a specified
percentage of the Outstanding Partnership Securities, abstentions and broker non-votes shall be
counted as votes against such matter). The Limited Partners present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of Outstanding
Partnership Securities specified in this Agreement (including Outstanding Partnership Securities
deemed owned by the General Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited
Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a
majority in voting power of the Outstanding Partnership Securities entitled to vote at such
meeting (including Outstanding Partnership Securities deemed owned by the General Partner)
represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as
provided in Section 13.7.

meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes

Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it
may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or
solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies,
the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and
examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in

Section 13.11    Action Without a Meeting.

Partners may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if an approval in
writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less
97
than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Partnership Securities (including Partnership
Securities deemed owned by the General Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such
provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Partnership Securities are listed or admitted to trading, in which case the
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern).
Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who
have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot submitted
to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the
Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General
Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Partnership Securities held
by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the
Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is
solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals
shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care
of the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of a date
not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with the Partnership
and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of
such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not
cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the
business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners’ limited liability
and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and
liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.
Section 13.12    Right to Vote and Related Matters.
(a)    Only those Record Holders of the Partnership Securities on the Record Date set pursuant to
Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained in the definition of “Outstanding”) shall
be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to
matters as to which the holders of the Outstanding Partnership Securities have the right to vote or
to act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the
Outstanding Partnership Securities shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the
Record Holders of such Outstanding Partnership Securities.
(b)    With respect to Partnership Securities that are held for a Person’s account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any
of the foregoing), in whose name such Partnership Securities are registered, such other Person
shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Partnership Securities on any matter, and
unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Partnership
Securities in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the
Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of
this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to the
provisions of Section 4.3.

and its Affiliates hold more than 85% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class or series
then Outstanding, the General Partner shall then have the right, which right it may assign and
transfer in whole or in part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable at
its option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Limited Partner Interests of such class or
series then Outstanding held by Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, at the

any of its Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class or series purchased during
the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the repurchase right described in this Article XV shall not apply to

trading on any National Securities Exchange means the average of the daily Closing Prices (as
hereinafter defined) per Limited Partner Interest of such class or series for the 20 consecutive
Trading Days (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; (ii) “Closing Price” for any

such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, regular way, as reported
in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or

over-the-counter market, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market or such other system then in
use, or, if on any such day such Limited Partner Interests of such class or series are not quoted
by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day as
furnished by a professional market maker making a market in such Limited Partner Interests of
such class or series selected by the General Partner, or if on any such day no market maker is

Limited Partner Interests on such day as determined by the General Partner; and (iii) “Trading
Day” means a day on which the principal National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests of any class or series are listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction

Securities Exchange, a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are open.
(b)    If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the Partnership elects to
exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the
General Partner shall deliver to the Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the
“Notice of Election to Purchase”) and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such
Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner Interests of such class or
series (as of a Record Date selected by the General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60,
days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for
a period of at least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general circulation
printed in the English language and published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The
Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in
accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Limited Partner Interests will be purchased and state

such Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited Partner
Interests, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Limited Partner Interests, in
exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may
specify, or as may be required by any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed
to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the records of the
Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of whether the
owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate or
the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner Interests to be
purchased in accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have
been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the
Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of
the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and
after the Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Limited Partner Interests, shall not have been surrendered for purchase, all rights
of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests (including any rights pursuant to Article IV, Article
V, Article VI and Article XII) shall thereupon cease, except the right to receive the purchase price
(determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for Limited Partner Interests therefor, without
interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Limited Partner Interests,
and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record books of the Transfer
Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the
Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner
Interests from and after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Limited
Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner Interests pursuant to
Article IV, Article V, Article VI and Article XII).
(c)    At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited Partner
Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1 may surrender his Certificate
evidencing such Limited Partner Interest, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated
103
Limited Partner Interests, to the Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described
in Section 15.1(a), therefor, without interest thereon.
ARTICLE XVI
SERIES A FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PERPETUAL
PREFERRED UNITS
Section 16.1    Designation.
The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of Preferred Units to be designated
as “8% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units,” and
fixes the preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units as
set forth in this Article XVI. Each Series A Preferred Unit shall be identical in all respects to every
other Series A Preferred Unit, except as to the respective dates from which the Series A
Liquidation Preference shall increase or from which Series A Distributions may begin accruing,
to the extent such dates may differ. The Series A Preferred Units represent perpetual equity
interests in the Partnership and shall not give rise to a claim by the holder for redemption thereof
at a particular date.
Section 16.2    Series A Preferred Units.
(a)    The authorized number of Series A Preferred Units shall be unlimited. Series A Preferred
Units that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Partnership shall be cancelled.
(b)    The Series A Preferred Units shall be represented by a single certificate registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, and no Series A Holder shall be entitled to receive a
certificate evidencing such Series A Preferred Units, unless otherwise required by law or the
Depository gives notice of its intention to resign or is no longer eligible to act as such and the
Partnership shall have not selected a substitute Depository within 60 calendar days thereafter.
So long as the Depository shall have been appointed and is serving, payments and
communications made by the Partnership to Series A Holders shall be made by making
payments to, and communicating with, the Depository.
Section 16.3    Distributions.
(a)    Distributions on each Series A Preferred Unit shall be cumulative and shall accrue at the
Series A Distribution Rate from the Series A Original Issue Date (or, for any Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units issued after the Series A Original Issue Date, from the Series A Distribution
Payment Date immediately preceding the issuance date of such Series A Preferred Units or if the
issue date of any such additional Series A Preferred Units precedes the first Series A Distribution
Payment Date for Series A Preferred Units issued on the Series A Original Issue Date, then from
the Series A Original Issue Date) until such time as the Partnership pays the Series A
Distribution, converts the Series A Preferred Units in full in accordance with Section 16.4 or
redeems the Series A Preferred Units in full in accordance with Section 16.6, whether or not such
Series A Distributions shall have been declared. Series A Holders shall be entitled to receive
Series A Distributions from time to time out of any assets of the Partnership legally available for
the
104
payment of distributions at the Series A Distribution Rate per Series A Preferred Unit, when, as,
and if declared by the General Partner. Series A Distributions, to the extent declared by the
General Partner to be paid by the Partnership in accordance with this Section 16.3 shall be paid
monthly on each Series A Distribution Payment Date and, unless otherwise determined by the
General Partner, shall be deemed to have been paid out of Available Cash with respect to the
Quarter then ended immediately preceding the Series A Distribution Payment Date with respect
to which such distribution was made. Distributions shall accumulate in each Series A Distribution
Period from and including the preceding Series A Distribution Payment Date (other than the
initial Series A Distribution Period, which shall commence on and include the Series A Original
Issue Date), to but excluding the next Series A Distribution Payment Date for such Series A
Distribution Period, and distributions shall accrue on accumulated Series A Distributions at the
Series A Distribution Rate. If any Series A Distribution Payment Date otherwise would occur on a
date that is not a Business Day, declared Series A Distributions shall be paid on the immediately
succeeding Business Day without the accumulation of additional distributions. Series A
Distributions shall be payable based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. All
Series A Distributions payable by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 16.3 or Section 12.4(b)
shall be payable without regard to the income of the Partnership and shall be treated for federal
income tax purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the
Code.
(b)    Not later than 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on each Series A Distribution Payment Date, the
Partnership shall pay those Series A Distributions, if any, that shall have been declared by the
General Partner to Series A Holders on the Record Date for the applicable Series A Preferred
Distribution. The Record Date for any Series A Distribution payment (the “Series A Distribution
Record Date”) shall be the first Business Day of the month in which the applicable Series A
Distribution Payment Date occurs, except that in the case of payments of Series A Distributions
in Arrears, the Series A Distribution Record Date with respect to a Series A Distribution Payment
Date shall be such date as may be designated by the General Partner in accordance with this
Article XVI. No distribution shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any Junior
Securities (other than a distribution payable solely in Junior Securities or cash in lieu of fractional
Junior Securities) unless full cumulative Series A Distributions have been or contemporaneously
are being paid or provided for on all Outstanding Series A Preferred Units and any Parity
Securities through the most recent respective Series A Distribution Payment Dates. Accumulated
Series A Distributions in Arrears for any past Series A Distribution Period may be declared by the
General Partner and paid on any date fixed by the General Partner, whether or not such date is a
Series A Distribution Payment Date, to Series A Holders on the record date for such payment,
which may not be more than 60 days, nor less than 15 days, before such payment date. Subject
to the next succeeding sentence, if all accumulated Series A Distributions in Arrears on all
Outstanding Series A Preferred Units and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid, or if
sufficient funds for the payment thereof shall not have been set apart, then payment of
accumulated distributions in Arrears on the Series A Preferred Units and any such Parity
Securities shall be made in order of their respective distribution payment dates, commencing with
the earliest. If less than all distributions payable with respect to all Series A Preferred Units and
any Parity Securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made Pro Rata with respect to the
Series A Preferred Units and any Parity Securities entitled to a distribution payment at such time
in proportion to the aggregate distribution amounts remaining due in respect of such Series A
Preferred Units and Parity Securities at such time. Subject to Section 12.4 and 16.6, Series A
Holders shall not be entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or Partnership
105
Securities, in excess of full cumulative Series A Distributions. Except insofar as distributions
accrue on the amount of any accumulated and unpaid Series A Distributions as described in
Section 16.3(a), no interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any
distribution payment which may be in Arrears on the Series A Preferred Units. So long as the
Series A Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the Depository, declared Series A
Distributions shall be paid to the Depository in same-day funds on each Series A Distribution
Payment Date.
Section 16.4    Change of Control.
(a)    In connection with any Change of Control that occurs after the Series A Original Issue Date
and while Series A Preferred Units are Outstanding, if the Partnership does not elect to redeem
the Series A Preferred Units as provided for in Section 16.6, the Partnership will deliver notice to
the Series A Holders and make an irrevocable written offer (a “Series A Change of Control Offer”)
to each Series A Holder to convert such number of Series A Preferred Units held by such Series
A Holder on the Series A Change of Control Conversion Date as such Series A Holder may elect
in accordance with Section 16.4(c) into a number of Units per Series A Preferred Units that is an
amount equal to the Series A Conversion Ratio (the “Series A Unit Conversion Consideration”).
The “Series A Change of Control Conversion Date” shall be the date fixed by the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, as the date the Series A Preferred Units are to be converted to
Series A Conversion Units. Such Series A Change of Control Conversion Date shall be a
Business Day that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days from the date on which the
Partnership provides to the Series A Holders notice of the Series A Change of Control Offer.
(b)    Subject to Section 5.9, the “Series A Conversion Ratio” shall be calculated as the lesser of
either: (i) the quotient, rounded to the nearest 10,000th of a Unit, obtained by dividing (A) the sum
of the Series A Liquidation Preference as of 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Series A Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Series A
Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Series A Distribution Record Date and prior to the
corresponding Series A Distribution Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such
accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in this sum) by (B) the average of the closing
prices for the Partnership’s Units on the National Securities Exchange on which the Units are
then listed or admitted to trading for the ten consecutive Trading Days ending with the Trading
Day immediately preceding the Series A Change of Control Conversion Date, or (ii) 1.962. No
fractional Units will be issued upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Units. Instead, the
Partnership shall pay the cash value of such fractional Units.
(c)    In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Series A Preferred Units will be
converted into Alternative Form Consideration, a holder of Series A Preferred Units will receive
upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Units the kind and amount of Alternative Form
Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the
Change of Control had such holder held a number of Units equal to the Series A Unit Conversion
Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control.
(d)    If the holders of Units have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received
in the Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of Series A Preferred Units will
receive will be the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders
106
of Units who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and
will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Units are subject, including pro rata
reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control.
(e)    Each Series A Holder electing to participate in the Series A Change of Control Offer will be
required, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Series A Change
of Control Conversion Date, to notify the Partnership in writing of the number of Series A
Preferred Units to be converted in the Series A Change of Control Offer, which written notice
shall be irrevocable. The failure of any Series A Holder to timely deliver a written notice in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence (or the delivery by a Series A Holder of a
timely notice of exercise for only a portion, but not all, of the Series A Preferred Units held by
such Series A Holder) shall constitute an election by such Series A Holder to reject the Series A
Change of Control Offer (or to reject the Series A Change of Control Offer as to the portion of the
Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Holder as to which a timely notice of exercise
was not submitted).
(f)    Upon conversion, the rights of such participating Series A Holder shall cease with respect to
such converted Series A Preferred Units, and such Person shall, if it was a Limited Partner
immediately prior to such conversion, continue to be a Limited Partner and have the rights of a
holder of Series A Conversion Units under this Agreement. Each Series A Preferred Unit that is
converted into Series A Conversion Units in accordance with this Section 16.4 shall, upon the
Series A Change of Control Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled by,
the Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Series A Conversion Unit(s).
(g)    The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes or
duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Series A Conversion Units. However, each
participating Series A Holder shall pay any tax or duty which may be payable relating to any
transfer by such Series A Holder involving the issuance or delivery of Series A Conversion Units
in a name other than such Series A Holder’s name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the
notation of book entry (or the issuance of a Certificate) for Series A Conversion Units being
issued in a name other than the Series A Holder’s name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum
sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due because the Series A Conversion Units are to
be issued in a name other than such holder’s name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax
withholding required by law or regulation.
(h)    The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws regulating the offer and
delivery of any Series A Conversion Units and, if the Units are then listed or admitted to trading
on a National Securities Exchange, shall list or cause to have admitted to trading and keep listed
and admitted to trading the Series A Conversion Units to the extent permitted or required by the
rules of such National Securities Exchange.
(i)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give to any Series A
Holder any rights as a creditor in respect of its right to conversion.
107
Section 16.5    Voting Rights.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Series A Holders shall have
no voting rights whatsoever in respect of Series A Preferred Units, except as set forth in Section
13.3(c), this Section 16.5 or as otherwise provided by the Delaware Act.
(b)
(i)    Unless the General Partner shall have received the affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting as a separate class, the
General Partner shall not adopt any amendment to this Agreement that would have a material
adverse effect on the existing terms of the Series A Preferred Units.
(ii)    Unless the General Partner shall have received the affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting together with holders of
any other Parity Securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable, as a separate class, the Partnership shall not (x) issue any additional Series A
Preferred Units, Parity Securities or Senior Securities if the cumulative distributions payable on
Outstanding Series A Preferred Units are in Arrears or (y) create or issue any Senior Securities.
(c)    For any matter described in this Section 16.5 for which the Series A Holders are entitled to
vote as a class (whether separately or together with the holders of any Parity Securities), such
Series A Holders shall be entitled to one vote per Series A Preferred Unit. Any Series A
Preferred Units held by any Group Member shall not be entitled to vote.
Section 16.6    Optional Redemption.
In addition to the rights of the Partnership provided for in Section 4.10, the Partnership shall have
the right at any time, and from time to time, on or after April 15, 2019 or within 180 days following
the occurrence of a Change in Control, to redeem the Series A Preferred Units, in whole or in
part, from any source of funds legally available for such purpose. Any such redemption shall
occur on a date set by the General Partner (the “Series A Redemption Date”).
(a)    The Partnership shall effect any such redemption by paying cash for each Series A
Preferred Unit to be redeemed equal to the Series A Liquidation Preference for such Series A
Preferred Unit on such Series A Redemption Date (the “Series A Redemption Price”). So long as
the Series A Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the Depository, the Series A
Redemption Price shall be paid by the Transfer Agent to the Depository on the Series A
Redemption Date.
(b)    The Partnership shall give notice of its election to redeem Series A Preferred Units pursuant
to this Section 16.6 by mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days
before the scheduled Series A Redemption Date, to each Series A Holder (as of 5:00 p.m.
Central Time on the Business Day next preceding the day on which notice is given) whose
Series A Preferred Units are to be redeemed as such Series A Holders’ names appear on the
books of the Transfer Agent and at the address of such Series A Holders shown therein. Such
notice (the “Series
108
A Redemption Notice”) shall state: (1) the Series A Redemption Date, (2) the number of Series A
Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all Outstanding Series A Preferred Units are to
be redeemed, the number (and the identification) of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed
from such Series A Holder, (3) the Series A Redemption Price, (4) the place where the Series A
Preferred Units are to be redeemed and are to be presented and surrendered for payment of the
Series A Redemption Price therefor and (5) that distributions on the Series A Preferred Units to
be redeemed shall cease to accumulate from and after such Series A Redemption Date.
(c)    If the Partnership elects to redeem less than all of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units
pursuant to this Section 16.6, the number of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed shall be
determined by the General Partner, and such Series A Preferred Units shall be redeemed by
such method of selection as the Depository shall determine either Pro Rata or by lot, with
adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional Series A Preferred Units. The aggregate Series A
Redemption Price for any such partial redemption of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units
shall be allocated correspondingly among the redeemed Series A Preferred Units. The Series A
Preferred Units not redeemed shall remain Outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided in this Article XVI.
(d)    If the Partnership gives or causes to be given a Series A Redemption Notice, the
Partnership shall deposit with the Transfer Agent funds in an amount sufficient to redeem the
Series A Preferred Units as to which such Series A Redemption Notice shall have been given no
later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Business Day immediately preceding the Series A
Redemption Date, and shall give the Transfer Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay
the Series A Redemption Price to the Series A Holders to be redeemed upon surrender or
deemed surrender (which shall occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series A
Preferred Units is issued in the name of the Depository or its nominee) of the certificates therefor
as set forth in the Series A Redemption Notice. If the Series A Redemption Notice shall have
been given, from and after the Series A Redemption Date, unless the Partnership defaults in
providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the time and place specified for payment
pursuant to the Series A Redemption Notice, all Series A Distributions on such Series A
Preferred Units to be redeemed shall cease to accumulate and all rights of holders of such Series
A Preferred Units as Limited Partners with respect to such Series A Preferred Units shall cease,
except the right to receive the Series A Redemption Price, and such Series A Preferred Units
shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Transfer Agent or be deemed to be
Outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The Partnership shall be entitled to receive from the
Transfer Agent the interest income, if any, earned on such funds deposited with the Transfer
Agent (to the extent that such interest income is not required to pay the Series A Redemption
Price of the Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed), and the holders of any Series A Preferred
Units so redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest income. Any funds deposited with the
Transfer Agent hereunder by the Partnership for any reason, including redemption of Series A
Preferred Units, that remain unclaimed or unpaid after two years after the applicable Series A
Redemption Date or other payment date, shall be, to the extent permitted by law, repaid to the
Partnership upon its written request, after which repayment the Series A Holders entitled to such
redemption or other payment shall have recourse only to the Partnership. Notwithstanding any
Series A Redemption Notice, there shall be no redemption of any Series A Preferred Units called
for redemption until funds sufficient to pay the full Series A Redemption Price of such Series A
Preferred Units shall have been deposited by the Partnership with the Transfer Agent.
109
(e)    Any Series A Preferred Units that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Partnership
shall be canceled. If only a portion of the Series A Preferred Units represented by a certificate
shall have been called for redemption, upon surrender of such certificate to the Transfer Agent
(which shall occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series A Preferred Units is
registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee), the Transfer Agent shall issue to such
Series A Holder(s) a new certificate (or adjust the applicable book-entry account) representing
the number of Series A Preferred Units represented by the surrendered certificate that have not
been called for redemption.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XVI, in the event that full cumulative
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid
or declared and set apart for payment, none of the Partnership, the General Partner or any
Affiliate of the General Partner shall be permitted to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, in
whole or in part, any Series A Preferred Units or Parity Securities except pursuant to a purchase
or exchange offer made on the same terms to all Series A Holders and any Parity Securities.
None of the Partnership, the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner shall be
permitted to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Units or any other Junior Securities
(other than net exercises or withholding for tax under employee benefit plans, employee
programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants or appreciation
rights relating to Partnership Securities)) unless full cumulative distributions on the Series A
Preferred Units and any Parity Securities for all prior and the then-ending Series A Distribution
Periods shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment.
Section 16.7    Rank.
The Series A Preferred Units shall be deemed to rank:
(a)    Senior to any Junior Securities;
(b)    On a parity with any Parity Securities; and
(c)    Junior to any Senior Securities.
The Partnership may issue Junior Securities and, subject to any approvals required by Series A
Holders pursuant to Section 16.5(b)(ii), additional Series A Preferred Units and Parity Securities
from time to time in one or more classes or series without the consent of the Series A Holders.
The General Partner has the authority to determine the preferences, powers, qualifications,
limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights or privileges, if any, of any such class or
series before the issuance of any Partnership Securities of such class or series.
Section 16.8    No Sinking Fund.
The Series A Preferred Units shall not have the benefit of any sinking fund.
Section 16.9    Record Holders.
110
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, Partnership, the Registrar
and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat any Series A Holder as the true, lawful and absolute
owner of the applicable Series A Preferred Units for all purposes, and neither the General
Partner, the Partnership nor the Registrar or the Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.
Section 16.10    Other Rights; Fiduciary Duties.
The Series A Preferred Units shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
other than as set forth in this Article XVI or as provided by applicable law. To the fullest extent
permitted by law and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Article VII) or any duty otherwise existing at law or in equity, neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any fiduciary or other duties to Series A Holders;
provided, however, that the foregoing does not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, without reference to the definition of “good faith” in Section 7.9(b).
ARTICLE XVII
SERIES B FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PERPETUAL
PREFERRED UNITS
Section 17.1    Designation.
The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of Preferred Units to be designated
as “8.00% Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units,”
and fixes the preferences, rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Series B Preferred Units
as set forth in this Article XVII. Each Series B Preferred Unit shall be identical in all respects to
every other Series B Preferred Unit, except as to the respective dates from which the Series B
Liquidation Preference shall increase or from which Series B Distributions may begin accruing,
to the extent such dates may differ. The Series B Preferred Units represent perpetual equity
interests in the Partnership and shall not give rise to a claim by the holder for redemption thereof
at a particular date.
Section 17.2    Series B Preferred Units.
(a)    The authorized number of Series B Preferred Units shall be unlimited. Series B Preferred
Units that are redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Partnership shall be cancelled.
(b)    The Series B Preferred Units shall be represented by a single certificate registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, and no Series B Holder shall be entitled to receive a
certificate evidencing such Series B Preferred Units, unless otherwise required by law or the
Depository gives notice of its intention to resign or is no longer eligible to act as such and the
Partnership shall have not selected a substitute Depository within 60 calendar days thereafter.
So long as the Depository shall have been appointed and is serving, payments and
communications made by the Partnership to Series B Holders shall be made by making
payments to, and communicating with, the Depository.
111
Section 17.3    Distributions.
(a)    Distributions on each Series B Preferred Unit shall be cumulative and shall accrue at the
Series B Distribution Rate from the Series B Original Issue Date (or, for any Outstanding Series B
Preferred Units issued after the Series B Original Issue Date, from the Series B Distribution
Payment Date immediately preceding the issuance date of such Series B Preferred Units or if the
issue date of any such additional Series B Preferred Units precedes the first Series B Distribution
Payment Date for Series B Preferred Units issued on the Series B Original Issue Date, then from
the Series B Original Issue Date) until such time as the Partnership pays the Series B
Distribution, converts the Series B Preferred Units in full in accordance with Section 17.4 or
redeems the Series B Preferred Units in full in accordance with Section 17.6, whether or not such
Series B Distributions shall have been declared. Series B Holders shall be entitled to receive
Series B Distributions from time to time out of any assets of the Partnership legally available for
the payment of distributions at the Series B Distribution Rate per Series B Preferred Unit, when,
as, and if declared by the General Partner. Series B Distributions, to the extent declared by the
General Partner to be paid by the Partnership in accordance with this Section 17.3 shall be paid
monthly on each Series B Distribution Payment Date and, unless otherwise determined by the
General Partner, shall be deemed to have been paid out of Available Cash with respect to the
Quarter then ended immediately preceding the Series B Distribution Payment Date with respect
to which such distribution was made. Distributions shall accumulate in each Series B Distribution
Period from and including the preceding Series B Distribution Payment Date (other than the
initial Series B Distribution Period, which shall commence on and include the Series B Original
Issue Date), to but excluding the next Series B Distribution Payment Date for such Series B
Distribution Period, and distributions shall accrue on accumulated Series B Distributions at the
Series B Distribution Rate. If any Series B Distribution Payment Date otherwise would occur on a
date that is not a Business Day, declared Series B Distributions shall be paid on the immediately
succeeding Business Day without the accumulation of additional distributions. Series B
Distributions shall be payable based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. All
Series B Distributions payable by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 17.3 or Section 12.4(b)
shall be payable without regard to the income of the Partnership and shall be treated for federal
income tax purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the
Code.
(b)    Not later than 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on each Series B Distribution Payment Date, the
Partnership shall pay those Series B Distributions, if any, that shall have been declared by the
General Partner to Series B Holders on the Record Date for the applicable Series B Preferred
Distribution. The Record Date for any Series B Distribution payment (the “Series B Distribution
Record Date”) shall be the first Business Day of the month in which the applicable Series B
Distribution Payment Date occurs, except that in the case of payments of Series B Distributions
in Arrears, the Series B Distribution Record Date with respect to a Series B Distribution Payment
Date shall be such date as may be designated by the General Partner in accordance with this
Article XVII. No distribution shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any Junior
Securities (other than a distribution payable solely in Junior Securities or cash in lieu of fractional
Junior Securities) unless full cumulative Series B Distributions have been or contemporaneously
are being paid or provided for on all Outstanding Series B Preferred Units and any Parity
Securities through the most recent respective Series B Distribution Payment Dates. Accumulated
Series B Distributions in Arrears for any past Series B Distribution Period may be declared by the
General Partner and paid on any date fixed by the General Partner, whether or not
112
such date is a Series B Distribution Payment Date, to Series B Holders on the record date for
such payment, which may not be more than 60 days, nor less than 15 days, before such payment
date. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, if all accumulated Series B Distributions in
Arrears on all Outstanding Series B Preferred Units and any Parity Securities shall not have
been paid, or if sufficient funds for the payment thereof shall not have been set apart, then
payment of accumulated distributions in Arrears on the Series B Preferred Units and any such
Parity Securities shall be made in order of their respective distribution payment dates,
commencing with the earliest. If less than all distributions payable with respect to all Series B
Preferred Units and any Parity Securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made Pro Rata
with respect to the Series B Preferred Units and any Parity Securities entitled to a distribution
payment at such time in proportion to the aggregate distribution amounts remaining due in
respect of such Series B Preferred Units and Parity Securities at such time. Subject to Sections
12.4 and 17.6, Series B Holders shall not be entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash,
property or Partnership Securities, in excess of full cumulative Series B Distributions. Except
insofar as distributions accrue on the amount of any accumulated and unpaid Series B
Distributions as described in Section 17.3(a), no interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall
be payable in respect of any distribution payment which may be in Arrears on the Series B
Preferred Units. So long as the Series B Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the
Depository, declared Series B Distributions shall be paid to the Depository in same-day funds on
each Series B Distribution Payment Date.
Section 17.4    Change of Control.
(a)    In connection with any Change of Control that occurs after the Series B Original Issue Date
and while Series B Preferred Units are Outstanding, if the Partnership does not elect to redeem
the Series B Preferred Units as provided for in Section 17.6, the Partnership will deliver notice to
the Series B Holders and make an irrevocable written offer (a “Series B Change of Control Offer”)
to each Series B Holder to convert such number of Series B Preferred Units held by such Series
B Holder on the Series B Change of Control Conversion Date as such Series B Holder may elect
in accordance with Section 17.4(c) into a number of Units per Series B Preferred Units that is an
amount equal to the Series B Conversion Ratio (the “Series B Unit Conversion Consideration”).
The “Series B Change of Control Conversion Date” shall be the date fixed by the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, as the date the Series B Preferred Units are to be converted to
Series B Conversion Units. Such Series B Change of Control Conversion Date shall be a
Business Day that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days from the date on which the
Partnership provides to the Series B Holders notice of the Series B Change of Control Offer.
(b)    Subject to Section 5.9, the “Series B Conversion Ratio” shall be calculated as the lesser of
either: (i) the quotient, rounded to the nearest 10,000th of a Unit, obtained by dividing (A) the sum
of the Series B Liquidation Preference as of 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Series B Change of Control Conversion Date (unless the Series B
Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Series B Distribution Record Date and prior to the
corresponding Series B Distribution Payment Date, in which case no additional amount for such
accrued and unpaid distribution will be included in this sum) by (B) the average of the closing
prices for the Partnership’s Units on the National Securities Exchange on which the Units are
then listed or admitted to trading for the ten consecutive Trading Days ending with the Trading
Day immediately preceding the Series B Change of Control Conversion Date, or (ii) 1.962. No
113
fractional Units will be issued upon the conversion of the Series B Preferred Units. Instead, the
Partnership shall pay the cash value of such fractional Units.
(c)    In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Series B Preferred Units will be
converted into Alternative Form Consideration, a holder of Series B Preferred Units will receive
upon conversion of such Series B Preferred Units the kind and amount of Alternative Form
Consideration which such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the
Change of Control had such holder held a number of Units equal to the Series B Unit Conversion
Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control.
(d)    If the holders of Units have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received
in the Change of Control, the consideration that the holders of Series B Preferred Units will
receive will be the form and proportion of the aggregate consideration elected by the holders of
Units who participate in the determination (based on the weighted average of elections) and will
be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Units are subject, including pro rata
reductions applicable to any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control.
(e)    Each Series B Holder electing to participate in the Series B Change of Control Offer will be
required, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Series B Change
of Control Conversion Date, to notify the Partnership in writing of the number of Series B
Preferred Units to be converted in the Series B Change of Control Offer, which written notice
shall be irrevocable. The failure of any Series B Holder to timely deliver a written notice in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence (or the delivery by a Series B Holder of a
timely notice of exercise for only a portion, but not all, of the Series B Preferred Units held by
such Series B Holder) shall constitute an election by such Series B Holder to reject the Series B
Change of Control Offer (or to reject the Series B Change of Control Offer as to the portion of the
Series B Preferred Units held by such Series B Holder as to which a timely notice of exercise
was not submitted).
(f)    Upon conversion, the rights of such participating Series B Holder shall cease with respect to
such converted Series B Preferred Units, and such Person shall, if it was a Limited Partner
immediately prior to such conversion, continue to be a Limited Partner and have the rights of a
holder of Series B Conversion Units under this Agreement. Each Series B Preferred Unit that is
converted into Series B Conversion Units in accordance with this Section 17.4 shall, upon the
Series B Change of Control Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled by,
the Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Series B Conversion Unit(s).
(g)    The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes or
duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Series B Conversion Units. However, each
participating Series B Holder shall pay any tax or duty which may be payable relating to any
transfer by such Series B Holder involving the issuance or delivery of Series B Conversion Units
in a name other than such Series B Holder’s name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to reflect the
notation of book entry (or the issuance of a Certificate) for Series B Conversion Units being
issued in a name other than the Series B Holder’s name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum
sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due because the Series B Conversion Units are to
be issued in a name other than such holder’s name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax
withholding required by law or regulation.
114
(h)    The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws regulating the offer and
delivery of any Series B Conversion Units and, if the Units are then listed or admitted to trading
on a National Securities Exchange, shall list or cause to have admitted to trading and keep listed
and admitted to trading the Series B Conversion Units to the extent permitted or required by the
rules of such National Securities Exchange.
(i)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give to any Series B
Holder any rights as a creditor in respect of its right to conversion.
Section 17.5    Voting Rights.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Series B Holders shall have
no voting rights whatsoever in respect of Series B Preferred Units, except as set forth in Section
13.3(c), this Section 17.5 or as otherwise provided by the Delaware Act.
(b)    (i) Unless the General Partner shall have received the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units, voting as a separate
class, the General Partner shall not adopt any amendment to this Agreement that would have a
material adverse effect on the existing terms of the Series B Preferred Units.
(ii)    Unless the General Partner shall have received the affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units, voting together with holders of
any other Parity Securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable, as a separate class, the Partnership shall not (x) issue any additional Series B
Preferred Units, Parity Securities or Senior Securities if the cumulative distributions payable on
Outstanding Series B Preferred Units are in Arrears or (y) create or issue any Senior Securities.
(c)    For any matter described in this Section 17.5 for which the Series B Holders are entitled to
vote as a class (whether separately or together with the holders of any Parity Securities), such
Series B Holders shall be entitled to one vote per Series B Preferred Unit. Any Series B
Preferred Units held by any Group Member shall not be entitled to vote.
Section 17.6    Optional Redemption.
In addition to the rights of the Partnership provided for in Section 4.10, the Partnership shall have
the right at any time, and from time to time, on or after June 15, 2019 or within 180 days following
the occurrence of a Change in Control, to redeem the Series B Preferred Units, in whole or in
part, from any source of funds legally available for such purpose. Any such redemption shall
occur on a date set by the General Partner (the “Series B Redemption Date”).
(a)    The Partnership shall effect any such redemption by paying cash for each Series B
Preferred Unit to be redeemed equal to the Series B Liquidation Preference for such Series B
Preferred Unit on such Series B Redemption Date (the “Series B Redemption Price”). So long as
the Series B Preferred Units are held of record by the nominee of the Depository, the Series B
Redemption Price shall be paid by the Transfer Agent to the Depository on the Series B
Redemption Date.
115
(b)    The Partnership shall give notice of its election to redeem Series B Preferred Units pursuant
to this Section 17.6 by mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days
before the scheduled Series B Redemption Date, to each Series B Holder (as of 5:00 p.m.
Central Time on the Business Day next preceding the day on which notice is given) whose
Series B Preferred Units are to be redeemed as such Series B Holders’ names appear on the
books of the Transfer Agent and at the address of such Series B Holders shown therein. Such
notice (the “Series B Redemption Notice”) shall state: (1) the Series B Redemption Date, (2) the
number of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all Outstanding Series B
Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number (and the identification) of Series B Preferred
Units to be redeemed from such Series B Holder, (3) the Series B Redemption Price, (4) the
place where the Series B Preferred Units are to be redeemed and are to be presented and
surrendered for payment of the Series B Redemption Price therefor and (5) that distributions on
the Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed shall cease to accumulate from and after such
Series B Redemption Date.
(c)    If the Partnership elects to redeem less than all of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units
pursuant to this Section 17.6, the number of Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed shall be
determined by the General Partner, and such Series B Preferred Units shall be redeemed by
such method of selection as the Depository shall determine either Pro Rata or by lot, with
adjustments to avoid redemption of fractional Series B Preferred Units. The aggregate Series B
Redemption Price for any such partial redemption of the Outstanding Series B Preferred Units
shall be allocated correspondingly among the redeemed Series B Preferred Units. The Series B
Preferred Units not redeemed shall remain Outstanding and entitled to all the rights and
preferences provided in this Article XVII.
(d)    If the Partnership gives or causes to be given a Series B Redemption Notice, the
Partnership shall deposit with the Transfer Agent funds in an amount sufficient to redeem the
Series B Preferred Units as to which such Series B Redemption Notice shall have been given no
later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the Business Day immediately preceding the Series B
Redemption Date, and shall give the Transfer Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay
the Series B Redemption Price to the Series B Holders to be redeemed upon surrender or
deemed surrender (which shall occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series B
Preferred Units is issued in the name of the Depository or its nominee) of the certificates therefor
as set forth in the Series B Redemption Notice. If the Series B Redemption Notice shall have
been given, from and after the Series B Redemption Date, unless the Partnership defaults in
providing funds sufficient for such redemption at the time and place specified for payment
pursuant to the Series B Redemption Notice, all Series B Distributions on such Series B
Preferred Units to be redeemed shall cease to accumulate and all rights of holders of such Series
B Preferred Units as Limited Partners with respect to such Series B Preferred Units shall cease,
except the right to receive the Series B Redemption Price, and such Series B Preferred Units
shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Transfer Agent or be deemed to be
Outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. The Partnership shall be entitled to receive from the
Transfer Agent the interest income, if any, earned on such funds deposited with the Transfer
Agent (to the extent that such interest income is not required to pay the Series B Redemption
Price of the Series B Preferred Units to be redeemed), and the holders of any Series B Preferred
Units so redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest income. Any funds deposited with the
Transfer Agent hereunder by the Partnership for any reason, including redemption of Series B
Preferred Units, that remain unclaimed or unpaid after two years after the applicable Series B
Redemption Date or other payment date, shall be, to the
116
extent permitted by law, repaid to the Partnership upon its written request, after which repayment
the Series B Holders entitled to such redemption or other payment shall have recourse only to
the Partnership. Notwithstanding any Series B Redemption Notice, there shall be no redemption
of any Series B Preferred Units called for redemption until funds sufficient to pay the full Series B
Redemption Price of such Series B Preferred Units shall have been deposited by the Partnership
with the Transfer Agent.
(e)    Any Series B Preferred Units that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Partnership
shall be canceled. If only a portion of the Series B Preferred Units represented by a certificate
shall have been called for redemption, upon surrender of such certificate to the Transfer Agent
(which shall occur automatically if the certificate representing such Series B Preferred Units is
registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee), the Transfer Agent shall issue to such
Series B Holder(s) a new certificate (or adjust the applicable book-entry account) representing
the number of Series B Preferred Units represented by the surrendered certificate that have not
been called for redemption.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XVII, in the event that full cumulative
distributions on the Series B Preferred Units and any Parity Securities shall not have been paid
or declared and set apart for payment, none of the Partnership, the General Partner or any
Affiliate of the General Partner shall be permitted to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, in
whole or in part, any Series B Preferred Units or Parity Securities except pursuant to a purchase
or exchange offer made on the same terms to all Series B Holders and any Parity Securities.
None of the Partnership, the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner shall be
permitted to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any Units or any other Junior Securities
(other than net exercises or withholding for tax under employee benefit plans, employee
programs and employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants or appreciation
rights relating to Partnership Securities)) unless full cumulative distributions on the Series B
Preferred Units and any Parity Securities for all prior and the then-ending Series B Distribution
Periods shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment.
Section 17.7    Rank.
The Series B Preferred Units shall be deemed to rank:
(a)    Senior to any Junior Securities;
(b)    On a parity with (i) the Series A Preferred Units and (ii) any Parity Securities; and
(c)    Junior to any Senior Securities.
The Partnership may issue Junior Securities and, subject to any approvals required by Series B
Holders pursuant to Section 17.5(b)(ii), additional Series B Preferred Units and Parity Securities
from time to time in one or more classes or series without the consent of the Series B Holders.
The General Partner has the authority to determine the preferences, powers, qualifications,
limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights or privileges, if any, of any such class or
series before the issuance of any Partnership Securities of such class or series.
117
Section 17.8    No Sinking Fund.    The Series B Preferred Units shall not have the benefit of any
sinking fund.
Section 17.9    Record Holders.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, Partnership, the Registrar
and the Transfer Agent may deem and treat any Series B Holder as the true, lawful and absolute
owner of the applicable Series B Preferred Units for all purposes, and neither the General
Partner, the Partnership nor the Registrar or the Transfer Agent shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.
Section 17.10    Other Rights; Fiduciary Duties.
The Series B Preferred Units shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
other than as set forth in this Article XVII or as provided by applicable law. To the fullest extent
permitted by law and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Article VII) or any duty otherwise existing at law or in equity, neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall owe any fiduciary or other duties to Series B Holders;
provided, however, that the foregoing does not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, without reference to the definition of “good faith” in Section 7.9(b).
ARTICLE XVIII
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 18.1    Addresses and Notices.
Any notice, demand, request, report or proxy materials required or permitted to be given or made
to a Partner under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made when
delivered in person or when sent by first class United States mail or by other means of written
communication to the Partner at the address described below. Any notice, payment or report to
be given or made to a Partner hereunder shall be deemed conclusively to have been given or
made, and the obligation to give such notice or report or to make such payment shall be deemed
conclusively to have been fully satisfied, upon sending of such notice, payment or report to the
Record Holder of such Partnership Securities at his address as shown on the records of the
Transfer Agent or as otherwise shown on the records of the Partnership, regardless of any claim
of any Person who may have an interest in such Partnership Securities by reason of any
assignment or otherwise. An affidavit or certificate of making of any notice, payment or report in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 18.1 executed by the General Partner, the Transfer
Agent or the mailing organization shall be prima facie evidence of the giving or making of such
notice, payment or report. If any notice, payment or report addressed to a Record Holder at the
address of such Record Holder appearing on the books and records of the Transfer Agent or the
Partnership is returned by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the United
States Postal Service is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or report and any subsequent
notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to have been duly given or made without further
mailing (until such time as such Record Holder or another Person notifies the Transfer Agent or
the
118
Partnership of a change in his address) if they are available for the Partner at the principal office
of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of the giving or making of such notice,
payment or report to the other Partners. Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if
received by the General Partner at the principal office of the Partnership designated pursuant to
Section 2.3. The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in relying on any notice or other
document from a Partner or other Person if believed by it to be genuine.
Section 18.2    Further Action.
The parties shall execute and deliver all documents, provide all information and take or refrain
from taking action as may be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this
Agreement.
Section 18.3    Binding Effect.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Section 18.4    Integration.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings pertaining
thereto.
Section 18.5    Creditors.
None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, or shall be enforceable by,
any creditor of the Partnership.
Section 18.6    Waiver.
No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or
condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof
shall constitute waiver of any such breach of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition.
Section 18.7    Third-Party Beneficiaries.
Each Partner agrees that any Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies
hereunder as a third-party beneficiary hereto with respect to those provisions of this Agreement
affording a right, benefit or privilege to such Indemnitee.
Section 18.8    Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which together shall constitute an
agreement binding on all the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all such parties are not
signatories to the original or the same counterpart. Each party shall become bound by this
Agreement immediately upon affixing its signature hereto or, in the case of a Person acquiring a
Limited Partner Interest pursuant to Section 10.2(a) without execution of this Agreement.
119
Section 18.9    Applicable Law.
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law.
Section 18.10    Invalidity of Provisions.
If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be
affected thereby.
Section 18.11    Consent of Partners.
Each Partner hereby expressly consents and agrees that, whenever in this Agreement it is
specified that an action may be taken upon the affirmative vote or consent of less than all of the
Partners, such action may be so taken upon the concurrence of less than all of the Partners and
each Partner shall be bound by the results of such action.
Section 18.12    Facsimile Signatures.
The use of facsimile signatures affixed in the name and on behalf of the transfer agent and
registrar of the Partnership on certificates representing Units is expressly permitted by this
Agreement.
