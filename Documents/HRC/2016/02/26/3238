<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Timor-Leste was held at the 15th 
meeting, on 12 October 2011. The delegation of Timor-Leste was headed by Ms. Lucia

</footnote>/12/TSL/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, was transmitted to Timor-Leste through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Timor-Leste stated that it was proud to be at the Human Rights Council to present 
its report under the universal periodic review. It recalled that in the conclusions of its 
report, it stated that the Timorese people&#8217;s struggle to gain their independence is, in its 
essence and in all its dimensions, a struggle for human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. In order to put the current situation into context, Timor-Leste recalled its history, 
including the fact that in 2012 it will celebrate its tenth anniversary after 24 years of 
resistance. It also recalled that in 1975, after 400 years of Portuguese rule, it had 
unilaterally declared its independence. It was observed that even before its independence 
was recognized it had been invaded and annexed by Indonesia, leading to widespread 
human rights violations, as was noted in the stakeholders&#8217; summary. In 1999, following the 
</p>
<p>combined resistance by various actors, a referendum was carried out under the auspices of 
the United Nations in which 78.<footnote name="5">8. Poland congratulated Timor-Leste for its progress since independence in the areas of 
social development and human rights. It noted with appreciation the establishment of 
several institutions and legislation and policies in this field. It welcomed its cooperation 
with the United Nations system. It noted with concern that Timor-Leste was still not party </footnote> per cent of the population voted for independence. After 
the referendum various confrontations took place, caused by armed groups (pro-Indonesian 
militias) and in this context the international community intervened and installed the United 
National Transitional Administration for Timor-Leste (UNTAET). In May 2002, Timor-
Leste declared its independence and in September 2002 was welcomed as a Member State 
by the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>7. Timor-Leste stated further that it had always been aware that recognition by the 
United Nations was not an objective in itself and that its membership in the organization </p>


<p>entailed rights and obligations, the latter being clearly related to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. It was noted that such rights are interdisciplinary and 
interdependent in nature, and concern all levels of government. Timor-Leste highlighted the 
enormous efforts required to comply with the objectives that in had set itself. 
</p>
<p>8. It was added that Timor-Lest is one of the few examples in the world where the self-
determination of a people was accomplished simultaneously with the building of the State, 
based on the rule of law, democratic principles and respect for human rights. An example 
given was the ratification of numerous international human rights conventions immediately 
after the adoption of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>9. It was recalled that the majority of the country&#8217;s infrastructure, both State and 
private, had been in ruins, and this was less than 10 years ago. Timor-Leste stated that in 
this context it was with great satisfaction that the national report was being presented, as it 
was aware both of what had already been accomplished and of what remained to be done. 
</p>
<p>10. Timor-Leste then noted that, in the context of its regular diplomatic exchanges with 
other countries, international organizations and more concretely through the UPR process, 
it has been questioned regarding what measures it would adopt concerning the human rights 
violations that occurred during the period of the Indonesian occupation and that following 
the referendum. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding this issue, Timor-Leste thanked all for their contributions and their 
concern, noting that those persons who have come before the Council were also victims in 
the past and have themselves lost leaders, family members, friends and companions. It 
asked whether everyone, Timor-Leste as well as the international community, was prepared 
to raise the issue of an invasion which all know was carried out with the collusion of third 
countries. It asked further if we were prepared to investigate the external financing of the 
invasion and the arms sales to the oppressing country. 
</p>
<p>12. Timor-Leste stated that it was now enjoying the longest period of peace and stability 
since its independence. It added that a situation of social peace, although still fragile, would 
be put at risk if the country went forward, at this moment with these accusations. Timor-
Leste and its society needed to grow in many different arenas, before being in a position to 
confront its historical past in a dignified and courageous manner. It added that, 
unfortunately, this moment had not yet arrived. Timor-Leste clarified that with regards to 
the dichotomy of oppressor/victims, it had been developing and implementing several 
programmes in support of victims through its Law on Combatants, which grants pensions to 
former combatants, their widows and family members. 
</p>
<p>13. It was also noted that Timor-Leste and Indonesia had made efforts to normalize their 
bilateral relations, which should be based on mutual respect and friendship. Timor-Leste 
stressed that it cannot and should not antagonize its closest neighbour, and that it had 
created mechanisms for diplomatic dialogue which would permit past wounds to heal, 
leading to a more promising future. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding appeals to Timor-Leste to ratify additional international human rights 
conventions and instruments, it was indicated that these have largely been accepted with the 
ratification of seven human rights conventions and their incorporation into national law. 
Timor-Leste stated that it considered implementation, in a manner consistent with already 
ratified instruments, to be more important than acceding to new conventions. 
</p>

<p>a collective analysis was carried out, involving the civil society. This allowed  the country 
to understand that it was now better prepared to confront remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>16. Timor-Leste expressed appreciation to countries that had submitted advance  
questions. It hoped that the UPR review session would contribute to clarifications about the 
human rights situation in the county. 
</p>
<p>17. It was reiterated that at its present development stage, the country did not have the 
financial or technical capacity to immediately take on all the problems raised. Citing the 
issues of the country&#8217;s legal framework as an example, it argued that those issues do not 
</p>
<p>always translate into violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Timor-Leste added that it was very difficult in a short period of time to solve all 
problems inherent to the creation of a State thathad, as a social basis, a population with 
such socio-economic characteristics as those in the country. In this regard, Timor-Leste 
prioritized capacity development and, simultaneously,  elaborated plans in the area of basic 
infrastructure as well as socio-economic  development. 
</p>
<p>19. Timor-Leste indicated that it is only now that actions by successive Governments 
had begun to yield results. It added that the international community should be aware that it 
takes time to train doctors, judges and teachers. 
</p>
<p>20. Timor-Leste underscored that it had received support over the years from numerous 
donor countries and international agencies with a special role for the United Nations. It 
added that this fruitful collaboration had permitted the development of human rights 
awareness by different political actors, public official and security actors. 
</p>
<p>21. It was further highlighted that the country has worked together with the United 
Nations Integrated Mission for Timor-Leste (UNMIT), and in particular its Human Rights 
Unit, in the education of the population as to what should not be tolerated in the area of the 
protection of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>22. Timor-Leste noted that, in a context of transition from a dictatorial regime to a 
democratic State based on the rule of law, it was not surprising that some behaviours which 
reflect past realities during the occupation could persist.  Despite remaining gaps, Timor-
Leste shared the view that at times the country was identified as a reference in the 
promotion of human rights in its region. 
</p>
<p>23. It was noted that the country was witnessing rapid changes which benefit the general 
population, especially in the areas of universal access to education, improvement in 
education facilities, better access to health services and improved nutrition and sanitation, 
and wider access to modern means of communications. It was added that advancement in 
economic conditions especially those of women, would soon allow for gradual change in 
attitudes, resulting in the decrease of early marriages, girls&#8217; school dropout and gender 
based violence. 
</p>
<p>24. In conclusion, Timor-Leste explained that it will soon hold presidential and 
legislative elections, and that the remaining eight months of the current Government 
represents a short period of time to implement all proposals made by other delegations. It 
was added that the current Government is committed to giving serious attention to the 
issues raised so as to establish the basis for the new Government to continue developing 
integrated policies with respect to human rights.

</p>

<p>46. Timor-Leste responded to questions raised in advance and during the dialogue. 
Regarding questions on the security sector, in particular accountability and civilian 
oversight, Timor-Leste explained that the Five Year Plan of the Ministry of Defence and 
Security (2007&#8211;2011) focuses on reforming the security sector, especially in the area of 
legislation and structural reform. It was added that the strengthening of the country&#8217;s legal 
</p>
<p>framework was an important factor to create an environment in which the security forces 
act in accordance with the law and were accountable to the public. It was indicated that the 
Government&#8217;s commitment in this regard was confirmed by the adoption of the Law on 
National Security, the Defence Law and the Internal Security Law.  
</p>
<p>47. Regarding concerns raised about the low level of enforcement of the disciplinary 
mechanism of the National Police, it was explained that dramatic improvements have been 
made in recent years. Details were provided regarding the decrease in the percentage of the 
number of cases archived. Timor-Leste then gave detailed information on measures adopted

to monitor the process of promotion and which oversaw the disciplinary conduct of the 
police who are up for promotion. Timor-Leste also provided details on legislation in this 
regard as well as on the functions of mechanisms of civilian oversight including those of 
the Parliament and the Provedoria. 
</p>
<p>48. Concerning corporal punishment, Timor-Leste recalled that it had adopted a zero-
tolerance policy and that strict measures were being taken, including disciplinary action and 
criminal charges. On education, details were provided of the measures adopted in the 
National Strategic Plan for Education 2011-2015. It was indicated that this plan marks an 
important shift by placing the child&#8217;s physical, psychological, social and academic well-
being at the centre of school decision making. It was affirmed that Timor-Leste regards 
corporal punishment as a form of ill-treatment and that the Children&#8217;s Code, when adopted, 
will prohibit such punishment in all settings. Regarding the dropout rates of girls, Timor-
Leste provided statistics and details of efforts made to decrease it. Timor-Leste indicated 
that compulsory basic education was now nine years when previously it had been six. This 
education is now universal, compulsory and free. It was added that, under the current 
education framework, a number of literacy programmes had  been carried out and, with the 
support of the Government of Cuba, it was hoped that two additional programmes to 
combat illiteracy would also be implemented. 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding questions related to the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR), Timor-Leste recalled that 
the Commission&#8217;s report contains more than 200 recommendations and that of these 134 
</p>
<p>were addressed to the State institutions of Timor-Leste. It was indicated that, of these, 112 
had been implemented through various development programmes. These included the 
improvement of conditions of detention, which are now operating with an open policy. 
Additionally the Government, together with development partners and civil society actors, 
was engaged in dialogue and reconciliation at the community level aimed at bringing peace. 
Moreover, youth policies have been approved; and with the assistance of friendly countries 
such as Cuba and Brazil, widespread programmes for the eradication of illiteracy are being 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>50. Timor-Leste then reiterated information given on efforts made to eradicate violence 
against women and to improve gender equality. Timor-Leste referred to the recent 
promulgation of the Law on Domestic Violence and mentioned actions taken, including 
budgetary, to ensure the implementation of the law. Detailed information was also provided 
of awareness-raising efforts currently under way.  Timor-Leste recalled that the Strategic 
Development Plan (2011&#8211;2030) identified as the main challenges to gender equality the 
high level of illiteracy among women, domestic violence and the high rate of maternal 
mortality, and provided detailed information regarding these issues. Timor-Leste then </p>


<p>explained what actions had been taken to face these challenges. It gave details in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>51. Regarding questions raised regarding the Provedoria, Timor-Leste stated that it 
valued the work of that institution and that both the judiciary and the disciplinary organs in 
various Government structures were committed to implementing and following-up on its 
recommendations. Concrete information was provided in this regard. It was added that the 
Government was committed to providing the Provedoria with adequate financial resources 
and that there had been an increase in the resources provided. 
</p>
<p>52. Canada congratulated Timor-Leste&#8217;s efforts to protect human rights through the 
cooperation with the United Nations system, the Commission for Reception, Truth and 
Reconciliation, and the Commission of Truth and Friendship. Canada noted progress in 
terms of security and defence measures, and the adoption of the Law against Domestic 
Violence in 2010. It raised concerns about victims of domestic violence who did not receive 
adequate justice and urged Timor-Leste to strengthen protection of minority religious
