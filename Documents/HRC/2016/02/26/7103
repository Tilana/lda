<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as elaborated in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
applicable instruments,  
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14273  (E)    031006 </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Security 
Council and the General Assembly, most recently General Assembly resolution 60/106 of 
18 January 2006 in which it reaffirmed, inter alia, the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that Israel is a party to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de jure to Palestinian 
and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of High Contracting 
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 2001,  
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
(including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict (S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on 
all settlement activity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its grave concern</i> about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of 
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East Jerusalem, thus preventing the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the 
realization of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing construction, contrary to international 
law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with 
</p>
<p>the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (E/CN.4/2006/29) and calls upon the 
Government of Israel to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur to allow him fully to discharge 
his mandate;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that </p>

 <p></p>
<p>Convention; settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive 
peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli so-called E1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement of 
Maale Adumim and building the wall around it, thereby further disconnecting occupied 
East Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The new Israeli plans to construct more than 900 additional housing units in 
different Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The implications on the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s recent announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, constituting a de facto annexation of 
Palestinian land; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West Jerusalem 
and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev in violation of international law and relevant 
United Nations resolutions, and calls upon Member States, in respect for their obligations under 
international humanitarian law, to refrain from rendering any form of support to the above Israeli 
project; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the 
restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated closure of 
the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have caused an extremely precarious humanitarian 
situation for the civilian population as well as impaired the economic and social rights of the 
Palestinian people;  
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> Israel, the occupying Power:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including 
East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and related 
activities;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Demands</i> that Israel implement the recommendations regarding the settlements 
made by the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report to the 
Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the occupied Palestinian 
territories, Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114);  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to take and implement serious measures, including confiscation 
of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts of violence by 
Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal obligations, 
as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process and to 
implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 1515 (2003) of 
19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive political settlement in 
accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including resolutions 242 (1967) of 
22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, and other relevant United Nations 
resolutions, the principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle East, held in Madrid on 
30 October 1991, the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements, which will allow two States, 
Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of this question at its fourth session.
