<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/25, 
in which the Council, inter alia, renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert on the 
situation of human rights in Somalia for one year, and requested him to report to the 
Council at its twenty-first session. The present report covers the period from September 
2011 to early August 2012. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert undertook his eighth field visit to Somalia and Kenya from 
15 to 25 April 2012. He visited Nairobi, Hargeysa in Somaliland, Garoowe and Boosaaso in 
Puntland, and Mogadishu, the federal capital of Somalia. With the support of a military 
convoy provided by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), the Independent 
Expert was able to spend two days and nights in Mogadishu and to travel twice through the 
city to meet with the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Interior and other senior officials 
</p>
<p>3. In Nairobi, the Independent Expert held meetings with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General for Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, and the Chief of Staff, Hasmik 
Egian, who provided him with useful insights into the challenges faced by the United 
Nations in moving the road map to end the transition in Somalia forward. He received 
extensive briefings from the Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Political Office for 
Somalia (UNPOS), the Joint Constitution Unit, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the Human Rights Working Group of the European 
Union. 
</p>
<p>4. In Mogadishu, the Independent Expert held wide-ranging discussions with the Prime 
Minister of the Transitional Federal Government, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who reiterated 
his commitment to bring the transition to a successful conclusion despite the security 
challenges. The Independent Expert also met the Minister for the Interior and National 
Security, Abdisamad Mohamed Hassan, who briefed him on the overall military and 
security situation in South-Central Somalia and the Government policy on Al-Shabaab 
defectors and prisoners of war. The Mayor of Mogadishu apprised the Independent Expert 
on the difficult security challenges his office faced in providing basic services to people 
living in liberated areas. The meeting with the technical Working Group on Justice and 
Corrections, at which the Attorney-General was also present, helped the Independent 
Expert to understand the grim picture that exists in the country as a result of the collapse of 
the justice and correction system.  
</p>
<p>5. In Mogadishu the Independent Expert received useful briefings from representatives 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Office 
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF, the United Nations Mine Action 
Centre and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), as well as the Deputy 
Humanitarian Coordinator. He was also briefed by the AMISOM Force Commander and 
the Deputy Special Representative of the African Union Chairperson on the military front. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert met with journalists and human rights defenders of 
Mogadishu. He learned how they constantly took risks working in one of the most 
dangerous cities of the world. 
</p>
<p>7. In Somaliland, the Independent Expert met with Ministers and senior officials of the 
Government. In Puntland, he participated in the closing ceremony for the adoption of the 
new Constitution of Puntland, held in Garoowe. He later met with the President, members 
of his Cabinet and others. During his visit to Bossasso in Puntland, he observed first-hand 
the situation of internally displaced persons and the problems they faced. </p>


<p>8. The present report is based on the information obtained by the Independent Expert 
during his talks with the many interlocutors mentioned above. He also consulted recent 
publications and media reports on developments in Somalia, and received written 
communications from individuals drawing his attention to important human rights issues.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>9. According to recent UNHCR information,1 Somalia generated the third-highest 
number of refugees in the world, after Afghanistan and Iraq. The number of Somali 
refugees in the region had exceeded 1 million. They were mainly hosted in Kenya, Yemen, 
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Egypt. Almost 
1.36 million internally displaced Somalis within the country were settled mainly in the 
South-central region. A total of 44,734 Somalis sought refuge in neighbouring countries in 
the first five months of 2012, while another 39,000 were internally displaced, mainly in 
South-central Somalia. 
</p>
<p>10. Somalia was the country in the Horn of Africa most affected by the ongoing 
drought, widely regarded as the worst in 60 years. In a country devastated by two decades 
of civil war, consecutive seasonal rain failures have led to scarcity and extremely high food 
prices. Some 3.7 million Somalis were estimated by UNHCR to be in urgent need of 
humanitarian assistance. Increasingly, Somalis are leaving their homes, walking thousands 
of kilometres in search of food, most of them ending up in settlements for the internally 
displace inside Somalia and in refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, in conditions of 
extreme malnourishment. 
</p>
<p>11. According to the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the humanitarian situation in 
Somalia is critical and needs to remain high on the agenda of the international community. 
Although famine conditions are no longer present, large numbers of people are still in crisis 
and the situation could worsen quickly. The April-June rains began late and were 
distributed unevenly. As a result, the harvest was likely to be smaller and later than usual. 
People in southern Somalia were likely to experience emergency levels of food insecurity 
later in 2012.2 
</p>
<p><b> III. Key developments  
</b></p>
<p>12. Two important developments took place in the country during the reporting period: 
one, relating to the security situation, was the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu 
in early August 2011; the other was the adoption of a road map for Somalia to end the 
transition period on 20 August 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>13. The withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu represented a significant political 
and security development that had a direct bearing on the human rights situation in 
Somalia. The cessation of traditional warfare was almost immediately reflected in a change 
in the type of injuries treated at the main medical facilities in Mogadishu. It also allowed

<p>Mogadishu to be brought under the authority of the Transitional Federal Government, 
which provided it with an opportunity to serve the people better. 
</p>
<p>14. Despite the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu, however, heavy armed 
clashes between AMISOM, the Transitional Federal Government and allied forces against 
Al-Shabaab continued elsewhere through December 2011 and January 2012. The clashes 
were mainly confined to the city&#8217;s outer districts. Thereafter, the frequency and 
effectiveness of insurgent attacks started to decline as pressure mounted from reinforced 
Government and AMISOM forces, culminating in a successful mid-February incursion 
towards the Afgooye corridor. This extended Government and AMISOM influence beyond 
Mogadishu, which continues to be the case. 
</p>
<p>15. An additional element in the conflict was the more visible return of Ethiopian 
troops. By concentrating heavy combat elements in the border towns, they drove Al-
Shabaab out from important strongholds, including from the key city of Baidoa. Al-
Shabaab responded by changing their tactics, with a combination of conventional warfare, 
as well as asymmetrical attacks, causing fatalities and contributing to ongoing instability. 
</p>
<p>16. The arrival of Kenyan forces in October 2011 was another new development. They 
were officially brought under AMISOM control on 6 July 2012. They played an important 
role, including through air strikes, in capturing recovering territories in the south-central 
region from Al-Shabaab, who tried to hinder their in military advances by hit-and-run 
attacks. 
</p>
<p>17. The emergence of multiple fronts, coupled with internal divisions, defections and 
loss of foreign fighters, began to weaken Al-Shabaab forces. During the reporting period, 
AMISOM and Somalia security forces extended their territorial control over most of central 
and southern Somalia, and were poised to capture Kismaayo.  
</p>
<p>18. The troop strength of AMISOM stood at approximately 9,800 troops in sector 1 
(Mogadishu). Approximately 4,660 troops from Kenya were deployed in sector 2 (southern 
Somalia), bringing the total current troops strength to approximately 14,460. With the 
arrival of an additional 2,500 troops from Burundi and Uganda to be deployed in sector 3 
(Baidoa and central Somalia), and another 600 troops from Djibouti deployed in sector 4 
(Beledweyne and eastern Hiraan), AMISOM strength was expected to soon reach its 
mandated ceiling of 17,731. 
</p>
<p>19. As a result of the increased strength of AMISOM forces, the freedom of movement 
of people in Mogadishu improved significantly. This was possible largely through the 
disposal of landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices 
throughout Mogadishu.  
</p>
<p>20. Regular training of AMISOM forces on humanitarian law and human rights law 
yielded positive results, including with regard to the prevention of conflict-related sexual 
violence. Public perception and approval of AMISOM appeared to increase significantly. 
According to observers, military operations of February 2012 in the Afgooye corridor 
showed that measures taken by AMISOM to minimize civilian casualties by choosing 
specific routes of attack and requiring multiple verifications of targets were largely 
successful. 
</p>
<p>21. There were also positive developments in the strengthening of the National Security 
Forces. A coordination committee was formed to review the code of conduct, future logistic 
installations, payroll data, gender mapping and the veterans&#8217; pension scheme, and to 
</p>
<p>organize distribution of military vehicles and equipment. The Independent Expert is, 
however, concerned that capacity-building of the Security Forces remained constrained by 
the limited ability of the Government to pay and equip troops.<b> </b></p>


<p>22. There were also improvements in the police forces. With support from donors, those 
attending refresher courses at the Mogadishu Police Academy were paid stipends. Training 
allowances were paid to others. Efforts to clear arrears in the salaries of police forces also 
progressed well, though more funds were required to make them up to date. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Road map to end the transition 
</b></p>
<p>23. The road map to the end of the transition period was mandated by the Kampala 
Accord of June 2011, under which the leaders of the executive and the legislative branches 
of the Government agreed to extend the transition period by a year, until 20 August 2012. 
Formally adopted at a consultative meeting of Somali stakeholders held in Mogadishu on 6 
September 2011, the Accord is aimed at improving security in Mogadishu and other areas 
in southern Somalia; finalizing and adopting the National Security and Stabilization Plan; 
pursuing national reconciliation and outreach; finalizing and adopting the draft 
Constitution; implementing institutional reforms in transitional federal institutions; and 
organizing the elections of the President, Speaker and Deputy Speakers prior to 20 August 
</p><p>2012.  
</p>
<p>24. The implementation of the key goals of the road map included efforts by the 
Transitional Federal Government to reach out to a number of regional administrations. 
Consultations aimed at finalizing the constitution-making process culminated in two Somali 
national consultative constitutional conferences, held in Garoowe, in Puntland, from 21 to 
23 December 2011 (Garoowe I), and from 15 to 17 February 2012 (Garoowe II). 
</p>
<p>25. Garoowe I resulted in a set of agreed principles on the structure, size, basis of 
representation and selection criteria for a new federal parliament, and the adoption of a new 
federal Constitution by a national constituent assembly, including the mandate, size and 
selection criteria of the members thereof.  
</p>
<p>26. Garoowe II resulted in consensus on the nature of the federal structure of Somalia, 
including the status of the capital city, Mogadishu; the structure of the federal executive, as 
well as the related elements of an electoral system design; and on operationalizing the 
Garoowe I principles relating to the constitutional adoption process and the new federal 
Parliament. Garoowe II further decided that women would occupy at least 30 per cent of 
seats in Parliament and in other bodies set up to end the transition, namely, the national 
constituent assembly and an interim independent electoral commission. 
</p>
<p>27. The Constituent Assembly was duly established and inaugurated in Mogadishu on 
25 July 2012. It met until 2 August, with the participation of 825 elders from 18 regions 
across the country. It was agreed that, in the current security situation and pending the 
organization of a direct referendum and elections, the traditional elders would be the source 
of electoral legitimacy and representatives of the people in approving a provisional 
Constitution and forming a new Parliament in order to end the current transition. The 
proportion of women appointed to the Assembly was however only 24 per cent, well below 
the target of 30 per cent set in Garoowe II. The Assembly adopted the provisional 
Constitution of Somalia on 1 August. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Somaliland 
</b></p>
<p>28. A number of important developments took place in Somaliland during the reporting 
period. The Somaliland National Human Rights Commission became gradually operational. 
Though not fully compliant, it was close to the spirit of the Paris Principles. The UNPOS 
Human Rights Unit assisted the Commission in carrying out an assessment of its strengths 
and weaknesses as a baseline for the development of its future strategy. The proposed </p>


<p>placement of the Commission under the Ministry of Justice, however, raised concern about 
its likely effect on the Commission&#8217;s independence. The Independent Expert conveyed his 
concerns thereon to the Minister for Justice, Hassan Ahmed Aided, whom he met during 
the mission. 
</p>
<p>29. The regional authorities continued to take progressive steps towards strengthening 
the justice and security sectors. In June 2011, the Ministry of Justice launched, with the 
support of UNDP, a national justice strategy, which sought to harmonize traditional law 
(<i>Xeer</i>), religious law (sharia) and formal justice policy, to strengthen the capacity of the 
judiciary and to ensure their independence in conformity with human rights standards. It led 
to the dismantlement of the regional committees, which had caused serious human rights 
violations in the past. There was, however, concern about certain patterns of intimidation, 
arrest and detention of journalists to curb freedom of expression and opinion and the rights 
of media. In July 2011, the Ministry of Justice, with the support of UNODC, conducted a 
study on the situation of detainees in Somaliland. According to the study, 70 per cent of 
prison inmates were sentenced by first instance court without the opportunity to appeal 
against their conviction. 
</p>
<p>30. The study showed that, among prison inmates, the majority were on remand or 
prolonged detention without charges, including one prisoner who was held in remand for 
four years. It concluded that the pretrial rights of inmates had been violated and neglected 
by relevant authorities. The main reasons for these violations included lack of coordination 
between police forces, custodial corps, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, lawyers and courts, 
as well as the fact that existing prison administration legislation was outdated and 
incompatible with the Somaliland Constitution and international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert discussed the above concerns with the Minister for Justice, 
who informed him that, given that the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, press, 
association and assembly were guaranteed by the Somaliland Constitution, no journalist 
could be arrested without a warrant unless they went beyond their rights. He regretted that 
most journalists had no academic background in the field, lacked professionalism and were 
primarily keen to broadcast sensitive information. The Minister sought technical assistance 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to 
develop a comprehensive media law that was compliant with human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>32. The Independent Expert was apprised of efforts by the Somaliland authorities to 
combat piracy. He learned from UNODC that Somaliland had made progress in eradicating 
piracy in its coastal area. He was informed about the arrest off the waters of Seychelles of 
alleged Somali pirates, who were charged with piracy, convicted and subsequently 
transferred to serve prison sentences in Somaliland under an agreement between the two 
sides. During his visit to Hargeysa Central Prison, the Independent Expert spoke with the 
convicted pirates, who were sentenced to terms of 10 to 20 years of jail. The prisoners 
complained about the denial of due process in that they had not been given the right to 
appeal under Seychelles law. The Independent Expert passed on this complaint to the 
Minister for Justice, who stated that Somaliland was satisfied about the fairness of the trials 
as it had sent a representative to Seychelles to monitor them. He had also asked the Human 
Rights Unit to look into the matter. 
</p>
<p>33. The Independent Expert conveyed his dismay to the Minister for Justice that, despite 
his earlier calls, both young girls and boys were still being put in jail for disobedience to 
their parents. The Minister acknowledged that secular tradition and customary practices 
would not disappear overnight; however, since the inception of the current regime in 2010, 
efforts had been made to adopt and apply a juvenile law. As a result of awareness-raising 
campaigns for parents, the number of cases had dropped significantly. He added that the 
Government had established a special section for the rehabilitation of children within the 
Ministry of Justice to deal with children in conflict with the law. </p>


<p><b> D. Puntland 
</b></p>
<p>34. In Puntland, the Independent Expert visited Garoowe and the port city of Bossasso. 
In Garoowe, he was invited by the President of the Puntland State of Somalia, Abdirahman 
Mohamud Farole, to participate in the ceremony organized for the ratification of the 
transitional Constitution of Puntland by the regional constituent assembly. He subsequently 
met with President Farole and his Vice-President, Mr. Abdisamad. He held meetings with 
the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Security, the Chief of Justice and with Members of 
the High Judicial Council, as well as with the Police Commander and civil society 
organizations. He also visited the Garoowe Central Prison. 
</p>
<p>35. The Independent Expert complimented the President on the achievements of his 
Government since their previous meeting, in 2011. He acknowledged the President&#8217;s efforts 
</p>
<p>in initiating and supporting a democratization process and moving towards a multiparty 
political system, demonstrated by the establishment of an electoral commission, which had 
facilitated the process leading to the enactment of a law on political association and the 
ratification of the transition Constitution. He also acknowledged the security challenges that 
Puntland faced in the light of reports of Al-Shabaab elements entering its territory as they 
fled from south-central Somalia. He emphasized, however, the need to accord suspects due 
process and their fair trial rights in accordance with the Puntland Constitution. 
</p>
<p>36. The Independent Expert commended the Puntland authorities for the gender-neutral 
language adopted in the recently ratified Constitution. He raised concerns, however, that 
some of its provisions did not comply with international human rights standards and 
principles. He expressed the hope that the concerns raised by UNPOS on certain articles 
would be addressed with a view to strengthening the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>37. In November 2011, the Puntland legislature passed the Human Rights Defender Act, 
although a human rights defender has yet to be appointed. The Independent Expert urged 
the President to operationalize the Office for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights 
in Puntland by ensuring a transparent selection process for a suitable individual to occupy 
the position, for instance through a public call for applications.  
</p>
<p>38. The Independent Expert conveyed his concern to the President about the practice of 
the appointment and dismissal of judges, which, left to the exclusive discretion of the 
executive and the legislature, was likely to affect the independence of the judiciary. He 
hoped that measures would be taken to ensure that such decisions were taken in 
consultation with an independent legal authority. He suggested the involvement of the High 
Judicial Council in reviewing and recommending appointments and the dismissal of judicial 
officers. He also appealed to the President to consider abolishing the death penalty or at 
least to commit to a moratorium on all executions, in keeping with the commitments made 
by Somalia during the universal periodic review.3 
</p>
<p>39. The Independent Expert also conveyed his concerns to the Puntland authorities 
about the enactment of the Circumcision law, which outlawed pharaonic circumcision but 
allowed other forms of female genital mutilation. He urged that the law be amended to 
prohibit all forms of female genital mutilation in accordance with article 18(2) of the 
Constitution of Puntland, which guaranteed every person the right to the protection of their 
body and integrity, and also in accordance with international human rights standards. A 
commitment in this regard was made during the universal periodic review for Somalia in 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 A/HRC/18/6. </p>


<p>40. The Independent Expert was informed that, in July 2012, President Farole had 
signed the Puntland Political Associations Act into law. This permitted the establishment of 
political parties in Puntland not allowed in the past.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Sool, Sanaag and Cayn regions  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Independent Expert was informed about the formation in northern Somalia of a 
semi-autonomous federal State of Somalia bringing together the Sool, Sanaag and Cayn 
regions, known as &#8220;Khatuumo State&#8221;, by a group of politicians, diaspora figures, elders and 
religious leaders from the Dulbahante subclan of Darod, who met in Taleeh in January 
</p><p>2012. The territory is claimed by both Somaliland and Puntland. The &#8220;Khatuumo 
administration&#8221; announced that it supported the unity of Somalia. The President of the 
</p>
<p>Transitional Federal Government initially announced the recognition of Khatuumo State, 
but this was subsequently withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>42. It should be mentioned that the Dulbahante clan was central to the politics in the 
territorial dispute between Puntland and Somaliland over Sool and Sanaag. Divided 
loyalties within the subclan between Somaliland and Puntland often caused instability in 
the region and tension between the two authorities, although both Puntland and Somaliland 
tried to accommodate Dulbahante representation within their respective administrations. 
Since the emergence of Khatuumo State, citizens (especially in the Sool region) apparently 
expressed support for the new State in public demonstrations, which the Somaliland 
security forces reportedly suppressed, using force that led to a number of deaths.  
</p>
<p>43. The political and security situation in the region remained tense. During the 
reporting period, clashes occasionally broke out between Somaliland forces and armed 
groups aligned to Khatuumo State, leading to numerous deaths and civilians casualties. On 
26 January 2012, fighting reportedly broke out between Somaliland forces and the 
Dulbahante clan militias in a village near Buuhoodle, in Cayn. This resulted in several 
deaths and casualties. In February 2012, fighting flared up again between Somaliland forces 
and forces aligned to the Khatuumo administration near the border town of Buuhoodle, 
resulting in deaths and casualties among the civilian population and forcing some residents 
to flee.  
</p>
<p>44. During his visit to Somaliland, the Independent Expert discussed the situation with 
Harshi Abdi Hassan, the Minister in the President&#8217;s office, who informed him that President 
Silanyo was committed to dialogue and had called for a peace conference in this regard. 
Moreover, preliminary talks were under way to find a political solution. He added that the 
talks between the Minister for Justice with a leader of Khatuumo in Djibouti and the 
envisaged conference in Abu Dhabi were headed in the right direction.  
</p>
<p>45. In response to the concern expressed by the Independent Expert about allegations of 
repression by Somaliland security forces of unarmed people who were exercising their right 
to peaceful demonstrations, the Minister denied the allegations, stating that there were 
people who were against the Government, which had the responsibility to maintain public 
order. He added that, unlike other Somali regions, there was no dominant clan in these 
territories, as all clans had a mixed population. He stated that Sanaag had been was 
pacified, but there were still some gaps in Sool, taking advantage of which anti-peace 
forces had attacked the Somaliland army.  
</p>
<p>46. At the request of the Independent Expert to allow the UNPOS Human Rights Unit 
and other human rights organizations to monitor alleged human rights violations in the 
region, the Minister agreed to allow, facilitate and organize such visits. The Independent 
Expert drew the attention of the Minister to the work of Humanitarian Dialogue, an 
independent agency in Geneva that helped promote dialogue between conflicting parties.  </p>


<p>47. The Independent Expert had raised the same issue with the President of Puntland 
and Vice-President Abdisamad Ali Shire, who was from the Sool region. Both claimed that 
the territories belonged to Puntland and they were therefore opposed to the formation of a 
new State. On 21 January 2012, the day of the demonstrations, the Vice-President of 
Puntland allegedly stated that Puntland had the constitutional right to liberate Las Anod 
from Somaliland, and asked Somaliland forces to leave the Sool region. 
</p>
<p>48. In further developments, on 4 June, militias loyal to Khatuumo State captured a 
checkpoint manned by Puntland security forces and occupied Tukaraq village. Elders and 
community leaders from both sides entered into negotiations on 12 June to avert a conflict 
between the two sides. On 16 June, Somaliland forces advanced into Tukaraq, forcing the 
Khatuumo militias to withdraw. After a few hours, however, Somaliland forces retreated to 
their base in Laascaanood, in the Sool region, after which Puntland army forces took 
control of Tukaraq. On 18 June, reports indicated that at least 120 security personnel from 
different sectors of Puntland security forces deserted and joined Khatuumo State militia. 
According to reports, the deserters were met and welcomed by members of the Khatuumo 
administration and residents in the area.  
</p>
<p>49. The Independent Expert subsequently learned that the President of Somaliland and a 
Sool, Sanaag and Cayn leader had met in Dubai on 27 June 2012 and agreed to resolve the 
problem, and to end all human rights violations resulting from the conflict in the region. 
The Independent Expert would like to draw the attention of the international community to 
the developments in the Sool, Sanaag and Cayn regions, which had potential to get out of 
hand.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Developments in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to life  
</b></p>
<p>50. The end of active combat in Mogadishu brought improvement to the situation of 
civilians living in the capital. The number of weapon-related casualties had decreased 
significantly as against those of 2011, when in May alone 1,590 people were admitted to 
Mogadishu hospitals with weapon-related injuries, 735 cases being children under 5 years. 
Against this, the number of casualties stood at about 500 people in the course of the month 
of January 2012, with 43 cases involving children under the age of 5.  
</p>
<p>51. The prohibition of direct fire and the identification of no-fire zones by AMISOM 
also contributed to the reduction of civilian casualties. The introduction of a civilian 
casualty tracking cell by AMISOM was expected to contribute to a further reduction. 
</p>
<p>52. The number of injuries or loss of life resulting from unconventional warfare, 
violence and insecurity remained very high. Al-Shabaab had publicly stated its intention to 
continue such attacks and claimed responsibility for the October 2011 attack in Mogadishu, 
which killed about 70 people, many of them students applying for scholarships, and in 
February 2012, which killed 15 people near the Muna Hotel.  
</p>
<p>53. The high number of strikes by Al-Shabaab was indicative of its disregard for the 
rules of war traditionally embedded in Somali culture. It had reportedly announced that it 
would continue to use improvised explosive devices, a tactic that accounted for a 
significant percentage of casualties. On 27 February, for example, such a device exploded 
during a football game in Wardhigley District, killing five people and injuring 12. 
</p>
<p>54. Outside Mogadishu, military operations by Ethiopian and Kenyan forces reportedly 
caused civilian casualties. One example was an airstrike conducted on Jilib, where, at the 
end of October 2011, a missile hit a camp for internally displaced persons, killing five </p>


<p>people, including a woman and three children, and injuring 45. Kenyan forces denied 
responsibility for the incident, while M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, which was present at the 
location and treated the wounded, publicly attributed the incident to Kenyan actions.  
</p>
<p>55. Reports of civilians being assassinated by Al-Shabaab accused of collaborating with 
the Transitional Federal Government also abound. In February 2012, in Baidoa, a man who 
was washing clothes for a Government minister was shot and killed after evening prayer. 
Al-Shabaab had warned the population not to support the Transitional Federal Government 
forces or their allies. On the other hand, suspected Al-Shabaab members were also 
reportedly being arrested by the Government and its allies, though there was no clarity with 
regard to the procedure and the status of the detainees. 
</p>
<p>56. Al-Shabaab had reportedly beheaded civilians in the Galguduud region, central 
Somalia, between 11 and 13 June following the pull-out of Ethiopians and troops of the 
moderate Islamic group Ahl al-Sunna wal-Jama&#8217;a from the city. Ten people were reportedly 
beheaded because suspected of spying for their enemies. Reportedly, all victims were men, 
accused of welcoming Ethiopian and Ahl al-Sunna wal-Jama&#8217;a forces to the town. The 
<i>muezzin</i> of a mosque was also among the victims.  
</p>
<p>57. Unknown assailants shot and killed the Attorney General of the Sool region under 
Somaliland administration, making him the second judge to be killed in northern Somalia in 
less than a month. Unknown gunmen armed with pistols opened fire on the judge as he was 
watching a football match at a location in Laascaanood, the capital of the Sool region.  
</p>
<p>58.  On 30 June, a prosecutor based in in Gaalkacyo, in the Mudug region, was killed as 
he was going home. As at the end of July, no suspects had been arrested in connection with 
the incident. In another incident, on 2 July, a former deputy Police Commissioner was 
killed in Garoowe. No suspects were arrested in connection with the killing. Some media 
sources believed that the motives for the assassination were political.  
</p>
<p>59. On July 17, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General condemned the 
murder in Mogadishu of a former Minister for Trade, allegedly by Al-Shabaab. The former 
Minister and a current Member of Parliament, Mohamed Abdinur Garweyne, were killed 
and at least six others wounded by a car bomb in Mogadishu. Media reports link the murder 
to the former Minister&#8217;s meeting with the United Nations monitoring group concerning 
corruption allegations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>60. Though conflict is a key factor for displacement in Somalia, information collected 
by UNHCR4 indicate that, in more recent times, an increase in internally displaced persons 
and refugees could be attributed to problems in access to minimum food supplies. In May 
and June, some 6,000 Somalis reportedly moved because of food insecurity resulting from 
meagre seasonal rains mainly in the Bay, Lower Juba and Bakool regions. For the first half 
of 2012, UNHCR recorded 13,000 such displacements. In the Lower Juba region, people 
are also reportedly moving to nearby towns in search of water and pasture. There were 
similar displacements in and around the region bordering Ethiopia. 
</p>
<p>61. In recent months, some 157,000 Somali refugees have taken shelter in Ethiopia. 
Since the beginning of June 2012, Somali refugees have continued to arrive in increasing 
numbers (on average, almost 1,200 new arrivals every week). They cited growing physical 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Available from www.unhcr.org/4fec227b9.html. </p>


<p>and food insecurity as their reasons for flight, including fear of forced recruitment by Al-
Shabaab. Many new arrivals came with all their belongings, including donkey carts and 
whatever livestock they still possessed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>62. In February 2012, the anticipation of fighting in the Afgooye corridor owing to 
offensives by AMISOM and Transitional Federal Government troops against Al-Shabaab 
triggered the movement of about 22,000 people from Afgooye into Mogadishu where, 
according to UNHCR, around 185,000 internally displaced persons had already taken 
refuge, an extra burden on the meagre existing basic services, such as water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>63. In addition, the Transitional Federal Government ordered evictions in order to 
reclaim 93 long-term occupied public buildings in Mogadishu. While the need to put such 
buildings to public use and to take advantage of rehabilitation promised by the international 
community was understandable, it was clear that alternative solutions should have been 
found to avoid making people homeless. At the time of reporting, the United Nations was 
working with the Government to develop a policy on internally displaced persons to 
contribute to durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>64. In Somaliland, the Government&#8217;s policy of fighting any Al-Shabaab activity led to 
many official statements criticizing immigration from southern Somalia as being mainly 
responsible for the insecurity. On 11 September 2011, the Government of Somaliland 
announced that it would expel some 100,000 illegal immigrants within 30 days. 
</p>
<p>65. During his meeting with Somaliland authorities, the Independent Expert expressed 
his concern at the forced repatriation of Somalis from the south-central region, as well as of 
Ethiopian, Eritrean and other refugees and asylum seekers, as it might put some of them at 
risk upon return. The Minister for Justice informed him that Somaliland had always offered 
hospitality to Somalis from the South and central regions and other African migrants. 
During the drought of 2011, Somaliland sent a group of ministers to Mogadishu to provide 
emergency aid to their &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; in Somalia. Moreover, Somalis came from 
various parts of Somalia to settle down and study in Somaliland universities. The capital 
city was, however overwhelmed, its huge population further extenuated by the drought 
situation. As a result, Somaliland could not afford to receive a greater influx of refugees 
and asylum seekers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>66. People living in camps remained vulnerable. Cases of sexual violence against 
internally displaced women and girls were reported and documented by United Nations 
teams. As noted, however, by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women ),5 its 
causes and consequences, who visited Somalia in December 2011, the exact number of 
cases was not known owing to the lack of a standardized database used by all protection 
partners in Mogadishu. After the Special Rapporteur presented her report to the Human 
Rights Council at its twentieth session, the Independent Expert thanked her for her 
important recommendations, which he felt would provide guidance to the Somali 
leadership.  
</p>
<p>67. Victims of sexual and gender-based violence in camps for internally displaced 
persons identified &#8220;Somali armed men in khaki uniforms&#8221; as the perpetrators. Few cases 
</p>
<p>  
 5 See A/HRC/20/16/Add.3. </p>


<p>were reported to the police owing to the perceived futility of reporting, stigma or fear of 
retaliation. Few victims sought medical attention because of the costs involved. The 
Transitional Federal Government established a task force on violence against women, and 
the United Nations was supported the Government in implementing measures to prevent 
and respond to the phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>68. Sexual exploitation and abuse by AMISOM was also reported, in spite of their 
prohibition by the AMISOM Code of Conduct. To prevent and respond to this phenomenon 
adequately, AMISOM should develop its engagement with the local population and 
strengthen its prevention and response mechanisms. The Independent Expert was informed 
that AMISOM lacked public information and an awareness strategy, an external reporting 
system and a victim assistance programme. In view of the authorized increase of troops to 
17,000, these gaps should now be addressed.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Protection of children  
</b></p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert was informed that the United Nations was continuing its 
efforts to address violations of children&#8217;s rights in Somalia. The country task force on 
monitoring and reporting, created in accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 
(2005), continued to document cases of grave violations in this regard. Of particular 
concern was a pattern of children being increasingly caught in direct attacks and crossfire 
owing to the intensification of military activities against Al&#8211;Shabaab. 
</p>
<p>70. The Independent Expert further learnt that the country task force was following up 
on the commitments made by the Government during the visit of the Special Representative 
for Children and Armed Conflict in 2010. On 7 January 2012, the Government announced 
the introduction of strict measures to prevent the recruitment and use of child soldiers. It 
also expressed its readiness to enter into dialogue for the preparation and implementation of 
time-bound plans of action within the framework of Security Council resolutions 1539 
(2004), 1612 (2005) and 1882 (2009). 
</p>
<p>71. At a workshop held on 6 and 7 March in Mogadishu and organized by the 
Transitional Federal Government and the United Nations, a draft plan of action was 
adopted for the release and re-integration of child soldiers from Government armed forces.  
</p>
<p>72. At the margins of the meeting of the International Contact Group on Somalia, held 
in Rome on 2 and 3 July 2012, the Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister of 
Somalia, Hussein Arab Isse, signed a plan of action to end the recruitment and use of 
children by the Somali National Armed Forces. Concrete steps should be taken by the 
Government of Somalia to ensure a child-free national army. 
</p>
<p>73. The positive developments on the Government side were, however, overshadowed 
by reports that Al-Shabaab militants were forcibly recruiting children. According to reports, 
the Al-Shabaab militia in Galguduud region took approximately 100 children, aged 12 
years and younger, and had sent them to Koranic schools, where they were reportedly 
taught about jihad and nothing else. According to local residents, when the children 
returned home, they recited jihad poems and abused those who fought Al-Shabaab. It was, 
however, reported that, in recent months, Al-Shabaab had lost control of many towns in the 
Galguduud region. 
</p>
<p>74. The situation of juveniles in detention centres in Somaliland remained a matter of 
concern. An assessment conducted in August 2011 by the Ministry of Justice of Somaliland 
found that, of a total of 104 children in prison at the time, 10 per cent were female. A total 
of 59 per cent of all children in prisons were convicted by courts mainly for rape, drug 
possession and gang-related offences, as well as for other minor offences, while the 
remaining 41 per cent were on remand. The assessment concluded that the juvenile justice </p>


<p>law, which called for the establishment of children&#8217;s courts, pretrial detention centres and 
rehabilitation centres remained unimplemented.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of expression and the media  
</b></p>
<p>75. Democratic freedoms, including the freedom of opinion and expression, were 
restricted throughout Somalia. In such a repressive environment, all parties, State or non-
State, sought to control and restrict the scope of freedom of opinion and expression on 
grounds ranging from protection of the national interest, State security through to public 
morality. It affected the work of, inter alia, journalists, who in all parts of Somalia were 
subjected to harassment, intimidation, unlawful or arbitrary arrest and detention at the 
hands of both Government authorities and/or militia groups. Several journalists received 
threats to life or were assassinated because of their work and the information they 
disseminated.  
</p><p>76. In Somaliland, the authorities maintained tight control over the media. There was 
only one State-controlled radio station, which operated under strict Government guidelines. 
The Government of Somaliland had consistently prohibited the establishment of private FM 
stations. At the end of 2011 and in January 2012, a spate of arrests and harassment of 
journalists was reported, with the notable case of 21 journalists arrested on 15 January 
while protesting against the closure of a television station.  
</p>
<p>77. In Puntland, despite the President&#8217;s stated commitment to greater openness, the 
media still faced restrictions in their coverage of political and security issues. A prominent 
radio journalist and member of the National Union of Somali Journalists was shot dead by 
three men in Gaalkacyo on 2 May 2012. No arrests for the killing have been reported. In 
another incident, on 24 May, a journalist working with Radio Shabelle was shot dead by 
four unknown assailants. This recent assassination brought the number of journalists 
assassinated in Somalia since the beginning of 2012 to six. 
</p>
<p>78. On 3 March 2012, the police raided the premises of Codka Nabadda, a private radio 
station broadcasting from Boosaaso, Puntland, confiscated radio and other equipment and 
closed down the station. The station director was arrested and remained in detention, 
without charge, until the end of April. The raid was reportedly conducted following a news 
story broadcasted by the radio station, in which it was reported that clashes had erupted 
between the Puntland administration and militants affiliated to Al-Shabaab near the Galgala 
area (Bari region).  
</p>
<p>79. On 5 March 2012, equipment belonging to reporters of Universal TV and Raxanreeb 
online radio and to a photographer for the Eastern Television Network were confiscated by 
the security officers working for the Puntland Deputy Security Minister. This incident 
apparently took place after the journalists covered a press conference called by General 
Abdullahi Said Samatar. The equipment was returned several days later. The General, who 
is a former Minister for Security, has political ambitions and intends to run for presidential 
office.  
</p>
<p>80. While the Constitution of Puntland guarantees the right to freedom of expression, 
the Media Law of 1999 prohibited the media from disseminating, inter alia, reports that 
threatened or damaged the security, economy, dignity and general interests of Puntland. 
Anyone who acted contrary to these provisions was liable to prosecution. A clear definition 
of what would threaten or damage the security of Puntland was not provided and, as such, 
the law was open to abuse.  </p>


<p><b> G. Treatment of prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>81. During his visit to Somalia, the Independent Expert visited several detention centres 
in Puntland and Somaliland. He found that, in a significant number of cases, detentions 
were either unlawful or arbitrary, with prisoners detained without a legal basis. He was also 
shocked to find women and girls detained for &#8220;disobeying&#8221; their parents or husband. 
Detention conditions were close to inhumane, and water and sanitation were frequently 
lacking. Ventilation was poor, with only small slits for windows. Prisons were overcrowded 
and stifling hot. Inmates slept on bare floor. The principle of separation between juveniles 
and adults, criminals and others was not always respected. Most inmates in Puntland and 
Mogadishu were accused of such serious crimes as murder, piracy or having links with al-
Shabaab; for a significant number of cases, however, detentions appeared to be either 
unlawful or arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>82. The Independent Expert was unable to visit the prison in Mogadishu because of 
security reasons. He was subsequently informed, however, that a team composed of 
UNODC, the OHCHR/UNPOS Human Rights Unit and UNICEF had made an assessment 
of the Mogadishu Central Prison and held meetings with Government officials from various 
institutions within the criminal justice sector, including representatives of the Ministry of 
Justice, Religious Affairs and Endowment, Custodial Corps, and the judiciary. Members of 
the assessment team had also consulted with representatives of civil society and 
interviewed prisoners detained at the Mogadishu Central Prison. This is a welcome 
development. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Other developments 
</b></p>
<p>83. The reporting period also witnessed greater engagement by the international 
community to take the road map forward. A number of important meetings were held, 
including the meeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, held in January 
2012; the meeting of the International Contact Group on Somalia, held in Djibouti on 5 and 
6 February 2012; the London Conference on Somalia, held on 23 February 2012; the 
Istanbul Conference on Somalia, held on 31 May and 1 June 2012; a meeting of the 
International Crisis Group, held on 2 and 3 July 2012 in Rome; and the Dubai meeting on 
27 and 28 June 2012. The aim of the meetings was primarily to move the road map 
forward, bring the recalcitrant parties together, help resolve disagreements, offer support 
for the implementation of the road map and warn &#8220;spoilers&#8221; of adverse consequences. 
</p>
<p>84. Another important development was the signing of a memorandum of understanding 
by the Transitional Federal Government and OHCHR, on 11 May 2012. The memorandum 
aims at helping the Government to fulfil its commitment to uphold human rights and the 
rule of law in Somalia, to bring an end to the culture of violence and impunity, and to 
establish accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Recent developments in Somalia indicate that the country has reached a 
turning point in its tortuous recent history. Efforts by all concerned, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations, the African Union, AMISOM and the international community, have 
</b></p>
<p><b>helped Somalia to move towards peace and normalcy. Whether this will actually be 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieved within the time frame laid down by the road map depends on the leadership 
</b></p>
<p><b>and people of Somalia. There are indications that the road map has progressed 
</b></p>
<p><b>steadily in recent months. Challenges remain, however. The deadline of 20 August </b></p>


<p><b>2012 will have passed by the time the present report is submitted to the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Independent Expert is both hopeful and wary about the prospects of a 
successful transition in Somalia. He hopes that the Transitional Federal Goverment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transitional federal institutions and the people of Somalia realize that if the 
</b></p>
<p><b>momentum gathered to date towards the goals so painstakingly developed in recent 
</b></p>
<p><b>years is lost, Somalia risks another long period of uncertainty and chaos. Not only 
</b></p>
<p><b>could international support, generated over the years, be lost, but the consequences of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the failure would likely strengthen the hands of those who have benefitted from 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict and instability. The Independent Expert is wary about the machinations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>many elements in Somalia who are not keen to see the success of the road map and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>who believe that their personal or group interests would be better served by continued 
</b></p>
<p><b>instability. Unless the majority of the people of Somalia are united against these 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;spoilers&#8221; and show their determination to foil their efforts, the latter might indeed 
</p>
<p><b>have the last say. This is a danger that everyone must guard against. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Only the determined efforts of all concerned can ensure a positive outcome in 
both the pre- and post-transition periods. Both the current Government and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>successor must, through its actions, take the lead in establishing in the minds of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>people the benefits of the rule of law over continued conflict, chaos and confusion. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Without the whole-hearted support of the people, the change expected cannot be 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieved.  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> As stated in earlier reports, the Transitional Federal Government holds the key 
in this regard. The Government can win over the minds and hearts of the people by 
</b></p>
<p><b>changing the way they have lived their lives in recent years without any rule of law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and authority to turn to in their hour of need. This can only be achieved by convincing 
</b></p>
<p><b>them that the Government cares for their welfare, is aware of their human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs and keen to restore their dignity.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Unfortunately, with a long history of political machinations and in-fighting 
among ever changing groups of people holding power in Mogadishu, ordinary people 
</b></p>
<p><b>have lost faith in their leadership. As a result, many have sought protection from their 
</b></p>
<p><b>clans or local warlords in return for allegiance to them. The Transitional Federal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government must do whatever necessary to change the perception that people have of 
</b></p>
<p><b>it.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Apart from improving the security situation for the people, in which much 
progress has been achieved in recent months, the Transitional Federal Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>must prepare the ground for the post-transitional Government to pursue the process 
</b></p>
<p><b>of change in Somalia, not only politically and economically but also socially. It should 
</b></p>
<p><b>recall that average Somalis see their Government as more interested in grabbing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abusing power, indulging in corruption to amass wealth, sowing disunity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissension among people to keep them divided, while remaining utterly oblivious to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their welfare. Much of this might not be true and people might not understand the 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficulties that the Government has had to face. The Independent Expert does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>subscribe to all these allegations as he is convinced about the commitment of many of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the leaders of the transitional Government to turn a new and more hopeful page for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Somalia, but he recognizes how deep-rooted these views are.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> In order to change this general negative perception, the Transitional Federal 
Government should consider developing another road map to give the people a clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>picture of how it seeks to improve the human rights situation in the country, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>timeline for each activity. For too long, the people of Somalia have forgotten how life 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be different in a State where the rule of law prevails, good governance is not </b></p>


<p><b>only a slogan but a practice by the Government, and where human rights are 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoted and protected by it.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The proposed human rights road map must move the focus of human rights in 
Somalia beyond civil and political rights to include economic, social and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. While the rights to due process, freedom from illegal and arbitrary detention, 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom from torture and cruel treatment, access to justice, the right to due process, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to a fair pre-detention procedure and the right to a lawyer must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized and people must be helped to understand that these are their 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutionally guaranteed rights, an ordinary Somali citizen faced with hunger, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thirst and the deprivation of basic requirements of life would perhaps be more keen to 
</b></p>
<p><b>hear about the enjoyment of the right to food, water and sanitation, health, education 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the like. The road map must clarify how the Government proposes to go about 
</b></p>
<p><b>realizing them.</b> 
</p>
<p>93.<b> The human rights road map could be developed with the help of thematic 
mandate holders under the special procedures system. The Government of Somalia 
</b></p>
<p><b>could consider inviting these mechanisms to identify the various needs in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>respective fields. The Independent Expert believes that the mandates of a significant 
</b></p>
<p><b>number of mandate holders are of relevance to the situation of Somalia.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Independent Expert wishes to remind the Government that human rights 
encompass the gamut of human existence, and attention to all of them is important for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human dignity and quality of life. The Government could prioritize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation plan in the respective areas with help of the mandate holders. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>would send a positive message to the international community and move them to assist 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government in the realization of these rights. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> By the time the present report is presented to the Human Rights Council, the 
road map to end the transition in Somalia will be completed and a new post-
</b></p>
<p><b>transitional Government for Somalia in office. Many of the recommendations made 
</b></p>
<p><b>herein will therefore fall upon the new Government to implement. The Transitional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Federal Government should, however, prepare the ground for the post-transitional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to build upon. The international community and the United Nations will, 
</b></p>
<p><b>of course, have a very important role to play during the interim and post-transitional 
</b></p>
<p><b>periods. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Transitional Federal Government and transitional federal institutions 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Transitional Federal Government to develop 
a human rights road map with a time frame for the implementation of each activity 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assigning specific responsibility to members of the Government. This should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed in a process that is inclusive, participatory and transparent. Ideas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations could be sought from all Somali citizens, particularly in identifying 
</b></p>
<p><b>priorities. OHCHR and thematic mandate holders could also help in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Independent Expert is concerned about reports that unscrupulous groups 
are attempting to garner support for candidates in the coming elections by offering 
</b></p>
<p><b>them money or threatening them. Such attempts must be resisted at all costs. If they 
</b></p>
<p><b>succeed, a basic objective of democracy and human rights underlying the road map 
</b></p>
<p><b>will be defeated. The Independent Expert urges all relevant parties to work together 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Government in this regard.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Independent Expert believes that the human rights road map would be 
best built upon good governance and the rule of law, which should therefore be a key 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority of the Government. </b></p>


<p>99. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Government to make special efforts to 
ensure that law enforcement and other Government bodies are properly trained and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strictly ordered to ensure respect for human rights and human dignity in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>dealings with the Somali people. Their success in this regard would spur international 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for such initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Independent Expert urges the Government to investigate all targeted 
killings and assassination attempts against journalists and human rights defenders, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as against Members of Parliament, Government ministers, other senior officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ordinary citizens.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b>  The Independent Expert urges the Government to use existing laws rather 
than emergency decrees to prosecute and try civilians for criminal offences in 
</b></p>
<p><b>liberated areas, as has been alleged in recent times. It should make a clear separation 
</b></p>
<p><b>between the jurisdiction of exceptional military courts and regular civilian tribunals 
</b></p>
<p><b>and courts of justice. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Government should adhere to its commitment not to recruit children for 
military activities. A credible and verifiable mechanism to check compliance must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Government should pay particular attention to the education and health 
needs of the population, which have been badly affected during the entire crisis. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>is an area where the international community would be keen to support any 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed effort of the Government. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Independent Expert urges the Government to implement the 
recommendations accepted during the universal periodic review, in particular those 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to the promotion of </b>women&#8217;s rights and <b>to addressing violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women. It should also pay special attention to all other recommendations made by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences.6  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Independent Expert urges the Government to ratify all core human rights 
instruments to which it is not yet a party. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Government should consider paying special attention to improving the 
judicial and correctional sectors, as many years of neglect have seriously affected their 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality and capacity. The absence of mechanisms to bring perpetrators to justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to hold them accountable has contributed to the prevalence of a culture of impunity, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which is a scourge that should be removed from Somali society. It is equally important 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the appalling detention conditions seen all over Somalia be improved.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Somaliland 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Somaliland authorities to secure for all its 
citizens the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental principles set forth in the Constitution of Somaliland. Anyone held in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention should be brought before a court and charged in accordance with the law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>or released. Family members of detainees should be informed of their whereabouts 
</b></p>
<p><b>and permitted to visit them in detention. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The use of force, including lethal force, by Somaliland security forces in the 
Sool, Sanaag and Cayn regions must comply with human rights standards. The 
</b></p>
<p>  
 6 See A/HRC/20/16/Add.3. </p>


<p><b>response of law enforcement agents to protests must comply with the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements of necessity and proportionality in the use of force, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Independent Expert urges Somaliland to abide by its international 
obligations under international and regional refugee laws and UNHCR guidelines. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Somaliland should refrain from the forced repatriation of Somalis from south-central 
</b></p>
<p><b>regions, as well as of African refugees and asylum seekers. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Government and Parliament of Somaliland 
to prohibit the imprisonment of youths simply for disobedience to their parents. While 
</b></p>
<p><b>taking into account customary law, parents should have full responsibility for provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>their children under the age of 18 with the best possible education and face the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Puntland  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Independent Expert urges the Puntland authorities to take appropriate 
measures to stop the pattern of attacks on judges and prosecutors, as well as on 
</b></p>
<p><b>businessmen and religious leaders. A continuation of this trend will have a serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on the rule of law and the administration of justice in Puntland. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert is also concerned about the dismissal without charges of 21 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges at the request of the Chief of Justice. This increases a vacuum and tensions in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the administration of justice. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>While the hospitality shown by Puntland to internally displaced persons from 
South-Central Somalia is commendable and the need for Puntland to prevent terrorist 
</b></p>
<p><b>acts by Al- Shabaab is understandable, the Independent Expert is concerned about 
</b></p>
<p><b>the mass arrests made at checkpoints without due process of young people coming 
</b></p>
<p><b>from South-central Somalia, and therefore urges that any action taken in this respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>be consiste</b>nt with Puntland&#8217;s obligations under international and African human 
</p>
<p><b>rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Independent Expert encourages the Government of Puntland to 
operationalize the Office of the Human Rights Defender and to appoint its President 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a transparent manner, following broad consultations with all stakeholders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including civil society organizations. OHCHR and the Human Rights Unit could 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide technical assistance to the Office to ensure that it acts in compliance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Paris Principles. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. International community 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The primary attention of the international community in the two weeks before 
the transition period comes to an end should be to ensure that the elections scheduled 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the road map are successfully held. The Independent Expert suggests that 
</b></p>
<p><b>AMISOM forces be empowered to deal with any signs of wrongdoing in the electoral 
</b></p>
<p><b>process. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The international community should consider supporting all credible efforts 
made by the Government for the promotion and protection of human rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Somalia. It should in particular support a stronger focus of the Government on 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural rights. Specific consideration should be given to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of the right to education, given that almost two generations of Somali 
</b></p>
<p><b>children have been denied the benefit of education owing to the protracted conflict. </b></p>


<p><b>Special attention must be given in this regard to the needs of vulnerable groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including minorities, women and internally displaced persons. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>In areas of South-central Somalia that have gradually come under the control 
of the Government, there is a need to provide communities with prompt, substantive 
</b></p>
<p><b>support. At the same time, opportunities to consolidate development in more stable 
</b></p>
<p><b>regions demand additional resources. There is particular need to promote the rule of 
</b></p>
<p><b>law, greater access to justice, the accountability of police services and the viability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>corrections systems.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The international community should support the launching of a national and 
global awareness-raising campaign on the situation of Somali women and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment </b>of specific funding channels to support local women&#8217;s organizations for 
</p>
<p>the protection of women&#8217;s rights and assistance to victims of <b>sexual and gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and discrimination in Somalia. 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The Independent Expert calls upon international donors to support 
programmes under the protection cluster of the Consolidated Appeals Process. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>cluster has in the past been underfunded, which has had a negative effect on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-related programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The international community must guard against what the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women called </b>the &#8220;fragmentation of international assistance&#8221; to 
</p>
<p><b>Somalia.7 The Independent Expert would like to draw the attention of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations to this issue as well. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The international community should provide financial and technical assistance 
to Somaliland authorities, who are making progress in the area of democratization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>good governance and the rule of law. The strategy for the justice sector was a major 
</b></p>
<p><b>achievement that should be implemented in a timely and appropriate fashion.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>The international community should provide Puntland authorities with support 
to eradicate piracy. In this regard, an integrated strategy that combines local and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international measures aimed at addressing the root causes on land, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>livelihood and job opportunities, vocational training and awareness-raising, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste, should be implemented. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. United Nations system  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The relocation of UNPOS to Mogadishu should lead to an increase in the 
engagement of its Human Rights Unit in human rights monitoring and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting, as well as capacity-building programmes and awareness-raising in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mogadishu and other areas in Somalia. The United Nations must provide the Unit 
</b></p>
<p><b>with sufficient capacity, both in human and financial resources, to be able to carry out 
</b></p>
<p><b>its mandate effectively. OHCHR should in particular pay more attention and provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>additional support to activities in areas highlighted in the present report, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the situation in the Sool, Sanaag and Cayn regions. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>In the light of the recent developments in the implementation of Security 
Council resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), the United Nations should deploy an 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate number of women</b>&#8217;s<b> protection advisers to the UNPOS Human Rights Unit, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thus strengthening its capacity to monitor, document, report and respond to sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence-related violations and protection concerns. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 7 Ibid., paras. 76 &#8211; 80. </p>


<p>124. <b>The memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation signed by the 
Government and OHCHR is a good beginning to improve the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights in Somalia. It provides an umbrella under which the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government may seek guidance and assistance from OHCHR to improve different 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of human rights issues. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>As the use and recruitment of children for military purposes remains a major 
concern, the United Nations must monitor closely the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p>Government&#8217;s polic<b>y of not recruiting children into the Somali National forces. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also ensure implementation of the joint security plan relating to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>reintegration of children from armed entities into civilian life.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>OHCHR should consider organizing a workshop with the participation of 
lawmakers and members of the judiciary, as well as experts in both Islamic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law, to address the question of the harmonization of Somali laws, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular between Islamic and sharia law and customary and international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and humanitarian law. Such a workshop might include, among others, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders of mandates on such thematic issues as torture, enforced disappearances, 
</b></p>
<p><b>summary and extrajudicial killings, violence against women, and freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression and opinion, as well as selected members of the Transitional Federal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government and Parliament. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The United Nations must pay special attention to helping the Government to re-
establish a legitimate justice system in Mogadishu and South-central Somalia. A 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific, coordinated assessment of the justice and corrections sectors and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of a nationally-owned strategy for the re-establishment of a functioning 
</b></p>
<p><b>apparatus are essential to rebuild the country. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>The institutions of the United Nations should bear in mind that, in Somalia, 
there is a widespread perception that a substantial amount of international assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by the international community to Somalia is spent on missions and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporting humanitarian activities and capacity-building programmes, very little of 
</b></p>
<p><b>which has touched the lives of ordinary people. The United Nations should conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>public relations exercises and make other efforts to remove this perception, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>affects the impact of its work and the safety of United Nations personnel. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>The United Nations and donor agencies should be encouraged to assist the 
Government in providing long-term assistance to internally displaced persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially women and children. The Organization should assist the Government in 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring the provision of adequate lighting and security, and geographically 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible police stations, as well as access to appropriate health care and schooling 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities, adequate shelter and food.  
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>United Nations agencies and their partners should integrate the relevant 
universal periodic review recommendations into their planning and programming and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide the Government with the technical and financial support necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement them. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>UNODC should do more to raise the terrible conditions of detainees in Somalia 
to international standards and ensure compliance with the Standard Minimum Rules 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the Treatment of Prisoners.  
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>The Independent Expert encourages OHCHR and UNPOS to provide advisory 
services to the Puntland authorities to develop a media law that is compliant with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
