EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1 
 
This Technical Report was prepared for Orvana Minerals Corp (“Orvana”), a Canadian company listed on 
the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  (Ticker:  ORV)  and  the  sole  owner  of  Kinbauri  España  S.L.U.  (“KE”).    In 
addition to the El Valle-Boinás/Carlés (“EVBC”), Spain property, Orvana operates the Don Marío Upper 
Mineralized Zone Cu-Au-Ag deposit in eastern Bolivia and is developing the Copperwood copper project 
in the Upper Peninsula, Michigan. 
 
This  Technical  Report  supersedes  “Technical  Report  on  the  Boinás  and  Carlés  Gold  Mines,  Asturias, 
Spain”  by  A.  Wheeler,  B.  Dowdell,  and  A.  Noble  with  an  effective  date  of  April  30,  2010.    Its  primary 
purpose is to update resource and reserve estimates, the update of which includes new resource models 
for the Boinás East and Charnela Zones and updates to other resource estimates using additional assays 
from 72 underground holes for 8,770 metres of drilling from April 30, 2010 through November 10, 2011, 
the effective date of this Technical Report.  Also, an updated mine plan is included herein.  Furthermore, 
an operations summary covering the period from May 31, 2011 through October 31, 2011 is included.  
Finally, the results of exploration drilling at the Godán prospect are discussed.
1.1
Property Description
The  Río  Narcea  Gold  belt  is  located  in  northwestern  Spain  within  the  Oviedo  Province,  Asturias 
Principality  approximately  35  kilometres  west  of  the  Asturian  capital  city  of  Oviedo  and  about  30 
kilometres south of the north coast of Spain (Figure 1-1).  The Asturias airport and the port city of Avilés 
are located approximately 40 kilometres northeast of the property.  The EVBC deposits, as well as other 
proximal  deposits  (“The  Properties”),  are  situated  in  the  municipalities  of  Belmonte  de  Miranda  and 
Salas. 
 
The  Properties  are  within  a  portion  of  the  belt  that  trends  northeast-southwest  with  a  length  of  15 
kilometres and a width of 4 kilometres.  The terrain is hilly to mountainous and is dissected by numerous 
streams  and  rivers,  including  the  Río  Narcea  River.    The  hills  are  generally  grass-covered  with 
intermittent  wooded  areas.    Small-scale  farming  is  common  throughout  the  area.    As  there  is  little 
industry or other sources of employment in the area, the local communities are supportive of continued 
mining operations as a source of viable employment. 
 
The  Properties  consist  of  14  Exploitation  Concessions  comprising  4,298.22  hectares  and  two 
Investigative  Permits  comprising  753.60  hectares.    The  properties  are  controlled  by  Kinbauri  España 
S.L.U.  Orvana acquired the project through the purchase of Kinbauri Gold Corp. (“KGC”) in September, 
2009.  Workings of the Roman era trace the length of the Río Narcea Gold Belt, which hosts the EVBC 
mines.  Little is known about the history of metal mining in the Río Narcea Gold Belt from the time the 
Romans abandoned the area near the end of the second century until the 19th century. Some  of the 
earliest modern mining interest in the belt is documented in public records as permits granted for iron 
exploration in the late 1800s. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, small 
copper mines were exploited at Carlés, Boinás and El Valle. During World War II, arsenopyrite was mined 
near Carlés.

Figure 1-1  General Location of the Properties in Spain and Asturias
Modern  exploration  of  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt  led  by  Spanish  subsidiaries  of  multinational  mining 
companies  began  in  the  1970s  and  continued  into  the  1990s.    After  extensive  drilling  as  well  as 
underground  exploration, a  Feasibility  Study completed  in  1996 confirmed the  economic viability  of  a 
mine  operation.    Río  Narcea  Gold  Mines  (“RNGM”)  commenced  open-pit  mining  of  the  EVBC  gold 
deposits in 1997 and mined nearly 1 million ounces of gold through 2006.  In 2007, KGC purchased the 
asset and conducted exploration drilling throughout the area.  In 2009, Orvana acquired  KGC and thus 
acquired the EVBC and proximal deposits and prospects.
1.2
Geology and Mineralization
The Río Narcea Gold Belt is located in the western portion of the Cantabrian Zone in the northwestern 
part of the Hercynian-age Iberian Massif. The Cantabrian Zone is the eastern foreland area that is east of 
the  internal  zones  of  the  Hercynian  orogenic  belt.    Middle  Cambrian  to  Carboniferous  shallow-water 
platform clastics and carbonates are the country rock of the foreland area.  The stratigraphic section is 
approximately 3,500 metres thick and was not subjected to regional metamorphism.

Igneous rocks intruded the Cantabrian Zone during the late Hercynian (approximately 300 Ma) as stocks 
and  skarn,  hornfels,  and  marble  formed  along  the  contacts  with  the  Paleozoic  carbonate  rocks  and 
released  hydrothermal  fluids  that  resulted  in  gold  and  copper mineralization.    The  NE-SW-striking  Río 
Narcea fault system formed preferential sites for post-orogenic calc-alkaline intrusions.  Compositions of 
these  intrusions  range  from  gabbro  to  granite  with  some  of  the  more  felsic  stocks  closely  associated 
with hydrothermal events. Textures of these intrusions range from equigranular to porphyritic. 
 
Later dykes intruded both the sedimentary rocks and earlier intrusions throughout the Río Narcea Gold 
Belt, especially to the south in the vicinity of the EVBC deposits.  Compositions range from andesite to 
rhyolite.  Many are quartz-feldspar porphyries that are related to another hydrothermal episode, which 
resulted in significant epithermal gold deposition. 
 
The  Mesozoic  and  later  stratigraphic  record  is  largely  absent  in  the  western  Cantabrian  Zone  as  the 
region  underwent  extensive  periods  of  uplift,  erosion,  and  normal  faulting.  Tertiary  sedimentation 
began in the late Eocene/late Oligocene as alluvial deposits covered nearly all of the mineralized section 
in a topographic depression that was eroded along the Río Narcea fault and fracture system. 
 
Extensive early broad-scale folding and thrusting followed by normal faulting are manifest throughout 
the  region.    Both  low-angle  thrust  and  high-angle  normal  faults  postdate  the  magmatic  and 
hydrothermal  activity,  but  predate  early  Tertiary  sedimentation.    Tertiary  Alpine  thrusting  moved 
Paleozoic rocks over Tertiary sedimentary rocks and may have displaced mineralization as well. 
 
Two main areas of mineralization have been identified: 1) El Valle/Boinás and 2) Carlés. 
 
The El Valle/Boinás area has two types of gold mineralization: 1) mesothermal exoskarn mineralization 
related  to  a  granite  porphyry  stock,  and  2)  a  later  epithermal  event  related  to  faulting  and  to  the 
intrusion of quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes. 
 
Copper-gold  skarns  have  developed  mainly  along  the  contacts  between  igneous  rocks  and  carbonate 
units  creating  two  distinct  types  of  skarn.  At  EVBC,  calcic  skarns  formed  in  the  limestones  of  the 
Cambrian  Láncara  Formation  and  magnesian  skarns  formed  in  the  dolomites  of  the  same  formation.  
Whereas  calcic  skarns  consist  mainly  of  garnet,  pyroxene,  and  wollastonite,  magnesian  skarns  consist 
mainly of diopside with some interbedded forsterite and are typically called “black skarns” due to their 
dark  color.    Most  of  the  economic  mineralization  is  spatially  associated  with  prograde  skarns  in  the 
carbonate host rocks; endoskarn mineralization is weak. 
 
Retrograde  calcic  skarns  consist  of  epidote,  quartz,  calcite,  magnetite,  and  sulphides  (chalcopyrite, 
pyrite,  and  arsenopyrite).   Gold mineralization  in  this  type  of skarn  is erratic and  mostly  uneconomic.  
Retrograde  magnesian  skarn  is  altered  to  tremolite,  actinolite,  serpentine,  phlogopite  and  carbonate. 
The  retrograde  alteration  and  metallic  mineralization  is  more  intense  in  this  black  skarn.  The 
paragenesis  consists  of  a  first  stage  involving  chalcopyrite,  magnetite,  and  pyrrhotite,  with  minor 
sphalerite, cubanite and arsenopyrite.  The second stage consists of chalcopyrite, bornite, magnetite and 
electrum as well as accessory Ag, Bi, Cu, Co and Ni sulphides and sulpharsenides.

P a g e  | 4
Intrusive  rocks,  skarn,  and  all  sedimentary  rocks  are  hosts  to  at  least  two  phases  of  epithermal 
mineralization,  which  caused  silicification,  argillization,  sericitization  and  propylitization.  These  exhibit 
strong  structural  controls.    At  EVBC,  reactivation  of  fracture  zones  along  NE-SW,  E-W  and  NW-SE 
orientations  produced  widespread  brecciation  and  favoured  the  emplacement  of  the  quartz-feldspar 
porphyry  dykes.    Of  economic  significance  is  the  epithermal  gold,  often  characterized  by  jasperoid, 
spatially  related  to  these  dykes.    The  jasperoids  formed  by  silicification  of  carbonate  rocks  and  are 
characterized  by  anomalous  Au,  As,  Sb  and  Hg;  jasperoids  formed  by  silicification  of  previously 
mineralized skarn are characterized by anomalous Au, Ag, Cu, Bi, Te, As, Sb and Hg. 
 
The final phase of alteration at El Valle/Boinás was leaching and enrichment along the structural zones, 
which  is  as  deep  as  400  metres  from  the  surface,  and  oxidation  of  outcropping  mineralization.    The 
presence of chalcocite, cuprite, and native copper in certain areas suggest at least two cycles of leaching 
and enrichment. 
 
The  Carlés  gold  deposit,  which  is  15  kilometres  NNE  of  El  Valle/Boinás,  is  a  gold-  and  copper-bearing 
calcic  exoskarn  located  along  the  eastern,  northern,  and  northwestern  margins  of  the  Carlés 
granodiorite where it is in contact with Devonian Rañeces Formation.  The skarn is developed mainly in 
the  lower  portion  of  the  Rañeces  Formation  and  is  continuous  for  over  1,000  metres.    It  ranges  in 
thickness from 1.5 metres to over 25 metres and dips 50º  - 90º away from the granitic intrusion.  The 
skarn is known over a vertical continuity of 400 metres in certain areas and remains open at depth. 
 
The  exoskarn  consists  of  layers of  garnet  (grossularite-andradite)  intercalated  with  layers  of  pyroxene 
skarn (hedenbergite) and is host to the mineralization.  Retrograde phases of the skarn are manifested 
irregular magnetite layers associated with amphibole.  The skarn grades outwards into coarse-grained 
marbles  followed  by  the  non-altered  limestones.    The  latter may  show  narrow  intercalations  of  distal 
garnet-pyroxene incipient skarn. 
 
Gold  mineralization  at  Carlés  is  closely  associated  with  copper  sulphides  that  consist  of  disseminated 
and  patchy  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  that  precipitated  mainly  in  the  magnetite  zone.    Other  metallic 
minerals common in the skarn are arsenopyrite, löellingite, pyrrhotite and late-stage pyrite.  Accessory 
minerals  in  the  deposit  are  hessite,  bismuthinite,  molybdenite,  sphalerite,  stannite  and  jamesonite.  
Gold occurs as electrum (43% Au and 57% Ag) associated with copper sulphides. 
 
The  gold-copper  mineralization occurs  in thin  layers,  called  “capas”,  which vary  in  thickness  from  less 
than 2 metres to more than 15 metres.  The average thickness of the gold- and copper-bearing zones in 
the underground mining operation was about 4 metres.

Resource Estimate
Updated  resource  estimates  for  the  A107,  Charnela  South,  Boinás  East,  Carlés  North,  and  Carlés  NW 
mineralized  zones  are  reported  herein.    Resources  are  estimated  using  3-dimensional  wireframes  to 
define  the  geologic  limits  of  the  mineralized  zones.    Inverse-distance-power  estimation  with  trend 
surface directional control is then used to estimate block grades within the wireframe envelopes.  The 
total  estimated  resources,  using  a  2  g/t  gold  cutoff,  are  summarized  in  Table  1-1.    The  La  Brueva 
resource estimate is not reported herein (Noble, 2010).

1.4
Reserve Estimate and Mine Plan
The reserve  estimate  and mine  plan were  based on the  estimated measured and indicated resources, 
updated cost data related to the operation from May 31, 2011 through October 31, 2011, and a price 
deck of US$1,100 per ounce of gold, US$2.75 per pound of copper, and US$22.50 per ounce of silver.  
The total estimated reserves for the properties are summarized in Table 1-2. 
 
The  fundamental  change  in  the  mine  plan  described  herein  is  that  the  skarn  ore  will  be  mined  by 
longhole stoping or bulk mining methods and the panel width increased from 10 metres to 15 metres; 
stopes will be backfilled.  The oxide zones will be mined by cut-and-fill methods using roadheaders. 
 
The reserve estimate includes more dilution and ore loss than that presented previously (Wheeler and 
Dowdell, 2010).

1.5  Mine Operations
Mine  operations  were  commissioned  on  May  31,  2011.  All  mining  is  underground  and  extraction 
methods include cut-and-fill and longhole stoping.  The mill and plant capacity is a nominal 2,000 tonnes 
per  day.    Ore  is  crushed  and  ground  then  passes  through  a  gravity  circuit,  flotation  cells,  and  a 
carbon-in-leach circuit (“CIL”); both concentrate and doré are produced. 
 
The  operation  started  up  on  May  31,  2011  and  commercial  production  started  October  1,  2011.  
Concentrate  is  sold  through  an  agreement  with  MRI  Trading  AG  and  the  doré  is  sold  through  an 
agreement with Metalor Technologies S.A. 
 
Currently, all haulage at both El Valle/Boinás and Carlés is via ramps and it has been difficult to provide 
enough ore to occupy the capacity of the mill and plant.  A 420-metre shaft is currently in construction 
at El Valle/Boinás and it is expected to be operable in Spring, 2012.  The shaft, which will be exclusively 
for ore hoisting, will be rated at 4,000 tonnes per day and will alleviate haulage bottlenecks.  In fact, the 
shaft is the first step to evaluate the viability of an increase in throughput. 
 
The  lower  gold  grades  that  have  been  processed  over  the  last  five  months  were  a  result  of  treating 
development ore as well as the inability to mine the higher-grade gold oxide ore, specifically the A107 
subvertical structure, at the planned rates.  Over the last few months, a roadheader has been used to 
extract material from the A107 zone and, in November, mobilized to the Charnela South high-grade gold 
structure; a second roadheader is scheduled to arrive in January, 2012.  The advantage of this method is 
that, unlike drill-and-blast, the surrounding rocks are relatively unaffected during extraction.  With the 
primary development to the  main ore  faces  nearly complete,  gold grades will increase over time with 
the application of mechanized mining aimed to facilitate this increase. 
 
Three  diamond-drill  underground  rigs  are  under  contract  in  order  to 1)  better  define  stopes  for mine 
planning, 2) dewater, 3) upgrade resources, 4) and add resources.

P a g e  | 7
As of October 31, 2011, the number of direct employees was 312 and the number of contractors on site 
was 148.
1.6
Environmental and Permitting
The  mines  at  El  Valle-Boinás  and  Carlés  are  fully  permitted  and  bonded.    In  June  2011,  the  Asturias 
Ministry of Environment  required the  posting of a €10M bond for the tailings impoundment, which is 
located in the old El Valle open pit.  Soon thereafter, €5M was posted and the remainder is due in June 
2012.    KE  has  received  an  independent  study  that  shows  remediation  of  the  tailings  impoundment 
would cost less than the amount currently posted and will seek relief from the regulatory authorities to 
waive the bond due in June 2012.
1.7
Capital and Operating Costs
Capital expenditures through September 30, 2011 were €66.7M, which includes various costs related to 
the  commissioning  of  the  mine;  commissioning  ended  on  July  31,  2011.    €6.5M  is  budgeted  for  fiscal 
year  2012,  which  fiscal  year  will  end  on  September  30,  2012,  in  order  to  complete  the  shaft  and  the 
slope-stability work for the tailings impoundment. 
 
Due  to  the  lower-grade  development  material  processed,  the  cash  costs  for  August  and  September, 
2011 were US$1,180 per ounce of gold net of byproduct.  Direct operating cash costs  are estimated at 
$700-$800 per ounce of gold net of by-product revenue.
1.8
Conclusions
The  EVBC  gold  deposits  can  be  mined  with  acceptable  margins.    The  significant  advance  of  primary 
development, the completion of the shaft, and the application of mechanized mining to the oxide zones 
will result  in the  mining of higher  gold grades  over time.  The underground drilling has upgraded and 
added resources; continued drilling should discover more resources.
1.9
Recommendations
The following is recommended:
Continue  underground  drilling  not  only  for  operational  purposes,  but  to  delineate 
known  mineralization,  upgrade  inferred  resources  and,  in  certain  areas,  indicated 
resources, and attempt to discover additional resources that would support at least 6 to 
18 months of production in contiguous areas.
Consider  drilling  the  subvertical  structures,  which  host  the  higher-grade  gold 
mineralization, with a sonic or Cubex drill rig to increase confidence of reserves in the 
oxide zones.
Optimize  the  use  of  mechanized  mining,  specifically  the  roadheader,  in  the  oxide 
mineralization  to  increase  productivity,  but  improve  grade  control  and  reduce  the 
planned dilution.


Optimize  the  longhole  stoping  bulk  mining  methods  by  reducing  overbreaks  and  thus 
dilution.
Evaluate the optimization the mill and plant to increase throughput.
Once the shaft is completed and operational, consider expanding the mill and plant.
Long-term mine planning work should also consider what-if scenarios, particularly with 
respect  to  the  inferred  material,  which  could  significantly  lead  to  an  increase  in  the 
future reserve base.  The distribution of this material could also have a significant effect 
on future infrastructure and ore haulage planning.
Because  there  are  two  mine  properties,  multiple  ore  bodies  and  underground  and 
open-pit  ore  sources,  many  different  mining  sequences  are  possible.    This  sequencing 
aspect needs to be analysed and tested continuously so as to maximize cash flow.

experts in environmental permits and liabilities in Spain. 
 
Although the authors have relied upon the supplied data and interviews with KE employees, they have 
no reason to believe that any of the data are unreliable or that any material facts have been withheld. 
 
Estimates of mineral resources and reserves are inherently forward-looking statements subject to error.  
Although  resource  and  reserve  estimates  require  a  high  degree  of  assurance  in  the  underlying  data 
when  the  estimates  are  made,  unforeseen  events  and  uncontrollable  factors  can  have  significant 
adverse  or  positive  impacts  on  the  estimates.    Actual  results  will  inherently  differ  from  estimates. 
Possible  unforeseen  events  and  uncontrollable  factors  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  geologic 
uncertainties,  including  inherent  sample  variability;  metal  price  fluctuations;  variations  in  mining  and 
processing  parameters;  and  adverse  changes  in  environmental  or  mining  laws  and  regulations.    The 
timing and effects of variances from estimated values cannot be accurately predicted.

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
4.1
Location
The  Properties  lie  within  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt  and  are  located  in  northwestern  Spain  within  the 
Oviedo  Province,  Asturias Principality  approximately 35  kilometres west  of the Asturian  capital  city of 
Oviedo and about 30 kilometres south of the north coast of Spain along the Cantabrian Sea. Madrid is 
located  350  kilometres  southeast  of  the  property  (Figures  1-1  and  4-1).    The  Asturias  airport  and  the 
port city of Avilés are located approximately 40 kilometres northeast of the property.  The KE properties 
are  situated  in  the  municipalities  of  Salas  and  Belmonte  de  Miranda.    The  most  northerly  of  the 
properties is the Ortosa-Godán area, which is located approximately three kilometres east of the village 
of  Salas  and  45  kilometres  by  road  from  Oviedo.    The  Carlés  deposit  and  the  La  Brueva  deposit  are 
located 50 kilometres by road from Oviedo and 40 kilometres from the Cangas del Narcea village. 
 
The approximate center of the property is at latitude 43° 21’N, longitude 6° 16’W.

4.2
Type of Mineral Tenure
The mineral rights for the properties are held in the form of Spanish “Exploitation Concessions” (EC) and 
“Investigation Permits” (IP).  The EC and IP are granted by the Spanish government, but oversight has 
been delegated to the regional authorities of Asturias in this case. 
 
The EC provides the holder of the concession the right to extract minerals from a specified area, subject 
to  approval  from  the  Mining  Authorities  of  an  “Exploitation  Plan”.    The  term  is  for  30  years  and  is 
renewable upon application.  The EC provides the holder of the concession the right to extract minerals 
from a specified area,  subject to approval from the  Mining Authorities of an “Exploitation Plan”.  The 
Exploitation Plan includes the Environmental Impact Study and the subsequent Restoration Plan, which 
needs approval from Environmental Authorities. The El Valle/Boinás and Carlés Exploitation Plans and 
the  respective  Environmental  Studies  and  Restoration  Plans,  approved  in  1996  and  in  2000,  give  the 
holder of the Exploitation Concessions the right to carry further investigation activity inside the “mining 
areas”  with  no  other  authorization  except  that  from  the  Mining  Authorities,  which  is  achieved  by 
submitting  a  complementary  investigation  plan  annually.    On  January  31,  2007,  Kinbauri  España  S.L. 
submitted a “Complementary Investigation Plan for 2007” to the mining authorities for El Valle-Boinás 
and one for Carlés in which all activity planned is located inside the “mining area” that was previously 
approved  in  the  “Exploitation  Plans”.    Work  plans  are  presented  to  the  Dirección  General  de  Minería 
before 31 January of each year. 
 
At  the  same  time,  KE  submitted  a  single  “Complementary  Investigation  Plan”  for  La  Brueva  and 
Godán-La  Ortosa  projects,  which  needs  no  further  authorization  except  for  that  from  the  mining 
authorities.  Any  activity  on  those  projects  that  may  affect  the  environment would  require  permission 
from the environmental authorities, and an Environmental Study and the subsequent Restoration Plan 
would be required. 
 
An IP provides the holder of the permit the right to investigate the resources in the permit area, subject 
to approval from the Mining Authorities of an “Investigation Plan”. The holder has the right to carry out 
all types of exploration activities including geological studies, soil geochemistry, geophysics, and drilling. 
If there  is any activity on surface  that the mining authorities believe  may affect  the  environment, the 
company may be required to get additional approvals from environmental authorities.  The term is for 3 
years and is renewable upon application.
4.2.1
Investigation Permits Under Application
Orvana  has  applied  for  2  new  IPs  comprising  753.60  hectares  adjacent  to  the  existing  exploitation 
permits  in  the  El  Valle-Boinás  area.    These  permits,  Quintana  and  Campalcarro,  have  not  yet  been 
granted, but, according to the legal opinion, the necessary paperwork is being processed to grant these 
IPs to KE.  The pending investigation permits are shown in Table 4-1 and Figure 4-2.

Shown in Figures 4-6, 4-7, 4-9, and 4-10 are the “Mining Areas” for El Valle-Boinás and Carlés, according 
to the exploitation plans approved by the Mining Authorities in 1996 and 2000, respectively, plus the 
surface rights owned by KE inside the “Mining Areas”.  These are the areas that KE must restore in the 
future according to the aforementioned exploitation plans and the corresponding restoration plans. 
 
The  property  has  been  surveyed  in  several  phases  in  the  past  by  the  companies  INTOPCAR  S.L.  and 
INCAR.  These surveys include aerial photography of the area, creation of a photogrammetric base map 
with  contour  level  lines  every  1  metre,  and  onsite  ground  surveying  work,  such  as  measuring  a  few 
strategic points in UTM coordinates, European datum 1950 (UTM ZONE 29). 
 
The “Mining  Areas”,  including  both open-pit  and  underground  development,  have  been surveyed  and 
are updated continuously during the mining operations. 
 
There  are  no  government  royalties  on  the  property, although  there  is  a minimal  annual  fee.    In  May, 
2008, KGC closed a $7.5M Net Smelter Return Royalty agreement with Anglo Pacific Group PLC ("Anglo 
Pac").  Under the terms of the agreement, Anglo Pac funded KGC through the issuance of a convertible 
debt instrument in the principal amount of $7.5M. Principal is to be repaid through a 2.5% net smelter 
return royalty on the El Valle-Boinás/Carlés project. The royalty increases to 3% in the event gold prices 
exceed US$1,100/ounce. Upon repayment of principal, the instrument converts to a net smelter return 
royalty.  In  the  event  that  the  rate  of  production  from  the El  Valle-Boinás/Carlés  mill  does  not  exceed 
90,000  ounces  of  gold  at  an  annualized  rate  through  the  2012 calendar  year, Anglo  Pac will  have  the 
right to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal into KGC common shares: (a) at a price of 
$0.958  per  share  until  May  12,  2013,  and  (b)  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange, 
thereafter until December 31, 2015, at the discounted market price.
4.5
Environmental Considerations
KE  possesses  all  necessary  environmental  permits  to  operate  a  mine.    KE  has  the  responsibility  to 
reclaim portions of the property including: Zone A - The office plant and other installations at El Valle, 
plus the parking and adjacent area to Zone A; Zone B - The Boinás Underground Portal; Zone C - The new 
El Valle tailings impoundment in the El Valle Pit; Zone D - The Laboratory facilities.  In addition, KE has 
responsibility for reclamation of part of the Carlés area. 
 
The  current  distribution  of  the  Asturian  brown  bear  could  affect  future  operations  outside  of  EVBC 
mining  and  processing  area.    The  La  Ortosa-Godán  area  is  considered  to  be  an  area  of  potential 
distribution  of  bears.    Classification  as  an  area  with  the  current  distribution  of  bears  may  require 
additional permitting from environmental authorities in the La Brueva and La Ortosa-Godán areas.  No 
additional  approvals  are  required  inside  the  area  of  the  El  Valle-Boinás  Exploitation  Plan,  however, 
because the Exploitation Plan has been approved. 
 
Monitoring of water within The Properties and proximal areas is continuous.  Although the processing 
plant  and  tailings  impoundment  are  no-discharge  facilities,  KE  is  permitted  to  discharge  mine  waters 
after proper handling.  To date, no citations for non-compliance have been received.

4.6
Archeological Considerations
Cultural heritage sites in the  area include Roman workings, including old Roman pits, channels, ponds 
and fortified areas. The sites are shown in Figure 4-8 and any work carried out in those areas requires 
archaeological follow up by appropriate technical people.
4.7
Cultural Considerations
The northern projects (Carlés and Godán-La Ortosa) belong to the municipality of Salas and the southern 
projects  (El  Valle-Boinás  and  La  Brueva)  belong  to  the  municipality  of  Belmonte  de  Miranda.  It  is 
significant  that  both  municipalities  are  supportive  of  mining  activity  at  the  Carlés  and  El  Valle-Boinás 
deposits. 
 
The land use classifications in the project areas by the Municipalities of Salas and Belmonte de Miranda 
are seen in Figure 4-9 and Figure 4-10, respectively. All the deposits are well inside areas classified as 
“Mining Interest” except the Godán-La Ortosa, which is classified as agrarian interest, and the northern 
part  of  the  La  Brueva,  which  is  classified  as  “landscape”  (scenic)  interest.    The  regulations  of  the 
Municipality of Salas indicate that mining would be compatible in areas of agrarian interest or landscape 
interest in areas where an Exploitation Concession has been granted, such as at Godán-La Ortosa.  The 
regulations  of  Belmonte  de  Miranda  are  more  restrictive  with  respect  to  areas  of  landscape  interest, 
such as the northern part of the La Brueva deposit.  These limitations may restrict the ability of Orvana 
to drill or to conduct mining activities on the north side of the concession if they are not converted.

The Río Narcea Gold belt is located in northwestern Spain within Oviedo Province, Asturias Principality 
approximately 35 kilometres west of the Asturian capital city of Oviedo and about 30 kilometres south 
of the north coast of Spain, as shown in Figure 5-1.  The Asturias airport and the port city of Avilés are 
located  approximately  40  kilometres  northeast  of  the  property.    The  Properties  are  situated  in  the 
municipalities of Salas and Belmonte de Miranda. 
 
The  Properties  are  within  a  portion  of  the  belt  that  has  a  length  of  15  kilometres  and  a  width  of  4 
kilometres, with a northeast-southwest orientation of the long axis.  The terrain is hilly to mountainous 
and is dissected by numerous streams and rivers including the Río Narcea River.  The hills are generally 
grass-covered with intermittent wooded areas.  Small-scale farming and ranching is common throughout 
the area.  As there is little industry and other sources of employment in the area, the local communities 
are supportive of continued mining operations as a source of well-paying jobs. 
 
The climate is temperate with an average  temperature of 12ºC  and about  1180 millimetres of annual 
precipitation.  The previous open-pit mining operation at El Valle was operated without difficulty year 
round,  although mining  activity  was  often  suspended  in  the  pit  bottoms  during  the  wetter months of 
January and February.

The  most  northerly  of  the  properties  is  the  Ortosa-Godán  area,  which  is  located  approximately  3 
kilometres south of the village of Salas and 40 kilometres by road from Oviedo. 
 
The Carlés deposit is about 5 kilometres southeast of Salas and 40 kilometres by road from Oviedo.  The 
deposit is located in the Municipality of Salas. 
 
National road AS-15 and the Río Narcea River both cross over Carlés deposit along the valley floor.  A 
small, portable office is located at the Carlés site that has power, telephone and internet connection.  A 
core storage warehouse  is located near the  Carlés  deposit that contains drill cores  from several other 
projects that were explored by RNGM. The elevation at Carlés varies from 100 masl at the lowest point 
on  the  Río  Narcea  to  300  masl  at  the  small  village  of  Carlés,  which  overlooks  the  deposit.    An  aerial 
photograph of the Carlés area is shown in Figure 5-2.  The direction of view is northerly, the village of 
Carlés  is  at  the  top  of  the  photo,  the  Carlés  North  pit  is  just  below  the  village,  and  the  portal  at  the 
bottom near the road.

The  La  Brueva  prospect  is  located  6  kilometres  northwest  of  the  village  of  Belmonte  and  about  50 
kilometres by road from Oviedo.  It is located in the northern part of the Municipality of Belmonte de 
Miranda.    The  prospect  is  accessed  by  a  narrow  paved  road  that  starts  from  Selviella  on  AS-227  that 
continues west to El Valle-Boinás.   
 
The El Valle-Boinás area is located in the west side of the municipality of Belmonte de Miranda and is 6 
kilometres west of the village of Belmonte.  It is 15 kilometres by road from Belmonte and 55 kilometres 
by road from Oviedo. The population of Belmonte is about 800 people.  The primary economic activity in 
the  area  is  farming,  and  the  area  is  covered  with many  small  farmsteads  and villages.   There  are  two 
small paved roads that access the property from the east from Selviella and Alvariza and another from 
the west from Tuña. The roads are narrow and curvy and cross through steep, rugged topography.  The 
two small villages of Boinás and Begega are the only villages of any size near the project.  Elevations in 
the project area range from 380 masl to 700 masl.  The aerial photograph of the El Valle-Boinás area in 
Figure 5-3 shows (clockwise from the center left) the reclaimed old tailings impoundment, the El Valle 
Pit and current tailings impoundment, the Boinás Pit (backfilled), and the underground portal (bottom 
center).  The plant and office are at the center of the photograph and the shaft is left of the left highwall 
of the reclaimed Boinás Pit.

The final access to the plant and mine offices is about 1 kilometre of improved dirt road from Boinás on 
the south and over approximately 2 kilometres of paved and dirt road from Begega on the north.  The 
main access is from the south as the north access was closed due to a pit failure.

Power, telephone and internet are available at the El Valle Mine office, which also retains the computers 
and furniture from the RNGM mining operation. Other surface buildings include the mill, warehouses, 
maintenance shops, laboratory, sample preparation and core storage including El Valle-Boinás and the 
rest of the  Río  Narcea Gold Belt  drill holes.  Ample  process water is available from dewatering of the 
Boinás East underground workings.  The tailings impoundment that was used by RNGM during its mining 
operations  was  remediated  and  being  monitored.    The  new  tailings  impoundment  was  initiated  by 
RNGM and completed by KGC in the El Valle open pit.

HISTORY
6.1
General History
Workings of the Roman era trace the length of the Río Narcea Gold Belt, which hosts the EVBC mines. 
Some  of  the  larger  Roman  workings  include  pits  at  these  mines.  The  El  Valle  and  Boinás  Roman  pits 
occur at both ends of the El Valle gold deposit and mineralized outcrops exposed in the pit walls were 
important  in  the  discovery  of  the  deposit.    Just  north  of  the  village  of  El  Valle,  the  Romans  moved 
approximately 400,000 cubic metres  of material.  One  kilometre  to the southwest,  near the village  of 
Boinás, the volume of material has been estimated at 700,000 cubic metres. 
 
Although  minor  amounts  of  gold  continued  to  be  extracted  from  the  region  through  simple  panning 
methods, little is known about the history of metal mining in the Río Narcea Gold Belt from the time the 
Romans abandoned the  area near the  end of the second century until the 19th century. Some  of the 
earliest modern mining interest in the belt is documented in public records as permits granted for iron 
exploration in the late 1800s. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, small 
copper mines were exploited at Carlés, Boinás and El Valle. During World War II, arsenopyrite was mined 
near Carlés. 
 
Modern  exploration  of  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt  began  in  the  1970s  by  Spanish  subsidiaries  of 
multinational  mining  companies.  In  1971  and  1972,  while  exploring  the  Salave  gold  deposit  60 
kilometres to the northwest near the coastal village of Tapia, Gold Fields Española, S.A. (“Gold Fields”) 
conducted preliminary reconnaissance of the area near Salas and mapped the Carlés skarn. Gold Fields’ 
work  included  soil  and  outcrop  sampling,  geochemical  analyses,  and  a  surface  magnetometer  survey. 
Boliden  Minerals  A.B.  (“Boliden”)  came  to  the  Río  Narcea  belt  through  the  Salave  route  in  1981. 
Focusing  on  the  La  Ortosa  granodiorite,  just  south  of  Salas,  Boliden  conducted  detailed  geological 
mapping  and  soil  geochemical  and  geophysical  surveys  on  a  600  metre  by  500  metre  grid  prior  to 
completing a 7-hole, 1,085 metre, core-drilling program on the La Ortosa intrusive. Boliden was followed 
by Exploraciones Mineras del Cantábrico S.A. (“EMC”) in 1985. EMC continued exploration in the area 
and drilled an additional 3 core holes for a total of 624 metres at La Ortosa and 1 hole to a depth of 346 
metres at the Godán prospect. 
 
Anglo American Company (“AAC”) initiated the  first systematic program of gold exploration in the  Río 
Narcea Gold Belt in 1985.  Focusing on skarn-related gold mineralization, AAC concentrated their initial 
work in the vicinity of the Carlés  intrusive  while  conducting exploration throughout  the belt. The first 
phase of exploration at Carlés included 1:6,000- and 1:25,000-scale aerial photography, photo geologic 
and outcrop mapping at a scale of 1:1,000, collection and geochemical analysis of 253 outcrop samples 
and 240 soil samples, completion of 1,292 metres of percussion drilling in 25 holes, and 13,147 metres 
of core drilling in 58 holes with mineralized intercepts assayed for gold, silver, copper, and arsenic. AAC's 
work also included geotechnical studies and preliminary bench metallurgical test work.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 29
By  the  end  of  1990,  AAC,  through  a  joint  venture  with  Hullas  del  Coto  Cortés,  S.A.  (“HCC”),  had 
developed 910 metres of decline for access to the +70, +40 and +18 levels, 200 metres of ore drives, and 
80 metres of raises at Carlés. Underground sampling work included the collection of 600 panel samples, 
189 channel samples, and 140 muck pile samples to determine the extent and continuity of the skarn 
mineralization in the deposit. A total of 90 samples weighing a total of 36 tonnes were sent to  Angelo 
American  Research  Laboratories  in  Johannesburg,  South  Africa  for  large-scale  metallurgical  testwork. 
The underground drilling program included a total of 6,012 metres in 108 core holes.  A feasibility study 
completed by Anglo in 1991 concluded that Carlés was a viable project. 
 
Along with its work on the Carlés project, AAC expanded the exploration program in the Río Narcea Gold 
Belt.  During  the  Carlés  exploration  and  pre-development  programs,  Anglo  and  the  Anglo/HCC  joint 
venture  mapped,  at  a  1:1000  scale,  several  of  the  Roman  pits  on  the  belt,  collected  858  samples  for 
analysis,  conducted  magnetometer  and  soil  geochemical  surveys  at  the  El  Valle  deposit  and  Godán 
prospect,  and  initiated  the  first  exploration  drilling  program  to  test  these  areas.  By  1991,  the  joint 
venture had completed a total of 8,932 metres of core drilling in 43 holes including 4,555 metres in 26 
holes at Boinás East (part of the El Valle mine), 3,474 metres in 13 core holes at El Valle and 903 metres 
in 4 core holes at the Godán prospect. 
 
Drawn  by  the  work  of  Anglo  and  HCC,  Concord  Services  Inc.  (“Concord”),  a  mining  company  from 
Denver,  Colorado,  U.S.A.,  established  the  wholly-owned  Spanish  subsidiary  Concord  Minera  Asturiana 
(“CMA”) in April, 1992 and joined Anglo and HCC to continue work on the project as operator for the 
joint  venture.  CMA  began  exploratory  drilling  on  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt  in  January,  1993  after  the 
completion  of  detailed  geological mapping  between  La  Brueva  and  Boinás  and  trenching  programs  at 
the prospects of Santa Marina, Villaverde and La Brueva. By August, 1993, CMA had completed the first 
round of drilling at El Valle and defined a zone of high-grade gold mineralization in the West Breccia over 
a strike length of 250 metres. At this time, CMA and HCC acquired Anglo's remaining interest in the joint 
venture  and  formed  Río  Narcea,  A.I.E.  (“Río  Narcea”),  a  company  registered  in  Spain,  to  hold  their 
interest in the properties and continue exploration on the Río Narcea Gold Belt. 
 
By  the  time  of  the  its  public  listing  in  July,  1994,  Río  Narcea  A.I.E.  and  the  precursor  CMA/Anglo/HCC 
joint  venture had completed an additional 9,727 metres of drilling in 50 holes in the  Río  Narcea Gold 
Belt. The exploration program included 7,090 metres in 32 holes in the El Valle deposit, 371 metres in 3 
holes at the Pontigo prospect, 577 metres in 3 holes at the Villaverde prospect, 541 metres in 4 holes at 
the  Antoñana  prospect,  and  1,148  metres  in  8  holes  at  the  La  Brueva  prospect.  Following  its  public 
listing,  Río  Narcea  commenced  an  advanced  exploration  drilling  program  at  the  El  Valle  deposit  (now 
considered to include Boinás) while continuing exploratory drilling for additional deposits along the belt. 
 
Río  Narcea  expanded  its  exploration  drilling  program  through  the  remainder  of  1994  and  1995  to 
delineate  the  mineralization  at  El  Valle,  while  continuing  to  test  targets  at  the  Villaverde,  Antoñana, 
Millara and La Brueva prospects. In August, 1995, infill drilling commenced in the West El Valle zone.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 30
Metallurgical, hydrological, geotechnical and sterilization drilling was completed on the El Valle deposit 
in  the  second  quarter  of  1996  with  infill  drilling  continuing  into  the  third  quarter  to  delineate  yet 
another zone of gold and copper mineralization referred to as the Black Skarn below the planned Boinás 
East open pit. Infill drilling for the feasibility study was completed in the West Breccia zone, the Boinás 
West  zone  and  within  the  planned  open  pit  of  the  Boinás  East  zone  at  the  end  of  August,  1996.  The 
feasibility  study  on  the  El  Valle  project  was  completed  in  October,  1996  by  MinCorp  Engineers  & 
Constructors,  a  division  of  MinCorp  Ltd.  (“MinCorp”),  based  in  Denver,  Colorado.  Infill  drilling  was 
initiated later in the year at Carlés, completing an additional 16,283 metres in 96 holes. By the end of 
1997, drill spacing on the Carlés deposit was approximately 25 metres to a depth of 100 metres below 
surface  and  a  spacing  of  50  metres  to  a  depth  of  approximately  200  metres  below  surface. 
Contemporaneous  with  this  program, mineralization in  the  form of  a  gold  skarn  was  identified  at  the 
Godán  prospect  where  an  additional  5,656  metres  were  drilled  in  17  holes  prior  to  the  end  of  1998.  
RNGM continued to explore the properties through early 2006 and drilled 38,665 metres of core holes 
during the period 2004 through 2006.

El Valle – Boinás History
In 1995 and 1996 RNGM completed the Feasibility Study for the three deposits that confirmed technical 
and  economic  feasibility  and  recommended  construction  of  an  open-pit  mine  to  exploit  the  deposits.  
The  resource  estimate  for  the  Feasibility  Study  included  8  million  tonnes  of  measured  and  indicated 
resource  with  an  average  grade  of  4.6  g/t  Au  (1.2  million  ounces)  and  2.9  million  tonnes  of  inferred 
resource  with  a  grade  of 3.7  g /t  Au (0.3  million ounces).    The  open-pit  reserve  was  estimated  as 0.7 
million ounces of gold contained in 2.2 million tonnes at 5.7 g/t Au at El Valle, 1.0 million tonnes at 4.6 
g/t Au at Boinás East, and 0.9 million tonnes at 5.0 g/t Au at Boinás West. 
 
RNGM started open-pit operations at Boinás West in 1997 with pre-stripping of overburden.  Production 
at Boinás West was 620,000 tonnes of ore averaging 5.22 g/t Au (104,000 ounces), plus 250,000 tonnes 
of low-grade mineralization averaging 1.38 g/t  Au  (11,000 ounces).  Total production from the  Boinás 
West pit was about 115,000 ounces gold mainly produced during 1998. 
 
Mining at Boinás West was followed by the Boinás East pit, which was mined in two phases during 1999 
and 2001.  590,000 tonnes with a grade of 4.03 g/t  Au and 0.37% Cu were mined in the first phase of 
Boinás East, and 622,500 tonnes averaging 5.79 g/t Au and 0.65 % Cu were mined in the second phase.  
The  total  amount  for  the  two  phases  was  1,215,000  tonnes  averaging  4.93  g/t  Au  and  0.52%  Cu. 
(192,450 ounces).  The Boinás West pit was backfilled by waste material from the Boinás East open pit 
during 1999.  After finishing the operation in Boinás East, the pit was filled with waste from the El Valle 
pit.  
 
2,760,000 tonnes of ore were mined from the El Valle Pit in multiple phases. A total of  about 600,000 
contained ounces of gold were produced from the El Valle open pit.  Production from the El Valle pit was 
significantly higher than the  Feasibility Study estimate  because  production included the Caolinas Zone 
and the high-grade Charnela Zone, which were not identified at the time of the Feasibility Study reserve 
estimate.  Mining of the El Valle pit terminated in late summer 2003.

During 2002 and 2003, a Feasibility Study for underground mining at Boinás East was completed.  A total 
of 850,000 tonnes with a grade of 4 g/t Au and 1.2 % Cu were estimated as underground reserves at that 
time.  Underground mining at Boinás East was started in 2004, and since that time 314,000 tonnes with 
grades  of  3.2  g/t  Au  and  1.0%  Cu  were  mined  out  from  the  Boinás  East  underground.    The  RNGM 
operation  was  done  using  staff  and  operating  personnel  who  were  inexperienced  in  underground 
mining,  and  RNGM  closed  the  Boinás  East  underground  in  December,  2006  because  of  continuing 
difficulties in mining sufficient ore to feed the mill at capacity and because of high mining costs and low 
grades from excessive dilution.
6.3
Carlés History
The early work at Carlés by Anglo included surface mapping, drilling, development of the decline to the 
+18 level, underground sampling in drifts and raises along the ore zone, and more detailed underground 
drilling  to  define  the  ore  zones  at  Carlés  East.    This was  followed  by  additional  surface  drilling  by  Río 
Narcea  in  1996.    Surface  mining  in  the  Carlés  North  deposit  was  started  in  late  2000  and  continued 
through  2002.    Dewatering  of  the  decline  was  started  in  2002,  followed  by  additional  underground 
drilling,  and  finally  underground  production  starting  in  late  2003.    Underground  production  at  Carlés 
continued through the end of 2006, at which time the mine was closed. 
 
A  total  of  63,852  tonnes  averaging  4.54  g/t  Au  (9,320  ounces)  and  0.78%  Cu  have  been  mined  from 
Carlés East open pit from 2000 until 2002.  A total of 147,254 tonnes of ore have been mined at Carlés 
East by underground methods averaging 5.06 g/t Au and 0.95% Cu (23,972 ounces). 
 
From  2000  to  2004  RNGM  exploited  the  upper  part  of  Carlés  North  by  open  pit.    A  total  of  241,381 
tonnes averaging 4.43 g/t Au and 0.77% Cu were mined resulting for a total production of 34,393 ounces 
of gold. 
 
Between 2003 until late in 2006, a total of 296,464 tonnes were exploited underground from Carlés East 
and  Carlés    North  averaging  5.11  g/t  Au  and  0.76%  Cu  (48,674  ounces).    The  underground  operation 
started at the +200m elevation and finished at the -10m elevation.
6.4
La Brueva History
Starting  in  late  1992  through  early  1993,  CMA  mapped  and  sampled  the  La  Brueva  surface  exposure, 
then drilled 8 reverse-circulation holes over the easternmost part of the structure.  Some years later, Río 
Narcea drilled an exploration hole (LB-9) to test the possibility of epithermal mineralization in contact 
with the Láncara Formation.  Drill hole LB-9 cut garnet-skarn mineralization anomalous in gold.  In 2000, 
RNGM and Barrick Gold carried out a joint venture to explore the Río Narcea Gold Belt outside of the El 
Valle-Boinás  and  Carlés  mine  areas.    At  La  Brueva,  the  JV  completed  a  909.45-metre  diamond  drill 
program  in  La  Brueva  that  intersected  the  structure  500  metre  to  the  east,  but  did  not  intersect 
ore-grade mineralization.

Godán – La Ortosa History
Boliden carried out an exploration program in 1981 consisting of geological mapping, geochemical soil 
sampling, geophysical exploration (IP, EM) and 7 drill holes.  From 1985 to 1986 Exploraciones Mineras 
del Cantábrico SA drilled three new holes into the Ortosa stock.  Between 1986 and 1990 Anglo created 
a new interpretation of the geology and drilled 4 holes.  From 1996 to the end of 2006, RNGM explored 
the property compiling all the data and drilling 3653.30 metres of core holes.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION
7.1
Regional Setting
The Río Narcea Gold Belt is located in the western portion of the Cantabrian Zone in the northwestern 
part of the Hercynian-age Iberian Massif, as shown  in Figure 7-1.  The  Cantabrian Zone  is the  eastern 
foreland area that transitions to the west through the West Asturian-Leonese Zone toward the internal 
zones of the Hercynian orogenic belt.  The Cantabrian Zone and the nearby West Asturian-Leonese Zone 
consist of a stratigraphic section of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that range in age from Middle Cambrian 
to Permian. Extensive early broad-scale folding and thrusting, and then normal faulting are common in 
the  region,  and  intrusions  of  Hercynian  and  later  age  have  invaded  the  sedimentary  package. 
Post-dating  the  igneous  intrusions  are  high-angle  normal  faults  that  in  turn  predate  Tertiary 
sedimentation.  The geologic situation is further complicated by Alpine thrusting, which may move older 
rocks over the Tertiary sediments and may also displace mineralization. 
 
The Iberian Massif represents the westernmost exposures of the European Variscides, which are a series 
of mountains and hills formed by the plate-tectonic collision between Laurasia and Gondwana to form 
Pangea. They make  up the southwestern limb of the arc formed by this chain in  Western Europe and 
represent  the  largest  exposure  of  pre-Permian  rocks  within  the  Iberian  Peninsula.    The  Variscan  Belt 
found in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula has been divided into four zones (Julivert et al., 1972; Farias 
et al., 1987). From east to west they include: the Cantabrian Zone, the West Asturian-Leonese Zone, the 
Central Iberian Zone, and the Galicia-Trâs-os-Montes Zone.

7.1.1  Regional Geology of the Cantabrian Zone
The project area is located along and near the western margin of the Cantabrian Zone.  The Cantabrian 
Zone is a typical foreland thrust belt with an arcuate shape. It is characterized by an unmetamorphosed, 
3,500-metre  thick  sedimentary  succession  that  includes  a  pre-orogenic  pre-Carboniferous  Paleozoic 
sequence, with clastic and carbonate sediments of shallow-water platform facies resting unconformably 
on upper Proterozoic turbidite facies deposits. The Carboniferous section corresponds to a synorogenic 
clastic sequence in the Upper Carboniferous. 
 
The  West  Asturian-Leonese  Zone,  located  west  of  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt,  consists  of  a  nearly 
continuous  series  of  siliciclastic  rocks.  Approximately  11,000  metres  of  these  Cambrian  through 
Ordovician sediments have been subjected to intense deformation. 
 
The Variscan Orogeny gave rise to superficial thrust sheets with associated structures, especially folds. 
The deformation took place under shallow crustal conditions without metamorphism. 
 
Prior  to  Tertiary  redbed  sedimentation  and  westward-verging  Alpine  thrusting,  late  Hercynian  normal 
faulting, along which faults dykes intruded, affected the Paleozoic rocks.
7.1.2  Stratigraphy of the Cantabrian Zone
The project area is underlain mainly by Lower Paleozoic rocks and unconformably overlain in places by 
Tertiary sediments that fill a northeast-oriented channel eroded along the Río Narcea fracture system.  
The  lower  stratigraphic  section  of  the  Cantabrian  Zone  includes  the  Láncara  Formation  (Cambrian 
limestone), which is underlain by Cambrian feldspathic sandstone. The limestone has a total thickness of 
some  250  metres  and  constitutes  the  principal  host  rock  for  gold  and  copper  mineralization  at  El 
Valle-Boinás. 
 
The  Upper  Cambrian  Barrios  Formation  and  Ordovician  Oville  Formation  orthoquartzites  overlie  the 
earlier  Cambrian  rocks.    The  Ordovician  section  is  overlain  by  about  1,500  metres  of  carbonate  and 
clastic  rocks  (mostly  shales)  that  represent  the  Silurian,  Devonian  and  Lower  Carboniferous  in  the 
region. About 100-300 metres of black shale (Lower Silurian Formigoso Formation) is overlain by 80 to 
200  metres  of  ferruginous  intertidal  to  marginal  marine  sandstone  (Middle-Upper  Silurian  Furada 
Formation),  which  constitutes  the  main  host  rock  for  gold mineralization  at  the  Ortosa  deposit  in  the 
north part of the Roi Narcea Gold Belt. 
 
Devonian  stratigraphy  in  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt  is  represented  by  some  1,250  metres  of  limestone 
with interbedded sandstone and shale that comprises the Rañeces Series. This unit is the host for skarn 
gold-copper mineralization at the Carlés deposit. 
 
During  the  Carboniferous,  synorogenic  sedimentation  began  with  deposition  of  conglomerate  and 
finished  with  coal  beds.    The  sedimentation  took  place  in  small  basins  formed  during  the  tectonic 
deformation related to the Variscan Orogeny. 
 
Upper  Eocene-Lower  Oligocene  alluvial  sediments  cover  nearly  all  of  the  mineralized  section  in  a 
topographic  depression  along  the  Río  Narcea  fracture  system.  These  sediments  lie  on  an  erosional 
unconformity above the Paleozoic bedrock and reach a maximum thickness of 130 metres.

7.1.3  Structure of the Cantabrian Zone
The  Variscan  Orogeny  (Mid-Devonian  to  Lower  Carboniferous  age)  is  responsible  for  the  current 
structural  characteristics  of  the  Cantabrian  Zone.    Orogenic  events  took  place  under  shallow  crustal 
conditions and gave rise to superficial thrust sheets (with a thin-skinned geometry) having practically no 
internal deformation.  The project area is located in the western part of the Cantabrian Zone, called the 
Somiedo Unit, which is made up of four minor stair-like thrusts. The lowest thrust unit is located below 
the Láncara Formation. 
 
Later  extensional  events  caused  normal  faults  that  controlled  the  emplacement  of  intrusions  and 
provided conduits for metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids. 
 
The latest tectonic event was the Alpine Orogeny of Tertiary age, which caused reactivation of existing 
structures  (economically  this  event  was  important  because  it  caused  mineral  remobilization  and  local 
enrichment).    Also  slices  of  the  Paleozoic  section  were  thrust  westward  in  places  over  Tertiary 
sediments.  The overthrusted Paleozoic section together with the Tertiary sediments hide much of the 
mineralized bedrock in all but a few valleys along the Río Narcea Gold Belt.
7.1.4
Igneous Rocks of the Cantabrian Zone
Igneous activity took place at different times in the Cantabrian Zone. Minor volcanism took place during 
the Upper Cambrian.  Sediments of the Oville Formation are interbedded with several flows and sills of 
basalt and trachyte. 
 
Intrusive  activity  began  during  the  late  stages  of  the  Hercynian  orogeny  and  continued  intermittently 
until  the  end of  the  Paleozoic.  The  NE-SW oriented fault  system  formed  during  the  extensional  event 
created preferential sites for post-orogenic, calc-alkaline intrusions, which produced skarn and hornfels 
in  contact  with  carbonate  and  non-carbonate  rocks,  respectively.  Gold  and  copper  mineralization  is 
directly associated with the hydrothermal events resulting from the intrusions.
7.2
Geology of the Río Narcea Gold Belt
The Río Narcea Gold Belt is located in the western part of the Cantabrian Zone.  It is a 45-kilometre long 
and up to 4-kilometre wide northeast-trending zone that is characterized by the  alignment of mineral 
occurrences,  Paleozoic  sediments,  Tertiary  basins,  fracture  zones,  and  igneous  intrusions;  numerous 
Roman workings are located along its length. 
 
The 15-kilometre long central zone between Salas to the north and Boinás in the south contains up to 11 
gold  zones,  from  north  to  south:  Ortosa,  Godán,  Carlés,  La  Brueva,  Pando,  Pepito,  Antonaña, 
Villaverde-Pontigo, Mari Luz, Santa Marina and El Valle-Boinás, as shown in Figure 7-2. 
 
The Río Narcea Gold Belt consists of a highly fractured zone, trending north-northeast, that crosscuts a 
section  of  Paleozoic  sedimentary  rocks  ranging  from  carbonate  to  clastic  in  composition  and  from 
Middle Cambrian to Permian in age.  On a regional scale, these  rocks have been thrusted and folded, 
showing  a  north-northeasterly  regional  trend,  and  have  been  intruded  by  several  stages  of  late 
Hercynian igneous rocks.

P a g e  | 37
High-angle faults, striking mainly subparallel to the regional NNE trend of the older structures, predate 
the igneous intrusions and the Tertiary continental sediments, which partly cover an anticlinal axis zone 
along the southern portion of the Río Narcea Gold Belt.  From Boinás-El Valle in the south to La Brueva 
further to the north, the Río Narcea Gold Belt coincides with the axis of the Río Narcea anticline.  North 
of  La  Brueva,  however,  the  belt  is  truncated  resulting  in  a  north-northwest  trend,  as  shown  with  the 
alignment of Carlés and La Ortosa gold deposits. 
 
The Tertiary Alpine Orogeny caused reactivation of older structures in the southern part of the belt and 
resulted in thrusting that has been found to cut and displace some mineralization. 
 
Gold mineralization in the Río Narcea Gold Belt consists mainly of two types:
•
•
Gold-bearing copper skarn: related to the interaction between late Hercynian intrusions, 
mesothermal  solutions,  and  carbonate  host  rocks.  This  is  the  primary  type  of  gold 
deposit that may be affected by later events (favorable host rocks for skarn include the 
Láncara Formation at El Valle-Boinás and the Rañeces Group Formation at Carlés).
Jasperoid  type:  related  to  subvolcanic  dykes  and  epithermal  solutions  which  cause 
silicification  with  argillization  and  sericitization,  plus  epigenetic,  hypogene  oxidation.  
This  type  of  mineralization  may  overprint,  remobilize,  and  enrich  gold  mineralization 
within  the  skarn  deposits,  as  happened  at  El  Valle/Boinás.    Also,  this  can  form  the 
breccia-style gold mineralization that produced higher grades at El Valle/Bionás.  Limited 
to structural zones of varying width, they dip at high angles.  They are typically the sites 
of leaching and enrichment that extend as much as 400 metres below the surface.
7.2.1  Stratigraphy of the Río Narcea Gold Belt
The stratigraphic section for the Río Narcea Gold Belt and the Cantabrian Zone is shown in Figure 7-3.
7.2.1.1  Cambro-Ordovician
The  Paleozoic  sedimentary  section  consists  of  the  basal  Láncara  Formation, the  Oville  Formation,  and 
the overlying Barrios Formation. 
 
Láncara Formation 
 
The core of the Río Narcea anticline in this area contains the Láncara Formation, which is Lower-Middle 
Cambrian and 100-225 metres thick,  but  may be  up to 450 metres  thick  where it is thrust  over itself.  
This  unit  is  economically  important  because  the  limestones  and  dolomites  are  the  most  favorable 
stratigraphic  hosts  for  gold-copper  mineralization  at  the  El  Valle-Boinás  deposits.    They  consist  of  a 
lower  organic-rich  dolomite  and  an  upper  limestone  member  that  is  topped  by  a  red  fossiliferous 
limestone  about  15  metres  thick.    The  dolomite  is  generally  the  better  host  for  gold-copper 
mineralization.

P a g e  | 38
Oville Formation 
 
The Upper Cambrian Oville  Formation consists of interbedded shales and sandstones  with an average 
thickness of 800 metres. In the El Valle-Boinás area, shale beds predominate whereas in the upper part 
of the formation the percentage of sandstone increases. 
 
In  places,  sub-economic  gold-bearing  hornfels  can  be  found  in  the  Oville  Formation  near  intrusive 
contacts where the shale or sandstone has been subjected to contact metamorphism. 
 
Barrios Formation 
 
The  BarRíos  Formation  of  late  Cambrian  through  Ordovician  age  is  a  prominent,  cliff-forming  white 
orthoquartzite some 700 metres thick. It contains interbeds of shale and locally kaolin.
7.2.1.2  Silurian and Devonian (from Spiering, et al. 2000)
Along the northern and eastern flanks of the Río Narcea anticline, the Ordovician section is overlain by 
approximately 1,500 metres of carbonates and clastics that represent the Silurian, Devonian, and early 
Carboniferous deposition in the region. 
 
The Silurian section conformably overlies a depositional hiatus at the top of the Ordovician. The section 
is represented by 100-300 metres of black shale belonging to the Lower Silurian Formigoso Formation, 
which is overlain by 80-200 metres of ferruginous intertidal to marginal marine sandstone belonging to 
the Middle-Upper Silurian Furada Formation.  The Furada Formation constitutes the main host rock for 
gold mineralization at the Ortosa and Pando prospects.

P a g e  | 40
The Devonian stratigraphic record is represented in the Río Narcea belt by approximately 1,250 metres 
of  limestone  with  interbedded  sandstone  and  shale  that  comprise  the  Rañeces  Series.  Acting  as  the 
principal  host  for  skarn  mineralization  at  the  Carlés  deposit,  the  lower  Devonian  Nueva  Formation 
limestone forms the basal formation of the series with a local thickness of 250 metres. The succeeding 
series  includes  400  metres  of  sandstone  and  slate  of  the  Naranco  Formation,  and  an  additional  200 
metres of limestone and slate of the Candas Formation and nearly 400 metres of ferruginous sandstone 
and quartzite of the Piñeres Formation.
7.2.1.3  Tertiary Sediments
Upper Eocene-Lower Oligocene alluvial sediments cover nearly all of the mineralized section along the 
Río Narcea anticline in a topographic depression that was eroded along the Río Narcea fracture system. 
At  El  Valle-Boinás,  the  Tertiary  sediments  lay  on  a  near  planar  erosional  unconformity  above  the 
Paleozoic bedrock at the 510-metre level and reach a maximum thickness of 130 metres near the toe of 
an Alpine thrust. The section consists of a basal conglomerate ranging from 1 to 10 metres in thickness, 
(in places containing clasts of mineralized jasperoid), followed by a zone of sand and clayey sand with 
interbedded  conglomerates  that  are  overlain  by  a  marley  clay  zone.  This  sequence  is  repeated  in  the 
thicker sections and capped with a light-gray calcareous unit. Based on rodent teeth found in thin clay 
zones, the sequence has been assigned an age of 34-36 million years corresponding to the Upper Eocene 
– Lower Oligocene.  The sediments were deposited as coalescing alluvial fans that evolved upward into a 
system of sandy  alluvial flats  and formed caliche horizons in arid times  and calcareous micrites  under 
later lacustrine conditions.
7.2.2  Structure of the Río Narcea Gold Belt
A regional unconformity truncates the Upper Devonian section where small outcrops of sandstone and 
conglomerates  represent  the  remnants  of  a  thick  Carboniferous  section  that  developed  toward  the 
center of the sedimentary basin to form the coal-producing region of central and eastern Asturias.  The 
unconformity reflects the Hercynian Orogeny which thrusted, folded and faulted the Paleozoic section 
giving rise to the formation of the northeast-trending Courio anticline and the Cornellana and Leiguarda 
synclines (Pérez Estaún and Bastida, 1990). 
 
The  history  of  deformation  in  the  N20°E-trending  Río  Narcea  anticline  is  more  complex  and extensive 
than apparent in the flanking synclines. This anticline is overturned to the northwest and the axial plane 
dips 45-70° to the southeast. The structure is affected by a number of relatively low-angle reverse faults 
that  produced  strong  brecciation  and  a  structurally  prepared  host  rock  especially  at  the  contact 
between  the  siliciclastic  Oville  Formation  and  the  carbonate  rocks  of  the  Láncara  Formation. 
Reactivation  of  the  northeast-trending  fault  structure  during  an  extensive  period  of  erosion  was 
accompanied by hydrothermal activity occurring periodically through the end of the Paleozoic. 
 
During  the  Mesozoic,  the  region  underwent  extensive  periods  of  uplift,  erosion,  normal  faulting  and 
fault reactivation along northeast, northwest and east-west trends as the region adjusted to the opening 
of  the  Cantabrian  Sea  during  late  Triassic  to  early  Cretaceous  time.  Streams  carved  valleys  along  the 
older mineralized fracture systems, forming a northeast-trending ridge  along the east flank  of the  Río 
Narcea  anticline.  The  overthrusted  Paleozoic  section  together  with  the  underlying  Tertiary  sediments, 
hide the mineralized bedrock in all but a few recent valleys and Roman pits along the gold belt.

7.2.3
Igneous Rocks of the Salas-Belmonte Group
important,
Several  Upper  Carboniferous  intrusive  igneous  rocks  are  known  along  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt.  The 
most 
from  north  to  south,  are  the  Ortosa-Godán,  Carlés,  Pando,  La  Brueva, 
Villaverde-Pontigo and El Valle-Boinás intrusives. 
 
They  consist  mainly  of  stocks  whose  compositions  include  gabbros,  diorites,  granodiorites,  quartz 
monzonites  and  monzogranites  (Corretge  et  al.,  1970;  Martin-Izard,  et  al.,  2000).  Late  rhyolite  and 
andesite subvolcanic porphyry dykes also are present throughout the Río Narcea Gold Belt, especially in 
the vicinity of El Valle-Boinás. 
 
The Ortosa-Godán stock is located at the northwestern part of the Río Narcea Gold Belt.  This intrusion is 
emplaced  at  the  contact  between  the  Rañeces  Formation  (Devonian)  and  the  Furada  Formation 
(Silurian).  It  covers  an  area  of  one  square  kilometre  and  it  intruded  along  NW-SE-striking  structures 
mainly  as  dykes  and  sills  of  quartz-monzodiorite.    Based  on  U-Pb  in  monazite,  a  297  +/-  6  Ma 
(Valverde-Vaquero, et al., 1999) age was determined, which may be an age of retrograde alteration and 
silicification. 
 
The Carlés stock, which measures 700 metres x 700 metres, has been emplaced between the Rañeces 
and Furada Formations.  It is a monzogranite.  Adjacent to the northern part of the intrusion, the Carlés 
skarn  is  developed  in  carbonates  of  the  Rañeces  Formation.    Adjacent  to  the  southern  part,  at  the 
contact with Furada Formation, hornfels developed with some narrow skarn zones related to carbonate 
rocks interbedded within the siliciclastic units.  The Carlés intrusion yielded an age of 305 +/-6 Ma (Sole 
et al, 1995) from biotite using K-Ar methods, which may be an age of retrograde alteration. 
 
The  La  Brueva  quartz-monzonite  intrusion,  approximately  500  metres  x  500  metres,  is  located  in  the 
northern part of the Río Narcea anticline. Based on U-Pb methods from a zircon, an age of 293 +/- 3 Ma 
was  determined  (Valverde-Vaquero,  et  al.,  1999).    The  stock  intruded  between  the  Oville  and  Barrios 
Formations and for that reason there is no skarn at surface related to this intrusion.  At depth, RNGM 
drilled a hole (LB-9) that cut garnet skarn that may be related to an interbedded carbonate horizon. 
 
The  Villaverde  quartz-monzonite 
the  main 
northeast-trending trend.  It is located in the core of the Río Narcea anticline and intrudes the Láncara 
and  Oville  Formations.    Its  age  is  probably  the  same  as  that  determined  for  the  La  Brueva  intrusion.  
Narrow skarn is developed at its contact with the Láncara Formation. 
 
The  Mari  Luz  system  of  porphyry  sills  and  dykes  has  been  mapped  1,000  metres  east  of  Villaverde.  
Epithermal mineralization is associated with these intrusives. 
 
The El Valle-Boinás stock is located at the southern end of the Río Narcea Gold Belt.  This intrusion was 
formed  by  two  main  events.    The  first  is  a  biotite-rich  granite  intrusion,  which  consists  of  an  initial 
equigranular  quartz  monzonite  phase.    The  second  was  a  porphyritic  monzogranite.    The  granite 
intruded  along  northeast-trending  structures  and  it  widens  at  the  intersection  between  NE-  and 
NW-striking faults.  Its age is 303 +/- 6 Ma based on K-Ar methods from biotite, which age may reflect 
retrograde  alteration  and  silicification  (Martin-Izard,  et  al.,  1999).    Skarn  mineralization  is  associated 
with the granite intrusion.

P a g e  | 42
The granite was followed by the intrusion of quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes that crosscut all lithologies.  
Their age is 285+/-6 Ma based on K-Ar methods from sericite.  Epithermal mineralization is associated 
with  the  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  dyke  event  and  the  suggestion  is  that  this  mineralization  is 
synchronous  with  dyke  emplacement.    The  last  magmatic  event  in  the  El  Valle-Boinás  area  was  the 
intrusion  of  diabase  dykes  crosscutting  all  previous  lithologies.  K-Ar  dterminations  on  sericite  yielded 
255 +/- 6 Ma (Martin-Izard, et al., 1999).  Gold mineralization is not associated with the diabase dykes.
7.2.4  Metamorphism in the Río Narcea Gold Belt
Metamorphism in the RNGB is related only  to intrusion of the igneous rocks, which produced contact 
metamorphism  in  the  sedimentary  rocks.    They  produce  hornfels  in  the  clastic  units  and  skarn  in  the 
carbonate units.
7.3  Mineralization – El Valle – Boinás Area
The  El  Valle-Boinás  copper-gold  deposit  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Río  Narcea  Gold  Belt 
within the  Cantabrian Zone.  It is actually  a group of several significant  deposits related to the Boinás 
granitic intrusive and carbonate rocks of the Láncara Formation (Cambrian age), as shown in Figure 7-4. 
 
The gold mineralization system has a strike length of 2 kilometres and a width of at least 0.5 kilometres.  
The  intrusive  is  elongated  trending  N35E  with  a  length  of  500  metres,  its  average  thickness  is  300 
metres.    A  copper-gold  mesothermal  skarn  was  developed  mainly  along  the  contact  between  the 
igneous rock and the carbonate unit. 
 
Late  reactivation  of  the  main  NE-trending  fracture  system  was  accompanied  by  2  or  more  phases  of 
epithermal mineralization as well as the intrusion of porphyry dykes. These events produced hypogene 
oxidation with further enrichment of gold, arsenic, antimony and mercury (Martin-Izard, et al., 1999).  .   
 
Rhyodacite  dykes,  which  are  always  sericitized,  were  emplaced  along  fractures  and  breccia  zones 
trending NNE. 
 
The  intense  silicification  along  fractures  and  breccia  zones  resulted  in  the  formation  of  hematitic 
jasperoid that is characterized by enrichment in gold, arsenic, antimony and mercury. 
 
The  presence  of  cuprite  and  native  copper  in  the  structures  and  breccias  suggests  the  leaching  of 
chalcocite;  indeed,  chalcocite  is  encountered  at  approximately  400  metres  depth  along  the  A107 
structure.  This can be viewed as evidence of 2-cycle leaching and enrichment.

7.3.1  Boinás West
Boinás West was mined in 1997-98 and the pit has now been backfilled with waste from the Boinás East 
open pit.  Production totaled 115,000 ounces of gold in 868,000 tonnes of ore that averaged 4.9 g/t Au 
and 0.36% Cu. 
 
Boinás West was located on the west side of the main intrusive body.  It was a tabular-shaped zone of 
mineralized  calcic  skarn  developed  on  the  contact  of  the  Boinás  porphyritic  granite  with  a  thin  (30 
metres) block of limestones of the Láncara Formation.  The footwall was hornfels formed from contact 
metamorphism  of  the  Oville  Formation.    The  ore  body  measured 250 metres  long  by 50 metres  wide 
with a vertical continuity of around 100 metres.  The deposit was covered by an average thickness of 40 
metres  of  Tertiary  sediments.    A  typical  cross-section  through  the  Boinás  West  deposit  is  shown  in 
Figure 7-5. 
 
The skarn was a pyroxene skarn, consisting of hedenbergite with some irregular bands of garnet skarn 
and irregular layers of wollastonite. 
 
Where retrograded, the Boinás West skarn consists of epidote, quartz, calcite, magnetite and sulphides 
including  pyrite,  arsenopyrite  and  chalcopyrite.    Most  of  the  retrograde  skarn  was  controlled  by 
NE-trending fracture systems. 
 
The  intrusive  and  the  calcic  skarn  were  cut  by  a  N60°E  to  N70E  steeply-dipping  fracture  system  that 
controlled the emplacement of Permian subvolcanic andesitic to rhyolitic porphyry dykes.  Subsequent 
low-temperature hydrothermal alteration caused silicification and oxidation (Martin-Izard, et al., 1999).  
The width of the porphyry dykes varies from a few centimetres to 1.5 metres.  There are up to 6 sets of 
dykes associated with the development of jasperoids and jasperoid breccias ranging in thickness from a 
few centimetres to 20 metres of oxide material. 
 
Leaching  of  the  chalcopyrite,  bornite,  pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  and  electrum  formed  chalcocite  whose 
subsequent leaching formed native copper and native gold. 
 
Late post-mineral Permian subvolcanic diabase dykes crosscut the body and are barren.

7.3.2  Boinás East
Boinás  East  is  a  group  of  several ore  zones  located  along  the  contact  of  the  southeastern  part of  the 
Boinás intrusive. 
 
Boinás  East  was  mined  in  two  phases  during  1999  and  2001;  after  that,  the  open  pit  was  filled  with 
waste material from the El Valle pit.  590,000 tonnes averaging 4.03 g/t Au and 0.37% Cu were mined in 
the first phase.  622,500 tonnes averaging 5.79 g/t Au and 0.66 % Cu were mined in the second phase.  
Total production was 192,450 ounces of gold. 
 
Skarn Mineralization-Southern Part of Boinás East 
 
The  Boinás  East  zone  is  located  along  the  southeastern  contact  of  the  main  Boinás  intrusion.    The 
southern and southeastern part of the intrusion is a porphyritic granite in contact with limestones of the 
Láncara Formation.  A calcic skarn has developed along this contact, which trends N35 E and is 30 metres 
wide,  250  metres  long,  and  has  a  known  vertical  extent  of  400  metres.    At  depth,  this  skarn  wraps 
continuously around the south edge of the intrusive and connects with the Boinás South skarn. 
 
Prograde  calcic  skarn  consists  of  garnet,  pyroxene (hedenbergite)  and  wollastonite.    Retrograde  calcic 
skarn consists of epidote, quartz, calcite, magnetite, amphibole, potassic feldspar, chlorite and sulphides 
(pyrite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite). 
 
The upper part of this zone was mined in the open pit, but most of the mineralization in the calcic skarn 
is not considered ore. 
 
Skarn Mineralization-Mónica Zone (Boinás East) 
 
As one moves north along the granite contact, the granite changes from porphyritic to equigranular and 
the  orientation  of  the  contact  between  the  granite  and  Láncara  Formation  dip  changes  almost  90 
degrees  from  N35 E  to  N60 W.    A  calcic  skarn  related  to  the  limestone  unit  of  the  Láncara  developed 
along the upper part of this contact, and a magnesian skarn has developed along the lower part of the 
contact  where  the  formation  is  dolomitic.    The  mineralized  skarn  block  trends  NW  and  is  up  to  40 
metres wide, 350 metres long and has a vertical extent of at least 400 metres, and is called the Mónica 
Zone.    It  is  open  at  depth  although  discontinuous  hornfels  have  been  intersected  at  depth  that  may 
indicate the bottom of the carbonate sequence is not much deeper. 
 
Initial mineralogy in the magnesian skarn consists of forsterite and some  diopside.  It is graphite  rich, 
reflecting  metasomatism  of  the  organic  matter.    Retrograde  alteration  of  the  magnesian  skarn  is 
characterized  by  abundant  serpentine,  tremolite,  phlogopite,  chlorite  and  carbonates  with  potassium 
feldspar.    Mineralization  in  the  retrograde  skarn  consists  of  magnetite,  pyrrhotite,  arsenopyrite, 
chalcopyrite,  bornite,  bimuthinite  and  electrum.    The  geochemistry  of  the  magnesium  skarn  is 
characterized by strongly anomalous Au, Ag and Cu and weakly anomalous Bi and Te. 
 
The upper parts of the Mónica Zone (Figure 7-6) have been oxidized and have formed jasperoids with 
low-temperature  gold  mineralization  (Martin-Izard,  et  al.,  1999). 
  The  epithermal  events  are 
characterized  by  sericitization,  silicification,  argillization  and  carbonatization  accompanied  by  quartz, 
adularia  and  carbonate  veins.    Mineralization  is  characterized  by  native  gold  and  native  copper  with 
minor oxide copper.

P a g e  | 47
Some  narrow,  high-angle epithermal structures (5 to 50 centimetres wide), striking N40 E crosscut the 
Mónica  Zone  developing  fine-grained  quartz-pyrite  and  hematite  mineralization.    Gold  grades  are 
somewhat higher in skarns in contact with epithermal structures. 
 
The Boinás East open pit mined the Mónica Zone down to an elevation of 345 masl.  At this level, 90% of 
the ore consisted of oxide material and 10% was related to skarn-related sulphide mineralization.  Below 
this level, 160,000 tonnes were exploited by underground mining; some material classified as a resource 
remains.  The oxide material decreases gradually with depth disappearing at 300 metres elevation.

High Angle 1 and High Angle 2 
 
Epithermal gold mineralization in two high-angle faults, called HA1 and HA2, is related to N40°E-striking 
pre-mineral faults that provided conduits for injection of the Permian subvolcanic porphyritic dykes into 
the  carbonate  units.    The  zones  are  marked  by  intense  silicification,  argillization,  sericitization  and 
carbonatization accompanied by quartz, adularia and carbonate veins.  The porphyry dykes in HA1 and 
HA2 have been altered by hydrothermal fluids and broken by movement along the faults and are now 
observed  only  as  altered,  sericitized  fragments  in  core.    Hypogene  oxidation  is  marked  by  high  gold, 
arsenic, antimony, and mercury mineralization (Martin-Izard, et al., 1999).   
 
Gold  mineralization  in  the  fractured  zones  occurs  over  an  approximate  five  metre  width.    The  zones 
contain little jasperoid, but do contain abundant clays resulting from hydrothermal and tectonic events 
along the structures. 
 
Around 25% of HA1 was exploited by open pit and the remainder is part of the current gold resource.  
No material was removed from the HA2 zone. 
 
These structures remain open at depth. 
 
A typical section through the HA1 and HA2 zones is shown in Figure 7-7.

7.3.3  El Valle
There  are  five  main  areas  of  mineralization  in  the  El  Valle  area  that  are  called  the  El  Valle  Fault,  the 
A107, the Charnela Zone, the Black Skarn North and the Caolinas Zone.  In addition, there is significant 
mineralization in patchy, irregular bodies of jasperoid breccia and oxidized skarn throughout the El Valle 
pit area. 
 
El Valle Fault and Area 107 
 
The El Valle Fault Zone is a single structure that strikes north-south in the northern part of the El Valle 
pit, turns S55W in the central part, and finally turns to the southeast in the south as it exits the pit area.  
The  zone  that  dips  75º  to  the  east  and  is  10  metres  wide  in  the  northern  and  southern  part  of  the 
structure and it is 35 metres wide in the central part.  The widest parts of the zone measure up to 50 
metres.  A typical cross-section through the El Valle Fault Zone is shown in Figure 7-8. 
 
The  El  Valle  Fault  Zone  is  composed  of  jasperoids,  jasperoid  breccias,  polymictic  breccias  and  several 
sets of porphyry dykes.  Deformation is more significant in the northern and southern parts than in the 
central part where the open spaces were filled by intrusions of subvolcanic dykes. In some areas, blocks 
of garnet skarn and intrusive rocks are found in the zone, suggesting that it was originally composed of 
skarn materials. 
 
The El Valle Fault Zone was exploited in the El Valle open pit from 510 masl in the upper part (Tertiary 
contact) to 410 masl in the lower part.  Over 600,000 ounces of high-grade gold have been mined out in 
this structure by open-pit methods. 
 
The  structure  is open  to  the  north  where  the  Santa  Marina  project  is  located.    In  this  project,  RNGM 
intercepted the structure with interesting results (SM 5 intercepted 6.62 g/t Au over 9.70 metres).  To 
the southeast, the El Valle fault is called A107 because it was hole 107 that discovered the continuity of 
the structure to the southeast (Figure 7-1).  A107 is important economically as it is host to high-grade 
gold that can be extracted by underground methods. 
 
The  El  Valle  structure  is  also  open  at  depth  where  some  resources  could  not  be  mined  by  open  pit 
because of high stripping ratios.  The zone remains an important target for underground production.

Charnela Zone and Charnela South 
 
The Charnela Zone is located in the south part of El Valle pit.  It was discovered in 1999 while drilling to 
test the extension of ore zones in the open pit.  The discovery hole (Val-139) intersected 56.4 metrres 
averaging 38.4 g/t Au. 
 
This subvertical structure has a strike length of 125 metres, a height of 90 metres and average width of 
15 metres.  It strikes N35E and was bounded on both the top and bottom by Alpine thrust faults.  The 
zone was composed of oxidized garnet skarn and jasperoids in a clay matrix.  Altered porphyries were 
also present and are closely related to the gold mineralization.  The bottom benches in the pit showed 
fresh epithermal pyrite confirming the Charnela as an epithermal event. 
 
Over 300,000 tonnes containing more than 150,000 ounces of gold were mined out in this area. 
 
The  mineralization  disappears  at  370  masl  and  was  probably  truncated  by  an  Alpine  thrust.    Thus, 
further exploration was done to find the extension of the zone and, in 2001, drilling intersected the zone 
at 325 masl.  This new zone is now known as the Charnela South Zone.  A typical section through the 
Charnela Zone is shown in Figure 7-9. 
 
Black Skarn North 
 
The Black Skarn North Zone consists of copper-gold mineralization in magnesian skarn that lies on the 
contact  of  dolomitic  rocks  with  the  north  and  northeast  side  of  the  equigranular  Boinás  intrusive.  
Mineralization appears to be very similar to the Boinás East mineralization.  The Black Skarn North Zone 
lies just south and east of the Charnela South Zone. 
 
San Martín 
 
The San Martín Zone is the southern extension of the Black Skarn North Zone (Figures 7-1, 7-10).  It is a 
magnesian  skarn  that  generally  carries  higher  grades  of  gold  and  copper  than  the  Black  Skarn  North 
Zone, especially where it is intersected by the A107 epithermal mineralization 
 
Black Skarn Northwest 
 
The  Black  Skarn  Northwest  Zone  consists  of  magnesian  and  calcic  skarn  that  is  intersected  by 
subvertical, jasperoid-bearing structures with epithermal mineralization (Figure 7-10).  It is an extension 
of  the  Black  Skarn  North  Zone  as  the  skarn  mineralization  wraps  around  the  causative  intrusion;  it  is 
bound by Boinás West to the south. Recent drilling intercepted values of economic interest and the area 
will be subject of further drilling in order to delineate more resources. 
 
S107 
 
The  S107  subvertical,  jasperoid-bearing  structure  was  encountered  during  Orvana’s  2010  drilling 
campaign  (Figure  7-1).    The  intent  of  the  drilling  in  this  area  was  to  define  the  extension  of  the  San 
Martín  skarn  mineralization.    Although  no  additional  skarn  mineralization  was  discovered,  the  S107 
structure hosts economic grades of gold that is included in the resource estimates.

East Breccia Zone 
 
The East Breccia Zone is composed of two small units of oxidized, breccia-style mineralization that are 
located east of the El Valle Fault zone.

Caolinas Zone 
 
The Caolinas Zone was a zone of very altered, oxidized, and kaolinized rock in the northwest corner of 
the  El  Valle  pit.    High-grade  ore  in  this  zone  was  associated  with  some  narrow  porphyry  dykes.  
Mineralization was subvertical and had a strike of N35E. 
 
Almost 150,000 tonnes were mined out in this zone averaging 10.1 grams per tonne yielding over 50,000 
ounces of gold. 
 
The area was eroded and covered by Tertiary sediments in the upper part and faulted in the lower part.  
It appears that the Caolinas zone may be the upper part of the Charnela Zone that was displaced to the 
northwest by the Alpine thrust. 
 
Other “irregular areas” 
 
Between  the  El  Valle  Fault  Zone  on  the  east  and  the  Caolinas  and  Charnela  Zones  on  the  west, there 
were several small irregular bodies located inside, below, and at the contact of the main equigranular 
intrusive.

P a g e  | 56
Most  of  the  gold  mineralization  was  hosted  in  polymictic  breccias  composed  of  jasperoids,  oxidized 
garnet skarn, and fragments of intrusive rock in a clay matrix.  Due to extensive faulting the distribution 
of these gold zones was very irregular.
7.4
Carlés Deposit
The Carlés gold deposit is a gold- and -copper bearing skarn developed predominantly in the Devonian 
limestones  of  the  lower  portion  of  the  Rañeces  Formation  along  the  north  margin  of  the  Carlés 
granodiorite (Corretge et al, 1970), as shown in Figure 7-11.  The Carlés intrusion is more or less circular 
in plan with a diameter of about 750 metres.  The intrusion is located at the intersection of major faults 
(E-W, NE-SW and SE-NW) and it is bisected from west to east by the Río Narcea River.  The northern part 
of  the  granodiorite  is  in  contact  with  the  lower  part  of  Rañeces  Formation  and  the  south  part  of  the 
intrusion is in contact with the siliciclastic Furada Formation. 
 
Several barren Permian porphyritic and diabasic dykes crosscut the existing lithologies.

P a g e  | 58
Mineralization is continuous for over 1,000 metres.  It ranges in thickness from 1.5 metres to over 25 
metres dipping 50º - 90º away from the granitic intrusion.  The skarn is known over a vertical continuity 
of 400 metres and remains open at depth. 
 
The Carlés skarn is of calcic composition and is an exoskarn although irregular endoskarn has developed 
locally.    It  consists  of  layers  of  garnet  (grossularite-andradite  composition)  intercalated  with  layers  of 
pyroxene  skarn,  mostly  of  hedenbergite  composition.    Retrograde  phases  of  the  skarn  results  in  the 
formation of irregular magnetite layers associated with amphibole.  Inside these bands is where most of 
copper  sulphides  and  gold  mineralization  occur.    The  skarn  mineralization  grades  into  coarse-grained 
marbles  then  non-altered  limestones  away  from  the  intrusive.    The  latter  may  show  narrow 
intercalations of distal garnet-pyroxene incipient skarn. 
 
Gold mineralization at Carlés is closely associated with copper sulphides, which consist of disseminated 
and  patchy  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  that  precipitated  mainly  in  the  magnetite  zone.    Other  minerals 
common in the skarn are arsenopyrite, löellingite, pyrrhotite and late-stage pyrite.  Accessory minerals 
in the deposit are hessite, bismuthinite, molybdenite, sphalerite, stannite and jamesonite.  Gold occurs 
as electrum (43% Au and 57% Ag) and is spatially associated with Cu sulphides. 
 
The  gold-copper  mineralization  occurs  in  thin  layers  called  “capas”  in  Spanish  and  varies  in  thickness 
from less than 2 metres to more than 15 metres at the west end of Carlés North. The average thickness 
of the gold-copper bearing zones in the underground mining operation has been about 4 metres. 
 
Mineralization at Carlés is divided into four parts: Carlés East, Carlés North, Carlés Northwest, and Carlés 
West.
7.4.1  Carlés East
Carlés  East  is  located  along  the  northeastern  part  of  the  intrusion  in  two  continuous  bodies  of  skarn 
averaging  20  metres  in  thickness  each  and  striking  N45W.    The  skarn  units  are  separated  by  a  sill  of 
granodiorite.  In Carlés East, the granodiorite sills have been intruded along the original bedding of the 
limestone  and  gold–copper  mineralization  is  developed  within  pyroxene  bands  that  are  generally 
parallel to the original bedding. 
 
At  Carlés  East,  magnetite  is  scarce  compared  to  Carlés  North  and  gold  mineralization  is  mainly 
associated  with  chalcopyrite  and  bornite.    The  richest  bornite  zones  tend  to  contain  the  highest  gold 
grades. 
 
RNGM defined four economic Au-Cu zones that have been named H, I, A and B, where H is farthest from 
the intrusion and B is closest to the intrusion.  Economic mineralization extends 200 metres horizontally 
and  more  than  200  metres  downdip  to  -70m  elevation.    Gold-copper  mineralization  remains  open  at 
depth and laterally to the southeast. 
 
The  thickness  of  the  ore  zones  varies  from  less  than  2  metres  to  more  than  10  metres,  averaging  4 
metres.  Thickness and grades are higher in the upper portion of the deposit.  Gold and copper grades in 
the upper portions are higher due to supergene enrichment. 
 
Resources still exist below the 4 masl level, which was the lowest level mined.

7.4.2  Carlés North
This area is located at the northern part of the intrusion and it consists of a single, continuous band of 
skarn mineralization along the contact between the Carlés Granodiorite and the Rañeces Formation.  It 
corresponds to  the  same  skarn  as  described  in  Carlés  East,  but  strikes  E-W  following the trend of the 
intrusive contact. 
 
Skarn mineralization has dimensions of 350 metres along strike, 475 metres downdip, and a thickness of 
approximately  15 metres.   The  known extent of  the deposit  is  from  surface  level  at 275 masl  to  -200 
masl.  The deposit is open at depth. 
 
A set of alternating garnet and pyroxene bands of skarn have developed at the northern contact of the 
granodiorite  with  the  Rañeces  Formation.    The  ore  zone  consists  of  an  irregular  lens-shaped  body  of 
magnetite  with  good  gold-copper  mineralization  in  the  pyroxene  bands  that  are  located  close  to  the 
contact with the marbles. 
 
Gold mineralization is associated with copper sulphides, mostly chalcopyrite, bornite, and arsenopyrite.  
Gold occurs as electrum. 
 
Ore in Carlés North is located in Layer M at the marble contact.  It has been mined by open pit and later 
by underground methods.  It has a strike length of 150 metres, it is well defined to 50 masl and it is open 
at depth. 
 
Carlés  North  has  been mined  out  down  to  the  -10 metre  level,  although  part  of the  deposit  between 
levels +30 metres to +80 metres has not been mined and would be classified as proven ore if the mill 
was running.  Carlés North is sparsely drilled and it is open at depth. 
 
Carlés North was previously developed to the -10 metre level, with there being some exploitation from 
this area prior to the mine closure.  The remainder of this zone between levels -10 metre level to +70 
metre level is currently in production, with development of a second panel of extraction from the  -10 
metre level to the -100 metre level underway.  Carlés North is sparsely drilled below the -10 metre level 
and it is open at depth. 
 
In the northwest part of Carlés North, an arm of granodiorite extends out in a NNW direction.  In the 
skarn developed immediately to the east of the granodiorite, there is a mineralized zone, 20 metres long 
by 5 metres thick averaging 14 g/t Au and 1.0% Cu.  This zone remains open at depth and it is a good 
target for new resources.
7.4.3  Carlés Northwest
This area is located to the west of Carlés North and it consists of a single band of skarn striking N25E 
(Figure 7-12).  It measures 250 metres long, 350 metres downdip, and has an average thickness of <10 
metres.    It  is  a calcic  skarn  developed  at  the  contact  between  the  Carlés  intrusion  and  the  carbonate 
units of the lower portion of the Rañeces Formation.  Garnet and pyroxene skarn bands characterize the 
deposit.  Gold mineralization is associated with copper sulphides, mostly chalcopyrite and bornite, with 
arsenopyrite.    Gold  and  copper  mineralization  here  is  less  continuous  as  compared  to  the  Carlés  East 
and Carlés North zones.

The zone has been drilled from surface on a 25 metres x 25 metres grid, but it has not been explored by 
underground development. Surface drilling has defined small Au-Cu bodies of economic interest.  Some 
of the best intersections come from drill holes Car-20 (19.4 g/t Au over 3.75 metres) and Car-124 (18.0 
g/t Au over 2 metres).  In 2011, drilling extended the mineralization downdip (Figure 7-12).

7.4.4  Carlés West
The area is located along the west part of the Carlés intrusion.  Gold-copper mineralization occurs in the 
transition between the Furada and Rañeces Formations.  Several bands of skarn alternate with hornfels 
and interfingering sills of granodiorite occur. 
 
In this area, the main gold mineralization trends NW and is well defined over 100 metres in length and 
160  metres downdip.  The thickness  is very irregular due  to the lenticular shape  of most  of the  skarn 
bands which are intercalated with irregular bands of hornfels and irregular granodiorite sills. The calcic 
skarn is made of intercalated bands of garnet and pyroxene.  In places the pyroxene skarn is related to 
metamorphism  of  carbonate-rich  layers  in  the  siliciclastic  rocks  rather  than  metasomatic  alteration of 
the limestone. 
 
The  pyroxene  bands  host  lenses  of  chalcopyrite  with  minor  bornite,  arsenopyrite  and  pyrite.    Gold 
occurs as electrum, associated with copper sulphides. 
 
AAC and RNGM drilled the zone from surface on a 25 metre x 25 metre grid, but the area has not been 
explored underground.
7.5
La Brueva
The La Brueva gold deposit is 7 kilometres northeast of the El Valle mine on a 40-metre wide, east-west 
striking  fracture  zone  that  cuts  the  Río  Narcea  anticline  almost  perpendicular  to  the  axial  trend.    At 
surface,  the  fracture  zone  is  located  along  the  contact  of  the  Oville  and  Barrios  Formations.    Several 
million cubic metres of material were mined out from the La Brueva pit by the Romans. 
 
At  the  eastern  end  of  the  pit,  an  oxidized,  quartz-rich  jasperoid  breccia  with  partially  oxidized  patchy 
veins  of  arsenopyrite  is  prominently  displayed  in  a  road  cut.    A  channel  sample  from  the  exposure 
assayed 4.15 g/t Au over a 15-metre true width. 11 holes have been drilled over the easternmost 200 
metres of the breccia. 
 
The host fault structure for the La Brueva breccia was tested 500 metres to the west along strike by hole 
LB-12. This drill hole intercepted 46 metres averaging 0.5 g/t Au (including 5 metres at 2.2 g/t Au) and 
established the continuity of the mineralized zone over more than 1,300 metres of strike, within which 
ore  shoots  of  higher-grade  gold  mineralization  are  possible.    A  typical  cross-section  through  the  La 
Brueva deposit is shown in Figure 7-13.  The La Brueva resource estimate was reported in Noble (2011).

La Ortosa – Godán
La  Ortosa-Godán  is  the  northernmost  prospect  on  the  Property  presently  identified  in  the  Río  Narcea 
Gold  Belt.    It  is  situated 3  kilometres  south  of  the  municipality of  Salas.    It  is  located  near  the  site  of 
several small Roman pits excavated along the eastern margin of a granodiorite intrusive that measures 
1.5 kilometres in length and about 0.5 kilometres in width in outcrop.  The generalized geology of the La 
Ortosa-Godán area is shown in Figure 7-14. 
 
The  granodiorite  body  is  in  contact  with  the  Furada  Fm.  to  the  west  and  carbonates  of  the  overlying 
Rañeces  Group  to  the  east.    This  is  the  same  stratigraphic  section  that  hosts  the  gold-copper  skarn 
mineralization at Carlés.  Unlike Carlés, however, Godán is mainly a gold skarn. 
 
The prospect consists of a gold-bearing skarn and pyroxene hornfels.  The skarns were created from thin 
carbonate  horizons  interbedded  with  siltstones  of  the  upper  part  of  the  Furada  Formation  along  the 
contact with the granodiorite intrusive.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 63
Drilling  has  identified  3  gold-bearing  zones  with  inferred  resources.    Two  of  the  zones  (Ortosa  and 
Ortosa  West)  have  an  average  thickness  of 5  to  10  metres  with  an  average  grade  of  7  g/t  Au  in  very 
competent rock.  Drill core from these 2 zones indicates a tight stratigraphic control for mineralization 
around  the  intrusion.    The  two  zones,  if  continuous,  would  have  a  strike  length  greater  than  1,200 
metres.    There  is  also  a  possibility of  overprinted  epithermal mineralization  at  the  intersection  of  the 
gold skarns with northeast structures that remains to be tested. 
 
The Godán deposit is the third mineralized zone.  It is located 700 metres east of the main intrusion in 
Ortosa  within  an  area  with  a  Roman  pit.    The  zone  has  been  defined  by  3  drill  holes.    Hole  Sal-5x 
intercepted 13.7 metres of silicified carbonate with arsenopyrite that averaged 1.9 g/t Au. Sal-6x tested 
the zone at a position 70 metres downdip and intercepted 1.9 metres of mineralization at 2.1 g/t Au.  It 
also  penetrated  skarn  and  altered  diorite  that  averaged  0.54  g/t  Au  and  0.15%  molybdenum  over  a 
width of 54.05 metres (including 0.45% Mo over 9.8 metres).  In 2011, 2 drill holes for 899 metres were 
drilled along the eastern contact of the small intrusive north and south of holes Sal-5x and Sal-6x; only 
anomalous gold was encountered (Figure 7-15).

DEPOSIT TYPES
8.1
Skarn-Type Deposits
Gold-copper skarns have developed mainly along the contact between intrusives and carbonate units.  
Two different types of skarn have been recognized at El Valle-Boinás.  The first is a calcic skarn related to 
limestone  units  and the  second is a magnesian skarn, called “black skarn”, that is related to dolomite 
units.   
 
Calcic skarns consist mainly of garnet, pyroxene, and wollastonite.  Retrograde calcic skarns consist of 
epidote,  quartz,  calcite  magnetite,  and  sulphides  (pyrite,  arsenopyrite,  and  chalcopyrite).    Gold 
mineralization  in  this  type  of  skarn  is  erratic  and  mostly  uneconomic,  although  some  calcic  skarns 
produced ore in the open pits. 
 
Magnesian skarns consist of diopside with some interbedded forsterite.  Retrograde magnesian skarn is 
altered to tremolite, actinolite, serpentine and magnetite.  Commonly it is accompanied by chalcopyrite, 
bornite,  pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  and  arsenopyrite  as  well  as  disseminated  electrum.  The  result  of  this 
retrogradation is development of a dark magnesian skarn. Geochemistry indicates a Cu-Ag-Au-As-Bi-Te 
association.  Gold mineralization in this type of skarn is significantly higher grade than the calcic skarns 
and  is  generally  a  good  target  for  underground  mining.    The  magnesian  skarns  tend  to  have  good 
continuity at cutoff grades below 2 g/t Au, but can be very difficult to predict above 3 g/t Au. 
 
The  gold-copper-bearing  skarns  at  Carlés  are  generally  calcic  skarns.    Better  grade  gold-copper 
mineralization  is  associated  with  high  magnetite  and  bornite  content  that  is  localized  in  generally 
continuous, relatively thin (4 metres thick) layers of retrograde skarn. 
 
A different type of skarn is observed at Ortosa where gold is deposited without copper mineralization.  
These  skarns  are  calcic  skarns  formed  as  thin,  discontinuous  layers  interbedded  with  hornfels  and 
pyroxene hornfels.
8.2
Epithermal-Type Deposits
At  the  El  Valle-Boinás  deposit,  reactivation  of  fracture  zones  (along  NE-SW,  E-W  and  NW-SE 
orientations)  produced widespread  brecciation and  favored  the  emplacement of  porphyritic  dykes.    A 
low-temperature  alteration  and  mineralization  event  is  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  the 
subvolcanic porphyry dykes, which overprint all previous lithologies. Depending on the host rock, there 
are different styles of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, such as: sericite-adularia-carbonates 
(+py-aspy) in granites and skarns; leaching, enrichment, and silicification in skarns (+ native copper and 
chalcocite), and silicification (+py) in dolomites. 
 
Highest gold grades occur where the low-temperature mineralization overprints previously mineralized 
gold-copper  skarn,  forming  jasperoid  or  semi-jasperoids  with  native  copper  and  minor  chalcocite  and 
cuprite.    The  associated  geochemistry  is  characterized  by  an  increase  in  As,  Sb,  and  Hg.    This 
low-temperature event is the principal gold-mineralizing episode at El Valle.

EXPLORATION
Gold,  and  in  some  cases,  base-metal  mineralization,  has  been  found  in  association  with  late  tectonic 
breccias  related  to  low-angle  thrust  faults  at  El  Valle-Boinás.    The  origin  of  the  gold  mineralization  in 
these  structures  is  thought  to  be  due  to  remobilization  of  previous  skarn-  or  jasperoid-related  gold 
mineralization.  Gold  associated  with  low-angle  structures  is  important  at  El  Valle-Boinás  where  a 
significant percentage of the open-pit minable gold mineralization extracted from the Boinás East Zone 
came from this type of structure.

The gold-copper deposits in the Río Narcea Gold Belt are complex deposits that present challenges for 
exploration.  The original mineral deposits are usually internally complex skarn deposits that have been 
subjected  to  epithermal  alteration  and  remobilization  of  the  mineralization,  plus  displacement  and 
distortion by both high-angle reverse  and thrust  faults.  In addition, individual  ore zones may  be  high 
grade,  but  relatively  small  and  difficult  to  locate.    For  example,  the  Charnela Zone  contained 150,000 
ounces gold in a volume that was only 15-20 metres wide, 200 metres long, and less than 100 metres 
high. 
 
Despite  these  challenges,  the  area  is  sufficiently  well  mineralized  that  continued  exploration  at  El 
Valle-Boinás  found  enough  new  resources  to  extend  RNGM’s  mine  life  by  24%  and  to  increase  the 
amount  of  gold  mined  by  43%  over  the  reserve  at  the  beginning  of  mining.    Key  discoveries  that 
extended mine  life  include the  Sienna Zone  at the east  side  of Boinás East,  the  Charnela Zone  on the 
southern  part  of  the  El  Valle  pit,  and  the  Caolinas  Zone  on  the  west  edge  of  the  El  Valle  pit;  KGC 
discovered  the  A107  and  San  Martín  orebodies  in  2007-08,  and  in  2010  Orvana  discovered  the  S107 
Zone.  In 2011, mineralization was encountered in the Black Skarn Northwest Zone, but further drilling is 
required to define a resource. 
 
The  Black  Skarn  North  was  discovered  in  2001  by  underground  drilling  at  the  north  boundary  of  the 
main Boinás intrusive.  The discovery drill hole, Val-1001, intersected 3.2 g/t Au and 0.54% copper over 
46 metres, which includes high-grade areas containing 10.17 g/t Au and 2.4% Cu over 7.60 metres.  At 
the same time, the Charnela South was also discovered by underground drilling. 
 
In  2003,  a  program  looking  for  deeper  mineralization  east  of  the  El  Valle  pit  discovered the  Area 208 
zone by intersecting mineralization from a deep surface hole.  This was followed by further drilling from 
the bottom of the El Valle open pit and the first drill hole, Val-208, intersected 10.80 g/t Au over 51.10 
metres near the open pit and another zone with 13 g/t Au over 5 metres further east of the pit. 
 
Both KGC and KE focused exploration drilling from underground locations and consequently more than 
doubled the gold resource at EVBC.  Three underground drilling rigs have been operating continuously 
since October, 2010 and will continue to operate over the next few years.

El Valle-Boinás Area Targets
9.1.1  Area 107
The A107 Zone has been extensively drilled by KE and currently has a known strike length of 500 metres 
and a vertical extent of 400 metres and is the primary high-grade oxidized resource for the project.  The 
A107 Zone is open to the south and below the intersection with the Black Skarn North and San Martín 
(south end of Black Skarn) skarns.

9.1.2  Black Skarn North (BSN)
Based  on  the  current  exploration  and  development  drilling  in  the  BSN  Zone,  KE  has  recognized  the 
potential  for  significant  additional  resources  around  the  Boinás  stock  as  shown  in  Figure  9-1.    These 
include: 1) extension of the northwestern portion of the zone to the south along the western margin of 
the  intrusive; 2)  a  deeper  zone  of  skarn mineralization  below  the  eastern  portion  of  the  zone;  and  3) 
extension of the Boinás East skarn zones westward around the southern edge of the intrusive.  Drilling 
during 2010 that focused on extending the San Martín skarn discovered the S107 structure (Figure 9-1).  
During  2011,  drilling  encountered  not  only  skarn  mineralization,  but  vein  mineralization  as  well,  e.g., 
11V1204 with 7.16 metres (true thickness) of 3.95 g/t Au, 0.65% Cu, and 34. g/t Ag, and 11V1205 with 
3.35 metres (true width) of 8.49 g/t Au, 0.10% Cu, and 32.6 g/t Ag.  Underground mining of this ore zone 
started in 2011.

9.1.3  Charnela South
This  epithermal  structure  related  to  subvolcanic  porphyry  dykes  produced  more  than  150,000  ounces 
from  300,000  tonnes  in  the  open  pit.    In  2001,  hole  Val-1005  discovered  the  continuation  of  the 
Charnela Zone  deeper to the  south and the new  zone  was  called Charnela South.  The discovery hole 
intercepted  25.0  g/t  Au  over  5.50  metres.    This  hole  was  followed  by  further  exploration  to  define 
resources and later to convert the resources into reserves.  Following this drilling, RNGM did a feasibility 
study and defined a reserve, but those reserves were downgraded to resources following the decision to 
close the mine. 
 
The resource is well defined.  Mining of this zone is scheduled to start in early 2012.
9.1.4  Boinás East Skarn Zone (Mónica Zone)
This is a large, internally complex deposit in which the ore is gold-copper mineralization in magnesian 
skarn.    The  Mónica  Zone  has  been  exploited  partially  by  underground  by  RNGM,  but  the  bulk  of  the 
deposit is unmined.  Due to easy access, mining has focused on this are during 2011. 
 
Although the Mónica Zone is well defined down to the 75 metres elevation, the east side of the zone is 
open and remains an exploration possibility.  There  are also a few interesting intersections related to 
epithermal  mineralization,  e.g.,  Boi-154  intersected  23.11  g/t  Au  over  6.40  metres  at  40  masl  in  the 
central part of the Monica Zone.
9.1.5  High Angle 1 (HA1)
This steeply-dipping structure, where the rock is oxidized, brecciated and partially silicified, is located at 
the southeastern part of the El Valle-Boinás project.  The upper part of HA1 was exploited by open pit, 
but some resources remain below 400 masl. 
 
HA1  has  been  drilled  by  both  surface  holes  and  a  few  underground  holes,  but  there  remains  a  small 
resource that is open at depth.
9.1.6  High Angle 2 (HA2)
There are about a dozen surface and underground holes that define the current resource estimated in 
this zone.  High Angle 2 (“HA2”) is still open as there  is no drilling below 275 masl or on-strike to the 
south.    Every  hole  that  has  been  drilled  in  HA2  has  had  high-grade  intersections  indicating  good 
continuity.  An oddity of this structure is that it contains more than 1% copper, which is unusual for an 
epithermal structure in this area.  It is possible that the copper has been remobilized from nearby skarn 
mineralization that has not yet been observed in drilling. 
 
The last hole drilled by RNGM in HA2 extended mineralization 100 metres further to the south than the 
previous southernmost intersection.  That hole intercepted 4.4 g/t Au over 5.05 metres, including a zone 
of 15.17 g/t Au over 1 metre true thickness.  This zone will be a future underground exploration target 
for Orvana.

9.1.7  Area 208
In 2003, a drill program by RNGM involved exploring for structures parallel to and east of the El Valle 
Fault.  Hhole Val-194, drilled from surface 125 metres east of the El Valle Fault intercepted more than 
100 metres of  epithermal mineralization.  Val-208 was drilled from the  bottom of the pit towards the 
east to evaluate these structures in more detail.  Two main zones were discovered by this hole: near the 
pit it intercepted 10.80 g/t Au over 51.10 metres, followed by another intersection of 13.5 g/t Au over 
5.75 metres.  About 20 holes were drilled to determine whether this mineralization could be mined by 
open pit, but it was determined that the stripping ratio was too high.  Area 208 has an inferred resource, 
but is poorly defined and open at depth.
9.1.8  El Valle Fault at Depth
The El Valle Fault was mined by open pit down to the 400 masl, at which point the stripping ratio was 
too high to continue open pit mining.  The structure remains open at depth with more or less the same 
structural and lithologic characteristics. It has been evaluated by surface holes down to the 200  masl, 
but it is untested below that.
9.2
Carlés
The  Carlés  East  deposit  has  been mined  out  to +4  masl,  but  a  decline  was  driven  down  the  -60 masl.  
Infill drilling was done by RNGM to define the resources between the 4 metre elevation down to the -75 
metre elevation.  Based on this drilling, it appears that the layers exploited in the upper part  become 
more  irregular  and  discontinuous  at  depth.    One  deep  hole  located  in  the  south  part  of  Carlés  East, 
however,  cut  25  metres  of  skarn  (true  thickness)  with  6.5  g/t  Au  over  1  metre,  indicated  that 
mineralization may extend to depth. 
 
At  Carlés  North,  the  underground  mine  started  at  200 masl  and  finished  at the  -10  masl.   Part  of  the 
gold-copper mineralization between the 30 masl level and the 80 masl level was prepared for mining by 
RNGM, but it was not mined.  Exploration drilling by KGC and KE has extended the Carlés North Zone 
down to -200 masl and the zone remains open at depth for further exploration.  It is the focus of mining. 
 
In 2011, the Carlés Northwest mineralization was extended below the 50 masl level.
9.3
La Ortosa – Godán
9.3.1  Godán
Godán is located 700 metres east of the main intrusive in Ortosa within the area of a Roman pit. 
 
A gold zone here was defined by 3 drill holes.  Sal-5x intercepted 13.7 meress of silicified carbonate with 
arsenopyrite  that  averaged  1.9  g/t  Au.    Sal-6x  tested  the  zone  at  a  position  70  metres  downdip  and 
intercepted 1.9 metres at 2.1 g/t Au, it also penetrated skarn and altered diorite that averaged 0.54 g/t  
Au  and  0.15%  molybdenum  over  a  width  of  54.05  metres  (including  0.45%  Mo  over  9.8  metres).    In 
2011,  two  holes  were  drilled  to  test  the  continuity  of  this  mineralization,  but  although  skarn  was 
encountered, no ore-grade mineralization was intercepted (Figure 7-15).

9.4
La Ortosa
There are two defined zones at Ortosa. The first one is located at the center of the intrusive and it has 
been drilled from surface with some interesting results.  Hole Ort-11 intercepted 7.21 g/t Au over 11.15 
metres, and hole Ort-18, located 100 metres east of Ort 11, intercepted 11.38 g/t Au over 3.40 metres.  
The second target is called Ortosa West, where hole ORTW 3 intercepted 6.81 g/t Au over 11.25 metres 
in  very  competent  rock.    Drill  data  from  these  two  zones  indicate  a  tight  stratigraphic  control  for 
mineralization around the intrusion.  Both zones remain open and are targets for exploration.

Conclusions
DRILLING
The Río Narcea Gold Belt offers KE many excellent opportunities for expanding the resources of known 
mineralized bodies as well as discovering new gold and copper-gold resources.  The prospectivity of the 
area justifies the underground drilling in progress and beyond.

Early Anglo drilling was done with core rigs, but was plagued with poor recovery, especially in the oxide 
zones at El Valle.  Recoveries were acceptable in the more competent rock at Carlés. 
 
The initial work by CMA used reverse circulation drilling, which worked well for identifying new areas of 
mineralization, but had difficulty with high flows of water.  Seven reverse-circulation (“RC”) holes were 
drilled  in  El  Valle,  but  were  not  used  in  resource  estimates  because  of  concerns  with  the  quality  of 
samples. 
 
In  1993,  RNGM  started  using  core  drilling,  but  unsatisfactory  core  recovery  prompted  a  review  of 
methods and contracting a mud engineer to supervise the drilling.  These steps resulted in an impressive 
increase of recoveries to generally better than 90%. 
 
In 1995, three combination rigs were brought to El Valle that allowed both core and reverse circulation.  
These rigs were used to drill the upper portions of the holes, primarily Tertiary sediments, with RC and 
the lower mineralized portions with core. 
 
Underground core drilling from the El Valle drainage adit was started in 1997.  Additional underground 
drilling has included detailed drilling of the Mónica Zone,  the  discovery and exploration drilling of the 
BSN and Charnela South, and exploration drilling in Area 107.  A particular problem with underground 
core  drilling  is  that  core  recoveries  are  low  in  holes  drilled  upwards  into  ground  that  has  not  been 
dewatered and is under high water pressure.  In this case, the drilling mud cannot be maintained in the 
hole  and  high  water  flows  wash  out  fines  resulting  in  poor  core  recovery.    It  is  believed  by  the  mine 
geologists that poor core recovery causes assays that are more erratic and lower grade than they should 
be.  The Charnela South Zone and the Area 107 zone both have some holes with low core recovery. 
 
The  exploration  drilling  by  KGC  and  KE  between  2007  and  2011  were  almost  exclusively  from 
underground locations.  Core recovery was essentially good except for those holes drilled upward.

Between  Spetember  1,  2010  and  August  31,  2011,  KE  completed  87  underground  drill  holes  for  over 
10,300  metres.    The  purpose  of  this  drilling  was  to  define  stope  size  for  mine  planning,  dewatering, 
delineation  of  known  mineralized  bodies,  infill  drilling  to  upgrade  resource  classification,  and 
exploration.  In general, HQ core was drilled at El Valle/Boinás and NQ core at Carlés.  Drilling is ongoing. 
 
Drilling  on  the  properties  has  intersected  the  deposits  at  various  angles  from  perpendicular  to  near 
parallel and it can be  difficult  to estimate  true  thickness/width.  In many cases where the drilling was 
parallel to the deposit, the deposit width was 2-3 times the drilling grid and was adequately defined by 
the drilling.

SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY
11.1
Core Drilling
Diamond core drilling was done using HQ core, except for some drill holes at Carlés, for which NQ core 
was used; some metallurgical drill holes were drilled with PQ diameter core. 
 
Core boxes were transported daily from the different drill stations to the core shed facility at Begega for 
geotechnical and geological logging.  Each box of core was first photographed by the  project geologist 
with the help of a geological field assistant.  Film photograph was used up to 2002, after which a digital 
camera was used.
11.1.1  Core Logging and Sampling
The geologist identifies and marks the beginning and the end of the sampling intervals and prepares a 
detailed geologic log including lithology, alteration, mineralization, and structure.  In addition, a detailed 
written and graphical description is also included on the log sheet.  Sample intervals are identified based 
on changes in lithology, structure, alteration, and mineralization.  The average sample interval is about 
1.5 metres, and samples are rarely longer than 2.0 metres. 
 
Drill core logging is done by a company geologist under the supervision of the  chief project  geologist, 
Santiago  González  Nistal,  who  is  a  qualified  person  for  the  purposes  of  NI  43-101.    Core  recovery 
averages more than 90%, except in some holes with clay-oxide material as well as holes that were drilled 
upwards,  but  it  is  still  around  80%.    A  few  oriented-core  holes  were  done  to  determine  the  true 
orientation of bedding and other structural features. 
 
Before  sampling,  a  geotechnical  description  is  recorded,  including  total  core  recovery,  solid  core 
recovery,  rock  quality  designation,  number  of  joint  sets,  fracture  frequency,  joint  type,  point-load 
testing, large  and small scale roughness, joint  alteration, fracture  filling material, type  and strength of 
infill, water/flow, and weathering. 
 
Upon  completion  of  geotechnical  and  geological  work,  the  handwritten  forms  are  transferred  to 
data-entry personnel for conversion of the data into digital format and checked by the geologist.  The 
original data sheets are filed for future reference.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 73
Sample preparation technicians saw the core in half with a diamond saw, except for material with highly 
fractured and clay materials, which are divided manually with hammer and chisel. One half of the core is 
saved in metal pans for sample preparation; the other half is put back in the core boxes and saved in the 
core warehouse. 
 
During the infill program from late 1995 to mid 1996, the core  was not split, and the  entire core  was 
crushed for assaying.  The entire core was also consumed for HQ core at Carlés and in some drill holes in 
El Valle-Boinás where HQ core was used because drilling conditions forced downsizing of the core. 
 
Based on the good core recovery and high-standards in logging and sampling of the core, the drilling is 
considered to be very reliable.  In the few areas with poor recovery, the deficiency is known and can be 
accounted for in the resource estimate.
11.2
Sample Preparation Facilities
Sample preparation was done using industry-standard practices and procedures that were developed in 
consultation  with  ORE.    All  sampling  for  the  RNGM drilling  programs  and  for the  grade  control  in  the 
open-pit mine was done by employees of RNGM and overseen by the Chief Geologist.  None of those 
persons were senior employees or directors of RNGM. 
 
There have been two different sample preparation facilities during the history of the project.  The first 
one  is  known  as  the  Villanueva  core  shed  and  is  located  5  kilometres  east  of  Carlés.    It  was  an  old 
building  that  was  previously  a  tobacco-drying  barn.    That  facility  was  used  from  the  Anglo  period 
through 1995, when the Begega facility was constructed.  Today, the Villanueva core shed is where the 
Carlés core and core from other projects such as La Ortosa and Godán is stored. 
 
In 1995, RNGM built  the new sample preparation facility known as Begega core shed.  Located at  the 
northern part of the mine near the village of Begega, this was designed to provide a modern facility for 
logging  core  and  sample  preparation  using  the  best  equipment  available  at  that  time.    The  Begega 
facility contains drill core  from El Valle-Boinás plus other prospects  near El Valle-Boinás such as Santa 
Marina, Villaverde, La Brueva, and Antoñana.
11.3
Sample Preparation Procedure
Procedures were established by RNGM that are suitable to the specific type of drilling and the ultimate 
use of the data.  The procedure for diamond core samples is as follows:
 
 


 

The 7-kilogram core samples are dried at a temperature of 90ºC. 
The entire dried sample is crushed through a jaw crusher to 95%<6 millimetres. 
The  coarse-crushed  sample  is  further  reduced  to  95%<425  microns  using  an  LM5 
bowl-and-puck pulverizer. 
An Essa  rotary splitter is used to take a 450-  to 550-gram sub-sample of each split for 
pulverizing.  The remaining reject portion is bagged and stored. 
The sample is reduced to a nominal -200 mesh using an LM2 bowl-and-puck pulverizer. 
105  gram  subsamples  are  split  using  a  special  vertical-sided  scoop  to  cut  channels 
through the sample which has been spread into a pancake on a sampling mat.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 74

Samples are then sent to the laboratory for gold and base metal analysis.  Leftover pulp 
is bagged and stored.
The  sample  preparation  was  modified  for  grade  control  in  order  to  allow  higher  productivity  with  a 
larger number of the samples:






The  samples  with  an  average  particle  size  between  3  and  7  cms  are  dried  at 
temperature of 90ºC. 
The  entire  dried  sample  is  firstly  crushed  through  a  jaw  crusher  to 95%<6 millimetres 
and then crushed using a mill crusher to 95%<2 mm. 
A  Riffle  splitter  is  used to take a  500-gram sub-sample  for  pulverizing.   The  remaining 
reject portion is bagged and stored. 
The  sample  is  the  reduced  to  a  nominal  -200  mesh  using  an  LM2  bowl-and-puck 
pulverizer. 
105  gram  subsamples  are  split  using  a  special  vertical-sided  scoop  to  cut  channels 
through the sample which has been spread into a pancake on a sampling mat. 
Samples are then sent to the laboratory for gold and base metal analysis.  Leftover pulp 
is bagged and stored.
These  procedures  are  necessary  to  reduce  possible  sampling  errors  introduced  by  the  occasional 
relatively coarse gold at these projects.
11.4  Assaying
Samples  from all exploration and infill programs carried out  before 1997 were sent to Barringer (now 
Inspectorate)  Lab  in  Reno,  Nevada,  USA  for  analysis.    In  1997,  RNGM  built  a  laboratory  on  the  mine 
property and samples were analyzed at the mine laboratory.  During that time, the ITMA lab in Oviedo 
was used to provide capacity in addition to the RNGM lab.  The Barringer laboratory was not certified at 
the  time  of  the  earlier  drilling.  However,  the  Inspectorate  lab  has  been  certified  for  gold  under  ISO 
17025 since 1999. The RNGM mine lab was not certified and never has been. The RNGM laboratory was 
restored and upgraded by Orvana during 2011. 
 
Check assays were done in ITMA lab if the original sample was analyzed in the RNGM lab.  Between 2007 
and 2011, when the mine was not operating, KGC sent about 90% of its diamond drill core samples to 
ITMA  for  analysis  and  the  remainder  to  ALS-Chemex.  Check  assays  were  done  in  ITMA  while  original 
pulps  were  sent  to  ALS-Chemex  for  analysis,  and  vice  versa.  Once  Orvana  laboratory  was  restored  in 
2011 all samples, including mine face samples, are analyzed at the mine site lab. During starting up of 
the lab all infill and exploration hole samples were  sent to ALS-Chemex for checking and validation of 
EVBC Lab. Less percentage of check assay were sent as the mine lab performance increased. Since the 
end of 2011 some exploration samples are sent to ALS-Chemex for checking.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 75
For gold determination, a 50-gram fire assay method with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish 
were done by Barringer (also gravimetric finish for samples with high gold level).  Assays at the RNGM 
and ITMA labs were done using two 30-gram assay aliquots with AAS finish. Analyses for Cu, Ag, As Bi 
and Sb were done using an aqua regia extraction with an AAS finish. At the EVBC laboratory, a 30-gram 
sample was analyzed by fire-assay method with AAS finish for gold, and copper, silver, arsenic, bismuth 
(antimony,  and  mercury  when  needed)  were  analyzed  by  ICP-optical  emission  spectroscopy  (ICP-OES) 
after an aqua regia digestion.  Also, a 30-gram sample was analyzed by fire-assay method with AAS finish 
for gold and ICP-OES analysis for the analysis of 35 elements at ALS Chemex. 
 
Today, monthly  internal  and  external  check  assay  are  done.  For external  checking,  every  five  samples 
sent to ALS-Chemx include a blank standard or duplicate. Repeat or check assays were done regularly on 
original  pulp  and  occasionally on  a  second  pulp  prepared  from stored  rejects.    Routine  internal  check 
assays (blank, standard and duplicate) were done on every 10 samples for grade control hole samples.  
For infill and exploration holes all samples were duplicated and, on every 20 samples, check assays were 
performed. Samples are analyzed for Au, Cu, Ag, As, Bi and sometimes for Hg and Sb when needed.
11.4.1  Density Measurement
After logging the core, densities were measured using the following procedure:
a)
b) 
c) 
d)
A  length  of  core  approximately  15  centimetres  long  is  selected  and  the  lithology 
recorded. 
The core is weighed in air. 
The core is weighed in water. 
The core is then dried overnight at 90 C and weighed again; this is the dry weight.
Density is then calculated using the formula: 
 
Density=Dry Weight(d) /(Weight in Air(b)-Weight in Water(c) ) 
 
The density sample is returned to the box after density measurement. 
 
The above density measurement has proven reliable except that it is not possible to measure density in 
highly fractured zones.  Since the fractured zones are also usually clay-rich and low density, this caused a 
slight  bias  (about  5%)  in  the  measured  densities  for  jasperoid  and  oxide  skarn.    Those  densities  were 
adjusted after production results showed that they were too high.  Density measurements are now done 
only in the ore zones. 
 
Density data were reviewed for the November, 2008 report to confirm the densities for the BSN Zone, 
the Area 107 Zone, and the Carlés North Zone.   Results of this review are summarized below. 
 
Carlés North Density 
 
A  total  of  538  samples  were  available  for  the  Carlés  area,  which  averaged  3.24    t/m3.    Mineralized 
samples are slightly heavier than the average for all samples and 258 samples above 1 ppm Au averaged 
3.31  t/m3.  Thirty five (35) density measurements  were located inside  the North Zone  that averaged 
3.30 t/m3.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 76
Area 107 Zone Density 
 
A total of 175 density measurements are available inside the Area 107 Zone that average 2.17 t/m3.  The 
average density for 69 mineralized samples with gold grades above 1 g/t Au is 2.25 t/m3 , and the 2.25  
t/m3 is used for resource estimation in the Area 107 Zone. 
 
Black Skarn North Density 
 
A  total  of  408  density  measurements  are  available  inside  the  BSN  Zone  that  average  3.03  t/m3.    The 
average density for 249 mineralized samples with gold grades above 1 g/t Au is 3.07 t/m3 . The average 
density of 3.03 t/m3 is used for resource estimation in the Black Skarn North Zone. 
 
12
DATA VERIFICATION
12.1  Drill Hole Collar Locations
Collar  surveys  were  done  by  in-house  personnel  using  a  total  station  technique  with  a  maximum 
deviation of 3 millimetres.  The  surveyed locations of  drill holes, channel samples and other points of 
interest were put in a spreadsheet in the server, in local and UTM coordinates.  The Senior Geologist and 
the  geologist  responsible  for  the  database  transformed  the  data  to  the  collar  file  in  the  drill  hole 
database.  The project geologist then checked and verified the coordinates.
12.2  Drill Hole Down-Hole Survey
Downhole surveys were done by in-house personnel, first by Anglo and later by CMH and RNGM.  Anglo 
used an Eastman tool; subsequently, CMH bought a gyroscopic instrument (first a multi-shot and later a 
digital) capable of recording drill hole azimuth and inclination every 20 metres. 
 
Starting  in  1996,  downhole  deviation  surveys were  done  using  a  Maxibor  Reflex  Tool.    This operation 
was always done by the same person, who was also in charge of the maintenance of the tool.  Data was 
exported from the instrument to an ExcelTM file that was then transferred by the database geologist to 
the  drill hole downhole survey file.  In 2004, RNGM bought  a Flexit tool which was  used at Carlés  for 
downhole survey.  In 2007, KGC bought a Maxibor Reflex Tool and this tool  was used on all drill holes 
through the present.
12.3
Lithology
The drill hole lithologic database at El Valle-Boinás initially used a simplified alphanumeric code derived 
from the core log that was called “lito”.  After the lithologic data base had been in use for some time, it 
was determined that a more detailed lithologic code was needed.  The new lithologic code is known as 
“lito98".  The lithology codes were designed so that the most important aspects of lithology, alteration, 
and mineralogy were available for interpretation by computer.  When the lito98 codes were developed, 
most, but not all, of the previous holes were converted to the new codes based on the log sheets and/or 
relogging. 
 
The lithologic codes were entered into the computer in an ExcelTM spreadsheet by the geologist who did 
the  core  log.    When  the  hole  was  complete,  the  lithologic  data was  added  to the  main  database  and 
checked by the database geologist.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 77
At  Carlés,  there  is  also  an  early,  simplified  “lito  code”,  but  in  2003  it  was  superceded  by  the  more 
detailed code “lito2003".
12.4  Assay Data
From  1992  to  1997,  sample  assays  from  Barringer  (Inspectorate)  Labs  were  received  electronically  as 
ExcelTM files by modem or email.  From 1997 to 2006 assays were received directly from the assay lab 
over  the  project’s  intranet.    The  lab  assays  were  transferred  from  the  laboratory  file  to  the  drill  hole 
database by the database geologist.  They were also transferred into a separate drill hole spreadsheet by 
the  project  geologist.    In  addition,  some  samples  were  sent  to  the  ITMA  laboratory  and  results  were 
received  by  email  as  ExcelTM  files.    The  project  geologist  also  reviewed  the  blanks,  standards,  and 
duplicate  sample  to  ensure  that  they  were  in  agreement  with  the  expected  values.    The  same 
procedures were implemented for Orvana’s drill holes assays.
12.5
Blanks, Standards and Duplicates
Standards  pulps,  blanks  and  duplicates  are  used  for  control  samples.    During  the  RNGM  years,  the 
Barringer Lab and the mine used commercially-prepared standards for quality control.  On each set of 27 
grade-control  samples  three  quality  control  samples  were  analyzed,  plus  one  standard  and  two 
duplicates.  One standard and one blank were used for acid digestion-AA analysis of the other elements.  
All mill samples  and concentrate samples were  duplicated and one  standard was used for each set of 
12-15 samples.  An additional blank is used for the analysis of the other elements. 
 
In  addition  to  routine  quality  control  analyses,  RNGM  conducted  an  inter-comparison  program  with 
another laboratory to better control precision and accuracy from the mine laboratory.  For this purpose 
samples  have  been  divided  into  four  groups:  grade  control,  low-grade  mill  samples,  low-grade 
concentrates and high-grade concentrates. 
 
KGC  did  four  checks  for  every  20  samples:  a  blank,  a  duplicate  to  the  primary  lab,  a  duplicate  to  a 
secondary lab, and a standard.  During the infill program, most of the samples were sent to ITMA Lab, 
and the external check was done in ALS Chemex laboratory.  Where ALS Chemex was the primary lab, 
the CHEMEX lab assays were checked at ITMA Lab. 
 
 
Standard S-145, prepared by Gannet Holdings, Pty of South Perth, WA, was used by KGC until September 
2007.    Subsequently,  S-146  standard,  also  prepared  by  Gannet  Holdings,  was  used  (both  are  Au 
standards).    Review  of  the  assays  for  these  standards  do  not  show  any  significant  variation  from  the 
recommended  values  for  gold  grade  at  either  the  ITMA  or  ALS  Chemex  labs.    Copper  grades  for  the 
standards compare well for assays from the ALS Chemex laboratory, but copper grades from the ITMA 
laboratory average 10% lower the recommended value.  Paired check gold assays between the two labs 
are  not  significantly  different,  but  copper  check  assays  confirm  the  results  of  the  standards  assays.  
ITMA  copper  grades  below  1%  copper  (10000  ppm  Cu)  average  25%  below  the  ALS  Chemex  copper 
grades.    ITMA  copper  grades  above  1%  copper,  however,  are  only  7%  lower  than  the  ALS  Chemex 
copper grades.  Details of QA/QC are found in Noble (2010).

KE used the ALS Chemex laboratory for drill samples during 2009, 2010, and part of 2011.  In 2011, ALS 
Chemex became the secondary laboratory and did check sampling of results generated from the EVBC 
laboratory.  The QA/QC procedures remained the same.  One of the features of the KE QA/QC program 
is the analysis of pulp duplicates - in no case is the same pulp analyzed again, but rather a duplicate pulp 
is analyzed.  Table 12-1 shows results from a QA/QC check.

Reliability of Data and Databases
The primary check on the reliability of the assay data has been the successful reconciliation between ore 
reserve  estimates,  mine  production,  mill  production,  and  smelter  payments  associated  with  the 
beneficiation of nearly 1,000,000 ounces of gold. Reconciliation between the model and exploited areas 
continues.    Check-assay  studies,  sampling  studies,  and  routine  quality  control  provide  additional 
confirmation of the reliability of assays.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 79
The reliability of the data base is based on several layers of data checking, not only by those responsible 
for  entering  the  data  and  maintaining  the  database,  but  by  project  geologists  using  the  data  for 
interpretation and resource estimation.  The ultimate responsibility for the database is the Chief Mine 
Geologist,  who  has  been  Mr.  Santiago  González  Nistal  since  the  start  of  RNGM’s  operation  of  the 
project. 
 
The data and database are believed by the author to be reliable and suitable for resource estimation.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALURGICAL TESTING
13.1  Metallurgy
Metallurgically, the El Valle-Boinás/Carlés ores are relatively complex gold-copper ores that range from 
soft, oxidized materials, in which the copper is primarily native copper, to hard, sulphide skarn, in which 
the copper  is primarily composed of chalcopyrite and bornite.  Since  copper is a cyanicide,  it must  be 
removed from the ore before gold is recovered using conventional cyanide leaching.  Native copper is 
removed from the ore in a gravity circuit and by froth flotation.  Sulphide copper minerals can only be 
removed by froth flotation. 
 
Gold is primarily native gold and is substantially liberated in the extraction process.  Gold is recovered as 
gravity concentrate, flotation concentrate, and bullion (from the cyanide leaching circuit).  The quantity 
of gravity-recoverable native gold and native copper are much greater in oxide ores than in the sulphide 
ores, and the gravity circuit may be bypassed if only sulphides are being processed. 
 
Because  of  the  widely  varying  hardness  and  grindability  of  El  Valle-Boinás/Carlés  ores,  the  El  Valle 
treatment plant can treat 95 tonnes/hour of the softer oxide ores and as much as 70 tonnes/hour of the 
harder sulphide ores such as skarn from Boinás and Carlés.  Nonetheless, the oxide and sulphide ores 
can be processed together without notably sacrificing recoveries.
13.2
Results
Past metallurgical test results are irrelevant given that the plant operated from 1997 through 2006 and 
was restarted, after renovations, in May, 2011.  During the rehabilitation period, testing of various ores 
and the blending of such ores was conducted at the plant laboratory.  These results aided in fine tuning 
the extraction process once the plant was started up. 
 
Most  of  the  feedstock  has  been  principally  from  both  Boinás  and  Carlés  skarn  ores  and  the  softer, 
higher-gold  grade  oxide  ore  comprised  <10%  of  the  processed  ore.    By  November,  2011,  total  gold 
recovery was at 89% with about half from the flotation process and the other half from the CIL circuit; 
gravimetric methods yielded only a small percentage of the total recovery.  By the same date, copper 
recovery averaged 80%, nearly all recovered in the flotation process, and silver recovery was about 65% 
from both the flotation, gravity and CIL circuits.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
14.1
El Valle – Boinás Resource Estimate
The El Valle resource estimate is based on several resource models that were created during the time 
period from 1998 through 2011.  The original resource  and ore-reserve  estimates for the El  Valle and 
Boinás  East  areas  were  done  by  ORE  using  3-dimensional  block  models  that  contained  the  entire 
resource in the open-pit areas.  As RNGM continued to explore the area, a number of new deposits were 
defined and new models were  developed specifically for those  areas.  Detailed resource models were 
done in four areas including Boinás East, Charnela South, Black Skarn North, and Area 107.  At this time, 
the only resource that has been carried-forward from the earlier open-pit models is a minor resource in 
the  West  Skarn  deposit.    Current  resources  have  been  estimated  by  ORE  and  by  KNB  under  the 
supervision of ORE. 
 
A  general  description  of  the  resource  estimation  methods  and  estimated  resources  for  each  of  the 
models follows.

An updated resource model was prepared by ORE in February 2010 for the BSN and Area 107 zones to 
update the resource estimate for 25 new drill holes.  Eight of the new drill holes were drilled by KGC in 
2008/2009  and  were  not  included  in  the  previous  estimate,  and  17  of  the  new  holes  were  drilled  by 
Orvana in 2009/2010 with the primary objective of converting inferred resources to indicated resources.  
In  addition,  resource  estimates  for  silver  grade  were  added  to  the  model  in  this  update.    This  model 
replaced the previous estimates for the BSN and Area 107 that were reported in November 2008. 
 
The 2010 resource model was updated in 2011 by KNB  to include 26 new drill holes. Seven of the new 
drill holes were drilled in Area 107 and 19 of the new drill holes were drilled in Black Skarn North (15) 
and San Martín Zone (4) respectively. All of these new holes were drilled by Kinbauri in 2010/2011. This 
model replaces the previous estimates for the BSN and Area 107 that were reported by ORE in February 
2010. 
 
The model was  created  using  Datamine  Studio 3 software  with  wireframe  interpretations of  the  zone 
geometry.    Block-model  grades  were  estimated  using  inverse-distance-power  interpolation  with 
trend-surfaces to orient the interpolation.
14.2.1  Drill Hole Data
Drill-hole data intersecting the BSN and Area 107 Zones were provided by Orvana for 277 drill holes with 
a total drilled length of 35,680 metres, of which 33,159 metres were assayed for gold and 22,648 metres 
were assayed for copper.  Other assays were included in the data, but were not used in the estimate (As, 
Hg, Sb, Zn, Pb, Bi, Mo, Te, and Tl). Approximately 96% of the holes were drilled from underground and 
100% of the total drilling was done by KGC and Orvana since the last estimate in 2010.  All of the KGC 
and  Orvana  drilling  was  done  from  underground.    Underground  holes  averaged  approximately  157 
metres  in  length  and  surface  holes  averaged  283  metres  in  length.    Drilling  is  summarized  by  type  in

As shown in Error! Reference source not found., underground drilling was done on fans from a limited 
number  of  drilling  stations  and  drilling  is  generally  not  perpendicular  to  the  mineralized  zones.    The 
irregular  nature  of  the  drilling  in  conjunction  with  the  complex  geometry  of  the  mineralized  zones 
present a challenge for geologic interpretation, particularly where drill holes penetrate the deposit at an 
oblique angle and/or cross through several sections at an angle.

14.2.2  Mineral Zones
Black Skarn North 
 
The BSN mineralized zone wraps around the Boinás granite intrusive at the contact between dolomite 
and  granite.    The  northwestern  part  of  the  zone  consists  of  an  upper,  near  vertical  unit  and  a  lower, 
shallow-dipping  unit,  as  shown  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..  The  upper  part  of  the  zone  is 
20-metres to 50-metres wide in this area and carries the higher gold and copper grades.  The lower part 
of  the  zone  is  about  50-metres  thick  and  dips  about  40°  to  the  north  and  northwest,  away  from  the 
granite intrusion.  Gold-copper mineralization shows a near vertical trend in the upper part of the zone 
and is roughly parallel to the  granite/skarn contact.  Mineralization in the  lower part of the  zone  dips 
outward parallel to the footwall of the skarn unit.  The northwestern part of the BSN zone is open to the 
south. 
 
Moving  to  the  east  along  the  BSN  zone,  the  upper  portion  of  the  zone  gets  smaller  and  flattens;  the 
upper part connects with the Area 107, as shown in Error! Reference source not found..  The lower and 
upper zones are about 20 to 40-metres thick in this area.  Mineralization shows the same trends as the 
northwestern part of the zone. 
 
At the southern part of the BSN zone, the upper portion of the zone disappears and the lower portion 
flattens, as shown in Error! Reference source not found..  This portion of the zone, called the San Martín 
Zone, frequently shows high-grade mineralization because of the overprint of epithermal mineralization 
on the skarn mineralization.  The southern part of the BSN zone is partially open to the south and may 
connect  with  skarn  mineralization  in  the  lower  part  of  the  Boinás  East  Skarn  Zone.    Mineralization 
generally  trends  parallel  to  the  skarn  unit.  All  of  the  higher  grade  San  Martín  Zone  may  be  at  least 
partially confined within a subvertical geometry defined by the cross-cutting epithermal structure. 
 
Area 107 
 
Area  107  (“A107”)  is  a  20  to  30-metre  wide,  steeply-dipping  fault  zone  that  trends  N15W  and  dips 
approximately 75°  to  the  west.    The  northern  part  of  the  zone  extends  through  the  El  Valle  open  pit, 
where it was known as the El Valle fault zone.  This estimate focuses on  only that portion of the zone 
that is south of the open pit. 
 
The northern part of the A107 Zone, just south of the open pit, is a generally steeply-dipping zone that 
follows down the edge of granite until it intersects the BSN zone below 200 metres elevation, as shown 
in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    The  top  of  the  zone  is  defined  by  a  thrust  fault  that  cuts  off 
mineralization.    Further  to  the  south,  the  geometry  of  the  A107  Zone  becomes  more  complex,  and  it 
flattens  and  bends  so  that  the  lower  parts  of  the  zone  are  offset  by  as  much  as  50  metres  from  the 
projection of the upper part.  Further to the south, the upper portions of the A107 Zone pinch out and 
grades diminish, as shown in Error! Reference source not found..

14.2.3  Mineral Zone Models
Three-dimensional  wireframes  were  used  to  define  solid  objects  that  enclose  the  BSN  and  A107 
mineralization.    Interpretation  was  done  interactively  in  the  Datamine  design  window  as  strings  on 
cross-sections that were linked using the wireframe linking functions.  The wireframes were checked by 
plotting on plan and by viewing in alternate directions.  Wireframes were also checked to ensure that all 
assay intervals identified by the geologist as being inside the zones were actually inside the zones and 
that all other assay intervals were outside the zones.  Problems identified in the plan-map projections 
were  resolved  by  correcting  the  cross-section  interpretations  and  re-linking  the  wireframes.    This 
process continued until all inconsistencies were resolved.  The resulting wireframe solids are shown as 
three-dimensional perspective views in Error! Reference source not found.. 
 
The BSN zone was further divided into an upper zone with near vertical mineralization and a lower zone 
with  flatter-dipping  mineralization.    The  upper  and  lower  zones  were  further  partitioned  into  eastern 
and western portions near the hinge at the northern part of the zone to facilitate interpolation with the 
trend model. 
 
The A107 zone was also divided for purposes of interpolation into an upper, steeply-dipping portion and 
a lower flatter-dipping portion.

Block models were created inside the BSN and Area 107 wireframes using the model parameters shown 
in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    Regular  blocks  of  4x4x4  metres  were  used  for  the  BSN  Zone.  
Regular  blocks  of  1x2x1  metres  were  used  for  the  A107  Zone,  with  the  2-metre  direction  oriented 
north-south, subparallel to the strike of the zone.  Although different block model origins and block sizes 
were  used  for  the  two  zones,  the  block  layout  is  conformable,  and  the  A107  model  can  either  be  an 
independent  model  or  sub-blocks  using  the  BSN  prototype.    Overlapping  blocks  between  the  two 
models were resolved by overprinting the empty BSN model on the A107 model and removing all A107 
blocks that overlapped with the BSN model.

Trend Model 
 
Because the shape of all mineralized zones is too irregular to use simple search ellipses, trend models 
were  developed  to  allow  the  interpolation  to  follow  the  shape  of  the  mineralized  zone.    The  trend 
surface is based on the geologic interpretation by the Orvana on-site geologic staff and is believed to be 
a reasonable interpretation of the continuity of mineralization. It is expected that the trend surface will 
be  modified  to  better  fit  the  actual  continuity  of  the  zone  as  the  mineralization  is  defined  in  greater 
detail by further infill drilling, test mining, and detailed sampling inside the zones.  Continual evaluation 
and  improvement  of  the  trend  surfaces  is  particularly  important  in  the  A107  zone  to  confirm  the 
continuity of higher-grade intersections.  The intersection of the lower and upper portions of the BSN 
zone is also an area where it is difficult to define the trends and further evaluation is recommended. 
The trend model was used for interpolation as follows:
1.
2.
3.
The  distance  between  the  trend  surface  and  the  block-model  block  centroids  was 
measured by calculating the  perpendicular distance between the  block center and the 
nearest face in the trend surface wireframe.  The same procedure was repeated for the 
center-point location of composites.
The block model centroids were rotated so that the model was as close to a horizontal 
plane  as  possible.   The  composite center-point  locations  were  rotated  using  the  same 
parameters.
After  rotation,  the  Z-coordinate  for  the  model  and  composites  was  replaced  with  the 
distance  from  the  trend  surface.    At  this  point,  the  rotated  model  is  analogous  to

P a g e  | 92
1.

3.
Drill  intervals  were  selected  within  the  mineralized  zone  wireframes.  (BSN  and  A107 
Zones).
BSN  composites  were  computed  from  the  BSN  drill-hole  intervals  using  a  nominal 
4-metre  composite  interval.  A minimum of 2  metres of assayed interval was required 
for  compositing.    The  Datamine  compositing  mode  was  set  to  adjust  the  composite 
length so that all drill-hole intervals would be used.
A107  composites  were  computed  from  the  A107  Zone  drill-hole  intervals  using  the 
following procedure:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
Each drill hole was composited over its entire length inside the zone.
The  closest  point  from  the  center  of  the  composite  to  the  trend  surface 
wireframe faces was located.
The  true  thickness  of  the  composite  was  computed.    The  orientation  of  the 
closest face on the trend surface was assumed to define the orientation of the 
zone for computation of true thickness.
Drill  holes  were  re-composited  using  downhole  compositing  with  a  nominal 
composite length of 1 to 5-metres, depending on the ratio of the actual length 
of the composite to the true thickness of the composite, as follows:
Composite Length = integer (Length ÷ True Thickness)
The  above  procedure  ensures  that  the  composites  all  have  approximately 
1-metre true thickness relative to the zone.
14.2.5  Composite Statistics and Grade Distribution
Composite  grade  distributions  were  evaluated  by  compiling  basic  statistics  including  average  grades, 
coefficient  of  variation,  histograms,  and  cumulative  probability  plots,  as  shown  in  Error!  Reference 
source not found. and Error! Reference source not found. through Error! Reference source not found. 
(Note-Because the increase drilling was minor since the previous update, the histograms and cumulative 
probability plots were not updated).  Conclusions from these studies are as follows:
1.
2.
Gold and copper grades in all zones have relatively high variability, with coefficients of 
variation between 1.70 and 3.57. Most of the high variability appears to be caused by 
multiple populations that are intermixed within the zone boundaries.
Gold-grade distributions in the upper and lower parts of the Black Skarn Zone are very 
similar, as shown by the histograms and cumulative frequency plots in Error! Reference 
source  not  found..    The  overall  distribution  appears  to  be  composed  of  three 
populations, as shown in Error! Reference source not found.:
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 93
a.
b.
c.
a  low-grade,  high-variability  population  with  a  median  grade  of  0.33  ppm  Au, 
containing 35% of the total samples;
a  medium-grade, moderate-variability  population  with  a median  grade  of 1.36 
ppm Au containing 61% of the total samples; and
a  high-grade,  high-variability  population  with  a  median  grade  of  5.0  ppm  Au.  
Further analysis to evaluate the geologic and spatial nature of the overlapping 
grade  distributions  is  recommended  for  the  next  resource  update.    This  is 
particularly important for the high-grade population, which contains 28% of the 
total gold in 5% of the samples.
Gold-grade  distributions  in  the  upper  and  lower  parts  of  the  A107  Zone  are  quite 
different and the average grade of the lower zone is 70% higher than the upper zone.  
The  histograms and cumulative  frequency plots in  Error! Reference source not found. 
also  show  a  significant  difference  between  gold  grades  in  the  two  areas.    The  overall 
distribution appears to be composed of three populations, as shown in Error! Reference 
source not found.:
a.
b.
c.
a  spike  of  samples  with  “trace”  amounts  of  gold  with  a  median  grade  of  0.05 
ppm Au, containing 5% of the total samples;
a low-grade, moderate-variability population with a median grade of 0.13 ppm 
Au containing 18% of the total samples; and
a higher-grade, high-variability population with a median grade of 1.06 ppm Au.  
Additional  analysis  is  recommended  to  determine  whether  this  zone  can  be 
subdivided into high-grade and low-grade subzones.
Copper-grade  distributions  are  generally  quite  similar  to  the  gold-grade  distributions 
and  most  of  the  previous  comments  about  gold  distributions  also  apply  to  copper.  
Copper-grade distributions are shown in Error! Reference source not found. and Error!

14.2.6  Variogram Studies
Variogram studies were done on composited gold and silver grades for each model area using Sage 2001 
variogram analysis and modeling software.  (Note – because of the relatively small increase in the data 
since the previous estimate, variograms have not been remodeled.)  Because of the high coefficients of 
variation  and  near-lognormal  distributions,  variograms  were  done  using  log-transformed  grades  with 
the covariance method of variogram calculation.  All variograms were computed using XYZ coordinates 
that were transformed so that the XY-axes are subparallel to the trend and the Z-axis is replaced by the 
distance  from  the  trend  surface  to  the  composite  centroid.    The  rotational  parameters  for  this 
transformation are summarized in Error! Reference source not found..

Variograms were calculated using one or two structures with exponential variogram models and locked 
rotations.  Although  unlocked  rotations  appear  to  give  a  better  fit  to  the  variogram,  locked  rotations 
were  used  for  the  resource  model  variograms  because  Datamine  variograms  are  limited  to  a  single 
rotation.

Exponential variograms use the traditional Sill: 
        γ(h) = 1-exp(-h/A), where A is the range parameter 
 
 F-Values are based on 12x12x4m blocks for BSN and 12x12x1m blocks for Area 107.
Conclusions from the variogram studies are: 
 
Area 107:
Variograms for the A107 Zone are highly anisotropic.  Variograms have much better continuity 
parallel to the trend surface  than crossing the zone. The effective range of continuity for gold 
variograms is 5 metres across the zone, compared to 93 metres and 20 metres for the primary 
and secondary directions running parallel to the trend surface.  The primary axis of continuity is 
rotated approximately 50 degrees counter-clockwise from the dip direction.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 103
The average dip direction is about 238°  azimuth (S58W) and dips about 55°  SW for the  upper 
zone and 20° SW for the lower zone.  The primary axis of continuity plunges within the zone at 
an azimuth of about 195° (S15W). 
 
Copper  variograms  are  very  similar  to  gold  variograms,  but  have  better  continuity  and  longer 
ranges.
Black Skarn North, Upper Portion:
Gold variograms for the upper, subvertical portion of the Black Skarn North Zone have the best 
continuity  horizontally,  parallel  to  the  trend  surface,  with  an  effective  range  of  128  metres.  
Continuity  in  the  vertical  direction  is  only  32  metres  and  is  only  slightly  better  than  the 
continuity perpendicular to the trend, which is 22 metres.  Variograms for copper mineralization 
in this area are poorly defined compared to the gold variograms and it appears that continuity 
parallel  to  the  trend  surface  is  isotropic  with  a  range  of  92  metres,  while  continuity 
perpendicular  to  the  trend  is  shorter  with  a  range  of  22  metres.    Short-range  continuity  for 
copper mineralization is almost isotropic and 80% of the total variability occurs within a distance 
of 10 metres.
Black Skarn North, Lower Portion:
Gold variograms for the lower, flatter-dipping portion of the Black Skarn North Zone are nearly 
isotropic parallel to the zone, with an effective range of 230 metres.  Continuity perpendicular to 
the  zoning  is  much  less,  with  an  effective  range  of  only  11  metres.    A  zonal  component  is 
observed  in  the  variograms  parallel  to  the  zoning,  which  does  not  reach  the  sill  within  the 
maximum extent of the experimental variogram.  The zonal component suggests layered zones 
of mineralization oriented parallel to the trend surface. 
 
Copper  variograms  are  similar  to  gold  variograms,  except  that  the  zonal  component  is  only 
shown in the direction oriented parallel to the strike of the zones.
14.2.7  Grade Estimation
Grade  estimation  was  done  with 
inverse-distance-power  (IDP)  estimation  methods  using  the 
composited data within each zone as the data source.  Because the drilling was not done on a grid and 
has  a  very  irregular  spacing,  the  search  parameters  were  defined  to  ensure  that  a  representative 
selection of data was made for grade estimation, as follows:
1.
2.
the  number  of  composites  selected  from  any  single  hole  was  limited  to  1  or  2 
composites; and  
the Datamine search-ellipse expansion feature was used so that the search ellipse would 
be as small as possible and still provide adequate data for grade estimation.
All  estimation  was  done  using  block  and  composite  coordinates  transformed  relative  to  the  trend 
surface, as described previously in variogram studies.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 104
A  nearest-neighbor  estimation  (NN)  was  also  done  to  check  the  IDP  results  and  to  determine  the 
amount of smoothing in the IDP estimate, as measured by the smoothing ratio.  The smoothing ratio is 
defined  by  the  ratio  of  the  relative  variance  of  IDP  estimates  to  the  relative  variance  of  the  NN 
estimates.    A  targeted  smoothing  ratio  was  estimated  based  on  the  F-function  and  the  modeled 
variograms.  If the smoothing ratio was lower that the target smoothing ratio, the power was increased, 
the  number  of  selected  points  was  decreased,  and/or  the  search  radius  was  decreased.    If  the 
smoothing ratio was too high, the power was decreased, the number of selected points was increased, 
and/or  the search  radius was  increased.    Comparison  of  the  IDP  and  NN  estimates  is  shown  in  Error! 
Reference  source  not  found..    Resource  estimation  parameters  are  summarized  in  Error!  Reference

Gold grades  were  capped at  30 ppm Au in the BSN Zone  and 100 ppm Au in the A107 Zone.  Copper 
grades were capped at 10% Cu in the BSN and 8% Cu in A107.  Implementation of grade caps reduces 
the contained ounces of gold by about 8% and the contained tonnage of copper by about 10%.  Further 
evaluation  of  grade  distributions  is  recommended  to  determine  whether  high-grade  zones  can  be 
defined and modeled.  If continuous areas of high-grade mineralization can be defined, it is possible that 
grade caps can be increased in those areas.

14.2.8  Resource Classification
Resource classification was done based on drill-hole spacing as follows:
The drill-hole spacing was measured using the kriging variance from an ordinary-kriging, 
point  estimation  with  an  isotropic,  near-zero  nugget,  and  slope  of  0.5.    This  kriging 
variance  is  equal  to  the  distance  from  the  nearest  sample  if  the  estimated  point  is 
outside the data and is about 28% of the grid spacing when the point is at the center of 
a square drill-hole grid.

14.2.10 Black  Skarn  North  and  Area  107  –  Recommendations  for  Future  Resource
Estimation
The following recommendations are made for improvement of the resource models as the models are 
updated through infill drilling and with underground development within the zones:
Evaluate  separation of skarn  zones  into the  low-grade,  calcic  skarns  and  higher-grade, 
magnesic skarns for purposes of resource estimation.

6.
Better  define  the  high-grade  (+6  ppm  Au)  portions  of  the  BSN  Zone  to  determine 
whether  higher  grade  caps  are  possible,  particularly  in  the  San  Martín  Zone  and  the 
northwestern part of the zone where it is intersected by the Charnela Zone.
Extend  the  Black  Skarn  Zone  model  upwards  and  integrate  it  with  the  Charnela  Zone 
model to provide a seamless interpretation in that area.
Determine whether different trend models are required for gold and copper in the A107 
Zone.
Use  the  closer-spaced  infill  drilling  and  drifting  in  the  A107  Zone  to  refine  the  trend 
model for linking mineralization between drill holes.
Create an oxidation model for the BSN and Area 107 Zones for use in estimating density, 
metallurgical recoveries, and costs.  Particular attention should be paid to the presence 
of native copper in the A107 Zone.
14.3
S107 Zone Resources
A  resource  model  was  created  for  the  South  107  Zone  (“S107”)  in  February  2010.    This  is  the  first 
estimate  for  this  zone,  which  was  newly  discovered  and  was  not  previously  included  in  the  resource.  
The S107 zone is a near-vertical, vein-like zone located just south of the southern limit of the A107 zone.  
It is just to the east and below the San Martín Zone.
14.3.1  Drill Hole Data
The  zone  is  currently  defined  by  9  drill  holes,  which  are  all  from  the  KGC  and  Orvana  underground 
drilling programs in 2007 through 2009.  Drilling lengths are summarized in Error! Reference source not 
found..

14.3.2  Mineral Zone Model
A three-dimensional wireframe model was used to limit the resource.  The wireframe was created using 
interpreted outlines  of  the  mineralized  zone  on cross-sections  looking  N35E.   The  zone  was  extended 
approximately  30  metres  below  the  bottom  of  the  drilling,  20  metres  above  the  top,  and  about  25 
metres  northeast  and  southwest  of  the  lateral  extent  of  the  drilling.    The  zone  is  a  relatively  simple 
tabular shape  dipping about  75° to the  northwest.  The wireframe was  filled with blocks  to create an 
empty block model with the size and location parameters shown in Error! Reference source not found..

Grade Zoning 
 
Grade zoning was not used for the S107 estimate. 
 
Compositing 
 
Compositing  was  done  using  the  method  described  for  the  El  Valle  Fault  Zone  in  Section  Error! 
Reference  source  not  found..    Composite  intervals  perpendicular  to  the  structures  were  nominally 
1-metre in length.
14.3.3  Grade Estimation
Grade estimation was done with inverse-distance-power (IDP) estimation using a similar method to that 
used  for  the  A107  Zone.    Because  of  the  small  number  of  holes  that  currently  intersect  the  zone, 
however,  the  estimation  parameters  were  not  further  optimized  using  the  variance-smoothing-ratio 
procedure.  Grade capping and estimation parameters are shown in Error! Reference source not found. 
and Error! Reference source not found..

El Valle Fault, East Breccia, Area 208, and East 107 Resource Estimates
The resource model for the El Valle Fault Zone (EVF) was updated by ORE during December 2008, and 
the model for the East Breccia Zone (EBX) was updated in January 2009.  In addition, two new models 
were created for the Area 208 Zone (A208) and the East 107 Zone (E107) in January 2009.  The resource 
models were  created by ORE  using Datamine  Studio 3 software  with wireframe interpretations of the 
zone  geometry  and  block  model  grades  estimated  using 
interpolation.  
Wireframed trend surfaces were used to provide directional control for estimation.

The  A208  and  E107  estimates  are  new  estimates  for  mineralization that  was  identified  previously  but 
had not been modeled.  The other two estimates, the EVF and EBX Zones, replace resource models that 
were done by ORE for RNGM in February 2002.  The locations of the new and updated zones are shown

14.4.1  Drill Hole Data
The drill-hole data used for these models is a subset of the El Valle-Boinás drill-hole database.  Most of 
the drilling is historical surface  drilling that was  done by RNGM. Three KGC surface  holes  were  drilled 
into the A208 zone in 2007, and two of those holes also intersected the EVF zone.  The E107 Zone, which 
is  located  in  the  footwall  of  the  A107,  is  intersected  by  five  RNGM  underground  holes  and  one  KGC 
underground hole.  Drilling lengths are summarized by zone in Error! Reference source not found. and 
drill-hole locations are shown relative to the El Valle pit in Error! Reference source not found..

14.4.2  Mineral Zones
East 107 Zone 
 
The East 107 Zone (E107) is located along the contact between the sandstone and marble/dolomite in 
the footwall (east side) of the A107 zone.  Mineralization strikes northeasterly and dips 40° to 60° to the 
southwest.   Based on  intersections of  drilling  into sandstone  above  the  zone  and  dolomite  below  the 
zone, it is possible that this zone extends updip to the north to join with the A208 zone.  Mineralization 
is  believed  to  follow  parallel  to  the  zone,  but  much  of  the  drilling  is  subparallel  to  the  zone  and 
mineralization  trends  are  difficult  to  define.  The  relationship  of  the  E107  to  A107  is  shown  in  Error! 
Reference source not found. (Section 1).  Mineralization is oxidized breccias and clays. 
 
El Valle Fault 
 
The EVF Zone, which was one of the major mineralized zones in the El Valle open pit, is a N15E-striking 
fault zone with a width of 10 metres to 50 metres.  The dip of the zone is near vertical, but the north end 
of the fault dips slightly to the east and the south end of the zone dips slightly to the west.  The zone 
appears to pinch out  to the  north, although this may be  an artifact of the  sparse  drilling to the  north 
since the overall trend of mineralization continues northward for several kilometres. 
 
The south end of the EVF Zone connects to the A107 zone.  The connection between the two zones is 
complex,  however,  as the EVF Zone  is offset approximately 30  metres to 50  metres west of the A107 
Zone and the two zones connect through a broad NW-SE trending zone that does not parallel either of 
the main zones.  Mineralization is oxidized breccias and clays  and appears to be  similar to that in the 
upper parts of the A107 Zone.  Mineralization is open at depth.  The EVF Zone is shown in relation to the 
A208  and  EBX  Zones  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found.  to  Error!  Reference  source  not  found. 
(Sections 2 to 4). 
 
Area 208 Zone  
 
The A208 Zone is a north-south striking, east-dipping zone of breccia-type mineralization that is located 
just east of the EVF Zone.  It dips 30° to 40° to the east and mineralization is believed to dip parallel to 
the  zone,  but  much  of  the  drilling  is  subparallel  to  the  zone  and  mineralization  trends  are  difficult  to 
define.  Mineralization is generally near the contact between dolomite and overlying sandstones, but in 
some areas mineralization appears to be in sandstone. Mineralization is also frequently associated with 
late porphyry intrusives. The A208 Zone is shown in relation to the EVF Zone in Error! Reference source 
not found. (Section 3). 
 
East Breccia Zone 
 
The  EBX  Zone  is  a  west-dipping  zone  of  breccia  mineralization  on  a  west-dipping  contact  between 
dolomite and overlying sandstones.  It terminates on the EVF to the west and is bounded by the A208 
zone to the south. It is terminated updip to the east by an east-dipping fault.  The EBX Zone is shown in 
Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found..

14.4.3  Mineral Zone Models
Three-dimensional  wireframes  were  used  to  define  solid  objects  that  enclose  the  mineralized  zones.  
Interpretation was done interactively in the Datamine design window  as strings on cross-sections that 
were linked using the  wireframe linking functions.  The wireframes  were then checked by plotting on 
plan  and  by  viewing  in  alternate  directions.    Wireframes  were  also  checked  to  ensure  that  all  assay 
intervals identified by the geologist as being inside the zones were actually inside the zones and that all 
other  assay  intervals  were  outside  the  zones.    Problems  identified  in  the  plan-map  projections  were 
resolved  by  correcting  the  cross-section  interpretations  and  re-linking  the  wireframes.    This  process 
continued until all inconsistencies were resolved. 
 
Although most of the interpretation is based on drill-hole assays and geologic logging, the interpretation 
for the EVF Zone also relied on data from the grade-control drilling in the El Valle open pit. 
 
The A208 and E107 Zones were combined into a single wireframe model for purposes of modeling, since 
they both appear to be related to the same dolomite-sandstone contact.  The block models were divided 
into  the  two  zones  at  4,795,950N,  at  a  point  where  the  strike  of  the  zone  changed  from  generally 
north-south  to  northeasterly.  Overlapping  volumes  between  the  A107  and  the  E107  wireframes  were 
resolved by clipping the E107 wireframe with the A107 wireframe.  Overlapping volumes  between the 
A208  and  the  EVF  were  resolved  by  clipping  the  A208  wireframe  with  the  EVF  wireframe.    The  A208 
wireframe was also clipped to remove any portions above the mined-out topography of the El Valle pit.  
The EBX wireframe was clipped by the EVF wireframe to remove any overlap in those zones. 
 
Block  models  were  created  within  the  wireframes  using  the  model  parameters  shown  in  Error! 
Reference source not found..  Regular blocks of 1x2x1 metres were used for all zones, and the layout of 
the blocks is conformable with the block-model prototype for the A107 Zone.  A single prototype was 
used for creation of the block models, so the models could be merged to resolve overlapping blocks. 
 
Overlapping  blocks  between  the  A208  and  EBX  were  resolved  by  adding  the  two  models  and 
overprinting A208 blocks with EBX blocks.  A208/EBX overlaps were resolved at the block-model stage 
rather than with the  wireframes so that composites in the overlap area, which could belong to either 
zone, were available for estimation of both zones.  A MINED code, set to 1.0 for mined blocks and 0.0 for 
unmined blocks was used in the EVF model to identify material that has been removed in the open pit.

14.4.4  Trend Models
Because the shape of all mineralized zones is too irregular to use simple search ellipses, trend models 
were developed to allow the interpolation to follow the shape of the mineralized zone.  The location of 
the trend for these models is based on the general shape of the zones and a visual interpretation of the 
continuity  of  mineralization.    The  primary  objective  in  developing  the  trend  shapes  was  to  provide 
generally  reasonable  shapes  rather  than  to  simply  connect  high-grade  samples  to  other  high-grade 
samples.    The  trend  for  the  EVF  Zone  was  fine-tuned  using  detailed  information  from  open-pit 
grade-control samples. 
 
The trend model was used for interpolation as follows:
1.
2.
The  distance  between  the  trend  surface  and  the  block-model  block  centroids  was 
measured by calculating the  perpendicular distance between the  block center and the 
nearest face in the trend surface wireframe.  The same procedure was repeated for the 
center-point location of composites.
The block model centroids were rotated so that the model was as close to a horizontal 
plane  as  possible.   The  composite center-point  locations  were  rotated  using  the  same 
parameters.

P a g e  | 123
3.
After  rotation,  the  Z-coordinate  for  the  model  and  composites  was  replaced  with  the 
distance  from  the  trend  surface.    At  this  point,  the  rotated  model  is  analogous  to 
projecting the mineralized zone into a longitudinal view and flattening it parallel to the 
trend surface.  The rotation parameters are summarized in Error! Reference source not 
found..
The resulting XTREND values are banded parallel to trend surfaces.

14.4.5  Grade Zoning
A  problem  observed  previously  in  the  A107  Zone  is  that  the  mineralized  zone  appears  to  contain  a 
mineralized population with significant gold grades and a very low-grade population with grades below 
0.1 ppm gold.  The grade populations do not have a clear break, however, so it is difficult to create grade 
zones based on gold grade by itself. 
 
After reviewing the early estimation method that was used for the open-pit resource estimate for the 
EVF  Zone  and  reviewing  the  detailed  sampling  from  the  pit  grade-control,  the  following  method  was 
developed to partition the data into high-grade and low-grade populations:
Drill-hole assay data were selected that fell inside the mineral zone wireframe.
BHID, FROM, TO, and gold grade were exported to ExcelTM for the selected portions of 
drill holes.
Intervals above 0.75 ppm were assigned a HILOW code of 1.  Intervals below 0.1 were 
assigned a HILOW code of 0.
Intervals  between  0.1  and  0.75  were  color-coded  red  to  make  them  stand  out;  the 
HILOW code for these samples is initially blank.  These samples are in the region where 
the  low-grade  and  high-grade  zones  overlap,  and  could  be  in  either  the  high-grade  or 
low-grade population.
The  missing  HILOW  codes  were  entered  based  on  the  general  grade  of  adjacent 
samples.  Missing HILOW codes in generally low-grade intervals were assigned a HILOW 
code  of  0.    HILOW  codes  in  generally  higher-grade  intervals  were  assigned  a  HILOW 
code of 1.  Emphasis was placed on creating generally continuous zones.

6.
A few isolated samples above 0.75 ppm Au were recoded to the low-grade zone and a 
few samples below 0.1 ppm Au were recoded to the high-grade zone to maintain better 
continuity of the zoning intervals.
The  results  of  the  partitioned  populations  are  shown  for  the  EVF  Zone  as  lognormal  histograms  and 
cumulative frequency plots in Error! Reference source not found..  The histograms for the partitioned 
populations are nearly symmetrical and bell shaped.  The low-grade distribution appears to have a few 
too  many  higher-grade  samples  and  the  mineralized  population  appears  to  be  a  little  short  on 
lower-grade samples.  Overall, however, the partitioning method appears to provide grade distributions 
that are reasonable for grade estimation.

14.4.6  Composting
Drill-hole intervals inside the mineralized zones were composited as follows:

2.
a. 
 
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
Drill intervals were selected within the mineralized zone wireframes.
Composites  were  computed  using  the  following  procedure,  which  is  designed  to  provide 
composites that are as close as possible to 1 metre true thickness relative to the zone.
The HILOW code was merged to the drill-hole file.
Drill holes were composited to the full length of each HILOW interval, with a maximum 
interval length of 30 metres.
The  closest  point  from  the  center  of  the  composites  to  the  trend  surface  wireframe 
faces was located.
The true thicknesses of the composites were computed.  The orientation of the closest 
face  on  the  trend  surface  was  assumed  to  define  the  orientation  of  the  zone  for 
computation of true thickness.
Drill  holes  were  recomposited  using  downhole  compositing  with  a  nominal  composite 
length of 1 to 10-metres, depending on the ratio of the actual length of the composite 
to the true thickness of the composite, as follows:
Composite Length = integer (Length ÷ True Thickness)
The above procedure ensures that the composites all have approximately 1 metre true 
thickness relative to the zone.
14.4.7  Composite Statistics and Grade Distribution
Composite  grade  distributions  were  evaluated  by  compiling  basic  statistics,  including  average  grades, 
coefficient  of  variation,  histograms,  and  cumulative  probability  plots,  as  shown  in  Error!  Reference 
source  not  found.,  Error!  Reference  source  not  found.,  and  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..  
Conclusions from these studies are as follows:
1.
2.
Gold in all zones has relatively high variability, with coefficients of variation between 1.6 
and 3.5. Much of the high variability appears to be caused by multiple populations that 
are intermixed within the zone boundaries and variability is significantly reduced when 
composites are classified into low-grade and mineralized (higher-grade) subpopulations 
using  the  HILOW  flag.    Grade  distributions  are  quite  similar  in  all  zones,  as  shown  in 
Error! Reference source not found..
Copper  grade  in  these  zones  does  not  follow  the  same  zoning  patterns  as  gold  and 
classification  according  to  the  gold  HILOW  flag  does  not  partition  the  samples  into 
populations that are clearly different, as shown in Error! Reference source not found..

14.4.8  Variogram Studies
Variogram studies were done on grade-control gold data for the EVF Zone using Sage 2001 variogram 
analysis  and  modeling  software.    Because  of  the  high  coefficients  of  variation  and  near-lognormal 
distributions,  variograms  were  done  using  log-transformed  grades  with  the  covariance  method  of 
variogram calculation.  All variograms were computed using XYZ coordinates that were transformed so 
that the XY-axes are subparallel to the trend and the Z-axis is replaced by the distance from the trend 
surface to the composite centroid. 
 
Variograms  were  calculated  using  two  structures  with  exponential  variogram  models  and  locked 
rotations.    Variograms  indicate  two  structural  components:  a  long  range  component  that  is  nearly 
isotropic and a short-range component with more than 3-times the continuity in the vertical direction 
compared  to  the  horizontal.    Continuity  crossing  the  zone  is  about  1/7  the  continuity  following  the 
trend.  While the experimental variograms have  an effective  range of about  15  metres parallel to the 
trend,  there  are  several  factors that  suggest  that  variogram  ranges  may  actually  be  longer.    First, the 
experimental  variograms were  computed  using  all  grade-control  data without  regard  to  grade  zoning, 
and  it  is  likely  that  using  grade  zones  would  improve  the  variograms.    Second,  the  high  anisotropy 
perpendicular to the trend shortens the continuity parallel to the trend if there are even small errors in 
the location of the trend. 
 
The  variogram  model  parameters  are  summarized  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    Variogram 
models are shown in Error! Reference source not found..  Variograms were not prepared for the E107, 
A208, and EBX zones, because insufficient data are available to get meaningful variograms.

14.4.9  El Valle Fault Detailed Model from Pit Grade-Control Data
A detailed model was prepared for the mined-out portion of the EVF zone using closely spaced (2.5 to 
5-metre) grade-control data.  This model was then used as a basis of comparison for the model prepared 
from  exploration  data.    Estimates  were  prepared  using  ordinary  kriging,  inverse-distance-power,  and 
nearest-neighbor.    Because  of  time  constraints,  HILOW  zones  were  not  implemented  for  the  detailed 
model, and review of the results indicated that the kriged model was slightly over-smoothed and was 
smearing the contact between low-grade and mineralized material.  The effects of over-smoothing are 
minimized in the IDP model, which is believed to be the better model for validating and optimizing the 
parameters for the resource model.  Parameters for estimation of the mined-out model are summarized 
in Error! Reference source not found..

14.4.10 Grade Estimation
Grade  estimation  was  done  with  inverse-distance-power  (IDP)  estimation  using  the  composited  data 
within each zone as the data source.  Because the drilling was not done on a grid and has a very irregular 
spacing, the search parameters were defined to ensure that a representative selection of data was made 
for grade estimation, as follows:
1.
2.
the  number  of  composites  selected  from  any  single  hole  was  limited  to  1  or  2 
composites;
the  Datamine  search-ellipse  expansion  feature  was  used  so  that  the  search  ellipse 
would be as small as possible and still provide adequate data for grade estimation.
All  estimation  was  done  using  block  and  composite  coordinates  transformed  relative  to  the  trend 
surface, as described previously in variogram studies. 
 
A  nearest-neighbor  estimation  (NN)  was  also  done  to  check  the  IDP  results  and  to  determine  the 
amount of smoothing in the IDP estimate, as measured by the smoothing ratio.  The smoothing ratio is 
defined by the ratio of the relative variance of IDP estimates to the relative variance of NN estimates.  A 
targeted smoothing ratio was  estimated based on the  F-function and the  modeled variograms.  If the 
smoothing  ratio  was  lower  that  the  target  smoothing  ratio,  the  power  was  increased,  the  number  of 
selected points was decreased, and/or the search radius was decreased.  If the smoothing ratio was too 
high, the power was decreased, the number of selected points was increased, and/or the search radius 
was  increased.    Comparison  of  the  IDP  and  NN  estimates  is  shown  in  Error!  Reference  source  not 
found..

Grade  zones  were  assigned  to  model  blocks  using  NN  assignment  of  the  HILOW  code  to  blocks.    The 
grade  zone boundary was treated as a hard boundary for estimation of grades in the low-grade  zone, 
but higher-grade composites from the low-grade zone were used to estimate grades in the mineralized 
zone.    Capping  grades  were  set  at  appropriate  levels  for  each  grade  zone,  as  summarized  in  Error! 
Reference source not found.. 
 
Parameters  for  the  El  Valle  Fault  Zone  were  refined  to  minimize  the  error  in  the  tonnage-grade 
distribution relative to the mined-out model that was prepared from grade-control data.  As shown in 
Error! Reference source  not  found.,  the  comparison  between  the  resource  model  and  the mined-out 
model is excellent for gold, but the resource copper model is biased low by 10% to 15% relative to the 
mined-out model. This bias is likely caused by the use of the gold grade zones for estimation of copper 
grade.  The bias does not significantly affect the overall resource, which is dominated by gold grade, and 
improvements  to  the  model  to  reduce  the  copper-grade  bias  were  not  addressed.    The  resource 
estimation parameters are summarized in Table 14-.

14.4.11 Resource Classification
Resource classification was done based on drill-hole spacing as follows:

P a g e  | 136

4.
The drill-hole spacing was measured using the kriging variance from an ordinary-kriging, 
point  estimation  with  an  isotropic,  near-zero  nugget,  and  slope  of  0.5.    This  kriging 
variance  is  equal  to  the  distance  from  the  nearest  sample  if  the  estimated  point  is 
outside the data and is about 28% of the grid spacing when the point is at the center of 
a square drill-hole grid.
Resource classes were assigned to each block using the parameters in Error! Reference 
source not found.8.
No resources are classified as measured for the EVF Zone because little of the remaining 
resource is drilled with spacing sufficient to justify measured.  In addition, much of the 
drilling in the EVF Zone is vertical and is subparallel to the trend of the mineralization.
All resources are classified as inferred in the EBX, A208, and E107 zones because of the 
widely spaced drilling in those areas.

14.5  West Skarn Zone
The West Skarn Zone is a small tabular zone consisting primarily of skarns on the west side of the El Valle 
open pit.  Resources for this zone are estimated using the El Valle open-pit block model, which was last 
updated in February 2002 and continues to be valid for the portion of resource that remains below the 
open pit.  The geologic model was based on a three-dimensional interpretation by RNGM.  Estimation 
used  inverse-distance-power  estimation  within  grade  zones.    Grade  zones  were  created  using 
nearest-neighbor assignment within zones based on the geologic model.  The block model block size was 
4x4x4 metres. 
 
The  West  Skarn  Zone  resource  is  summarized  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    The  resource 
model estimation parameters are summarized in Error! Reference source not found..

Boinás East Area
Resources are estimated in the Boinás East  Area for four mineralized zones,  including the Boinás East 
Skarn Zone, the Boinás East High Angle Zones, the Sienna Zone, and the Boinás South Zone, as shown in 
Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    The  Boinás  model  was  completely  redone  in  2011  by  ORE  to 
include  additional  drilling  by  Orvana  in  2011  that  extended  the  Boinás  East  Zone  to  west.    The  2011 
Boinás  East  model  replaces  earlier  two  models  for  the  zone.    The  Boinás  East  High  Angle  Zones,  the 
Sienna Zone, and the Boinás South Zone resource models were updated by ORE in May 2009 using the 
same method that was developed for the El Valle Fault Zone.  The Boinás East High Angle Zones and the 
Sienna Zone were previously estimated using the resource model that was used during open pit mining 
at Boinás East.  The new drilling in the Boinás East Zone extended that resource so that it overlapped 
with the Boinás South Zone and the Boinás South resource was adjusted to remove the overlap.

14.6.1  Boinás East Mineral Zones
The  Boinás  East  Skarn  Zone  was  remodeled  by  ORE  in  2011  to  create  a  new  model  that  includes  all 
mineralization in that deposit.  This model replaces the previous “Upper Levels” model, also known as 
the Monica Zone model, and the “Open Pit”, lower levels, model, which had been carried forward from 
an  early  open-pit  resource  model.    The  new  model  uses  4x4x4  metre  blocks  to  estimate  the  entire 
Boinás  East  Skarn  Zone  between  -120 metres  elevation  and  460 metres  elevation  using  the 
trend-surface  method  that  was  used  for  other  deposits  in  the  El  Valle-Boinás  area.    The  deposit  was 
modeled as three lens: the “Main Lens”, which contains the bulk of the mineralization in a band of skarn 
along  the  southern  contact  with  the  Boinás  granite  intrusive;  the  Southeast  Lens,  which  is  a  south  to 
southeast  trending  splay  off  of  the Main  Lens;  and  the  Northwest  Lens,  which  is  a  EW  trending  splay 
from  the  Main  Zone.    The  Northwest  Lens  overlaps  with  the  east  edge  of  the  Boinás  South  Zone.    A 
general layout of the Boinás East Lenses is shown in Error! Reference source not found..

The geologic model was based on a 3-dimensional interpretation of the skarn envelope that was divided 
into  three  lenses  based  on  the  dominant  trend  of  mineralization.    In  the  previous  2010  Boinás  East 
model the skarn envelope was overprinted by a 3-dimensional interpretation of four high-angle zones.  
The  high-angle  zones  crosscut  the  skarn  at  nearly  a  90°  angle  and  locally  enhance  gold  and  copper 
grades.    The  high  angle  zones  were  not  modeled  for  the  new  model  as  it  was  determined  that  the 
additional detail did not improve the accuracy of the model at the bulk mining scale that is planned for 
the deposit.  Combining the two previous models into a single model puts the entire zone into a single 
model that conforms to the global resource prototype and replaces two older models that needed to be 
updated.
14.6.4  Trend Models
Trend models were developed for each of the three lenses to provide control for interpolation of gold 
and copper grades.  These trends were based on trend-line interpretations in plan view that were then 
wireframed to form trend surface models.  The trend distance was extended to composites and blocks

14.6.5  Grade Estimation and Resource Classes
Gold  and  copper  grades  were  estimated  for  blocks  using  inverse-distance-power  interpolation.  Global 
caps  were  set  for  all  lenses  and  are  summarized  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..      The  same 
search parameters were used for all metals in a lens and are summarized in Error! Reference source not 
found..  Estimation parameters are summarized for gold, copper, silver, and arsenic in Error! Reference 
source not found. to Error! Reference source not found.. 
 
Resource  classes  were  defined  according  to  the  drilling  grid,  measured  parallel  to  the  trend  of 
mineralization.  A resource block was classified as measured if the surrounding drilling grid was less than 
15 metres.  Blocks were classified as indicated between 15 and 30 metres drilling grid. All other blocks 
were classified as inferred.

Boinás South, Boinás High Angle Zones, and Sienna Zone Resources
New  resource  models  were  created  for  the  Boinás  South  Zone,  the  Boinás  High  Angle  Zones,  and  the 
Sienna Zone in May 2009 as part of an ongoing effort by KGC to upgrade resources previously estimated 
from the earlier models that were created by ORE for open-pit mining.  The Boinás South Zone is a new 
estimate  that  was  not  previously  included  in  the  resource.  Although  this  model  has  not  been 
recalculated, it has been revised to remove the overlap with the new Boinás East model.
14.7.1  Drill Hole Data
The drill-hole data used for these models is primarily historical surface drilling that was done by RNGM. 
Three KGC surface holes were drilled into the A208 zone in 2007 and two of those holes also intersected 
the EVF zone.  The E107 Zone, which is located in the footwall of the A107, is intersected by five RNGM 
underground holes and one KGC underground hole.  Drilling lengths are summarized by zone in  Error!

Boinás South Zone 
 
The Boinás South Zone is located in the contact between granite and limestone along a lobe of granite 
that extends southward from the main Boinás intrusion.  The Boinás South skarn mineralization wraps 
around the south and east margins of granite and curves under the bottom.  The west side of the zone is 
split in two by an unmineralized, near-vertical porphyry dike.  
 
High Angle Zones 
 
The High Angle Zones are a set of steeply dipping, N55E striking fault zones.  These zones are locally well 
mineralized with epithermal mineralization.  Five different high-angle zones are included in this model. 
Although  this  model  has  not  been  recalculated,  it  has  been  revised  to  remove  the  overlap  with  the 
updated Boinás East model. 
 
Sienna Zone  
 
The  Sienna  Zone  was  the primary  source  of ore  for the  Boinás  East  open  pit.   It  is  a  zone  of  clay-rich 
breccia  formed  in  a  thrust-fault  that  dips  to  the  southeast  and  is  locally  up  to  60  metres  thick.  
Mineralization  forms  in  shoots  that  are  sometimes  parallel  to  the  overall  geometry  of  the  zone  and 
sometime cross-cut the zone.

14.7.3  Mineral Zone Models
Three-dimensional  wireframes  were  used  to  define  solid  objects  that  enclose  the  mineralized  zones.  
Interpretation was done interactively in the Datamine design window as strings on cross-sections that 
were linked using the  wireframe linking functions.  The wireframes  were then checked by plotting on 
plan  and  by  viewing  in  alternate  directions.    Wireframes  were  also  checked  to  ensure  that  all  assay 
intervals identified by the geologist as being inside the zones were actually inside the zones and that all 
other  assay  intervals  were  outside  the  zones.    Problems  identified  in  the  plan-map  projections  were 
resolved  by  correcting  the  cross-section  interpretations  and  re-linking  the  wireframes.    This  process 
continued  until  all  inconsistencies  were  resolved.    Block  model  size  and  location  parameters  are 
summarized in Error! Reference source not found.. 
 
In some cases, the wireframes for the individual High-Angle subzones overlapped; overlapping blocks in 
the block model were resolved by giving priority to the blocks from the higher-numbered subzone (the 
most  easterly,  since  the  zones  were  numbered  from  east  to  west).    Where  High-Angle  Zone  blocks 
overlapped with the Sienna Zone model, the High-Angle Zone blocks were removed.  High-Angle Zone 
and  Sienna  Zone  blocks  inside  the  Monica  Zone  wireframe  were  also  removed  from  the  models.    A 
MINED code, set to 1.0 for mined blocks and 0.0 for unmined blocks, was used to identify material that 
was removed in the open pit.

Grade Zoning 
 
Grade  zoning  was  done  for  gold  using  the  same  general  procedure  as  was  used  previously  for  the  El 
Valle Fault Zone in Section Error! Reference source not found..  Because of the lower overall grade of 
the Boinás South Zone, a lower crossover point of 0.2 ppm Au is used to differentiate the low-grade and 
high-grade populations. 
 
Compositing 
 
Compositing  was  done  using  the  method  described  for  the  El  Valle  Fault  Zone  in  Section  Error! 
Reference  source  not  found..    Composite  intervals  perpendicular  to  the  structures  were  nominally  1 
metre for the High Angle Zones and 2 metres for both Boinás South and the Sienna Zone.
14.7.4  Composite Statistics and Grade Distribution
Composite  grade  distributions  were  evaluated  by  compiling  basic  statistics  including  average  grades, 
coefficient  of  variation,  histograms,  and  cumulative  probability  plots,  as  shown  in  Error!  Reference 
source  not  found.  and  Error!  Reference  source  not  found.  and  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..  
Conclusions from these studies are as follows:
1.
Gold in all zones has relatively high variability, with coefficients of variation between 2.5 
and 4.0. Much of the high variability appears to be caused by multiple populations that 
are intermixed within the zone boundaries, and variability is significantly reduced when 
composites are classified into low-grade and mineralized (higher-grade) subpopulations 
using the HILOW flag.  Grade distributions are quite similar in the Sienna Zone and the 
High Angle Zones, as shown in Error! Reference source not found..  A small population 
of high-grade outliers with grades above 100 ppm Au is observed in the Sienna Zone.
The  Boinás  South  Zone  is significantly  lower  grade  than  the other  two  zones,  which  is 
consistent  with  a  general  observation  that  epithermal  mineralization  in  the  El 
Valle-Boinás  area  tends  to  be  higher  grade  than  skarn  mineralization.    The  higher 
gold-grade  population  at  Boinás  South  is  asymmetric  with  more  high-grade  samples 
than would be suggested by a perfectly symmetric population.  An additional high-grade 
subpopulation is suggested that may be significant for further exploration of this zone.

Copper grade in these zones is generally higher grade in the HI Zones than in the LOW 
Zones, but the relative difference in grade is much less than for gold, as shown in Error!

14.7.5  Grade Estimation
Grade  estimation  was  done  with  inverse-distance-power  (IDP)  estimation  using  the  composited  data 
within each zone as the data source.  Because the drilling was not done on a grid and has a very irregular 
spacing, the search parameters were defined to ensure that a representative selection of data was made 
for grade estimation, as follows:
1.
2.
the  number  of  composites  selected  from  any  single  hole  was  limited  to  1  or  2 
composites;
the Datamine search-ellipse expansion feature was used so that the search ellipse would 
be small as possible and still provide adequate data for grade estimation.
All  estimation  was  done  using  block  and  composite  coordinates  transformed  relative  to  the  trend 
surface using the same procedure that was used for the El Valle Fault. 
 
A  nearest-neighbor  estimation  (NN)  was  also  done  to  check  the  IDP  results  and  to  determine  the 
amount of smoothing in the IDP estimate, as measured by the smoothing ratio.  The smoothing ratio is 
defined by the ratio of the relative variance of IDP estimates to the relative variance of NN estimates.  A 
targeted smoothing ratio was  estimated based on  the  F-function and the  modeled variograms.  If the 
smoothing  ratio  was  lower  that  the  target  smoothing  ratio,  the  power  was  increased,  the  number  of 
selected points was decreased, and/or the search radius was decreased.  If the smoothing ratio was too 
high, the power was decreased, the number of selected points was increased, and/or the search radius 
was  increased.    Comparison  of  the  IDP  and  NN  estimates  is  shown  in  Error!  Reference  source  not 
found.. 
 
Grade  zones  were  assigned  to  model  blocks  using  NN  assignment  of  the  HILOW  code  to  blocks.    The 
grade  zone boundary was treated as a hard boundary for estimation of grades in the low-grade  zone, 
but higher-grade composites from the low-grade zone were used to estimate grades in the mineralized 
zone.    Capping  grades  were  set  at  appropriate  levels  for  each  grade  zone,  as  summarized  in  Error! 
Reference  source  not  found..    Resource  estimation  parameters  are  summarized  in  Error!  Reference

14.7.6  Resource Classification
Resource classification was done using the drill-hole spacing as described previously for the El Valle Fault 
Zone in Section Error! Reference source not found., with the following exceptions:
1.
2.
3.
The  entire  Boinás South resource is classified as inferred because  of the relatively low 
density of drilling in that zone. 
 
The  entire  High  Angle  Zone  resource  is  classified  as  inferred  because  of  the  relatively 
low  density of  drilling  in  that  zone  and  because  much  of  the  drilling  is  vertical  drilling 
from the surface that is subparallel to the zones. 
 
The Sienna Zone is assigned a maximum resource of indicated.

Charnela South
There  has  been  no  further  drilling  in  Charnela  South  since  the  December  2004  model was  created  by 
ORE.  In 2011, Kinbauri undertook a revision of the interpretation and generated a new resource model 
in  which  the  grade  capping  changed  for  both  Au  and  Cu  after  reviewing  the  distributions.  A  new 
mid-grade  distribution  zone  was  added  producing  three  different  grade  distribution  zones:  very  high, 
mid, and low  grade. The reason behind the new grade  zoning was  to avoid the overlaps between the 
previously  defined  high  and  low  grade.    The  model  was  created  using  the  trend-surface  modeling 
method that is used for other deposits throughout the district.  The Charnela South resource estimate is 
summarized  in  Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    The  estimation  parameters  are  summarized  in 
Error! Reference source not found.  Measured resources reported previously by RNGM for the Charnela 
South  area  are  reported  as  indicated  resources  for  this  report,  pending  confirmation  of  continuity  in 
underground workings.

Carlés
The  Carlés  resources  were  estimated  using  3-dimensional  block  models  that  were  created  in  five 
different areas that were determined by the orientation of mineralization and the location of the zones 
relative to the Carlés intrusive.  These areas are called Carlés East, Carlés North, Carlés Northwest, Carlés 
West, and Carlés South.  The Carlés East model was developed previously by RNGM and has had no new 
drilling since that time.  The model remains valid, but has been modified slightly to remove mined blocks 
from the remaining resource.  The Carlés North model was updated in January 2010 to include drilling by 
Orvana  during  2009.    A  new  model  for  Carlés  Northwest  was  created  in  July  2009  to  incorporate  the 
same modeling methods that  were  used  for Carlés North, and this report  documents the  new model.  
The remaining areas have had little or no new drilling and are still valid.
14.9.1  Carlés East
The Carlés East model was created by RNGM under the direction of ORE and was last updated in January 
2006.  The model was created by IDP estimation of block grades inside a wireframe envelope based on 
geologic  interpretation  of  the  copper-gold  mineralization.    The  structure  was  divided  into  five 
equal-width bands for estimation of grades.  Estimation parameters for Carlés East are summarized in 
Error!  Reference  source  not  found..    The  Carlés  East  resource  estimate  is  summarized  in  Error! 
Reference source not found..  A small skarn layer called “Capa Z” is associated with Carlés East, but is 
not  included  in  the  Carlés  East  resource  model.    Resources  for  Capa  Z  are  summarized  in  Error! 
Reference source not found..

The model was created by IDP estimation of block grades inside a wireframe envelope based on geologic 
interpretation  of  the  copper-gold  mineralization.    Gold  and  copper  grades  were  estimated  inside  the 
mineralized  envelope  using  a  trend  surface  to  provide  directional  control  for  interpolation  of  grades.  
General model parameters are summarized in Error! Reference source not found..

Analysis of gold and copper grade distribution showed that the grade distributions for both copper and 
gold grade consist of overlapping low and high-grade populations, as shown in Error! Reference source 
not found. and Error! Reference source not found..  The overlapping populations were differentiated by 
assigning a “HILOW” code to each assay, based on lithology, as shown in  Error! Reference source not 
found..  Grade zone codes were assigned to blocks using nearest-neighbor assignment oriented parallel 
to the trend surface. 
 
Estimation was done using inverse-distance-power interpolation (IDP) and nearest-neighbor assignment.  
The model was rotated into longitudinal view  for estimation, and the distance from the trend  surface 
was substituted for the rotated Z-coordinate.  This procedure effectively flattens the mineralized zone, 
so  that  interpolation  follows  the  trend  surface.    Estimation  of  grades  for  low-grade  blocks  was  done 
using only composites with low-grade zone codes.  Estimation of grades for high-grade blocks was done 
using composites  with high-grade  zone  codes,  plus composites  above  0.2 ppm Au from the low-grade 
zone.  Estimation parameters for Carlés North are summarized in Error! Reference source not found..

14.9.3  Carlés Northwest
The Carlés Northwest deposit is a N35E trending skarn horizon that abuts the north end of the Carlés 
North Zone.  This zone is similar to Carlés North, but is thinner, lower grade, and more sparsely drilled.  
A  new  model  for  the  Carlés  Northwest  deposit  was  created  in  September  2011  with  three  new  drill 
holes added as part of an ongoing effort by KGC to update all resource models to current methods.  The 
Carlés Northwest resource is summarized in Error! Reference source not found..  The same method was 
used  for  Carlés  Northwest  as  was  used  for  Carlés  North,  although  the  estimation  parameters  were 
modified to be specific to Carlés Northwest as summarized in Error! Reference source not found..

14.10  La Brueva
The La Brueva model was created by RNGM and was last updated in April 2001. The Barrick-RNGM Joint 
Venture did additional drilling in the La Brueva area since the date of the model, but that drilling is not 
expected to materially affect the estimated resource.  The model was created by IDP estimation of block 
grades  inside  a mineralized envelope  based on nearest-neighbor assignment of a 0.3  g Au/t  indicator. 
The La Brueva resource estimate is summarized in Error! Reference source not found..  The estimation 
parameters are summarized in Error! Reference source not found..  This estimate was reviewed by ORE, 
and it is the opinion of ORE, that the parameters and procedures for the Carlés South resource estimate 
are reasonable.

MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
15.1
Block Model Preparation for Stope Planning
Based  on  the  current  sales  contract  and  pricing  estimates,  and  based  on  the  metallurgical  recoveries 
achieved  in  the  plant  during  2011,  a  series  of  gold  equivalent  factors  (AuEQ)  were  calculated  for  the 
Boinás and Carlés Skarns and for the Boinás Oxides.  For stope planning purposes, the gold, copper and 
silver  grades  were  combined  using  the  equivalency  factors  to  create  an  AuEQ  value  in  each  of  the 
resource block models. 
 
Operating cost parameters were compiled from 2011 data, and previous engineering calculations, so as 
to determine breakeven gold cut-off grades for each of the main zones at the Boinás and Carlés mines.  
These cut-offs were then applied for stope planning purposes.

The  upper  portion  of  the  Carlés  North  and  Carlés  North-West  zones,  both  of  which  outcrop,  were 
optimized in 2010 using CAE Mining’s NPV Scheduler to determine  the appropriate open pit reserves. 
The key parameters used in this optimization are summarised in Table 15-3 and Table 15-4.

15.2  Mine Planning
All  mine  planning,  other  than  for  the  Carlés  open  pit  was  based  on  metal  prices  of  $US1100/oz  Au, 
$2.75/lb Cu and $20/oz Ag.  This was completed using CAE Mining´s Datamine Studio, Mine2-4D and EPS 
Scheduler mining software systems.  The overall mine planning procedure used may be summarised as:
15.2.1  Block Model AuEq Assignment
As outlined in section Error! Reference source not found..1, a gold equivalent value was calculated for 
each cell in each of the resource block models. For the generation of the reserves, this value was set to 
zero for any material previously mined and for all material classified as inferred.
15.2.2  Stope Optimisation
CAE  Minings´  Mineable  Reserve  Optimiser  (MRO)  was  used  to  determine  the  location  of  the  optimal 
mining  envelopes  within  each  ore  zone,  based  on  the  gold  equivalent  values  and  cut-offs.    Different 
parameters  were  applied  to  the  different  zones,  primarily  dependant  on  the  mining  method  to  be 
applied.  For the oxides a cut and fill method with a selective mining unit (SMU) of 4m x 4m x 4m was 
applied.  For the skarn zones, a longhole stoping method with an SMU of 8m x 4m x 8m was applied. The 
output from this operation was a set of envelope block models and wireframe outlines that were used

It should be noted that the SMU´s that were applied in MRO are significantly more selective than can be 
achieved during production.  For cut and fill methods, an SMU of 4m x 4m x 4m reflects two phases of 
advance  with  the  continuous  miner.  While  the  unit  is  realistic,  when  applied  to  a  block  model  with 
parent  cells  of  1m  x  2m  x  1m  it  allows  for  directional  changes  within  a  stoping  block  that  cannot  be 
accommodated by the equipment fleet. This in turn suggests a degree of selectivity that is unobtainable 
and can provide an unrealistic estimate of the grades that are achievable with this method.   Similarly for 
longhole open stoping methods, an SMU of 8m x 4m x 8m is more selective than the default stope shape 
of 15m x 5m x 20m.  To account for this, the MRO results that were reported were factored for dilution 
and  ore  loss.  In  addition,  the  output  MRO  wireframe  shapes  were  used  solely  as  a  guide  during  the 
stope design process; and were not used in place of a stope design. 
 
The  MRO  stope  optimisation  process  was  also  used  to  generate  a  series  of  grade-tonnage  curves  for 
each zone, based on the mineable envelopes obtained for a range of cut-offs. As the cut-off increased 
the continuity of the economic material and hence the contiguity of the mineable envelopes decreased, 
as was evidenced from the number of envelopes/tonnes per envelope for each run.  To account for this, 
the dilution was scaled such that the less contiguous stoping envelopes incurred a higher dilution.   
 
An example of the MRO  output  for the  Black  Skarn and San  Martín  zones  has been included as Table 
15-6. As can be seen, the contained tonnes are sensitive to the cut-off grade, with a small incremental 
change in cut-off having a large impact on the total tonnes.

15.2.3  Stope Design
The  process  of  longhole  stope  design  was  achieved  by  loading  the  relevant  mined  as-built  and  MRO 
wireframe files and the current reserve model formatted according to AuEQ values.  For the Black Skarn 
and San Martín zones, vertical sections were reviewed every 5m, at an azimuth of 150°.  Stope sections 
were  designed  for  each  5m  interval,  to  coincide  with  existing  development  and/or  maintain  a  20m 
sublevel  spacing.  The  MRO  wireframes  were  used  as  a  guide  as  to  the optimal  location  of  the  stopes 
from  the  point  of  view  of  resource  category  and  grade,  and  the  block  model  was  used  as  a  guide  to 
determine whether the MRO outlines could support the dilution necessary to form stope sections from 
the point of view of grade, in those situations where the MRO outlines did not form 20m high or 15m 
wide stoping envelopes.  The same process was applied for the longhole stoping areas in Boinás East and 
Carlés except that the vertical sections were at different azimuths depending on the primary direction of 
each ore zone.  Post-design, the stope sections were evaluated in Mine2-4D and any sections for which 
the diluted grade was below cut-off were discarded. 
 
The process of cut and fill stope design was achieved by loading the relevant mined as-built and MRO 
wireframe files, and the current reserve model formatted according to AuEQ values.  Using the existing 
development  as  a  guide,  the  initial  mining  horizon(s)  were  selected  for  Charnela  and  A107.  For  the 
El-Valle zone, the mining horizons were chosen in conjunction with the conceptual design for a footwall 
ramp/exploration  drive  development  for  the  oxides.  Using  the  mining  horizons  as  a  starting  point, 
horizontal sections were reviewed at 4m intervals, reflecting the panel height of each successive cut and 
fill  lift.    Primary  ore  drives  were  designed  to  “follow”  the  main  high  grade  band(s)  within  the  oxide 
zones,  according to a standard  4m x 4m section as detailed in Section 16.2. In areas where  the ore is 
wider,  a  system  of  primary  and  secondary  stubs  were  designed  at  70°  to  the  main  access  in  order 
optimise  production  by  continuous  miner.    In  certain  areas  where  the  ore  was  less  than  4m  storage 
cuddies  were  installed  every  50m  to  allow  the  continuous  miner  to  pullback  during  shotcreting  and 
general maintenance operations.  Where possible the primary ore drives were limited to 100m in length 
to reduce the excavation life.  Post design, the oxide development was evaluated in Mine2-4D and any 
stubs for which the diluted grade was below the cut-off were discarded.  As the primary ore drives are 
necessary  to  access  the  stubs,  in  certain  instances  this  development  contained  excessive  dilution  but 
could  not  be  discarded  as  to  do  so  would  result  in  the  sterilisation  of  ore  zones.  Similarly,  in  certain 
instances  the  primary  development  passes  though  zones  of  inferred  material  in  order  to  access 
measured  and  indicated  material.    It  was  not  possible  to  discard  this  material  without  having  a 
significant impact on the production schedule as can be seen in Figures 16-15 to 16-21.
15.2.4  Evaluation
Evaluation  of  the  development  and  stope  designs  for  both  Boinás  and  Carlés  were  undertaken  using 
Mine2-4D.  Each ore zone was separately evaluated against the relevant block model, to determine the 
tonnes and grades for each resource category. Development was evaluated first and then depleted from 
each  of  the  block  models  prior  to  the  stope  evaluations.  For  development,  evaluations  in-ore  were 
carried out for each 10m segment to ensure that grade variations along a drive could be modelled in the 
schedule, while at the same time attempting to smooth some of the excessive variation that occurs as a 
result of the small block model parent cell sizes (between 1-4m). Longhole stopes were evaluated on 5m 
sections to ensure that grade variations within a stope could be modelled, with the uneconomic sections 
being discarded post-evaluation.

15.3  Mineral Reserve Estimation
The results obtained from the  Mine2-4D evaluation for Boinás and Carlés were exported to Microsoft 
Excel™ and separated by ore zone.  
  
As mentioned previously in section 16.2, the nature of the resource classification and stoping methods 
at Boinás and Carlés require that a certain portion of inferred material is extracted in order to generate 
a working mine design and schedule. As such, for each zone the portion of measured, indicated, inferred 
and  waste  material  was  evaluated  for  each  stope  section.    Where  the  inferred  tonnages  were 
considered to be excessive, the stope section was discarded from the results.  For all other sections, a 
check  was  performed  to  ensure  that  the  inferred  grade  did  not  result  in  the  inferred  ounces  for  that 
section being greater than the combined measured and indicated ounces. In any situations where this 
was the case, the inferred grades were factored to ensure the inferred ounces contributed to less than 
50% of the ounces for that stope section. 
 
The  process  of  generating  stope  shapes  also  required  the  inclusion  of  a  certain  amount  of  dilution.  
Where this has been included in the stope design and evaluated against the model, it has been referred 
to as “planned dilution”.  Planned dilution is considered to be the material that is necessary in order for 
the  successful  execution  of  the  stope,  but  that  contains  an  AuEQ  value  less  than  the  cut-off  for  that 
zone/mining method. The process of stope design also results in planned ore loss, in areas where all of 
the  material  cannot  be  extracted  by  practical  purposes.  This  is  more  difficult  to  quantify,  but  the 
resource to reserve conversion has been collated as a useful reference. 
 
In addition to the planned dilution and ore loss, a further 5% unplanned dilution and 5% unplanned ore 
loss  were  applied  to  the  reserves,  with  no  associated  grade.    Stope  reconciliations  that  have  been 
carried out for the initial Black Skarn and Boinás East zones suggest that the 5% dilution is a realistically 
achievable  figure  provided  that  the  development,  stope  drilling  and    blasting  and  ground  support  are 
carried out according to design.  Ore loss from these same initial stopes has been higher than 5%, but 
changes to the stope geometry have resulted in sub-optimal extraction drive orientations for the initial 
stopes, increasing the difficulty of mucking operations and impacting on recovery.  Future stopes should 
be better positioned with respect to the development, which should help reduce the dilution to be in 
line with the applied factors. An additional factor for unplanned ore loss was applied to Carlés North, as 
it was felt that despite factoring, this zone still included an excessive amount of inferred material. 
 
A summary of the factors that were applied in the stope design work have been included in Table 15-7.

P a g e  | 177
Table 15-7  Summary of the Dilution and Ore Loss Factors Applied
The  dilution  has  been  calculated  to  be  the  percentage  of  tonnes  of  waste  (along  with  tonnes  of 
uneconomic mineralised material) divided by the total tonnes for each stope.  The resource to reserve 
conversion for the unfactored reserve is 66%, whereas for the factored reserve it is 63%. This compares 
well  with  previous  results  where  an  unfactored  conversion  of  67%  was  obtained.  A  summary  of  the 
Reserve Evaluation is included in Table 15-8.

The Sienna and Carlés Este block models were not updated for this resource, and as a result the previous 
reserve figures were carried over.  Likewise the previous figures for the Carlés Pit were carried over as 
there has been no new pit optimisation work undertaken for this resource. For the upper portion of the 
Boinás Este above the 205mRL, the original MRO stope shapes were evaluated against the new model. 
The  evaluated  designs  have  been  displayed  by  zone  for  Boinás  in  Figure  15-2  and  for  Carlés  in  Figure

15.4  Mine Scheduling
Mine  scheduling  was  carried  out  using  CAE  Mining´s  Mine2-4D  and  EPS  mining  software  systems,  for 
both Boinás and Carlés.  The same data that was used to generate the reserve figures was also used to 
generate the Life of Mine (LOM) schedule.  As discussed previously; in order to generate a logical LOM 
schedule it has been necessary to include a portion of inferred material. The inferred material that has 
been included in the LOM schedule has not been factored as per the reserves and for this reason there 
is a small discrepancy between the overall totals for both. The reserve figures that have been quoted are 
more conservative with respect to ounces and grade.
15.4.1  Mine Sequence
Before the mine schedule is generated in EPS, the mine sequence was developed in Mine2-4D using a 
combination of the different activity types and manually applied attributes such as “level” and “cut and 
fill lift” to determine a logical mining sequence.  The sequence can then be visually run in Mine2-4D, to 
determine  the  validity  and  correct  any  erroneous  dependencies.    In  addition  to  the  base  activities  of 
development  and  stoping,  derived  activities  such  as  cable-bolt  support,  production  drilling  and  filling 
activities were created and included.  In this manner, complex links between the filling of each cut and 
fill lift, and the stripping out of the subsequent accesses were generated and verified.

P a g e  | 181
15.4.1.1
Boinás Sequence Ideology for Cut and Fill Stoping
The initial lift for each cut and fill horizon in Boinás has a positive gradient of +2% for drainage, limiting 
the number of lifts to 3. Thereafter, a maximum gradient of 15-20% is employed resulting in standard 
cut  and  fill  stopes  of  5  lifts/20m  height.  The  primary  drive  is  developed,  then  when  completed  the 
primary stubs are developed.  Primary stubs are filled as soon as possible after development, and when 
both  adjacent  stubs  have  been  filled,  the  secondary  stubs  can  be  developed  and  immediately  filled 
thereafter.  When all the secondary stubs have been filled, filling of the primary drives commences, and 
upon completion filling of the access commences. When the access has been filled, stripping of the next 
lift access can occur and the process repeats for each of the 5 lifts.  The system of extraction is cut and 
fill, so as each cut and fill stope is being mined the access development for the next stoping panel can be 
developed.    The  final  20m  of  the  second  stoping  panel  is  prohibited  until  the  filling  of  the  last  lift  is 
completed in the panel below.
15.4.1.2
Boinás Sequence Ideology for Longhole Stoping
The  longhole  stopes  at  Boinás  have  been  divided  into  primary  and  secondary  stoping  panels.  The 
primary  panels  are  to  be  extracted  first,  requiring  cable-bolt  support  prior  to  stoping  production 
activities, and requiring cemented aggregate fill post-production. After a period of curing, work can then 
commence on the secondary stopes.  In order to limit the open span, where possible primary stopes will 
be completed for two levels vertically before extraction commences from the secondaries.
15.4.1.3
General Sequence Restrictions at Boinás
In  addition  to  the  standard  mine  logic,  additional  sequence  restrictions  were  put  in  place  at  Boinás 
relating to ventilation and geological confidence.  In areas where it has been determined that additional 
ventilation  raises  are  required,  production  from  these  areas  is  dependent  on  the  completion  of  the 
ventilation raise and allowance of an additional month delay for installation and commissioning of any 
ventilation  fan  and  associated  infrastructure.    Similarly  in  areas  where  exploration  drives  have  been 
allocated,  production  was  delayed  from  the  relevant  areas  until  6  months  after  the  drive  had  been 
completed,  allowing  sufficient  time  for  a  drilling  program  to  be  undertaken  and  for  the  necessary 
interpretation and estimation work thereafter.
15.4.1.4
Carlés Sequence Ideology for Longhole Stoping
The  longhole  stopes  at  Carlés  are  to  be  mined  in  phases,  with  all  stope  ore  reporting  to  a  bottom 
extraction level for each phase. To maximise production and reduce ground support problems, Phase 3 
of Carlés North and all of Carlés North-West will be mined with a “v-front” extraction sequence, starting 
from the bottom extraction level and working up. As 20-50m of the bottom level stoping is underway, 
production  from  the  level  above  will  commence,  creating  an  advance  front  that  allows  production 
simultaneously  from  several  levels  and  reduces  the  amount  of  time  the  extremities  of  each  stoping 
panel are required to remain open. This front has been modelled in Mine2-4D with the use of several 
manual  links.  However  in  the  future  stope  geometry  should  allow  generic  sequencing  rules  to  be 
developed. 
 
As per Boinás, Carlés has had dependencies linking the commencement of production activities with the 
completion of a long term ventilation raise for Carlés North-West and the completion of an infill drilling 
program in this same zone.

A  general  overview  of  the  dependencies  created  in  Mine2-4D  for  Boinás  has  been  included  as  Figure

purple links have been applied automatically, based on a series of logical rules developed in Mine2-4D.  
All  other  links  have  been  created  manually,  and  are  coded  as  follows;  aqua  for  ventilation,  blue  for 
geology, green for general and grey for production/stope sequencing.

15.4.2  Resource Assignment
After the sequence was verified in Mine2-4D, the information was exported to EPS in order to generate 
a mine schedule.  In addition to the mine sequence dependencies, the schedule was constrained with 
respect to equipment allocation (resources) and manually applied priorities.  
 
Equipment allocation was applied in EPS based on the historically achieved development and production 
rates for 2011, for the first 6 months of the schedule. Thereafter, production was gradually “ramped” up 
in  order  to  meet  and  maintain  production  targets.    The  only  case  where  this  is  not  true  is  for 
development rates in Boinás, which were pushed for January-October 2012 in order to compensate for 
the extra development required to complete the shaft access and conveyor drive underground in 2011. 
Additionally, while the continuous miner rates were maintained, it was assumed that a second machine 
would be available in early 2012 and a third machine would be available late 2012.

Monthly  totals  are  achievable  only  when  there  are  sufficient  headings  available.    As  is  frequently  the 
case, dependencies between activities may prevent a heading/stope from being available for production 
activities.  In  these  cases,  the  monthly  totals  cannot  be  achieved  in  the  schedule  and  the  resource  is 
under-utilised.

Carlés can be viewed in Table 15-11 and Table 15-13.

15.4.3  Priority Assignment
The application of resources and levelling of the schedule based on equipment constraints ensures that 
no  resources  are  over-allocated  and  that  the  schedule  is  achievable  in  accordance  with  the  set 
production  rates.    However,  there  are  frequently  situations  where  there  are  too  many  available 
headings  to  choose  from  and  equipment  under-allocation  and/or  misallocation  becomes  an  issue.    In 
such cases, the schedules at Boinás and Carlés have been driven by a manually applied Priority attribute. 
For  the  most  part,  the  priorities  have  been  set  logically;  primary  stopes  will  have  precedence  over 
secondary  stopes,  lower  levels  over  upper  levels,  high  grade  zones  over  low  grade  zones,  areas  with 
fewer  production  issues  that  can  achieve  higher  production  rates  over  areas  that  may  have  lower 
production rates.  The application of priorities is an iterative process, as it can have a significant impact 
on the schedule. Generating the schedule with a series of different priorities allows a range of strategies 
to be simulated, and is an important tool in identifying potential bottlenecks or production issues. 
 
The  application  of  priorities  in  Boinás  and  Carlés  can  be  seen  in  Figure  15-9  and  Figure  15-10 
respectively.

MINING METHODS
16.1  Access and Materials Handling
16.1.1  Boinás / El Valle
Approximately 4.3km of horizontal and principal ramp development existed at Boinás from the previous 
operations,  with  the  existing  Boinás  portal  located  close  to  the  surface  workshop,  mine  offices  and 
underground mine stockpile.  Ramp dimensions are a nominal 4.0m x4.0m, however there are sections 
where  this  reduces  to  3.5m  x  4.0m,  limiting  the  access  of  equipment  to  certain  areas.  The  maximum 
gradient of the ramp is between +/-15%, although there are sections that have been developed flat. 
 
All ramp development currently undertaken by Kinbauri at Boinás has an arched profile of 4.0m x 4.5m, 
as per the schematic attached in Figure 16.1.  Based on the equipment fleet, this has been deemed the 
most  appropriate  size  to  ensure  sufficient  working  distance  between  personnel  and  equipment  when 
located in the ramp system, and to ensure that all mine services can be installed according to Kinbauri 
standards  and  properly  maintained.  Maximum  design  gradient  in  use  is  +/-15%  to  reduce  equipment 
wear, with the minimum gradient being +/-2% to ensure drainage.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 194
The Boinás principal ramp dimensions are such that haulage within this ramp is limited to 20t capacity 
trucks,  the  current  fleet  of  which  are  capable  of  achieving  a  monthly  haulage  rate  to  surface  of 
approximately  25kt.    Rather  than  undergo  the  expensive  and  time  consuming  task  of  enlarging  the 
existing development to enable a larger truck fleet to be employed, the decision was taken to install a 
haulage shaft of 430m from the surface to the 100RL. Reduced haulage distances within the mine will 
see the current 20t fleet capable of achieving 40kt per month feed to the shaft crushing station, which 
corresponds to an increase of approximately 60% with respect to materials handling at Boinás. 
 
The shaft is to be installed in two stages.  Raiseboring of the first shaft stage was completed in July 2010.  
The second and final stage is currently underway and due to be completed in January 2012.  Meanwhile, 
construction  of  the  shaft  headframe  and  winder  room  is  currently  progressing,  and  is  due  to  be 
completed by late February 2012.  Ore from the shaft will be transported 500m to the plant by means of 
an overland conveyor, also due for completion by the end of February. The surface layout of the shaft, 
winder  room  and  conveyor  can  be  seen  in  Figure  16.2.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  shaft  will  be  fully 
operational by the second quarter of 2012, and will have a maximum capacity of 200tph. 
 
Access to each of the individual areas of the mine is achieved via a system of independent ramps.  This is 
true  for  the  Black  Skarn,  San  Martín,  Boinás  Este,  Charnela  and  A107  zones.  The  higher-tonnage 
longhole stoping zones, the Black Skarn and San Martín, will employ a system of ore passes and loading 
stations to optimise truck haulage to the underground crushing station associated with the shaft.   
 
Charnela and the A107 will initially be accessed from the 300mRL, requiring a short surface haul to the 
underground mine stockpile.  As such it is currently envisaged that in the short term there will be only a 
small requirement  to haul oxide  material through the shaft. The bulk of the oxide  will continue  to be 
transported  to  surface  by  truck.  This  will  help  reduce  the  need  to  separately  stockpile  material  and 
“batch” the separate ore types. Material from the underground stockpile is transported approximately 1 
kilometre to the plant by means of conventional 20t road trains that are contracted to Kinbauri. 
 
The long term access for the oxide zones currently consists of an additional surface ramp access from 
the  El-Valle  pit.  Further  exploration  to  the  north  of  the  A107  is  required  to  define  inferred  resources 
such as the A208, before an additional ramp access design can be finalised.
16.1.2  Carlés
Approximately 3km of horizontal and principal ramp development existed at Carlés from the previous 
operations.    Access  to  the  underground  workings  is  provided  by  the  Carlés  East  ramp,  the  portal  of 
which  is  located  close  to  the  surface  workshop  and  underground  stockpile.    Ramp  dimensions  are  a 
nominal  4.0m  x4.0m,  however  there  are  sections  where  this  reduces  to  3.5m  in  width,  limiting  the 
access of equipment in certain areas of the mine. 
 
All ramp development currently being undertaken by Kinbauri at Carlés has an arched profile of 4.0m x 
4.5m,  as  per  the  schematic  attached  in  Figure  16.1.    Based  on  the  equipment  fleet,  this  has  been 
deemed  the  most  appropriate  size  to  ensure  sufficient  working  distance  between  personnel  and 
equipment  when  located  in  the  ramp  system,  and  to  ensure  that  all  mine  services  can  be  installed 
according  to  standard  and  properly  maintained.  Maximum  design  gradient  in  use  is  +/-15%  to  reduce 
equipment wear, with the minimum gradient being +/-2% to ensure drainage.

Material  from  the  surface  stockpile  at  Carlés  is  transported  to  the  plant  at  Boinás  by  means  of 
conventional  24t  and  27t  road-trains  that  are  contracted  to  Kinbauri.  The  journey  of  25  kilometres 
makes use of the regional Asturian road network, including the AS15, AS227 and AS310.

16.2  Geotechnical Studies
In 2008 Golder Associates undertook a geotechnical survey of the Boinás mine and provided site with 
their report entitled “El Valle Boinás Gold Mine – Geomechanical Report – 8 Dec 2008”. In September 
2010,  Pakalnis  and  Associates  visited  site  and  left  their  report  entitled  “Report  on  Site  Visit  to  El 
Valle  -  Boinás/Carlés  Project  –  Orvana  No.  ORVS-01/10”.  Recommendations  from  both  have  been 
adopted  where  appropriate.  Additionally  in  2011  Kinbauri  undertook  to  retain  the  services  of  the 
Universidad  Politécnica  de  Madrid  to  provide  technical  support  to  the  geotechnical  department  on  a 
fortnightly basis. 
 
Geotechnical inputs to the mine planning process include:

 
 
 
 
 

Geotechnical information relating to the areas to be mined (structure, stress, rock mass 
classification) 
References to analysis and/or design work for excavations, ground support etc 
Predictions of anticipated failure mechanisms 
Excavation designs 
Ground support patterns 
Quality control requirements (pull testing, shotcrete testing) 
Monitoring requirements (convergence monitoring, inspections)

A  major  task  undertaken  by  the  geotechnical  department  during  2011  was  to  establish  a  system  of 
ground support designs for the various rock types at Boinás and Carlés.
16.2.1  Ground Support Designs
Ground  support  designs  for  the  various  excavation  profiles  and  anticipated  geotechnical  domains  are 
given  in  detail  below.  The  ground  support  patterns  are  applied  as  standards  based  on  the  measured 
RMR/geotechnical  domains  for  each  development  heading,  published  daily  in  the  shift  muster  room, 
excepting those situations where additional geotechnical information necessitates a modification to the 
standard designs.

16.3
Selection of Stoping Method
The Boinás and Carlés operations have historically been exploited by open pit, cut and fill and longhole 
stoping  methods.    Based  on  this  experience,  and  by  reference  to  external  studies  including  the  2008 
Golder  Associates  Report  “El  Valle  Boinás  Gold  Mine  Geomechanical  Report”,  it  was  decided  to  use  a 
combination of the same to develop the life-of-mine plan. 
 
A generic overview of the longhole stope layout at Boinás has been included as Figure 16-13.  Nominal 
stope sizes in the Black Skarn are 15m in width, 20m in height with the longitudinal extent determined 
by grade and ground conditions. Nominal stope sizes in San Martín are 12.5m in width for the primaries 
and 17.5m in width for the secondaries, with height and longitudinal length as per the Black Skarn.  The 
stopes  in  Boinás  East  have  maintained  the  same  design  parameters,  with  stope  widths  at  10m  and 
heights at 20m. 
 
In  San  Martín,  the  primary  stopes  have  initially  been  designed  at  12.5m  width  to  manage  the  poorer 
ground  conditions that  are  anticipated  in  this  area.    Should  the  ground  conditions  prove  to  be  better 
than  expected  or  if they  can  be  adequately  managed,  there  is  provision  in  the  design  to modify  both 
primary and secondary stope widths to 15m as discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.3.6.

P a g e  | 207
Figure 16-13  Example of Longhole Stope Layout – Plan View of San Martín, 80m
A generic overview of the cut and fill stope layout at Boinás has been included as Figure 16-14. Stope 
panels are a nominal 20m height and consist of 5 lifts each of 4m.  The initial stoping panel is 12m high 
and maintains an initial access at +2% gradient to assist in the drainage of and pumping from each of the 
successive  stoping  panels.    The  long  term  conceptual  design  sees  the  main oxide  infrastructure move 
from the  hangingwall  to the  footwall, to  avoid  placing  a  substantial  amount  of  infrastructure  in  weak 
rock above the San Martín and Black Skarn longhole zones.  Current information indicates that ground 
conditions in the hangingwall wall are unlikely to be an improvement on the footwall, but the advantage 
is  that  there  is  presently  no  existing  infrastructure  in  this  area.    Before  the  conceptual  design  can  be 
considered  in  more  detail,  it  will  be  necessary  to  obtain  more  information  on  ground  conditions  and 
further define inferred zones such as the Area 208.

Figure 16-14  Example of Cut and Fill Layout – Area 107
Key aspects of the mining method employed for each zone are provided below in more detail:
16.3.1  Boinás Area 107
 



Overhand cut-and-fill (CYR) by means of continuous miner. 
Production  in  Area  107  commenced  in  June  2011,  by  means  of  overhand  jumbo  CYR 
stoping.    Shortly  thereafter  a  continuous  miner  was  trialled  in  an  attempt  to  reduce 
damage caused by the introduction of water during drilling operations, and by blasting.  
The  trial  was  a  success  and  the  life of  mine  plan  assumes  that  the exploitation  of  the 
Boinás oxides will continue to be by means of continuous miner using a system of CYR 
with cemented aggregate fill.    
The  A107  oxides  typically  have  RMR  values  of  25-35%,  as  such  the  maximum 
supportable section has been determined to be 4.0m x 4.0m.  The continuous miner is 
able to advance 2.0m before shotcrete is required, this being applied according to the 
ground control standards documented in Chapter Error! Reference source not found.. 
The conceptual sequence for the A107 is as follows: 
o 
o
Drive access ramp to the footwall contact for the initial lift (F0) 
Drive  on  footwall  to  ore  extremity  or  to  a  maximum  of  100m  longitudinal 
distance 
In  wide  areas,  drive  primary  stubs  to  the  hanging-wall  contact  to  form 
temporary rib pillars.  
In  narrow  areas,  ensure  at  least  1  primary  stub  every  50  metres  to  optimise 
production cycle times from the continuous miner

o
Place cemented aggregate fill in primary stubs by means of a LHD loader fitted 
with a “rammer-jammer” style ejection bucket 
Strip secondary stubs/rib pillars 
On  retreat,  place  cemented  aggregate  fill  in  both  the  secondary  stubs  and 
primary footwall drive 
Strip access ramp at gradients of 15-20% to provide access to the first lift (F1) 
and repeat cycle through to the fourth lift (F0-F4), obtaining a maximum panel 
height of 20 metres.
An  example of  the  layout  for  the  initial  lift  of  the  A107_330_F0  has  been  attached  as 
Figure 16-15, showing the existing development in grey, primary development in orange 
and  the  secondary  development  in  red.  For  reference,  the  previous  NI 43-101  reserve 
outline has been overlaid in purple. 
No sill pillars have been designed between successive panels, maximising extraction and 
ensuring  no  high  stress  concentrations  are  created  within  a  single  mining  horizon.    A 
crown pillar of 20m has been left between the AR_305_F1 and the AR_330_F0, to allow 
extraction to commence from the AR_330_F0.  Additionally there is a 60m crown pillar 
between the El-Valle tailings storage facility and the upper levels of the A107 workings, 
in accordance  with the  recommendations received from Pakalnis &  Associates in their 
September 2010 Report entititled “Report on Site Visit to El Valle-Boinás/Carlés Project 
Orvana ORVS-01/10”.

16.3.2  Boinás Charnela South
Overhand cut-and-fill (CYR) by means of continuous miner. 
Overhand cut and fill production in Charnela South commenced in November 2011 by 
means of continuous miner after similar ground conditions to those experienced in Area 
107 were encountered during the jumbo access development.   
The system of support in Charnela makes use of the standards that are in place for the 
oxides, as documented in section 16.2. 
Charnela  consists  of  a  series  of  high  grade  zones  located  within  an  oxide  matrix  that 
varies in width from 20 to 100 metres.  As such the  conceptual sequence for Charnela 
differs from that for the A107 oxides and is as follows: 
o
Drive access ramp to either the northern or southern extents of the oxide matrix 
for the initial lift (F0). 
Drive  the  primary  ore  access  transversally  across  the  oxide  matrix,  to  confirm 
the location of the high grade ore zones. 
Drive  primary  “stub”  accesses  from  the  ore  access,  following  the  high  grade 
zones. 
As  soon  as  each  of  the  primary  stubs  have  been  completed,  place  cemented 
aggregate  fill  by  means  of  a  LHD  loader  fitted  with  a  “rammer-jammer”  style 
ejection bucket. 
On retreat, place cemented aggregate fill in the primary ore access. 
Strip access ramp at gradients of 15-20% to provide access to the first lift (F1) 
and repeat cycle through to the eighth lift (F0-F8), obtaining a maximum panel 
height of 40 metres.

An  example  of  the  layout  for  the  initial  lift  of  the  CH_310_F0  has  been  attached  as 
Figure  16-16,  showing  the  existing  development  in  grey  and  primary  development  in 
orange.  For  reference,  the  previous  NI  43-101  reserve  outline  has  been  overlaid  in 
purple. 
No sill pillars have been designed between successive panels, maximising extraction and 
ensuring  no  high  stress  concentrations  are  created  within  a  single  mining  horizon.    A 
crown pillar of 5m has been left between the CH_270_F7 and the CH_310_F0, to allow 
extraction to commence from the CH_310_F0.  Additionally there is a 60m crown pillar 
between  the  El-Valle  tailings  storage  facility  and  the  upper  levels  of  the  Charnela 
workings, in accordance with the recommendations received from Pakalnis & Associates 
in September 2010.

Overhand cut-and-fill (CYR) by means of continuous miner  
Production  has  not  commenced  in  the  El-Valle  Fault,  but  based  on  conditions 
encountered in the open pit it has been assumed that a similar method to Area 107 and 
Charnela will be employed.  
No sill pillars have been designed between successive panels, maximising extraction and 
ensuring no high stress concentrations are created within a single mining horizon. There 
is  a  20-60m  crown  pillar  between  the  El-Valle  tailings  storage  facility  and  the  upper 
levels of the El-Valle workings, in accordance with the recommendations received from 
Pakalnis & Associates in September 2010.

16.3.4  Boinás Este
Longhole open stoping (LOS) with cemented aggregate fill.   
Historically Boinás Este has been exploited using both cut and fill and longhole stoping 
methods.    Most  recently,  longhole  open  stoping  has  been  successfully  applied  to  the 
lower  levels  from  the  285  to  the  205mRL.    Given  the  discontinuous  nature  of the  ore 
within the Boinás Este zone, it is very difficult to interpret high grade zones that could 
be  extracted  by  cut  and  fill  methods.  As  such,  the  current  design  for  Boinás  Este 
employs a series of alternating primary and secondary LOS stopes that extend from the 
150  Level  to  the  190  Level,  leaving  a  10m  crown  pillar  between  the  backs  of  the  190 
Level  and  the  floor  of  the  205  Level.    Above  the  205mRL  the  previous  reserve  stopes

have been maintained.  Old workings and the presence of the Boinás Este pit will slow 
production from this area, and as a result redesign has been given a low priority.  
The conceptual sequence for Boinás Este is as follows: 
o

Drive the 4.0m x 4.5m access ramp from the granite intrusion through the skarn 
to the marble/calcite contact.   
Develop  a  series  of  longitudinal  4.5m  x  4.5m  primary  drill  drives,  at  20m 
intervals.  The  length  of  the  drives  will  be  determined  by  the  economic  stope 
limit as defined by the resource model or the grade-control model, whichever is 
most valid. 
Define  the  short-term  stope  shape  according  to  the  grade  control  model  and 
develop the 5.0m x 4.5m primary slot accesses accordingly. 
Install cablebolt support as required, according to the standards in section 16.2. 
Drill and blast the primary stopes, in accordance with the drill and blast designs 
issue by the planning department. Where appropriate, install remote cuddies to 
ensure  safe  remote  loader  operation  during  mucking  activities  in  accordance 
with  Kinbauris`  internal  safety  procedure  (Dis  Mina  Nº8:  Desescombro  en 
cámaras de producción en mina). 
Upon completion of the primary stope, take a final CMS measurement in order 
to  assist  in  reconciliation  and  secondary  stope  design,  and  more  accurately 
determine cemented fill requirements. 
Place  cemented  aggregate  fill  by  means  of  articulated  mine  truck,  to  provide 
stable  walls  during  exploitation  of  the  secondary  stopes.  If  necessary,  final 
placement  of 
remote  controlled  LHD  using  a 
rammer-jammer/ejection bucket to get the CAF as tight to the backs as possible. 
Develop  secondary  drill  drives  at  10m  intervals  from  primary  drives  (leaving  a 
5.5m pillar between primary and secondary drill drives).  
Repeat  short-term  stope  shape  design,  cable  bolting,  drilling,  blasting  and 
mucking activities as per the primary stoping sequence.   
Upon  completion  of  secondary  stopes,  take  a  final  CMS  measurement  and  fill 
with cemented aggregate fill or mine waste, as appropriate.

16.3.5  Boinás Black Skarn
Longhole open stoping (LOS) with cemented aggregate fill. 
The previous design for the Black Skarn zone consisted of a combination of cut and fill 
and longhole stoping, with stoping areas split into 10m wide transverse panels. For the 
current  life  of  mine  design,  a  system  of  transverse  longhole  open  stoping  with  15m 
stope  widths  has  been  chosen  as  the  preferred  extraction  method    as  it  offers  the 
following advantages: 
o
Safety:  Longhole  open  stoping  is  a  non-entry  stoping  method.  Exposure  of 
personnel to the stoping operation should therefore be eliminated. 
Amenability: Given the discontinuous nature of the ore within the  Black Skarn 
zone,  it is very difficult to interpret  high grade  zones that can be  extracted by 
cut and fill methods. Grade-tonnage curves for the zone support this, indicating 
that  the  Black  Skarns  contain  substantial  tonnages  at  the  longhole  stoping 
cut-off and significantly less at the cut and fill stoping cut-off. Therefore, if the 
skarn  is  considered  a  high-tonne,  low  grade  orebody,  as  opposed  to  a 
low-tonne,  high-grade  orebody,  it  becomes  extremely  amenable  to  longhole 
open stoping. 
Dilution Control:  Cemented rock  fill placed within a longhole stope  provides a 
smoother and hence more stable fill wall, than that placed within successive lifts 
of  a  breasted  cut  and  fill  stope.    Ore  dilution  from  the  cemented  fill  should 
therefore be reduced. Internal stope (planned dilution) has been included in the 
stope designs and accounted for in the planned mining reserve figures. 
Productivity: Longhole open stoping methods allow for far greater productivity 
levels than can be achieved by mechanised cut and fill methods. 
Cost:  Longhole  stoping  can  achieve  a  lower  unit  cost  profile  than  mechanised 
cut and fill due to a combination of the above-mentioned efficiencies
The conceptual sequence for Black Skarn is as follows: 
o
Drive the 4.0m x 4.5m access ramp from the granite intrusion through to a 30m 
offset from the economic skarn contact.   
Develop a 4.0m x 4.5m longitudinal access parallel to the skarn  
Develop a series of transverse 4.5m x 4.5m primary drill drives, at 30m intervals. 
The length of the drill drives will be determined by the economic stope limit as 
defined by the resource model or the updated grade-control model, whichever 
is the most valid. 
Define  the  short-term  stope  shape  according  to  the  grade  control  model  and 
develop the 5.0m x 4.5m primary slot accesses accordingly. 
Install  cablebolt  support  as  required,  according  to  the  standards  included  in 
section 16.2. 
Drill and blast the primary stopes, in accordance with the drill and blast designs 
issue by the planning department. Where appropriate, install remote cuddies to 
ensure  safe  remote  loader  operation  during  mucking  activities  in  accordance 
with  Kinbauris`  internal  safety  procedure  (Dis  Mina  Nº8:  Desescombro  en

Upon completion of the primary stope, take a final CMS measurement in order

Sub  level  intervals  in  the  Black  Skarn  have  been  maintained  at  20m.    The  lack  of  ore 
continuity  results  in  a  substantial  increase  in  the  planned  dilution  when  there  is  an 
increase in the sublevel spacing. 
An  example  of  the  layout  for  the  initial  lift  of  the  BS_120_13a  has  been  attached  as

16.3.6  Boinás San Martín
Longhole open stoping (LOS) with cemented aggregate fill. 
The  San  Martín  and Black  Skarn zones  are the  same orebody, separated by low  grade 
material through a “transitional” zone as shown in Figure 16-20. 
Exploration drill hole information suggests that the ground conditions in San Martín may 
be poorer than in the Black Skarn, due to the presence of more joint sets. As such the 
conceptual design in San Martín consists of smaller primary stopes of 12.5m width with 
secondary stopes of 17.5m width, able to be adjusted to a standard 15m width for both 
in the future should ground conditions permit. The initial results from the development 
in  the  San  Martín  zone  indicate  that  the  ground  conditions  are  manageable  and  it  is 
envisaged  that  the  design  will  move  to  15m  stope  widths  in  the  short-medium  term.  
However  should  the  conditions  deteriorate;  the  smaller  dimensions  of  the  primary 
stopes will help maintain control of the ground conditions in the primaries and reduce 
blast damage. Combined with the systematic cable-bolting of the roof from the primary 
drill drives the larger 17.5m secondary stopes should be adequately pre-supported. 
Sub level intervals in the San Martín have been maintained at 20m.  Due to the lack of 
ore continuity an increase in the sublevel spacing requires significant additional planned 
dilution that cannot be supported by the project economics. 
An  example  of  the  layout  for  the  initial  lift  of  the  SM_80_19a  has  been  attached  as

16.3.7  Carlés North
 



Narrow-vein longhole open stoping (LOS) with unconsolidated rockfill.   
Historically  Carlés  North  has  been  exploited  using  open  cut,  and  a  combination  of  cut 
and fill and longhole stoping methods for the upper levels (CN Phase1).  Most recently, 
narrow  vein  longhole  open  stoping  has  been  successfully  applied  to  the  lower  levels 
from the +50 to the -10mRL (CN Phase 2).  
Given that the current resource extends to below the -150mRL, Carlés North has been 
divided into 3 mining horizons (Phase 1, 2 and 3) in order to commence production in a 
timely manner and to ensure that mining conforms to a non-entry bottom-up approach, 
reducing  the  exposure  of  personnel  to  risks  during  the  stoping  process.  Each  phase 
consists of 4 panels of 20m stope height, separated by a 10m crown pillar.   
The conceptual sequence for Carlés North is as follows: 
o
Drive  crosscut  accesses  at  4.0  x  4.5m  from  the  main  haulage  ramp  to  the 
hanging-wall  skarn  contact,  to  centrally  intersect  the  orebody  at 20m sublevel 
intervals.   
Develop  a  4.5m  x  4.5m  “shantyback”  drill  drive  on-strike  to  the  eastern  and 
western limits of the skarn.

Install  cablebolt  support  for  each  of  the  drawpoint  intersections  and  for  the 
orebody hangingwall and footwall contacts, according to the standards included 
in section 18.1. 
Define the short-term stope shapes according to the grade control model, to a 
minimum mineable width of 3.0m. 
Drill and blast the stopes, in accordance with the drill and blast designs issued 
by the planning department.  
Upon  completion  of  the  each  stope,  take  a  final  CMS  measurement  for 
reconciliation and volume calculation. 
Upon  completion  of  the  each  complete  mining  horizon,  make  use  of  the 
supported stope voids to place mine waste.

No production has commenced from Carlés North-West.  However based on similarities 
between the Carlés North and Carlés North-West zones, the conceptual design for the 
North West has been based on the North.  Carlés North West has been divided into 3 
mining horizons (Phase 1, 2 and 3) in order to commence production in a timely manner 
and  to  ensure  that  mining  conforms  to  a  non-entry  bottom-up  approach.  Each  phase 
consists of 2-4 panels of 20m stope height, separated by a 10m crown pillar.

Pumping
In  2008  Golder  Associates  conducted  an  investigation  of  the  hydrogeology  at  the  Boinás/El  Valle 
operations in order to identify the possibility of mine dewatering, based on the conservative assumption 
that the aquifer system in Boinás is not limited by low flow boundaries.  The findings in this report and 
the additional knowledge that has been gained by the geological department at Kinbauri with respect to 
the  hydrogeology  have  been  used  to  revise  the  mine  dewatering  system  for  Boinás.    Likewise,  the 
dewatering system at Carlés has also been reviewed based on the expertise of the Kinbauri personnel.
16.5.1  Boinás / El Valle
The phreatic level at Boinás has been gradually lowered from the 390mRL during open pit operations, to 
the current level of 170mRL.  This remains above the production horizon in the Boinás East, Black Skarn 
and San Martín zones. As such, the design of a new dewatering network has been a priority for 2011.   
 
Commissioning  of  the  new  dewatering  network  will  be  completed  during  2012,  including  the 
decommissioning  of  the  main  pump  station  currently  located  at  the  200mRL  and  the  installation  of  a 
new  underground  pump  station  at  the  100mRL,  in  close  proximity  to  the  shaft  access.  The  new 
dewatering network will maintain the current system of two independent circuits within the mine; clean 
water and mine (dirty) water.  
 
The clean water  circuit  will pump water from dewatering holes situated below the phreatic level.  The 
current pumping rate is approximately 160 m³/h (44L/s). When the new underground pump station has 
been commissioned, pumping capacity will be 416 m³/h (115L/s). This pumping capacity will be provided 
by the installation of two 250 kW pumps in parallel, each able to extract 208 m³/h (57L/s). All the water 
collected from the dewatering holes will report to the main pump station and from here will be pumped 
to the plant to be used during processing.   
 
The mine water circuit will remove operational water from the mine.  Mine water is collected from the 
various  working  faces  via  a  network  of  drain  holes,  sumps  and  flygt  pumps,  and  reports  to  the 
underground pumping station. The current pumping capacity is approximately125 m³/h (35L/s). When 
the new underground station has been commissioned, pumping capacity will be 360 m³/h (100L/s), and 
will be provided by two 250 kW pumps installed in parallel. Each pump will be able to extract 180 m³/h 
(50L/s).  Water extracted from the mine water circuit is sent to the surface water treatment facility and 
from there to the tailings dam.

16.5.2  Carlés
Improvements  have  been  made  to  the  mine  dewatering  network  at  Carlés  during  2011,  with  the 
introduction  of  independent  clean  and  mine  water  circuit  s  and  an  increase  in  the  overall  pumping 
capacity. 
 
The clean water circuit removes water from the aquifer in Carlés East. The maximum flow rate from the 
aquifer is approximately 140 m³/h (38L/s) with pumping capacity at 150 m³/h (42L/s), provided by two 
45 kW centrifugal pumps. 
 
The  mine  water  circuit  removes  operational  water  from  the  mine  that  is  collected  in  the  main  sump 
located  in  Carlés  North  -10  via  a  series  of  drain  holes  throughout  the  mine.    A  similar  system  will  be 
employed in the future for Phase 3 of Carlés North, with water reporting to the Carlés North -100. The 
mine  water  from  the  Carlés  North  -10  sump  is  pumped  to  the  main  water  station  situated  in  Carlés 
East -12 and extracted from the mine. The current flow rate is approximately 36 m³/h (10L/s) and the 
main station pump capacity is 72 m³/h (20L/s).

Backfill
Plant tailings are currently not permitted as backfill at the Boinás/El-Valle operations, due to the levels 
of arsenic present.  Therefore a system of cemented aggregate fill (CAF) has been designed by Kinbauri 
España in conjunction with technical support from Golder Associates and the Universidad Politécnica de 
Madrid.  
 
The  mining  method  adopted  at  Boinás  allows  a  quick  turn-around  of  small  stopes  and  as  such  it  is 
essential  that  access  to  the  secondary  production  headings  is  not  delayed.  The  mining  schedule  is 
therefore  targeting  a  7-day  curing  period  between  final  CAF  placement  and  development  work 
commencing  on  top  of  the  fill  mass  and  a  28-day  curing  period  between  final  CAF  placement  and 
exposure  of  the  fill  mass  laterally  during  extraction  from  adjacent  stopes.  There  will  be  a  maximum 
backfill  exposure  of  approximately  60m  given  that  it  is  the  intention  to  extract  stopes  without  the 
inclusion of sill pillars.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 232
The waste rock that is to be used as aggregate will be granite sourced from underground development.  
The rock will be stockpiled on surface and crushed to 75mm by means of a crushing plant that is to be 
contracted for this purpose and installed close to the shotcrete batching facility.   Initially the crushed 
aggregate will be trucked to a central location in the mine where the binder can be dosed into the back 
of the haul trucks, however the future system will likely make use of a surface-underground connection 
that will allow the aggregate to be gravity fed underground.  The underground binder preparation circuit 
will  include  a  binder  storage  arrangement,  a  mixing  system  and  a  storage/ageing  tank  and  dosing 
system.  The  cemented  aggregate  will  be  mixed  underground  and  batched  directly  into  a  fleet  of  2-3 
trucks. The current plan is to convert  several of the existing mine  fleet to ejection-tray trucks for CAF 
placement after commissioning of the shaft is complete. 
 
The fleet of fill trucks will deliver the fill material to the filling location.  For longhole stopes, the stopes 
will be filled by tipping the aggregate mix into the void directly from the upper level access. As the fill 
level increases, placement close to the backs will be achieved with the use of a rammer-jammer style 
ejection bucket attached to a LHD unit. In cut and fills stopes, the cemented aggregate will be pushed 
into the void using a rammer jammer style ejection bucket attached to a LHD unit.  
 
The  mining  dimensions  at  Boinás  mean  that  for  some  stopes  the  critical  strength  factor  is  the 
requirement for 1Mpa mucking floor strength rather than the dimensions of the exposure face of fill. To 
reduce  cost,  it  may  be  possible  to  fill  the  longhole  stoping  voids  with  lower  strength  fill  capable  of 
maintaining the fill mass integrity, and then capping the fill off with a higher strength layer to act as the 
mucking floor should future stoping be planned above. 
 
The dimension of cut and fill stoping prevent the development of a high strength top layer. However the 
same result may be achieved by using a sprayed concrete layer to coat backs prior to fill placement. 
 
In determining the CAF strength required, the following factors were considered:
 
 
 

Dimensions of the void to be filled 
Dimensions of the fill to be exposed by future mining 
Mining schedule and blasting practices 
Properties of the backfill material including: 
o 
o 
o
Particle size distribution 
UCS of the rock, 
Type of binder
Using a safety factor of two and a half, the following required fill strengths have been calculated:

E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 233
A testing procedure has been developed to assess the strength gain of the CAF with a range of binder 
dosages. Large scale cylinder UCS tests have been carried out to identify what binder dosage is required 
to meet the ideal mining schedule. 
 
In summary, a CAF required to support  the mining operation at Boinás needs to achieve  a 1Mpa UCS 
after 7 days of curing when the top fill mass is to be used as the mucking floor during overhand cut and 
fill or longhole stoping. When the fill mass will only be exposed by adjacent stoping activity the required 
strength is reduced to the figures presented in Table 16-3 after a 28 day curing period.

exhaust raise. The primary ventilation fan is a 250kW Zitron ZVNV 1-23-250/6.  Total pressure is 2100Pa, 
and the current circuit consists of a total flow of 95m³/s.

The Boinás ventilation circuit is based on the  air entering the portal and being distributed to the four 
principal zones in the mine as follows:



Boinás  Este:  fresh  air  arrives  at  the  Boinás  Este  via  the  Boinás  Este  ramp,  and  is 
extracted via a connection to the primary exhaust raise at the 150 level.   
Charnela South: fresh air arrives at Charnela South directly from the principal ramp and 
is extracted via an internal vent raise that connects to the underground magazine and 
from there to the primary exhaust raise at the 295 level.   
Black Skarn and San Martín: fresh air arrives at Black Skarn via the principal ramp and at 
present is returned to the same ramp through an internal vent raise from the 120 level.   
From this point, the air arrives at the San Martín as a mixture of both clean air and the 
exhaust air from Black Skarn. The ventilation circuit is undergoing changes to ensure a 
clean supply of fresh air to both zones in the future.
Air quantities in the attached figures have been formatted according to the following legend:

The current ventilation circuit has been modeled in VentSIM, which has been used to simulate scenarios 
to improve the existing circuit.  This has demonstrated the need to expand the ventilation circuit in the 
future which will be done by extending the Charnela vent raise to allow exhaust air to be extracted from 
the Black Skarn ramp directly.  Details of the internal vent raise are:
Top elevation: 310 m/Bottom elevation: 100 m 
Length: 214m 
Diameter: 2.7 m

The advantages of this will be that all the zones in the mine will maintain fresh air, independently with 
respect to each other and there will be greater control over the flow of air to the various working areas 
of  the  mine.    In  addition  the  vent  raise  will  reduce  the  overall  resistance  of  the  circuit  and  the  total 
pressure to1476Pa, which will increase flow through the mine to 129m³/s. 
 
A schematic of the proposed long-term ventilation circuit has been included as Figure 16-30.

The  primary  ventilation  circuit  in  Carlés  has  been  described  below,  and  has  been  included  as  Figure 
16-31. 
 
Fresh air enters  Carlés via the  Carlés Este  ramp and is extracted via a 2.7m diameter primary exhaust 
raise. The primary ventilation fan is a Zitron ZVR 1-18-110/4, which has been installed underground to 
reduce  the  environmental  impact  on  the  nearby  town  of  Carlés.    Total  pressure  is  800Pa,  and  the 
current circuit consists of a total flow of 60.5m³/s. 
 
The  Carlés  ventilation  circuit  is  based  on  the  air  entering  the  portal  and  being  distributed  to  the  two 
principal areas in the mine via a series of internal ventilation raises and a system of ventilation doors.  
Exhaust air returns via a ramp connection to the Carlés primary exhaust raise which is 2.4m in diameter 
and has a length of 143m.

Emergency Egress
16.8.1  Boinás / El Valle
Installation  of  an  escape  ladderway  at  Boinás  commenced  in  2011,  with  two  of  three  stages  being 
installed  (from  surface  to  the  395mRL  and  from  the  295mRLto  the  200mRL).  The  final  stage  is  to  be 
completed in March 2012 so as to not interfere with the shaft installation.  Below the 200mRL there is 
currently  only  the  single  means  of  egress.  This  is  being  addressed  by  the  placement  of  a  12-person 
MineARC refuge chamber located off the principle ramp system at the 140mRL, in close proximity to the 
Black Skarn and San Martín zones.  In the future, there will be an internal ventilation raise connecting 
San Martín to Boinás Este, at which point a short ladderway will connect the various ramp systems and 
provide two means of access from surface to the 120mRL.
16.8.2  Carlés
The second means of egress at Carlés is via an escape ladderway that has been installed in the primary 
exhaust  raise  from  surface  to  the  5mRL.  As  the  primary  ventilation  fan  is  located  underground,  the 
controls can be accessed by personal during an emergency such that the direction of flow in the primary 
ventilation raise can be reversed if required. Below the 5mRL, a 12 person MineARC refuge chamber has 
been installed off the Carlés North ramp at the -20mRL.

RECOVERY METHODS
17.1
Introduction
The EVBC processing plant consists of crushing, grinding, gravimetric, flotation, and CIL circuits, gravity 
concentrate  leaching  (ILIX),  gold  recovery  (carbon  elution,  electrolysis  and  bullion  smelting),  and 
detoxification of tailings (Figure 17-1). The EVBC plant was originally designed to treat 79 t/h and with 
later modifications of the process, it was upgraded to feed up to 95 t/h dry tonnes, or 2,280 t/d, with 
the ore extracted from El Valle-Boinás and Carlés open pit mines.  Today, the plant can process as much 
as 70 t/h of skarn ore only.  Given the softness of the oxide ore, if it is added to the skarn ore, more than 
2,000 t/d could be processed.  Fresh and recycled water is used; it is a zero discharge system.  Energy is 
supplied from the grid and is adequate to maintain the processing circuit operational throughout every 
day of the year. 
 
Both  gold-bearing  copper  concentrates  and  bullion  can  be  produced  on  site.    During  October  and 
November, the grade ranges for the copper concentrate were 75-110 g/t Au, 18-30% Cu, and 250-450 
g/t Ag.  The poured doré consisted of about 60% Au, 35% Ag, and 5% Cu.

Process Description
The ore extracted from EVBC mines is classified in stockpiles depending on the gold, copper and arsenic 
grades. A suitable ore mixture is estimated in order to feed the mill around 2-5 g/t gold and <1% copper. 
 
Dry crushing starts the treatment process. The ore is reduced up to 153 mm to 600 mm. After crushing, 
the  ore  is  sent  to  grinding  to  reach  the  ideal  liberation  size  of  gold  to  about  74  microns.  Grinding  is 
carried  out  wet  and  in  two  stages.    The  grinding  is  not  perfect  so  it  is  necessary  to  install  a  set  of 
hydrocyclones with a 74-microns diameter in order to treat  the  joint  discharge  from the SAG and ball 
mills.  The  hydrocyclones  classify  the  milled  ore  into  two  groups:  an  overflow,  or  fine  fraction,  with  a 
particle size <74 microns, and an underflow, or coarse fraction, with a particle size > 74 microns. 
 
Part of the cyclone underflow goes back directly to the grinding circuit. The rest goes through a 2-mm 
mesh  screen.  From  this  screen,  the  rejected  material  returns  to  the  grinding  circuit  and  the  passing 
material  enters  into  the  gravimetric  circuit.  In  this  circuit,  the  combination  of  centrifugal  forces  and 
gravity acting on the fluidized ore mixture enable the extraction of native metal concentrates (coarse Cu 
and Au) based on their specific gravities. Two types of products are obtained at this circuit: 1) high-grade 
gold in copper concentrate and 2) low-grade gold in copper concentrate. The low-grade gold in copper 
concentrate  is the  final product,  whereas  the high-grade  gold in copper concentrate is further passed 
into the ILIX plant. 
 
The  ILIX  plant  is  formed  by  a  reactor,  an  electrolysis  tank  and  two  electrolysis  cells.  The  high-grade 
concentrate from the gravity circuit is fed to the reactor together with a mixture of fresh water, soda 
and cyanide. The cyanide dissolves the gold present in such concentrates. The solution loaded with gold 
is  separated  from  the  solid  by  decantation.  The  solid  goes  back  to  MBO  and  the  liquid  goes  to 
electrolysis in order to convert the gold into solid state again in the form of cathodic sludge. This sludge 
is finally smelted to obtain the gravimetric bullion. 
 
The cyclone overflow goes to the flotation circuit. In this circuit, frothers and collectors, e.g., MIBC and 
xantate,  respectively,  are  used  to  float  the  copper  sulphides,  which  are  hydrophobic  and  stick  to  the 
surface of the air bubbles. The froth is collected and dried in a filter press, to obtain a concentrate that is 
high in copper and low in gold. 
 
The  residual  pulp,  or  tailings,  formed  from  the  flotation  process  passes  through  a  thickener  then  is 
leached in the  CIL  circuit using cyanide  and oxygen and then is adsorbed over active carbon. The fine 
gold particles that are not removed in the physical gravimetric process or the physico-chemical flotation 
process are removed by chemical reaction with oxygen and cyanide. The  loaded carbon is sent  to the 
elution  process  from  which  free  carbon  is  obtained,  with  the  gold  being  discharged  by  passing  the 
loaded carbon through an electrolyte solution which is then returned to the CIL process.  
 
The  electrolyte  goes  through  the  electrolysis  cells  where  the  cations of  the  cyanide  gold  complex  are 
reduced to native gold (cathode) while the cyanide anions are oxidized to cyanate (anode). The cathodic 
sludge is dried and is fluxed with silica, borax and nitrate. This mixture goes to the smelting kiln and doré 
bars are made.

17.2.1  Crushing
The ore is transported to an area and classified in terms of its mineralogy, gold, copper and/or arsenic 
grade. A loader collects the ore from the stock area and unloads it to the upper part of the mill feed bin, 
which has a 600 mm fixed grid to reject the oversized material.  The mill feed bin has an apron feeder 
that  feeds  the  primary  crusher.  Spillage  is  collected  on  a  conveyor  belt.    Both  the  spillage  and  the 
crushed  ore  which  is  <153  mm  size  are  unloaded  on  another  conveyor  belt  and  sent  to  the 
grinding-feeding  area  with  a  capacity  of  100  tonnes.    This  conveyor  belt  has  an  automatic  scale  that 
weighs  and  monitors  the  crushed  ore.    The  crushed  ore  ready  for  grinding  has  a  variable  speed  belt 
feeder in the bottom part in order to feed ground ore through another conveyor belt.  This belt also has 
a scale and it is the tonnage weighed therein that is recorded as the treated tonnage. 
 
Given the fact that the capacity of the crusher (200 t/h) is in excess of that for grinding, the mill feed bin 
will overflow (if necessary) to a conveyor belt that discharges the material to an emergency stack with a 
capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Thus, if the crushing is not able to feed the grinding directly (for example due 
to maintenance, breakdown, etc.), then the feed would go to the emergency stock. 
 
The crushing area has a dust control wet system for the most critical areas with the corresponding pump 
to  send  the  collected  wet  dust  to  the  grinding  box.  It  also  has  a  sprinkler  irrigation  system  for  other 
critical open places.
17.2.2  Pebble Crushing
After  grinding  in  the  SAG  mill,  the  particles  leaving  the  mill  doors  are  screened  to  12  mm  in  the 
trommel.  The trommel’s discharge falls onto the conveyor belt that carries the pebbles to the crushing 
chute; in this belt, there  is a magnetic  sorter  that will release  the load of ball fragments and metallic 
elements  in  general,  and  then,  a  metal  detector  will  automatically  jump  the  crusher  in  case  some 
magnetic material passes the  sorter.  The  pebbles fall directly into the cone  crusher, which will crush 
the pebbles to <12 mm.  The crushed pebbles return to the SAG mill feeding by means of a conveyor 
belt  provided  with  a  continuous  weightometer,  which  weighs  the  total  amount  of  pebbles  that  will 
recirculate together with the feeding to the SAG mill.  If for some reason this facility cannot be used, it is 
possible  to  unload  the  mill’s  pebbles  out  of  the  plant  by  a  portable  belt,  although  in  this  case  the 
pebbles would not recirculate to the plant and would be removed from the process.
Given  that  it  was  noted  early  on  that  the  production  of  pebbles  was  very  high,the  cone  crusher  was 
installed.    This  allowed  for  reduction  of  overall  residence  time  in  the  SAG  mill,  which  permitted  an 
increase in grinding capacity.
17.2.3  Grinding
The dry crushed ore at P80 < 153 mm feeds the wet grinding area by means of a conveyor belt with a 
scale and a classification circuit.  Water is added in the SAG mill to achieve  the  desired pulp density.  
There is a discharge trommel that removes foreign elements.  The oversize fraction goes to the pebble 
crusher circuit, milled by a cone crusher, and returned to the SAG mill.  The undersize fraction goes to 
the pump box and to the ball mill discharge.  The ball mill grinds the underflow from the hydrocyclones.
This closed circuit includes the main grinding pump, which feeds seven 250 mm diameter hydrocyclones 
with  the  underflow  feeding  the  ball  mill  and  the  overflow  (fine  milled  product  at  P80  <74  microns  or
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s

0,074 mm)  goes  to  the  flotation  area  (40%  solid).    It  has  been  planned  to  divert  this  flow  directly  to 
cyanidation if flotation is not necessary, e.g., low-grade copper oxide ore.
Part of the hydrocyclones unclassified underflow is sent to the gravity area at about 100 t/h.
17.2.4  Gravity Circuit
The  ore  size  reduction  in  the  SAG  mill,  at  less  than  1  mm,  produces  the  liberation  of  certain  metallic 
gold,  copper  and  silver  particles,  in  sizes  between  100  and  500  microns,  that  could  be  recovered  by 
gravity given the density difference with the host rock. 
 
After the ore has been crushed and milled, it goes to a battery of 8 hydrocyclones, whose purpose is to 
prevent coarse particles getting into the flotation area. Part of the hydrocyclones underflow goes back 
to the ball mill and the rest, at about 100 t/h, is diverted to the gravity circuit after passing through a 
2-mm vibrating screen. The screen undersize material goes to a bank of twelve 12LM3/2 rougher double 
spirals  located  near  the  screen  and  the  rest  is  fed  to  the  KNELSON–30  concentrator  (“K30”)  together 
with  the  previous  material  at40-80  t/h.    The  K30  concentrate  is  unloaded  in  the  Knelson  concentrate 
tank, while the waste feeds two other banks of 12 rougher double spirals.  The material form the three 
banks  of rougher  double spirals feed the KNELSON–20  (“K20”) concentrator, while  the waste material 
goes to the gravity tails box. 
 
The K20 concentrate goes to the Knelson concentrate tank together with the K30 material and the tails 
are pumped by a vertical pump to the bank of four cleaning double spirals (4LM3/2) situated next to the 
main  draining  cyclone.    The  concentrate  tank  feeds  the  KNELSON-12  concentrator,  from  which  a 
high-grade gravity concentrate is made as a final product and the tails go to the main draining cyclone. 
 
The cleaning spiral concentrate feeds the recleaning double spiral (1LM3/2) and the mixed material to 
the  retreat  double  spiral  (1LM3/2),  both  of  which  are  situated  behind  the  mills.  The  tails  go  to  the 
gravity tails box. 
 
The  recleaning  double  spiral  concentrate  feeds  two  of  the  four  Holman  vibrating  tables.  The 
concentrates  from  these  two  tables  are  pumped  to  the  concentrate  draining  cyclone  situated  in  the 
electrowinning  room.  The  overflow  goes  to  the  tails  box  and  the  underflow  feeds  the  Holman  2000 
vibrating table, from which a gold concentrate is made. 
 
Both the retreat spiral concentrate and the mixed material from the recleaning spiral and the Holman 
tables  go  to  the  mixed  pump  that  pumps  them  towards  two  recleaning  spirals  (2xLM3/1)  that  are 
located next to the Holman 2000 table. The tails and the mixed material from the retreat double spiral 
and the tails from the recleaning double spiral go to the tails box. 
 
The  concentrates  and  mixed  material  from  the  two  recleaning  spirals  feed  the  other  two  Holman 
vibrating  tables,  which  are  located  closer  to  the  pressure  filter  secondary  concentration  tables 
(25TBS01A and 25TBS01B). From these tables, the tails go to the tails box together with the tails from 
the two recleaning spirals and the concentrate goes to the dewatering screw (25TDS01).   A low-grade 
gravity concentrate is made from the screw.
E l   V a l l e / B o i n á s -   C a r l é s   G o l d   D e p o s i t s
P a g e  | 243
The content of the waste box is pumped to the main draining cyclone located next to the four cleaning 
spirals. The overflow is split and goes to the following areas: grinding pump box, gravity tails pumps, K30 
feeding pump, flotation tails and flotation dilution. The underflow goes back to the ball mill.
17.2.5  Flotation Circuit
After grinding to P80<74 microns and following the gravity process, significant  amounts  of fine  native 
gold and native copper as well as variable amounts of copper sulphides, mostly as chalcopyrite, remain.  
The  native  metals  and  sulphides  can  be  recovered  in  the  flotation  process;  the  recovery  of  copper  is 
extremely important due to its negative effect on gold recovery in the CIL circuit. 
 
The  frothing  flotation  principle  is  selective  flotability  of  the  economic  metals  and  minerals  that  are 
covered by a shaken slurry, trapped by specific collector reagents, and transported upwards by frother 
reagents.  The  flotation  circuit  consists  of  two  rougher  stages,  two  scavenger  stages,  and  two  cleaner 
circuits (Table 17-1).  All the cells include a low-pressure air blower.

The grinding cyclone overflow, with aproximately 40% solids, starts at the rougher conditioner. At this 
stage sampling takes place.  The slurry is conditioned by agitation in a tank with a 2.5-minute residence 
time and its density is reduced to 25% solids and, depending on the ore characteristics, lime is added to 
reach the desired pH (currently flotation is carried out at natural pH), Potassium Amyl Xanthathe is the 
collector reagent, Aero 412 or Danafloat 123 is the promoter reagent, and Dowfroth 250 is the frothing 
reagent. 
 
The  prepared  slurry  flows  by  gravity  to  the  first  rougher  cells,  second  rougher  cells,  and  the  first 
scavenger  cells,  and  then  is  pumped  to  the  second  scavenger  cells.  The  tails  go  to  the  leaching  head 
thickener.  The floated concentrate then is cleaned in two recleaning stages. 
 
The  first  rougher  concentrate  is  pumped  to  the  first  recleaning  cells,  the  second  rougher  concentrate 
and  the  first  scavenger  concentrate  are  also  pumped  to  the  first  recleaning,  and  finally  the  second 
scavenger  froth  recirculates  to  the  flotation  head  or  to  the  first  recleaning  depending  on  the  froth 
quality.  The tails from the four flotation cells of the first recleaning recirculate to the rougher flotation 
head or, if necessary, with the final rougher tails. The froth, that is, the first recleaning concentrate, is 
pumped to the second recleaning head.  In the two cells of the second recleaning, the tails go to the first 
recleaning and the concentrate is pumped to the concentrate thickener.

P a g e  | 244
17.2.6  Thickener and Filtering
The second recleaning concentrate feeds the concentrate thickener, which is 6 metres in diameter.  The 
addition of flocculant necessary to keep optimal sedimentation and compaction conditions is carried out 
in the feeding box of this thickener.  The thickener overflow contains a large amount of solids (low-grade 
copper concentrate), so it is subject to a clarifying process by lamellas. A small amount of flocculant is 
also added to this thickener. The clear lamellas overflow can be used as process water at this stage. 
 
The  overflow  from  both  the  thickener  and  clarifier  is  pumped  pneumatically  to  the  pressure  filter 
feeding tank. The filtered concentrate is discharged to the filtration sump pump in order to be loaded 
either  as  flotation  concentrate  final  product  (high  Cu  grade,  low  Au  grade)  or  by  loading  it  onto  the 
trucks.
17.2.7  Carbon-in Leach Circuit (CIL)
After flotation, the  tails still contain significant amounts  of very fine  gold and copper. Any copper will 
cause problems both in the cyanidation process (high consumption of cyanide) and carbon adsorption 
(slow  kinetics  and  reduction  in  the  gold  adsorption  capacity),  and  also  in  the  subsequent  desorption, 
electrodeposition and smelting processes.  The cyanide leaching and active carbon process (CIL Process) 
tends to recover this gold and inevitably part of the undesired copper by dissolution and adsorption in 
the same tanks. 
 
The tails pumped from the flotation tails pre-leaching thickener pass through a horizontal screen with a 
polyurethane  panel  and  600-micron  mesh  light  to  sort  the  undesired  materials  from  the  pulp,  mainly 
organic material. It is situated in the top part of the circuitso that the oversized material goes to the final 
tails pump box of the tailings impoundment.  The screen pulp goes to the leaching circuit formed by 6 
identical  tanks  -  1  cyanide  leaching  tank  and  5  CIL  tanks  (leaching  and  adsorption  with  cyanide  and 
active carbon). 
 
The volume of each tank is 600 m3 and a mechanical agitator with a double axial flow  blade stirs the 
fluids;  oxygen  is  introduced  by  a  low-pressure  air  blower  in  the  agitator.    The  retention  time  is  four 
hours. 
 
The slurry is prepared by adding lime, in order to maintain the pH between 10.5 and 11, and cyanide.  
The  five  cyanidation  and  adsorption  tanks  are  interconnected  by  overflow  channels;  active  carbon  is 
supended in the slurry.  The output of each tank has a vertical cylindrical screen with 700 mircon x 700 
micron  panels  to  retain  carbon.  The  platform  of  the  first  CIL  tank  has  a  vertical  pump  to  recover  the 
loaded carbon and send it to a wet vibrating screen for washing before the elution process.  Carbon is 
transferred between the other tanks by means air injectors. The slurry is progressively enriched in gold 
from the first to the fifth tank.  The slurry tails from the last CIL tank, with low amounts of cyanide, is 
sent to the last tank in order to detoxify the free cyanide and other polluting heavy elements.
17.2.8  Detoxification
The leach tails go to two 630 m3 tanks for detoxification by the SO2/air INCO process to remove residual 
cyanide  and  precipitated  heavy  metals,  e.g.,  copper,  zinc,  iron,  etc.    After  cleansing,  the  tails  are 
sampled and analysed.  The tails then go to the security screen to remove the carbon particles from the 
tails.  The tails are then pumped to the tailings impoundment.

17.2.9  Desorption and Carbon Degeneration
The loaded carbon coming from the first CIL tank and transferred by the vertical centrifuge pump to a 
cleaning screen goes  to an elution column; the slurry returns to the first  CIL  tank.  The elution circuit 
applies the Anglo-American AARL process, which is developed in a 9 m3 cylindrical column with capacity 
for 4 tonnes of carbon. It has the following stages:

The elution process is completed in less than 8 hours, including 2 hours between loading and unloading 
of the column.  The two first washing and rinsing effluents are rejected as tailings solution. The rest go 
to  the  reagent  tank  as  electrolyte  for  the  electrodeposition.    After  completing  the  elution  cycle,  the 
carbon  is  transferred  to  the  last  CIL  tank  or  to  the  carbon  regeneration  circuit  by  means  of  a  water 
pressure injector.  If the carbon contains a high copper content present in the carbon, washing with a 
cold cyanide solution can occur before elution.  This, however, has not been an issue at EVBC.
17.2.10 Regeneration
The unloaded carbon is transferred to a self-draining chute in the regeneration feed kiln by means of a 
water  injector.    This  kiln  is  a  horizontal  rotary  kiln  heated  up  by  propane  at  temperatures  ranging 
between  650º  and  700ºC  and  with  a  250  kg/h  capacity.  The  kiln’s  unloaded  material  is  fed  to  a 
regenerated carbon screen in order to wash the fines that pass through the carbon security screen. The 
position of the kiln over the CIL tanks makes sure that the regenerated undersize carbon go to the last 
adsorption tank in a minimal time.  The regeneration operation takes about 15 hours.
17.2.11 Doré Pour
The  electrolyte  coming  from  the  loaded  carbon  elution  is  stored  in  the  electrolyte  tank  of  the 
electrodeposition process.  This area has four electrolyte cells with its corresponding current rectifiers 
and  each  of  them  has  nine  steel  cathodes.    The  electrolyte  solution  circulates  through  the  cells,  such 
that it always contains less than 10 g/t Au.  This operation normally takes less than 16 hours. 
 
The Au deposited in the cathodes is dismantled and unloaded weekly and then goes to a calcination kiln 
at 750ºC before direct smelting.  The smelting is carried out in a 0.04 m3 smelting furnace with capacity 
to reach 1200ºC.  After calcination, the cathode gold and silver concentrates are mixed with fluxes for 
the smelting.  The gold is then poured into molds.

The EVBC main infrastructure was completed in 1997 (Figure 18-1, Figure 5-2).  The office was expanded 
in 2011.  The processing plant has a nameplate capacity of 600,000 tpa, where subsequent expansions 
have enabled treatment of over 750,000 tpa depending on ore types; a full description of the processing 
plant  is  found  in  Section  17.    Auxiliary  equipment  includes  pump  systems  to  distribute  water,  water 
recovery systems, gas storage, control boilers, gas heaters, blowers, compressors, etc. 
 
Other  surface  facilities  include  changing  rooms,  lunch  rooms,  clinic,  warehouses,  maintenance  shops, 
electromechanical  workshops,  a  shotcrete  plant  a  complete  laboratory  that  includes  a  sample 
preparation  area  with  jaw  crusher,  roll  mill,  LM5,  LM2,  rotary  and  manual  splitter,  etc.,  fire-assay

In June 2011, the Asturias Minsitry of Environment required the posting of a €10M bond for the tailings 
impoundment, which is located in the old El Valle open pit.  Soon thereafter, €5M was posted and the 
remainder is due in June 2012.  KE has received an independent study that shows remediation of the 
tailings  impoundment  would  cost  less  than the  amount  currently  posted  and will  seek  relief  form the 
regulatory authorities to waive the bond due in June 2012. 
 
Water samples from all pertinent areas are collected periodically and reported to the authorities (Figure 
20-1).  To date, no citations have been received for non-compliance.

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS
21 
 
The  capital  expenditure  through  September  30,  2011  was  €66,700,000,  most  of  which  is  related  to 
primary underground development.  During fiscal 2012, additional capital of €6,500,000 is budgeted plus 
a contingent amount of €5,000,000 for the environmental bond related to the tailings impoundment. 
 
During  August  and  September,  2011,  the  cash  cost  net  of  byproduct  was  US$1,180/ounce  of  gold.  
During October and November, 2011 the cash cost net of byproduct was below US$1,000/ounce of gold. 
 
22 
 
The  EVBC  operation  started  commercial  production  in  August,  2011.    The  Company  reported  a  direct 
operating  cash  cost  of  $1,180  per  ounce  of  gold  net  of  byproduct  revenues  for  the  period 
August-September, 2011, which falls into the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.

ADJACENT PROPERTY
OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
23 
 
There are several properties near the Orvana properties that have exploration potential.  These include 
Santa Marina, Villaverde, Antonaña, and other prospects in the area that were prospected, but were not 
owned by RNGM and are not part of the Orvana holdings.  In addition, the Navelgas and Oscos Belt west 
of the Río Narcea Gold Belt may present future opportunities.  During 2011, KE was awarded the Lidia 
claims located about 20 kilometres west of EVBC.  RNGM drilled various holes in the area targeting both 
skarn and disseminated granite-hosted gold. 
 
24 
 
Mining activities in Spain may be subsidized by the federal government.  In 2010, KE was granted a €5M 
subsidy  for  development  work.    Once  invoices  are  submitted  and  approved,  the  expenditure  is 
reimbursed. 
 
25 
 
The EVBC deposits  are  host  to about  800,000 ounces of gold reserves  and about  1,500,000 ounces of 
gold inferred resources, and the area has significant potential.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
1.
2.
3.
4.
Underground mining is a viable venture.  Although difficult, gold can be produced at a 
cost of less than US$1,000/ounce net of byproduct revenues.
Mining of the ore zones will be greatly facilitated by the completion of a shaft. 
 
The mill throughput can be increased with minor investment.
Continued underground drilling will likely upgrade and increase resources that could be 
converted to reserves.
5.
An increase in reserves could justify a mill expansion.
RECOMMENDATIONS
26 
 
It is recommended that Orvana continue drilling with the objective of increasing reserves.  Development 
drilling to convert inferred resources to indicated in the core area of the A107 and San Martín Zones is a 
high prioirity. 
 
Continued drilling based on the recommendations of Noble (2010) is imperative.  The coordinates of the 
recommended infill drilling, measured on the A107 trend surface, are summarized in Table 26-1.

Continued  drilling  is  required  to  convert  the  inferred  resources  in  the  San  Martín  Zone  (the  southern 
part of the Black Skarn North Zone) to indicated resources (Noble, 2011).  The highest priority area is in 
the  eastern  part  of  the  zone,  which  contains  high-grade  copper-gold  mineralization 
in  a 
northwesterly-trending  zone  that  is  parallel  to the  intersection of  the  San  Martín  Zone  with  the  A107 
Zone.    There  are  15  Priority-1  holes  in  this  area  using  a  20x40-metre  grid  that  is  designed  to  provide 
more  detailed  information  across  the  highest-grade  mineralization,  as  shown  in  Figure  26-2.    The  12 
Priority-2 holes provide additional information on the edges of the high-grade zone. 
 
The Priority-3 holes use a nominal 40-metre grid and are designed to convert the lower-grade western 
part of the San Martín Zone to indicated resources.  The coordinates of the recommended infill drilling, 
measured on the Black Skarn North lower trend surface, are summarized in Table 26-2.  Depending on 
the mining plan, it is possible that the Priority-3 drilling could be postponed for several years.

This drilling will principally upgrade resources to the Measured category. 
 
Following  the  infill  drilling  and  underground  drifting  programs,  additional  development  drilling  is 
required. 
 
Furthermore, the following work is recommended:




Long term mine planning work should also consider what-if scenarios, particularly with 
respect  to  the  inferred  material,  which  could  significantly  lead  to  an  increase  in  the 
future reserve base.  The distribution of this material could also have a significant effect 
on future infrastructure and ore transportation planning.
On-going  analysis  of the  ore  transport  system  is  required,  to  develop  and  improve  on 
the currently planned systems, particularly at the Boinás site.
A  key  aspect  of  the  mining  methods  planned  at  Boinás  is  the  supply  of  good  quality 
backfill.  Kinbauri have already initiated detailed planning work on the proposed backfill 
system, and this needs to be prioritised right through to implementation.
Because of the two mine properties, multiple ore bodies and underground and open pit 
ore  sources,  many  different  mining  sequences  are  possible.    This  sequencing  aspect 
needs to be analysed and tested in detail, so as to assist cashflow as the mine restarts.


Improved determination and control of mining costs will enable improvements in mine 
planning,  with  respect  to  cut-off  grade  analysis  and  assessment  of  alternative  mining 
methods.
