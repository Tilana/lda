appropriately to the ongoing discussion regarding the efforts of States Members of the 
United Nations to assure adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear procedures, 
in particular with regard to placing on and removing individuals and entities from 
terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are participating 
in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which provide technical assistance related 
to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, include, as appropriate and 
where consistent with their mandates, the respect of international human rights law and, as 
applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee law, as well as the rule of law, as an 
important element of technical assistance that they offer to States related to counter-terrorism,
