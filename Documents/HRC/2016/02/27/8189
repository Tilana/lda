<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education, Kishore Singh, undertook a mission to Kazakhstan from 12 to 20 September 
</p><p>2011. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur collected first-hand information on the 
situation of the right to education in the country. 
</p>
<p> Kazakhstan has made clear commitments to protect and promote the right to 
education through its ratification of treaties such as the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These 
commitments are reflected in the Kazakh Constitution, which ensures everyone&#8217;s right to 
education free of cost. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that, thanks to long-standing 
investments in education and the country&#8217;s commitment to provide free education for all at 
the primary and secondary levels, Kazakhstan has achieved almost universal enrolment at 
both levels, as well as high literacy rates. He also welcomes plans to expand preschool 
education and to modernize the higher education system in the country. Nevertheless, the 
Special Rapporteur also notes that important challenges remain with regard to quality of 
education and the promotion of equal opportunities in education. In particular, he 
underlines the need to continue investing in multilingual education, the need to invest in the 
integration of persons with disabilities into mainstream education, and the need to ensure 
education for migrants and refugees residing in the country.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education, Kishore Singh, submits the findings of his mission to Kazakhstan, undertaken 
from 12 to 20 September 2011, and discusses the situation of right to education in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met with various Government authorities, 
including the Minister of Education and Science, the Minister of Labour and Social 
Protection, the National Ombudsman of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Secretary of the 
Human Rights Commission, the Executive Secretary of the Assembly of the People of 
Kazakhstan and the Deputy Mayor of Almaty. He also met with various representatives of 
United Nations agencies and civil society organizations working in Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited universities in Astana and Almaty, and primary and 
secondary schools in those cities and in rural areas of the Almaty Region (Oblast). He also 
visited a technical school and special schools for children with disabilities and children 
diagnosed with behavioural problems. While visiting education establishments, he met with 
directors, teachers, support staff and students.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Kazakhstan for 
its invitation and full cooperation during his mission. He also extends his thanks to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights Regional Office for 
Central Asia and to the United Nations Country Team in Kazakhstan. Lastly, he expresses 
his gratitude to all those who took time to meet with him and share their views and 
experiences in the field of education. 
</p>
<p>5. Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan has experienced historic political and 
economic development. The country has made commitments to protect and promote the 
right to education through its ratification of international human rights treaties. Due to the 
recognition in the Kazakh Constitution of the right to free education at the primary and 
secondary levels, the country has very high literacy rates and almost universal enrolment at 
the primary and secondary levels of education. 
</p>
<p>6. As the country continues to enjoy accelerated economic growth, it has a great 
opportunity to invest substantially more in the education system, which would help it to 
ensure higher quality in education and avoid the exclusion of marginalized groups. In 
particular, attention must be given to the inclusion of students living in poverty and, 
considering the rich multi-ethnic and multilingual nature of the population in Kazakhstan, 
the promotion of multilingual education. Specific action is also required to ensure adequate 
education opportunities for persons with disabilities, and for migrants and refugees. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework / international obligations 
</b></p>
<p>7. Kazakhstan is a party to various core international human rights instruments: the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto; the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, on the involvement </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography. It has signed, but not yet ratified, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. All these instruments contain specific provisions on education and place an 
obligation on the State to take all necessary steps to protect, observe and promote the exercise 
of the right to education for all persons in its territory, without discrimination. 
</p>
<p>8. Kazakhstan is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which provides for, inter 
alia, the right to access to education. Such education should be free and compulsory, at least 
in the elementary stages; technical and professional education should be made generally 
available and higher education should be accessible, on an equal basis with nationals of the 
State of employment. Kazakhstan has affirmed that it does not intend to ratify the 
Convention in the near future in view of the far-reaching financial implications that would 
arise from its implementation.1 
</p>
<p>9. In accordance with article 4, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, international treaties 
ratified by Kazakhstan take precedence over national legislation, and can be directly 
applied in the domestic legal order except in cases where their application requires the 
promulgation of a law. On 10 July 2008, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
adopted a regulatory decision on the direct applicability of international treaties in national 
courts and tribunals, which requires judges to be guided by the norms of the international 
treaties to which Kazakhstan is a party.2 
</p>
<p>10. Under domestic law and the international human rights instruments ratified by 
Kazakhstan, the State has an obligation to provide and facilitate education for its 
inhabitants without discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework and national policies 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution, adopted by national referendum on 30 August 1995,3 has supreme 
legal force and direct effect in the entire territory of the republic. Articles 19 and 30 of the 
Constitution guarantee all Kazakh citizens the right to education in one&#8217;s native language, 
free and compulsory secondary education in State schools and the right to free higher 
education on a competitive basis. Fee-paying education is available in private schools under 
the terms and procedures established by law. 
</p>
<p>12. The National Human Rights Plan of Action for 2009&#8211;2012 is aimed at strengthening 
the national system of promotion and protection of human rights and the education of the 
general public regarding human rights and the mechanisms for their protection. The Plan 
identifies a set of concrete measures to eliminate gaps in national legislation and practice 
and to improve the coordination of governmental and non-governmental institutions 
working in the field of human rights protection.4

</p>
<p>13. The general legislative framework is governed by those provisions of the 
Constitution that deal with education, and by two core laws regulating education in the 
country, which are the Law on Education of 7 July 1992 (as amended on 27 July 2007) and 
the Law on Higher Education of 1993. These laws determine the State educational policy, 
the objectives and principles of education, the administrative structure, and the system of 
private schools.5 
</p>
<p>14. The Law on Education provides for the following levels of education: preschool, 
secondary, vocational and technical secondary, higher and post-graduate. Secondary 
education consists of three stages: (a) elementary (four-year programme); (b) basic 
secondary (five years); and (c) senior secondary (two years). The law regulates public 
relations in the sphere of education, defines the basic principles of national policymaking in 
this area and is aimed at ensuring protection of the constitutional right of citizens to 
education. According to article 23, &#8213;preschool education for 5(6)-year-olds shall be 
mandatory and it shall be provided in the family, preschool organizations or schools under a 
general educational programme. In state educational organizations, such education shall be 
free&#8214;. The Law also introduced a new model of higher professional education, consisting of 
three levels: basic higher education (four-year bachelor&#8217;s degree programmes), four-year 
specialized higher education courses, and higher scientific education (two-year master&#8217;s 
degree programmes).6 
</p>
<p>15. Subsequent regulations have been adopted in accordance with the two above-
mentioned laws, including the State standards for higher education as well as the 
regulations for organizing the activities of preschool organizations (Order No. 708 of the 
Ministry of Education and Science), which were approved on 10 July 2000.7 As regards the 
rights of the child, an important role devolves upon the Committee on the Protection of 
Children&#8217;s Rights, established on 21 February 2006 under the auspices of the Ministry of 
Education and Science.8 The Committee has the competence to consider personal appeals 
on child rights issues from the general public as well as matters related to the quality of 
educational services for children provided by State and public institutions. It is important to 
accentuate its authority in order to ensure an independent and thus conducive exercise of its 
mandate.9 
</p>
<p>16. Implementation of the respective laws on education, as well as strategic planning, 
management and funding of the education system, including the preparation of draft 
education budgets, is carried out under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and 
Science as the competent central authority.10 In accordance with the Law on Education, the 
functions of the Ministry include: defining and executing the State educational policy; 
drafting regulations concerning State funding for education; drafting and adopting State 
educational standards, curricula and syllabi; preparing State orders concerning the training

Kazakh language; and establishing international agreements on educational issues.11 
</p>
<p>17. The Ministry of Education and Science consists of several Committees and two 
Departments (Administration and Finance). The Committees are directly in charge of the 
corresponding branches. The Committee for Education is responsible for the management 
of the education system, the proposals on the financing of educational institutions from the 
State and regional budgets, the educational standards and programmes, and the appointment 
of the heads of higher schools. Article 36 of the Law on Education guarantees the principle 
of self-government of educational institutions.12  
</p>
<p>18. The national strategic plan for the development of education is detailed in the State 
Programme of Education Development in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2011&#8211;2020.13 In a 
drive to modernization, the overall goal of the plan is to increase the competitiveness of 
education and the development of human capital by ensuring access to quality education for 
sustainable economic growth.14 Its objectives include, inter alia, the transition to a 12-year 
education model, the improvement of the inclusive education system in schools and the 
updating of educational content. It is also aimed at integration into the European Higher 
Education Area.15 The Plan contains an analysis of the country&#8217;s education policy in terms 
of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges. It includes detailed goals and 
targets relating to education at all its levels, and addresses aspects such as developing 
financing mechanisms, enhancing teacher motivation, curricular adaptation, and expansion 
of the education infrastructure. The Plan further develops previously adopted strategies, 
such as the State Programme of Education Development for 2005&#8211;2010, the State 
Programme of Technical and Vocational Education Development for 2008&#8211;2012, the 
Children of Kazakhstan Programme for 2007&#8211;2011 and the Balapan Preschool Education 
Programme for 2010&#8211;2014. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overall situation of education in Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Primary and secondary education 
</b></p>
<p>19. Access to both primary and secondary education in Kazakhstan is almost universal. 
In 2008, the enrolment rate for children (of the typical age per level) was 99.8 per cent at 
the primary level, 100 per cent at the basic level and 99.6 per cent at the secondary level.16 
Thus, Kazakhstan has already achieved Millennium Development Goal 2, with respect to 
securing universal access to primary education. Moreover, Goal 3, relating to the 
elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education, has also been achieved 
in Kazakhstan.17 
</p>
<p>20. According to a 2010 report on the progress of Kazakhstan towards achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals, 90 per cent of children not attending schools come from

<p>poor and disadvantaged families.18 In this context, after conducting an assessment on the 
remaining gaps in the education system, the country decided to make further commitments 
under what it called a &#8213;MDG+ agenda&#8214;. In the field of education, the MDG+ agenda 
embraced an expanded version of Goal 2 to focus primarily on secondary education, 
enhancing quality in education, and promoting the enrolment of marginalized groups such 
as children with special needs and students from socially vulnerable groups.19 As developed 
below, further attention must be given to sources of inequality such as: school 
infrastructure, teachers&#8217; qualification and working conditions, the use of pedagogical 
materials and learning technologies, unified education data collection systems, and 
assessment of learning outcomes. 
</p>
<p>21. While noting continuously high enrolment levels, the 2010 review on the MDG+ 
agenda underlines that some schools still practice instruction in several shifts and that some 
urban schools are overcrowded. In the 2009/2010 academic year, about 66 per cent of 
daytime comprehensive secondary schools had classes in two or three shifts. A total of 37.1 
per cent of students had classes in the afternoon. Higher birth rates are expected to increase 
pressure on schools even with construction of additional schools.20 
</p>
<p>22. There has been an increase in the proportion of rural schools, from 76.4 per cent in 
2006 to 78.8 per cent in 2009.21 However, disparities in the quality of education provided in 
rural and urban areas are an important concern. With a vast territory not evenly populated, 
remote rural communities tend to be serviced by smaller schools with lower capacity. 
Despite a gradual decrease in the number of ungraded schools, it is noted that the majority 
of such schools are concentrated in rural areas, offer lower quality services and are 
particularly affected by the shortage of qualified staff and poor training facilities.22 The 
State Programme of Education Development includes a number of measures to improve the 
conditions of ungraded schools, including establishing resource centres to enhance the 
capacity of these schools, investing in information technology, and supporting alternative 
boarding schools and transportation services. 
</p>
<p>23. Investment in new information technologies and learning through the Internet (e-
learning) is one of the main elements in the efforts to improve quality across the education 
system. The State Programme of Education Development includes the target of promoting 
distance learning through the Internet and providing all ungraded schools having 10 or 
more students with new computers and access to broadband Internet. Investments in 
distance-learning processes is an understandable choice, given the distances in the country, 
however this measure may have limited impact if not accompanied by adequate assistance 
to teachers working in remote locations and continuous monitoring after implementation.  
</p>
<p>24. Another central challenge for the consolidation of good quality education is the 
improvement of data collection including, in particular, the consolidation of a national system 
for assessing learning outcomes. As noted in the Millennium Development Goals review, 
despite the country&#8217;s long-standing participation in the Millennium Development Goals and 
Education for All initiatives, Kazakhstan lacks a uniform database that could be updated on a 
regular basis.23 Lack of disaggregated information on quality issues, for example, can make it 
difficult to assess possible inequalities affecting rural or minority schools.

</p>
<p>25. As part of the country&#8217;s planned transition to a 12-year education cycle, the 
Government made efforts to establish a national testing system, under which standard 
assessments would be conducted at the conclusion of primary, basic, secondary and 
profession-oriented schools. Unifying the evaluation of learning outcomes is another essential 
step towards better identifying and addressing inequalities within the education system. 
</p>
<p>26. In order to ensure the equal rights of women and to combat covert discrimination, 
some initiatives are being taken, such as the establishment of the Kazakh State Women 
Teachers Training Institute and the development of pedagogical material, within the 
framework of the Strategy for Gender Equality (2006&#8211;2016).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Preschool education 
</b></p>
<p>27. According to the Law on Education, preschool is the first level of the education 
system in Kazakhstan, and preschool-age children have the right to education alongside 
school-age children. Preschool education in Kazakhstan is delivered through nurseries and 
kindergartens, of which there is currently an acute shortage. 
</p>
<p>28. Preschool enrolment falls well short of the high enrolment rates seen at the primary 
and secondary levels. Many preschool organizations, which had a widespread presence in the 
Soviet period, were closed in the early 1990s, resulting in a high number of children who did 
not have access to preschool, particularly in rural areas.24 Despite an increase between 2005 
and 2010, the preschool enrolment rate at the national level remains relatively low. 25 
</p>
<p>29. According to the 2010 Millennium Development Goals review, during the 
2008/2009 school year, only 35.6 per cent of Kazakh children of preschool age were 
enrolled; rural areas were particularly underserved, with an enrolment rate of 20.1 per 
cent.26 The same report indicates that over 900,000 children aged 1 to 6 years were not 
enrolled in an organized preschool programme, and 260,000 children were on the waiting 
list for a place in a preschool.27 
</p>
<p>30. In one policy review, it was further indicated that there were not only fewer 
preschool organizations in rural areas, but they tended to be more compact.28 In the same 
review, it was also noted that the integration of care and education<b> </b>and the emphasis on the 
child&#8217;s holistic development improved the quality of preschool education. However, it was 
also pointed out that more could be done by strengthening the linkage between social-sector 
services and the education sectors and by investing more in teacher qualification and 
career-prospects improvement (given the fact that part of the workforce is ageing).29  
</p>
<p>31. Causes of the low levels of enrolment include limited financial support and 
demographic changes. State funding for preschool education did not exceed 0.2 per cent of 
gross domestic product (GDP) between 2007 and 2010. It is also recognized that an 
increase in the birth rate will likely continue to affect the already overcharged preschool 
units.

</p>
<p>32. The Government recognizes that preschool education requires further investment, 
and that increased attention must be paid to underserved areas. Through the implementation 
of the Balapan State programme, it expects to establish a network of public and private 
kindergartens that could cover up to 70 per cent of children aged 3 to 6 by 2015, and the 
State Programme of Education Development contains a target of universal coverage for the 
same age group by 2020. Measures adopted to expand the network of preschool education 
vary according to regional particularities; such measures include investing in family-run 
nurseries and establishing mini-centres opened on school grounds utilizing surplus space.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Technical and vocational education 
</b></p>
<p>33. Technical and vocational education is mainly delivered on two levels: through 
vocational schools offering basic labour-market training, and through secondary vocational 
schools offering secondary-level vocational and higher-labour market training. Students 
typically attend between the ages of 15 to 17, following the end of compulsory education. 
While some State colleges exist, most vocational colleges are privately run. Some 
institutions are well resourced and well respected, but they are in the minority. Student 
numbers are relatively small, with around 500 to 800 colleges serving approximately 
500,000 pupils.30 
</p>
<p>34. Since 1991, the number of vocational schools across the nation has decreased by 
more than 30 per cent.31 Moreover, the existing infrastructure, material and technical base 
of the technical and vocational education system does not guarantee high-quality staff 
training or attractive education programmes for young people.32 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made and measures being taken 
under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Science and its Technical and 
Vocational Education Department to modernize the system of technical and vocational 
education for qualitative standards for training. Vocational education and training is 
currently undergoing a set of reforms under the State Programme for Educational 
Development (2011&#8211;2020), including measures such as the independent assessment of a 
graduate&#8217;s qualifications developed by the employers&#8217; associations and the assignment of 
educational institutions on a contractual basis to major enterprises for industrial placement 
and internships,33 as well as reforms under the related State Programme for Accelerated

<p>36. The Government aims at improving the quality of vocational education and training 
and ensuring that it is better oriented towards the labour market, in order to increase the 
employability of both youth and adults, as well as the quality and international 
compatibility of the labour force.35 Along these lines, for example, the development 
objective of a World Bank project currently being implemented is to raise the relevance,

<p>quality, and efficiency of technical and vocational education through an improved policy 
framework and institutional capacity.36  
</p>
<p>37. The budgetary allocation to technical and vocational education (only 0.2 per cent of 
GDP)37 must be increased in order to enhance infrastructure and facilities in a way that 
facilitates innovation and adaptation to the new labour-market requirements. In particular, 
the development and implementation of required occupational standards, qualifications, 
assessments and certification standards is as important as the provision of training for 
policymakers and advisers, for developers in education and training, and for teachers and 
managers in educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>38. The technical and vocational education system requires the resources, means and 
infrastructure to provide quality education and thereby facilitate the ability of young 
women and men to exercise their right to education as well as their ability to find 
sustainable employment  
</p>
<p><b> D. Higher education 
</b></p>
<p>39. Every Kazakh citizen has a right to obtain free higher education on a competitive 
basis. There were 148 universities in 2011; of these, 42 offered distant education, and 10 
offered adapted international accreditation.38  
</p>
<p>40. Kazakhstan joined the Bologna Process in 2010,39 becoming part of the European 
Higher Education Area. A new system of university classification&#8212;universities, national 
universities, research universities and academies and institutes&#8212;has been adopted.40 The 
principle of university autonomy in academic, financial and management activities is being 
implemented. The reform process also emphasizes academic freedom and academic 
mobility as part of the Bologna process. In 2012 the State standards for general secondary 
education will be integrated with the State standards for higher education (baccalaureate).41 
Some Kazakh higher education institutions are members of the European University 
Association. Furthermore, the integration of the country&#8217;s higher education sector into the 
global educational space is promoted through the implementation of joint educational 
programmes with foreign partners and the development of the students&#8217; economic mobility. 
</p>
<p>41. The Ministry of Education and Science is reorganizing and improving higher 
education, including postgraduate education, and the university system.42 The three-cycle 
system of higher and postgraduate education (bachelor/master/doctorate) has been adopted. A 
credit system of education has been introduced. A shift has been made from a focus on quality 
control of education to the creation of a system of quality assurance. The National 
Accreditation Centre was founded in 2005. A process has been started to introduce

<p>democratic principles for the management of higher educational institutions, involving, inter 
alia, the establishment of Trustee Councils and the introduction of corporate management. 
</p>
<p>42. The Government allocates funds from the national budget to invite foreign lecturers 
and academics to Kazakhstan, and awards about 200 educational grants yearly to foreign 
students (from Turkic-speaking countries) for studies in Kazakhstan. Although the current 
legislation does not provide for portable grants, the Bolashak International Scholarship 
initiative (initiated in 1993) sponsors about 3,000 students from Kazakhstan to study 
abroad.43  
</p>
<p>43. In compliance with current domestic legislation, higher education institutions have a 
right to self-governance, independence in the adoption of decisions concerning the 
organization of the educational process, staffing issues and financial/economic activity.44 
However, the rector of a public university is for instance appointed directly by the Ministry 
of Education and Science.45 Universities can define their own curriculum only within the 
framework of State educational standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education and 
Science; with the approval of the Committee for Education, universities may define the 
requirements for students&#8217; admission. Private university institutions may provide 
educational services only after obtaining a license from the Ministry of Education and 
Science, which monitors the application of State educational standards of quality. 
</p>
<p>44. In general, national education policy is made at the central level by the presidential 
administration and ministries, who define the general principles of education management, 
reform strategies and priorities, and monitor the implementation of the programmes. 
</p>
<p>45. The main challenges that remain include ensuring equal access and opportunities for 
all with respect to universities, and realizing full university autonomy as well as the full 
participation of students. Moreover, to improve educational policy, disaggregated statistics 
and indicators are necessary, in particular on the enjoyment of bursaries and other relevant 
realization factors as well as on university programme investments. 
</p>
<p>46. Nazarbayev University, in Astana, has been established as the new flagship 
university in Kazakhstan. The University, which functions in partnership with foreign 
universities and provides instruction in English only, has been accorded a special legal 
status with unprecedented independence, autonomy and academic freedom in setting the 
academic policy. It is allowed to operate according to its own standards, and there is a 
provision for the establishment of its own endowment fund.46 This autonomy allows the 
administrators full self-governance, without being subjected to the binding effect of the 
regulations of the Ministry of Education and Science on programmes, curriculum and other 
related matters. 
</p>
<p>47. The accordance of this special legal status ensuring full autonomy to Nazarbayev 
University reflects the limited implementation of the principle of self-government of 
educational institutions in line with article 36 of the Law on Education.  
</p>
<p>48. Given that English is the only language of instruction at Nazarbayev University, 
consideration should be given also to providing education in a national language. The

<p>Government recognizes the importance of continuous learning of the Kazakh language, from 
kindergarten to higher education, so as to enable every Kazakh citizen to acquire full 
command of the State language, and plans to introduce KAZTEST&#8212;a system to evaluate a 
person&#8217;s level of Kazakh language skills. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Quest for excellence in education 
</b></p>
<p>49. A number of programmes have been developed to foster excellence in education, 
such as the establishment of the Nazarbayev University, designed to attract the &#8213;best and 
brightest&#8214;. The presidential programme Daryn is also aimed at facilitating the selection of 
talented youth for attendance at specialized schools.47 The network of these specialized 
schools, which currently number 33, is being expanded. The Nazarbayev Intellectual 
Schools&#8212;founded to build academic excellence&#8212;are conceived in a similar vein; the 
project will be expanded in all regions of Kazakhstan, from 6 schools at present to 20 by 
2020.48 Similarly, Kazakhstan has set the target of having, by 2020, two universities that are 
ranked among the world&#8217;s best.49 
</p>
<p>50. The Bolashak initiative provides educational opportunities for young talented 
Kazakh citizens. Under the programme, international scholarships are awarded on the basis 
of an annual list of the most in-demand specialists in Kazakhstan; about 3,000 students, at 
25 universities, were sponsored in 2011.50  
</p>
<p>51. All these schemes and programmes are indicative of the country&#8217;s quest for 
excellence in education. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Promotion of equal opportunities in education 
</b></p>
<p>52. Further efforts are required to ensure the identification and effective involvement of 
children from vulnerable groups (growing every year in composition and in number)51 into 
the Kazakh education system. 
</p>
<p>53. The challenges listed below indicate some of the most important barriers that can 
limit the education prospects of Kazakh children. They include economic obstacles 
(potentially affecting all groups living in poverty), language and cultural obstacles 
(potentially affecting those belonging to minorities), physical obstacles (potentially 
affecting children with disabilities) and administrative obstacles (potentially affecting 
migrants and refugees). These obstacles can be interrelated and mutually reinforce each 
other. Thus, the promotion of a more inclusive education system requires not only 
understanding specific challenges, but also a full understanding of the interplay between 
them.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Ensuring basic education free of cost 
</b></p>
<p>54. The main reason behind the success of Kazakhstan with regard to its almost 
universal enrolment of children in both primary and secondary levels is, arguably, the 
country&#8217;s expanding system of providing education free of charge. It is thus crucial to 
continuously monitor practices at the local level to ensure that no costs are imposed on 
parents with low income. 
</p>
<p>55. The imposition of additional financial costs, such as contributions to teacher and 
parent associations, or contributions for school maintenance or the acquisition of school 
uniforms and materials, can become a serious obstacle for children from poor families to 
access high-quality educational services. Reports indicate that families are increasingly 
contributing to preschool and secondary education, despite improvements in the financial 
aid provided to general secondary education organizations. In 2009 schools collected an 
average of US$ 300 or more from each family; in primary grades the amount may be less, 
in senior grades it is higher.52 At the preschool level, the shortage of public nurseries and 
kindergartens results in high fees unaffordable to low-income families.53  
</p>
<p>56. This said, investment in social assistance schemes is part of the Government strategy 
to ensure education for those living in poverty. In 2009, total spending on financial aid 
exceeded US$ 33.9 million (about 2 per cent of total school maintenance spending), twice 
as much as in 2008. Under the annual Road to School campaign, children from poor 
families receive financial aid from entrepreneurs, institutions, sponsor organizations and the 
community. In 2009, over 190,000 children in the country benefited from such support, 
which totalled US$ 6.8 million.54 The supply of hot meals in schools (covering 61.3 per 
cent of school students) is another incentive. Despite these measures, the number of 
children not attending schools has reportedly not dropped.55 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the importance of investing in social assistance 
schemes in order to further encourage school attendance among children in economically 
disadvantaged situations. As some of these schemes specifically prioritize children living in 
poverty, efforts are required to ensure full transparency in the selection of beneficiaries and 
to correct possible exclusion errors. Moreover, efforts to prevent the imposition of costs to 
families at the local level would be needed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. </b>Multilingual and minorities&#8217; education<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Kazakhstan is a multi-ethnic society, and its unique cultural diversity is one of its 
strengths. In order to preserve and promote such a precious asset, education in multiple 
languages is essential.56 Kazakh is the official language, but Russian, of which most 
citizens have full command, is used equally officially in State institutions 
(A/HRC/13/23/Add.1, para. 3). Many citizens also speak English. 
</p>
<p>59. The Constitution of Kazakhstan stipulates in article 7, paragraph 3, the vested right 
of all citizens to speak and learn their own language, declaring that the State shall promote

 55 Ibid. 
 56 The composition of the population of Kazakhstan is as follows: 58.6 per cent ethnic Kazakhs, up to 
</p>
<p>26.1 per cent ethnic Russians, and 15.3 per cent other ethnic groups, including Ukrainians (2.9 per 
cent), Uzbeks (2.8 per cent), and Uighurs, Tatars and Germans (1.5 per cent each). In addition, 
another estimated one hundred ethnic groups (about 4.3 per cent) live in Kazakhstan. Report of the 
independent expert on minority issues on her mission to Kazakhstan (A/HRC/13/23/Add.1), para. 3. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>conditions for the study and development of the languages of the people of Kazakhstan. 
Further, in article 19, paragraph 2, the Constitution guarantees that everyone has the right to 
use his or her native language, to enjoy his or her own culture and to choose freely his or 
her language of communication, education, instruction and creative activities. These vested 
rights are further repeated and concretized in the Law on Languages of 1997. 
</p>
<p>60. Pursuant to article 9, paragraph 3, of the Law on Education, which stipulates the 
right to education in one&#8217;s native language, the Government policy is to provide general 
secondary education in pupils&#8217; native languages and/or teach native languages as subjects. 
</p>
<p>The organization of multicultural education in its complete variety remains a daunting 
challenge. According to available statistics, children from more than 100 ethnic 
backgrounds attended schools in the 2008/2009 academic year, with Kazakhs accounting 
for 71.4 per cent; Russians, 14.7 per cent; Uzbeks, 4 per cent; Ukrainians, 1.5 percent; 
Germans, 1 per cent; Uighurs, 1.7 per cent; and others, 5.7 per cent. As a whole, school 
instruction is offered in six languages.57 
</p>
<p>61. Current alternatives for education in one&#8217;s own native language are provided by 
Government institutions in cooperation with cultural associations. In this context a number 
of Sunday schools (about 79) have been established by national and cultural associations, 
providing language teaching, including German, Korean, Hebrew, Tartar and Polish, for 
children and adults. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur salutes the efforts to maintain, and even increase, the 
coverage of schools with specific language instruction, so as to offer minority children from 
more numerous and diverse ethnic backgrounds an inclusive education. However, he 
stresses that greater attention and resources should be dedicated to improving the teaching 
standards in minority schools. Further, resources need to be allocated to developing and 
maintaining the system of and infrastructure for minority schools and overcoming 
deficiencies in textbooks and learning materials (A/HRC/13/23/Add.1, paras. 48 and 49). 
Besides the mere supply of textbooks, it is just as relevant for minorities to have new 
editions of textbooks with content that reflects the multi-ethnic character of Kazakh society 
and the contributions of minorities to its diverse culture. 
</p>
<p>63. In this respect, it is pertinent to underline the importance of the constructive 
interfaith dialogue promoted by the Assembly of the People. Created in 1995, the Assembly 
gained constitutional status in 2007, and its composition includes nine Members of 
Parliament, who represent all ethnic minorities. All legislation on ethnic issues passes 
through the Assembly. The Assembly plays a crucial role in promoting mutual 
understanding and respect for the richness of linguistic and cultural diversity. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>64. Kazakhstan has signed (11 December 2008), but not yet ratified, the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which enshrines the right, and its prerequisites, of 
persons with disabilities to inclusive, barrier-free education.  
</p>
<p>65. Under the Law on Social Protection of Disabled Persons in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, the rehabilitation of children with disabilities falls within the competence of 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. It is in charge of financing and administering 
support programmes for low-income families under the Law on State Targeted Social 
Support of 2001. The Ministry of Health develops a policy of basic health services for 
children and their mothers, undertakes initiatives for the early detection of risk groups in

</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>cooperation with oblast education departments, and manages the system of early childhood 
orphanages.58 
</p>
<p>66. While public education policy in Kazakhstan is underpinned by a commitment to the 
full integration of children with special needs into society, the Ministry of Education has no 
competence for children with disabilities and they are therefore not covered by the regular 
education system. Special education organizations are in place to provide opportunities for 
children with special needs to receive a general secondary education. There are 101 special 
remedial education organizations (A/HRC/WG.6/7/KAZ/1, para. 122).  
</p>
<p>67. New methods of inclusive education are being employed for the integration of 
children with disabilities. More than 12,000 children with disabilities study in public 
schools and kindergartens, and several regions provide distance education for children with 
special needs. A quota system is in place to ensure access for children with special needs to 
colleges and universities (A/HRC/14/10, para. 69). 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur visited an educational establishment that provides education 
to children with disabilities, and was impressed with the quality of the conditions. In 
particular, he noted efforts made in providing learning facilities for children with 
disabilities that offer advanced computer-based techniques. But not all such children and 
adults benefit from such a good system, and in any case, such educational facilities are 
exclusive rather than inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>69. Inclusive education has not yet been developed, and facility provisions to meet the 
needs of students with physical disabilities have largely yet to be established. Kazakhstan 
has more than 150,000 children with disabilities, and only one third have access to teaching 
and development programmes. Children with disabilities are placed in special (correctional) 
boarding schools away from home, because there are no special educational establishments 
at their place of residence. Public schools do not have the necessary conditions or trained 
teaching staff to work with children with disabilities. As a result, such children are not able 
to attend regular schools and kindergartens.59 
</p>
<p>70. A recent study conducted by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the 
National Human Rights Centre (Ombudsman) in State-run residential institutions for 
children in Kazakhstan that provide care and education not only for children with 
disabilities, but also for orphans and children without parental care, reveals that violence by 
staff and among children is a serious problem.60 It provides a number of recommendations 
for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>71. Thus, the Special Rapporteur recalls that in realizing the right to education for 
persons with disabilities, particular focus shall be put on the inclusion into the general 
education system and the adoption of measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination 
against children with disabilities.61 Effective individualized support measures are needed in 
order to maximize the academic and social development of children with disabilities, 
consistent with the goal of full inclusion.

<p><b> 4. Migrants 
</b></p>
<p>72. Kazakhstan is not party to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and has affirmed that it 
does not aim to ratify the Convention in the near future in view of the far-reaching financial 
implications that would arise from its implementation (A/HRC/14/10/Add.1, para. 1). 
However, the Special Rapporteur underlines that under domestic law and the international 
human rights instruments ratified by Kazakhstan, the State has the obligation to provide and 
facilitate education for its inhabitants without discrimination and regardless of their legal 
status. 
</p>
<p>73. Inclusive education and the implementation of the right to adequate and accessible 
education must also be ensured in the administration of education. Consequently, all 
children, including migrant children, must be allowed to attend school without any 
administrative precondition, such as a &#8213;<i>propiska</i>&#8214; document.62 In accordance with article 8, 
paragraph 2, of the Law on Education, the legal and practical impediments to the schooling 
of migrant children can be overcome through, inter alia, administrative acts and decisions 
that declare the acceptance of all children to schools as a per se rule. 
</p>
<p>74. As an example of how administrative barriers can affect the enjoyment of the right 
to education by migrants and refugees, it was reported to the Special Rapporteur in the 
course of his visit that in 2010 the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, after an inspection of 
schools, issued a decree to expel the children of foreign nationals who failed to provide 
proof of their permanent residency status in Kazakhstan. As a result of the joint efforts of 
all relevant stakeholders, the Ministry of Education and Science issued a decree allowing 
the children expelled from school to be re-enrolled.63 
</p>
<p>75. A recent monitoring of schools in Almaty, Taraz and Karaganda also identified a 
number of cases where State schools had violated the right to education of refugee children 
as well as of migrants, by either expelling or not admitting children of refugees without 
local registration and working permits.64 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur considers that educational legislation and governance should 
ensure that all children, regardless of their citizenship, legal and social status, are 
guaranteed the right to adequate education. The State should adopt legal, administrative and 
organizational measures to allow for non-discriminatory school enrolment for all children. 
In this framework, related legislation and administrative practice should be harmonized 
and, if necessary, disambiguated in order to clarify that education also includes the 
education of migrants&#8217; children and that access to education should be granted universally, 
</p>
<p>without discrimination and on an equal basis with Kazakh citizens.65 
</p>
<p>

<p><b> 5. Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>77. Article 12, paragraph 4, of the Constitution states that foreigners and stateless 
persons in Kazakhstan enjoy the rights and freedoms and bear the responsibilities 
established for citizens, unless the Constitution, laws or international treaties of Kazakhstan 
stipulates otherwise. In accordance with article 1 of the Law on Education, citizens of 
Kazakhstan, foreigners and stateless persons have the right to choose their educational 
establishment and form of instruction, subject to enrolment conditions.66  
</p>
<p>78. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international norms and laws, access to 
public general secondary education should be universal, irrespective of a child&#8217;s legal 
status. In signing those international instruments, Kazakhstan undertook obligations to 
recognize the right of the child to education and to ensure the availability of primary and 
secondary education for all children. However, as reported above, at times refugee children 
meet significant barriers when trying to access general primary and secondary education 
due to their lack of the required documents (school progress records, residence permit, 
proper identification) and the legal status of their parents (temporary foreign residents).  
</p>
<p>79. Additional barriers to refugees&#8217; education are a lack of knowledge of the Kazakh 
and Russian languages and the refusal by some parents to allow girls to study in higher 
grades or alongside boys.67 Also, many migrants and refugees cannot afford to cover the 
costs of education at various levels, be it preschool, vocational or professional-technical 
education or higher education. Due to a lack of permanent residency status, refugees do not 
have the same access to Government loans and scholarship programmes for higher 
education that permanent foreign residents and nationals do. The main local funds generally 
target nationals of Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Responding to quality imperatives 
</b></p>
<p>80. In spite of achievements in primary and secondary education, as mentioned above, 
challenges remain in the areas of learning outcomes and the quality of education provided.68 
The development of life skills is not integrated into curricula or national standards as an 
expected educational outcome.69 The low status of the teaching profession and the poor 
quality of teacher training are central concerns with regard to the improvement of the overall 
quality in education. Both were identified as weakness by the State Programme of Education 
Development, thus deserving specific attention. In 2009, for example, 27 per cent of 
secondary teachers had no professional certification and there were 2,440 teaching 
vacancies.70 
</p>
<p>81. A lack of attractive salaries and career prospects have been identified as key reasons 
for the departure of qualified teachers from the education system&#8212;most qualified and 
promising teachers prefer to quit the technical and vocational education system for 
enterprises. In this sense, the State Programme of Education Development includes a 
number of measures aimed at enhancing salaries and career prospects for teachers and 
promoting teacher qualification. Measures included raising salaries (a pay raise was 
introduced during the period of the visit), introducing differentiated coefficients for the

<p>calculation of a teacher&#8217;s salary in relation to his or her qualification and experience, and 
investing in teacher training opportunities. 
</p>
<p>82. Efforts to improve the quality in education also include the revision of school 
textbooks and improvements in specialized school infrastructure, introducing new subject 
classrooms and multimedia rooms. Rules for the preparation, review and publication of 
textbooks, teaching materials and manuals were introduced, and in 2008 over one thousand 
textbooks were deemed non-compliant with the new standards. Thus, further efforts are still 
required to disseminate improved and updated materials. The monitoring of compliance 
with the State-wide standards of education developed in 2007, especially in rural areas, is a 
priority in improving education in Kazakhstan.71 
</p>
<p>83. In order to guarantee quality education, Kazakhstan has established the National 
Education Quality Assessment System (NEQAS), to ensure the comparability of national 
and international indicators, as well as regional NEQAS structures for regional quality 
appraisal. Kazakhstan also takes part in international comparative studies on international 
quality assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 
and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Moreover, the 
Unified National Testing has the objective of increasing the credibility and reliability of 
knowledge estimates to ensure equity-based access to higher and vocational education. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Financing education 
</b></p>
<p>84. State resources for education in Kazakhstan are provided through the national and 
local budgets, according to information provided by the Ministry of Education and Science. 
The Special Rapporteur applauds the efforts of the Government of Kazakhstan in fostering 
and enhancing the educational sector with an increase in State budgetary resources. The 
share of State budget spending on education increased from 3.7 per cent of GDP  in 2007 to 
4.2 per cent of GDP in 2011, with a peak of 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2009; it is important to 
maintain a sustained increase in budget expenditure. Education-related expenditures and 
costs must be taken into account: between 2006 and 2009 for instance, such expenditures 
had more than doubled. 
</p>
<p>85. In the State Programme of Education Development, the Government candidly 
admits that underfunding of education is an impediment in attaining goals and objectives 
set for education72 and that there is a need for the development of new mechanisms for 
financing.73 In this context, a revealing comparison of Unified National Testing results and 
per-student costs has shown that no correlation between significant costs and the quality of 
education exists.74 A number of institutional and structural features of the national 
budgeting and financing system are impeding the efficient allocation and utilization of 
resources in the field of education. As a consequence, budgeting has not always served as 
an effective tool for implementing intended educational policy priorities, despite an 
increase in resources. 
</p>
<p>86. Consequently, the Government is seeking to move towards a transition to per capita 
funding mechanisms by 2015, taking into account the particular circumstances of regions 
and educational institutions, from preschool organizations to technical and vocational 
education institutions, with the exception of ungraded schools. It thus intends to implement 
result-oriented financing as an integral part of reforms in the management of public

<p>expenditures in the secondary education sector. A methodology of per capita normative 
financing was being developed in 2011; this will help increase the efficiency of budgetary 
expenditures with responsibility and accountability. It is important to provide for the 
development of grants and preferential credits for those often smaller educational 
institutions to guarantee a smooth transition without affecting the right to education, as well 
as to ensure transparency and accountability in financial management. 
</p>
<p>87. Given its impressive economic advancement and abundant resources, Kazakhstan 
can and should further enhance investment in education, both in terms of the national 
budget as well as in proportion to the GDP, especially since education is acknowledged to 
be one of the main priorities in the Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy. Investing in this strategic 
sector is not only an obligation, but also an essential step in the consolidation of democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan has experienced historic political and 
economic developments. </b>The country&#8217;s <b>MDG+ agenda, with its long-term education 
</b></p>
<p><b>development goals and strategies, is highly relevant in the context of global reflections 
</b></p>
<p><b>on taking the Education for All agenda forward beyond 2015. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for achieving almost 
universal enrolment at the primary and secondary levels of education, as well as for 
</b></p>
<p><b>its determination to continue to invest in preschool, technical, vocational and higher 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. Nevertheless, he also underlines that there are a number of remaining 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges that Kazakhstan will need to address in order to ensure the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the right to education for all.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes that Kazakhstan has all the prerequisites in 
place to implement </b>&#8220;<b>Education for All</b>&#8221;<b> and switch to high-quality lifelong education 
</b></p>
<p><b>for each citizen of the country according to his or her needs and capacity. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations are aimed at assisting the Government in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Responding to quality imperatives with respect to education for all 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> Kazakhstan must enhance the quality of education provided, by integrating the 
concept of an inclusive education into national education development strategies; by 
</b></p>
<p><b>revising and upgrading of national educational standards and curricula based on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle of interrelation and continuity of preschool, primary and secondary 
</b></p>
<p><b>education standards.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> Increasing investments in the qualification of teachers and in the improvement 
of their career prospects is also crucial to improve the quality of education. Teachers 
</b></p>
<p><b>are the mainspring of quality education, and replacing the aging workforce with well-
</b></p>
<p><b>qualified and trained teachers is a huge challenge for the country. Also, while training 
</b></p>
<p><b>young teachers, Kazakhstan needs to take steps to ensure that the proportion of male 
</b></p>
<p><b>and female teachers, which is currently lopsided, becomes more balanced. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Enhancing investment in education 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> As a country with abundant resources, Kazakhstan can and should invest much 
more in education in terms of its national budget, especially as education is 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledged to be one of the main priorities in the Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>should continue to adapt budgeting mechanisms in order to ensure that financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources are utilized more judiciously and equitably. Investment in education must 
</b></p>
<p><b>focus on improving quality standards that are applied uniformly throughout the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>country. Priority must be granted to reaching groups traditionally excluded from 
</b></p>
<p><b>education systems, such as children living in poverty, children with disabilities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>children of minorities. Continuing to invest in education at all levels as a matter of 
</b></p>
<p><b>national priority is not only central to consolidating the significant development 
</b></p>
<p><b>recently experienced by the country, but it is an obligation of the State established by 
</b></p>
<p><b>both national and international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Promoting inclusive education  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Kazakhstan must ensure inclusive education, providing all children, including 
migrant and refugee children, with access to education without any legal or 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative precondition such as the <i>propiska</i>. This can be achieved by, inter alia, 
</b></p>
<p><b>stipulating that administrative acts and decisions determine the acceptance of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>children to schools as a matter of course. Concentrated efforts to adapt classrooms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and train education staff must be made to promote the inclusion of children with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities in regular classrooms. The placement of children in boarding schools 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be revised in the light of their best interests. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Promoting minority education  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> While noting the historical and geopolitical circumstances in Kazakhstan and 
</b>the Government&#8217;s policy towards strengthening <b>the Kazakh language as the State 
</b></p>
<p><b>language, these efforts should not result in the reduction of efforts to ensure education 
</b></p>
<p><b>to minority groups. Kazakhstan must ensure quality in minority-language schools, 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee adequate funding and resources, and ensure equality of access to university 
</b></p>
<p><b>education for students from all groups.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Preserving the richness of multicultural and multilingual diversity  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> One of the challenging tasks facing Kazakhstan is to preserve and enrich 
multicultural and multilingual diversity, while ensuring respect for the culture of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>community. In this, education can play a key role. Interfaith and intercultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue promoted through the Assembly of the People could provide a larger space to 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal values of human rights and democratic citizenship. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Institutionalized and adequate data collection mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Kazakhstan must ensure nationwide, systematic and regular collection of data 
in the area of education, including in a disaggregated manner, with particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to vulnerable groups that are more likely to be excluded from the education 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. Kazakhstan could establish an inter-agency commission to assume the key 
</b></p>
<p><b>role in coordination and monitoring (statistics agency, ministries and agencies 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned) and to achieve agreement on the collection and analysis of data relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education.
