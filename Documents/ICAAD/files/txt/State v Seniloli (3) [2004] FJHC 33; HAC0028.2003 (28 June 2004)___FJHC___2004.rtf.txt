Counsel: Mr. M. Tedeschi, Mr. G. Allan, Ms A. Prasad for State;
Mr. M. Raza for 1st Accused;

RULING

The test for bias in Fiji is whether there would be a reasonable apprehension of bias held by informed observers sitting at the back of the courtroom or whether there would be a real danger of bias. In this particular case, the information that we have received from the State is that the third assessor gave some information of a technical nature in relation to some Fiji Broadcasting Corporation broadcast in coup-related proceedings in the capacity of an employee of the FBC. In my opinion, does not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. He does not appear to have given any statement of fact in respect of the events which are subject of these proceedings and I do not consider that he should be discharged as an assessor.

I rule accordingly.
