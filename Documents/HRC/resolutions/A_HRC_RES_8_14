<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/14.</b> <b>Situation of human rights in Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, and reaffirming Council resolutions S-5/1 of 2 October 2007, 6/33 
</p>
<p>of 14 December 2007 and 7/31 of 28 March 2008, </p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation 
</p>
<p>in Myanmar (A/HRC/8/12) while calling on the Myanmar authorities to extend full 
</p>
<p>cooperation to the Special Rapporteur, including by inviting him to visit Myanmar as 
</p>
<p>soon as possible, 
</p>
<p><i>Being deeply concerned </i>that the urgent calls contained in the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>resolutions, as well as of other United Nations bodies concerning the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Myanmar have not been met and further emphasising that, without 
</p>
<p>significant progress towards meeting these calls of the international community, the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in Myanmar will continue to deteriorate, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing </i>its condolences to those who suffered loss as a result of Cyclone 
</p>
<p>Nargis, and welcoming the efforts of international, regional and national 
</p>
<p>organizations to bring relief to the survivors of this natural disaster and noting the 
</p>
<p>commitment made by the authorities of Myanmar, on 25 May, to grant unfettered 
</p>
<p>access to relief workers to the affected areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing also </i>its deep concern that the country&#8217;s political processes are not 
</p>
<p>transparent, inclusive, free and fair, and at the decision of the Government of 
</p>
<p>Myanmar to proceed with the constitutional referendum in an atmosphere of 
</p>
<p>intimidation and in disregard with international standards of free and fair elections 
</p>
<p>at a time of dire humanitarian need, </p>

<p><i>Being concerned </i>about reported widespread violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law in the Kayin State and Bago Division, 
</p>
<p><i>Being most concerned </i>by the decision, once again, to extend the house arrest 
</p>
<p>of the General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu 
</p>
<p>Kyi, on 27 May 2008, and by reports that there are as many as 1,900 other political 
</p>
<p>prisoners, many held without charge and in unknown locations, 
</p>
<p><i>Being concerned </i>that no effort has been made to investigate and prosecute 
</p>
<p>the perpetrators of the violent crackdown on peaceful mass demonstrations of 
</p>
<p>September 2007 and of the ensuing human rights violations, including enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and ill treatment, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns </i>the ongoing systematic violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms of the people of Myanmar; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to desist from further 
</p>
<p>politically motivated arrests and to release all political prisoners without delay 
</p>
<p>and without conditions; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon </i>the Government to fully implement the commitments it has 
</p>
<p>made to the Secretary-General on granting immediate, full and unhindered access by 
</p>
<p>relief workers to all persons in need throughout the country, to cooperate fully with 
</p>
<p>all humanitarian organizations, in particular in the Irrawaddy Delta, to refrain from 
</p>
<p>sending people back to areas where they cannot have access to emergency relief and 
</p>
<p>to ensure that return is voluntary and occurs in safety and with dignity; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to end all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and protect civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, on 
</p>
<p>the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and, in particular, to 
</p>
<p>comply with its human rights obligations under the Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child in this regard; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Condemns </i>the recruitment of child soldiers into both the Government 
</p>
<p>armed forces, contrary to its international obligations, and non-State armed groups, 
</p>
<p>and calls for an absolute and immediate stop to this appalling activity; </p>

<p>6. <i>Calls for </i>a full, transparent, effective, impartial and independent 
</p>
<p>investigation into all reports of human rights violations, including enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture, ill treatment, forced labour and forced 
</p>
<p>displacement, and for bringing those responsible to justice in order to end impunity 
</p>
<p>for violations of human rights; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Strongly calls</i> on the Government of Myanmar to engage in a real process 
</p>
<p>of dialogue and national reconciliation with the full and genuine participation of 
</p>
<p>representatives of all political parties and ethnic groups who have been excluded 
</p>
<p>from the political process; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Expresses </i>its strong support for the good-offices mission and 
</p>
<p>commitment of the Secretary-General, and encourages the Government of 
</p>
<p>Myanmar to take early steps to admit his Special Representative on Myanmar, 
</p>
<p>Ibrahim Gambari, to facilitate a genuine and inclusive political process, and calls on 
</p>
<p>the Government of Myanmar to ensure full cooperation with the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>his representative and the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to receive, as soon as 
</p>
<p>possible, the Special Rapporteur and to cooperate fully with him to implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in his reports (A/HRC/6/14, A/HRC/7/18, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/24 and A/HRC/8/12), as well as Council resolutions S-5/1, 6/33 and 
</p>
<p>7/31; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to report to the Council on the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of his mandate, and in particular, on the implementation of its relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Decides </i>to remain seized of this matter. 
</p>
<p>28th meeting 
18 June 2008 
</p>
<p> 
[Adopted without a vote.]   </p>
