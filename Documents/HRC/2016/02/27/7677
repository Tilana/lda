<p><b>Human Rights Council</b> 
<b>Twenty-fifth session</b> 
Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent international 
commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the commission of inquiry covers the investigations conducted 
from 15 July 2013 to 20 January 2014. Its findings are based on 563 interviews and other 
collected evidence. 
</p>
<p>More than 250,000 people are besieged in the Syrian Arab Republic and subjected 
to relentless shelling and bombardment. They are denied humanitarian aid, food and such 
basic necessities as medical care, and must choose between surrender and starvation. Siege 
warfare is employed in a context of egregious human rights and international humanitarian 
law violations. The warring parties do not fear being held accountable for their acts. 
</p>
<p>The scale and geographic distribution of violations perpetrated by government 
forces and pro-government militia, and non-State armed groups, differ among violations. 
</p>
<p>Government forces and pro-government militia continue to conduct widespread 
attacks on civilians, systematically committing murder, torture, rape and enforced 
disappearance as crimes against humanity. Government forces have committed gross 
violations of human rights and the war crimes of murder, hostage-taking, torture, rape and 
sexual violence, recruiting and using children in hostilities and targeting civilians in sniper 
attacks. Government forces disregarded the special protection accorded to hospitals, 
medical and humanitarian personnel and cultural property. Aleppo was subjected to a 
campaign of barrel bombing that targeted entire areas and spread terror among civilians. 
Government forces used incendiary weapons, causing superfluous injury and unnecessary 
suffering, in violation of international humanitarian law. Indiscriminate and 
disproportionate aerial bombardment and shelling caused large-scale arbitrary 
displacement. Government forces and pro-government militia perpetrated massacres. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> *
 The annexes to the present report are circulated as received, in the language of submission only. 
</p>

<p>Non-State armed groups, named in the report, committed war crimes, including 
murder, execution without due process, torture, hostage-taking, violations of international 
humanitarian law tantamount to enforced disappearance, rape and sexual violence, 
recruiting and using children in hostilities, attacking protected objects and forcibly 
displacing civilians. Medical and religious personnel and journalists were targeted. Armed 
groups besieged and indiscriminately shelled civilian neighbourhoods, in some instances 
spreading terror among civilians through the use of car bombings in civilian areas. In Al-
Raqqah, the widespread detention of civilians and their systematic torture by identified 
armed groups amounted to a crime against humanity. Non-State armed groups perpetrated 
massacres. 
</p>
<p>Chemical weapons, specifically sarin, were found to have been used in multiple 
incidents during the conflict. In no incident was the commission&#8217;s evidentiary threshold 
met with respect to the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>States that exert influence on the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic must act to 
ensure that these parties comply with the rules of international humanitarian law. The 
Security Council bears responsibility for allowing the warring parties to violate these rules 
with impunity.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/24, 
the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic presents 
its findings based on investigations conducted from 15 July 2013 to 20 January 2014.1 The 
report should be read in conjunction with previous reports of the commission.2  
</p>
<p><b> A. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>2. The commission&#8217;s investigations remain curtailed by the denial of access to the 
Syrian Arab Republic.  
</p>
<p>3.  The correspondence between the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic 
and the commission is annexed to the present report (see annex I).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The methodology employed by the commission was based on standard practices of 
commissions of inquiry and human rights investigations. The commission relied primarily 
on first-hand accounts. 
</p>
<p>5. The information contained in the present report is based on 563 interviews 
conducted in the region and from Geneva. Starting in September 2011, a total of 2,648 
interviews were conducted by the commission. Photographs, video recordings, satellite 
imagery and medical records were collected and analysed. Reports from Governments and 
non-governmental sources, academic analyses and United Nations reports formed part of 
the investigation. 
</p>
<p>6. The standard of proof is met when the commission has reasonable grounds to 
believe that incidents occurred as described. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conflict dynamics  
</b>7. The conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has grown in intensity and scope, as 
warring parties renewed efforts to strengthen their negotiation positions before the Geneva 
II conference. Despite intermittent tactical gains by the Government, fighting reached a 
stalemate, costing the country and the parties&#8217; significant human and material losses. 
Particularly fierce around major cities and along main lines of communication, hostilities 
involved more brutal tactics and means. The Government relied extensively on the superior 
firepower of its air force and artillery, while non-State armed groups increasingly resorted 
to methods of asymmetric warfare, such as suicide bombings and the use of improvised 
explosive devices. 
</p>
<p>8. The war has become deeply fragmented and localized, with the emergence of 
multiple frontlines involving different parties with shifting priorities. Primarily aimed at 
limited short-term agendas, these confrontations have been fuelled mostly by local 
operational and socioeconomic particularities rather than by the broader context of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chairperson), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit 
</p>
<p>Muntarbhorn and Carla Del Ponte. 
 
</p>
<p>2
  S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50, A/HRC/22/59, A/HRC/23/58 and A/HRC/24/46. </p>


<p>conflict. The hostilities in north-eastern governorates saw Kurdish forces fighting radical 
Islamic armed groups in a distinct subconflict, with its own front lines and internal military 
dynamics. In many cases, communities in central governorates brokered localized 
ceasefires. 
</p>
<p>9. External factors have increasingly driven the course of the conflict. While pushing 
for a political solution, international stakeholders continued to support the belligerents 
financially and logistically to influence the outcome of the conflict in line with their 
respective interests. Private donors and intermediaries from the region played an 
instrumental role in supporting specific armed groups or operation rooms with fundraising 
campaigns conducted through social media. Meanwhile, thousands of foreign fighters 
joined the hostilities, either officially in support of the Government or clandestinely in 
armed groups, fuelling the sectarian dimension of the conflict with their composition and 
narratives.  
</p>
<p>10. Sectarian rifts became more pronounced and expanded beyond the borders of the 
Syrian Arab Republic, threatening security and stability in neighbouring countries. The 
danger of further destabilization in the region is real and of serious concern. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p>11. Government forces regained several strategic areas through the use of heavy 
firepower, the systematic engagement of irregular forces and greater involvement of foreign 
forces. While maintaining most key urban centres and lines of communication under their 
control, they threatened armed opposition strongholds in Damascus and Aleppo. They have, 
however, failed to re-establish effective control of countryside previously lost to armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p>12. The ranks of pro-government irregular forces, both paramilitary and militia groups, 
and their use in direct combat operations grew. Besides the National Defence Forces, the 
Baath party battalions, popular committees and <i>shabbiha</i> groups continued to operate in 
their neighbourhoods while increasingly engaged in support of the military on a regular 
basis. The Government also benefited from the support of foreign combat units, including 
Hizbullah and Iraqi militia, particularly in critical operations.    
</p>
<p>13. As part of their strategy aimed at weakening the insurgents and breaking the will of 
their popular base, government forces besieged several localities, a strategy reinforced by 
prolonged shelling campaigns. Partial sieges aimed at expelling armed groups turned into 
tight blockades that prevented the delivery of basic supplies, including food and medicine, 
as part of a &#8220;starvation until submission&#8221; campaign.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>14. As the conflict intensified, non-State armed groups, encompassing all non-
government aligned armed groups, engaged in sequential realignments and infighting. 
Fragmentation thwarted initiatives to bring them under a unified command with a cohesive 
structure and a clear strategy. Persisting ideological, political and social differences resulted 
in diverse and sometimes antagonistic positions.  
</p>
<p>15. Connectivity among armed groups improved across the country, leading to the 
establishment of permanent or temporary coordination and integration mechanisms, 
including coalitions and operation rooms. These realignments were based on common 
tactical objectives, shared ideologies, pressure from external backers or simply operational 
necessity. In this context, local Islamic coalitions, such as the Islamic Front, have </p>


<p>marginalized the non-ideological and moderate groups, partly owing to the selective 
financial support provided by certain Governments and their nationals. 
</p>
<p>16. To describe this complex landscape, non-State armed groups can be classified into 
four broad, non-exclusive umbrellas: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Syrian moderate nationalists organised in a conglomeration of armed groups affiliated 
to the internationally backed Supreme Military Council, fighting the Government and 
calling for the formation of a democratic and pluralistic State. This also includes 
moderate Islamic groups and armed groups with local agendas limited to their 
communities&#8217; aspirations.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Syrian Islamic armed groups bringing together fighters aimed at the ousting of the 
Government and militating for the institution of sharia law as the framework of an 
Islamic State in the country.; This category encompasses fighters from a wide Islamic 
ideological spectrum.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Radical Jihadist groups, including the two major Al-Qaieda affiliates, Jabhat Al-Nusra, 
and the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS), recruited from Salafi jihadist fighters 
and with the substantial presence and influence of foreign fighters. A rift has grown 
between the two groups, as the former remained engaged alongside other rebel groups 
in fighting government forces, while ISIS prioritized the consolidation of its territorial 
control against all encroachments.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Kurdish armed groups, mainly the Popular Protection Units (YPG), who have taken 
charge of protecting and governing territory, benefiting from a unified command, 
disciplined members and popular support. They reinforced their control of Kurdish 
regions after engaging in combat against other armed groups, in particular Al-Qaida 
affiliates in Aleppo, Ar Raqqah and Al Hasakah governorates.  
</p>
<p>17. The overlap in ideological orientation and political aspirations, as well as continuous 
individual and collective migration among the first three groups, makes it difficult to draw 
linear or fixed lines of separation among these categories. Securing logistical resources, in 
particular funding, has become the most important driving factor of structural and 
operational dynamics among rebel groups. In many cases, joining an armed group or a 
coalition is more a matter of survival than genuine ideological engagement.  
</p>
<p>18. In this intricate context, internal strife among rebel groups from all categories has 
escalated over the control of territories and resources, including roads, border crossings, 
smuggling routes and natural resources. Recently, long-brewing tensions between ISIS and 
other rebel groups, including the Islamic Front, culminated in violent hostilities extending 
across northern and northeastern governorates.  
</p>
<p>19.  A description of the current political and humanitarian context is annexed to the 
present report (see annex II).  </p>


<p><b> III. Violations in the treatment of civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> 
fighters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres and other unlawful killing</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b> </b>20. Government forces continue to unlawfully kill those perceived as potential enemies, 
including civilians and hors de combat fighters, in violation of common article 3 of the 
Geneva Conventions. In Damascus countryside, Government forces tightened sieges on 
opposition-controlled areas, adopting increasingly brutal tactics against anyone perceived 
as a threat. Syrian forces outside Muadamiyah and Daraya killed persons passing through 
checkpoints. Killings were documented at the 4th Division checkpoint near Mezzeh 
Airport, as well as at Summariah and Sahnaya checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>21. Bedouins, particularly the Jamlan, Harb, Abadah and Na&#8217;im tribes, were targeted 
because of their perceived affiliation with the armed opposition. On 29 July 2013, three 
Bedouin men were arrested and executed by government forces near Bley, a military airport 
in southern Damascus. Syrian army soldiers shot two unarmed Bedouin men while 
patrolling Al-Bitariyah on 7 August. In early September, three Bedouin men were shot at 
close range at a checkpoint between eastern Ghouta and Damascus International Airport. 
</p>
<p>22. Government forces targeted sick and wounded persons, particularly men seeking 
medical treatment, regarding their wounds as indicative of participation in hostilities. In 
mid-September, persons receiving treatment for non-life-threatening injuries in Mowasat 
Hospital were found dead after soldiers entered their operating rooms. One male relative 
who witnessed the soldiers was asked for identification and shot upon discovery of his 
family ties to the victims. On 24 October, Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters were escorting 
a convoy of injured civilians and fighters out of Al-Nashabeyah when they were ambushed. 
Soldiers from the 22nd Brigade approached and killed the wounded at close range.  
</p>
<p>23. During the campaign to recapture Homs governorate, government forces perpetrated 
unlawful killings. In mid-July, internally displaced persons in eastern Homs were routinely 
apprehended in Al-Furqlus and killed by soldiers of the 18th Division. On 21 July, 
government forces, supported by <i>shabbiha</i>, entered Sukhnah, eastern Homs, and conducted 
house raids, during which they shot eight civilians. In Houlah, during Ramadan, 
government forces conducted house searches and arrests. Bodies of people arrested during 
these raids were later returned to their relatives.  
</p>
<p>24. Government forces continue to control the majority of Hama governorate. On 7 
August, government forces, supported by National Defence Forces, killed a man at the 
checkpoint near Al-Jadeedah. In late September, <i>shabbiha</i> raided a house in Jalmeh, killing 
a defector. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>1. Killings that amount to the war crime of murder 
</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>25. Two 15-year-old boys, abducted near Nubul (Aleppo) on 26 June were executed on 
11 August 2013 in Mayer, when demands of the ISIS Emir in Tal Rifaat and Azaz were not 
met. Their corpses were mutilated, almost beyond recognition. A video of the execution 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
  See also annex III. </p>


<p>was posted on the Internet. In September, ISIS attacked the Northern Storm Brigade 
headquarters and prison in Jebel Barsaya, executing one prisoner.  
</p>
<p>26. Alawite farmers in Al-Ghab Valley (Hama) are routinely abducted and killed by 
armed groups operating from surrounding Sunni villages. Since May 2013, several farmers 
have been shot while cultivating their fields.  
</p>
<p>27.  Non-State armed groups executed captured soldiers. After armed group fighters took 
control of a government military checkpoint located 2 kilometres from Maaloula 
(Damascus countryside) on 4 September, they captured and executed soldiers stationed 
there. On 7 September, fighters raided a house on Mar Sarkis Street. Fighters separated the 
women and elderly, then took three men outside and shot them.  
</p>
<p>28. Since July, Jabhat Al-Nusra, at times in coordination with other armed groups, 
carried out a series of killings of Kurdish civilians in Al Youssoufiyah, Qamishli and Al-
Asadia (Al-Hasakah). During a raid by ISIS, Jabhat Al-Nusra, the Islamic Front and FSA 
battalions, fighters killed a Kurdish Yazidi man in Al-Asadia who refused to convert to 
Islam.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>2. Killings amounting to the war crime of execution without due process 
</b></p>
<p>29. Certain armed groups, in establishing control over areas in north-eastern Syria, 
conducted public extrajudicial executions in violation of fair trial guarantees, violating 
common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. In late August, the Northern Storm Brigade 
executed an unidentified man in the public square of Azaz (Aleppo).  
</p><p>30. The FSA-affiliated Gathering of Ahrar Nawa Battalions entered Nawa (Dara&#8217;a) in 
mid-September and captured three government soldiers. They were interrogated to 
determine whether they had been involved in &#8220;bloodshed&#8221;, then summarily executed.  
</p>
<p>31. During an attack on a government checkpoint in Jisr Al Shughur (Idlib) on 7 
October, the FSA Al Sai&#8217;qa Brigade captured one soldier. The fighters sought advice on 
sharia law. Their contact instructed them to execute the soldier, stating that &#8220;those that 
surrender after being captured will be killed&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>32. In October, Ahrar Al-Sham captured an alleged car bomber in Binnish (Idlib). The 
man was interrogated and beaten to extort a confession, then summarily executed following 
a trial conducted by &#8220;defector judges&#8221;.  
</p><p>33. Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS carried out public executions in Tal Abyad (Ar Raqqah) in 
September. Armed groups conducted public executions to assert their presence after taking 
control of an area and to instil fear among the population.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p>34. Government forces conducted arbitrary arrests during or immediately following 
ground operations. From July to September 2013, government forces conducted a campaign 
of arrests throughout Homs in Al-Qaryatayn, Houlah, Karm Al-Zeytun and Dewayer, as 
well as in Sinjar (Idlib) in July, Al-Jalmeh (Hama) in November, and Beit Jin (Damascus 
countryside) and Kafr Shams (Dara&#8217;a) in September. Men and adolescent boys were 
targeted, although children, women and elderly persons were also detained.  
</p>
<p>35. Families of suspected members of armed groups, including deceased fighters, were 
detained with the purpose of obtaining information or as retribution. This has instilled fear 
among entire communities. Consequently, families from Muadamiyah (Damascus 
countryside) no longer publish death notices.  </p>


<p>36. Residents of opposition-controlled areas were arrested and detained when passing 
through checkpoints. In July, a woman was arrested at a Damascus checkpoint because her 
identity card indicated her former residence as Dara&#8217;a. Such practices have curtailed the 
freedom of movement of civilians, in particular men and boys over 12 years.  
</p>
<p>37. Doctors and rescue workers were detained on the grounds that they assisted 
&#8220;terrorists&#8221; in Hama and Damascus. Human rights defenders and political activists were 
targeted for arrest and detained in Damascus, limiting their freedom of expression and 
opinion.  
</p>
<p>38. Persons were detained without a legal basis, their detention was not justified on 
permissible grounds and they were not accorded their right to a review of the grounds and 
legality of their detention. Government forces conducted arbitrary arrests and unlawful 
detention, in violation of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>39. Non-State armed groups arbitrarily deprived persons of their liberty, violating their 
obligations under international humanitarian law. Armed groups did not afford detainees an 
initial and periodic review of the detention by an independent entity. 
</p>
<p>40. In late July 2013, ISIS fighters arrested Kurdish civilians in Tal Abyad (Ar Raqqah) 
on the basis of their ethnicity. In August, a doctor was apprehended by a FSA brigade in 
Aleppo city because he had provided medical aid to government soldiers. In Aleppo 
governorate, people were arbitrarily arrested and unlawfully detained by Jabhat Al-Nusra, 
Ahrar Al-Sham and ISIS. Summary judgements passed by mechanisms not fulfilling the 
minimum standards for due process guarantees sometimes formed the basis for 
imprisonment.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>41. Warring parties engaged in hostage-taking, in violation of international humanitarian 
and criminal law. There has been a rise in incidents perpetrated by non-State armed groups, 
in particular by ISIS.  
</p>
<p>42. Belligerents, motivated by financial gain or to exchange prisoners held by opposing 
forces, abducted individuals. In some instances, criminal gangs used the conflict as an 
opportunity for self-enrichment. As abductions accelerated, civilians fled their homes, 
seeking safety. Some families restricted women and girls to their homes, limiting their 
freedom of movement and their access to education. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p>43. Government forces, National Defence Forces, popular committees and <i>shabbiha</i> 
groups took hostages for ransom in Latakia and Tartus governorates. Al Mashtal checkpoint 
in Tartus is notorious. 
</p>
<p>44. In Beit Jin and Saesae (Damascus countryside), Syrian intelligence services 
abducted women and children at checkpoints to exchange for soldiers held by armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 25 June 2013, two teenage boys were kidnapped outside of Nubul and Zahra, 
Shia enclaves in northern Aleppo governorate. When a prisoner exchange failed, the boys 
were executed. On 23 and 24 September, two convoys of 60 women and children were 
abducted by Jamaat Al-Husba after leaving Nubul and Zahra. In Latakia, following an </p>


<p>attack by armed groups on eastern Alawite villages, 120 women and children were taken 
hostage and are being held, reportedly by Ahrar Al-Sham. 
</p>
<p>46. On 21 July, during an ISIS attack on Tal Abyad (Ar Raqqah), several hundred 
Kurdish men were taken hostage to effect a prisoner exchange for a captured ISIS 
commander. In July and August, Kurdish civilians were kidnapped for ransom by Jabhat 
Al-Nusra, in locations stretching from Qamishli to Al-Malikiyah. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearance  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia  
</b></p>
<p>47. In a conference room paper, the commission examined the occurrence of enforced 
disappearances in the Syrian Arab Republic between March 2011 and November 2013 (see 
annex IV). Reports of disappearances continue to be received. In September 2013, a 70-
year-old man was arrested by intelligence agents at the Nahar Aisha checkpoint 
(Damascus). His whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p><p>48. Syrian authorities systematically refuse to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or 
to notify the families of the fate or whereabouts of their relatives. Families are often afraid 
to approach the authorities. Means of obtaining information include former detainees and 
corrupt officials.  
</p>
<p>49. Enforced disappearance is committed as part of a widespread attack against the 
civilian population and constitutes a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>50. ISIS is adopting practices that may lead to acts tantamount to enforced 
disappearance, in breach of their obligations under international humanitarian law. In 
August 2013, an activist disappeared in Ar Raqqah; a fellow detainee indicated that he was 
being held by ISIS, which denied this. On 9 December, three activists were seized in 
Dumah (Damascus). Currently listed as missing, their whereabouts and the identity of those 
holding them remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Torture and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p>51. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment by government forces and pro-government 
militia continue to be perpetrated extensively at detention facilities, by intelligence 
agencies, at checkpoints around besieged areas, during house raids, as a means to extract 
information and to punish and inflict terror on the population.  
</p>
<p>52. Torture and ill-treatment are routinely committed in official detention facilities (see 
annex V), in particular intelligence agencies such as the Political Security Branch in 
Aleppo, the Military Intelligence Branch 227 and Military Intelligence Branch 215, the 
Mezzeh Airforce Intelligence facility, the Qaboun Military Police Branch and Sednaya 
Prison in Damascus, the Gharez Central Prison in Dara&#8217;a and the Military Intelligence 
Branch in Homs. Methods of torture, including severe beatings about the head and body, 
prolonged hanging by the arms and sexual torture continue, as previously documented by 
the commission. Victims showed physical injuries consistent with a pattern of torture.  
</p><p>53. Abuses were also widely reported at checkpoints surrounding besieged areas, around 
Al-Ghouta in September, as well as the checkpoints around Kafr Shams (Dara&#8217;a) until 
September. The use of torture and ill-treatment is part of the siege strategy, employed in 
order to contain the local population.  </p>


<p>54. Beatings and ill-treatment were perpetrated during house raids in Homs in 
September and Dara&#8217;a in July and October 2013. 
</p>
<p>55. Conditions of detention were characterized by a lack of food, water, space, sleep, 
hygiene and medical care. Such conditions led to the death of detainees. One interlocutor 
stated that a detained family member had requested only one visit every six months, 
because he was beaten after visits and his health had greatly deteriorated after each visit. 
With inadequate sanitary facilities and no medical care, detainees frequently fell ill. In July, 
a detainee shouting in agony asking the prison guards to take him to a toilet was beaten to 
death in front of other detainees. Conditions of detention constitute cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>56. Government forces and militia perpetrated torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment as part of a widespread attack directed against a 
civilian population<i>,</i> indicating the existence of an organizational policy. Widespread 
recourse to torture denotes a systematic attack on the civilian population. Torture and other 
inhumane acts as crimes against humanity, as well as war crimes, were committed by 
government forces and militia.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>57. Areas of Aleppo under the control of non-State armed groups were the scene of 
incidents of torture and ill-treatment by groups such as the Saddam Hussein Battalion of the 
Al-Tawheed Brigade, the Northern Storm Brigade and the Coalition of Al-Kifaa&#8217; Brigades. 
Civilians were targeted by the Sharia Board, employing harsh interrogation techniques and 
beatings during arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>58. In Damascus, civilians were detained and tortured in August 2013 for their religion 
alone. Hostages taken by non-State armed groups reported being subjected to physical and 
psychological torture. In Idlib, journalists have been targeted, detained and tortured since 
July by armed groups. In Tal Abyad (Ar Raqqah), in late July, Kurds were beaten and 
electrocuted by ISIS and Jabhat-al-Nusra, Ahrar Al-Sham and Shahid Walid Al-Sukhni 
Battalion at their headquarters. An interlocutor noted that, in Ar Raqqah, &#8220;every Islamist 
armed group has its own detention facility where civilians are routinely detained and 
tortured&#8221;. Beatings and harsh and humiliating treatment occurred at checkpoints manned by 
armed groups in Damascus in August 2013, in Ar Raqqah after July and in Al-Hasakah.  
</p>
<p>59. Non-State armed groups throughout the Syrian Arab Republic inflicted severe 
physical or mental pain or suffering on civilian populations in areas under their control, 
during apprehension and/or detention. The increase in such patterns, particularly in the 
context of events in Ar Raqqah, constitutes an emerging widespread and systematic attack 
on the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>60. The rise in torture and the inhumane treatment of the civilian population in areas 
controlled by ISIS and affiliated groups provide reasonable grounds to believe that such 
groups promote the widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>61. The acts committed by non-State armed groups identified above in areas under their 
control against the civilian population constitute torture and inhuman treatment as a war 
crime and, in the context of Ar Raqqah, as a crime against humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>62. Sexual and gender-based violence persists in the conflict. Reporting remains a 
challenge for the reasons identified by the commission in previous reports. </p>


<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p>63. In November 2013, in Damascus Military Intelligence Branch 215, a woman 
underwent an intimate body search by a male commander before being tortured and 
sexually assaulted. In December, she was transferred to Military Intelligence in Homs 
where she was tortured and orally raped.  
</p>
<p>64. In 2012, in an intelligence branch in Hama, five women were tortured daily, 
including by electrocution, for more than a month. During the same period, two women 
were raped by officers in command for 15 consecutive days. In August 2013, a woman was 
stripped and exposed at a checkpoint near Al-Jadeedah before being taken to the Hama 
branch, where she was raped. In December 2013, an 18-year-old girl was tortured and 
repeatedly raped. 
</p>
<p>65. Sexual torture, including the tying of genitals, has been systematically perpetrated 
against men and boys in custody in Damascus, Homs and Aleppo. In November 2012, a 
man was raped in Al Khatib security branch, Damascus. In January 2013, at the Homs 
Security Branch, security agents beat and electrocuted the genitals of a 17-year-old boy and 
raped him while others watched.  
</p>
<p>66. Rape and sexual assaults targeting women and girls occurred at checkpoints in 
Damascus, Latakia, Dara&#8217;a, Homs and Aleppo. In January 2013, a 17-year-old girl was 
gang raped at a government checkpoint in Damascus countryside. In February 2013, a 28-
year-old woman was taken off a bus by government militia in Latakia and gang raped.  
</p>
<p>67. Men were tortured and raped on the grounds of their sexual orientation at 
government checkpoints in Damascus. In 2011, six homosexual men were beaten viciously 
with electric cables by security agents and threatened with rape. In October 2012, a man 
was stopped by security because his partner&#8217;s brother was a member of the FSA. The man 
was taken to a rural area, where cigarettes were stubbed on his body and he was gang raped.  
</p>
<p>68. Government forces are conducting a sniper campaign in Bustan Al-Qasr (Aleppo). 
On one day alone in October, doctors treated five men shot in the groin. The same month, 
six pregnant women were shot in the abdomen.  
</p>
<p>69. Rape, sexual torture and sexual violence were perpetrated by government forces and 
militia against men, women and children. This conduct was committed as part of a 
widespread attack, where civilians were targeted for detention and systematically subjected 
to multiple violations. These acts constitute crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
violations of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>70. In 2012, a Kurdish woman from Afrin was kidnapped, held in solitary confinement 
and raped by the Northern Storm Brigade in Azaz (Aleppo). In June 2013, a woman was 
tortured and threatened with rape in Ar Raqqah city for &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; the Sharia Council. 
In October 2013, a 26-year-old man was detained on the grounds of his sexual orientation. 
He was beaten and hung by his arms from a ceiling by ISIS in Ar Raqqah. On 31 October, a 
school headmistress was publicly lashed by ISIS in Ar Raqqah for not wearing a hijab.  
</p><p>71. Rape, sexual torture and sexual violence perpetrated by non-State armed groups are 
in violation of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and constitute war crimes. </p>


<p><b> G. Violations of children&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia  
</b></p>
<p>72. Pro-government militia armed and used children from the age of 13 at checkpoints 
in Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a and Tartus. In October 2013, in Ataman (Dara&#8217;a), children from the age 
of 14 were armed and trained by popular committees.  
</p>
<p>73. Government sieges resulted in the severe malnutrition of young children in Daraya, 
Muadamiyah and Yarmouk (Damascus). 
</p><p>74. Children, particularly adolescent boys, were arrested at checkpoints controlled by 
government forces and pro-government militia in Aleppo, Damascus and Dara&#8217;a. Girls 
reported sexual violence and harassment at checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>75.  Children were detained with adults and subjected to torture inside the Aleppo 
Political Security Branch and the Military Security Branch detention facilities in Damascus. 
A 15-year-old boy, who spent three months in detention until late July, was subjected to 
daily torture. Scars, including cigarette burns, were visible on his body. He demonstrated 
marked signs of post-traumatic stress. 
</p>
<p>76. In Aleppo, children were the subject of deliberate targeting by snipers. A doctor 
reported that, in October 2013, at least one child was injured daily by a sniper, and cited a 
case of an 8-year-old boy killed while carrying bread. 
</p>
<p>77. Children have been killed, injured and suffered permanent disabilities through 
indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardment by government forces. Starting in July, a 
dozen schools were shelled, leading to the death and wounding of children in Aleppo, Ar 
Raqqah, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Dayr az Zawr, Homs and Idlib governorates.  
</p>
<p>78. Government forces and militia perpetrated acts that constitute war crimes, including 
torture of children in detention and the recruitment and use of children. Use of children by 
pro-government militia violates the commitment of the Syrian Arab Republic to the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Denial of food and medical 
care during sieges is in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law 
obligations. Children&#8217;s right to education has been denied through indiscriminate attacks on 
schools. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>79. Children were recruited and used by Ahrar al-Sham, several FSA affiliated groups, 
Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS. In late 2013, children were observed in combat roles with FSA-
affiliated groups in Tamoura (Aleppo), with Jabhat Al-Nusra in Al-Hasakah, and with ISIS 
in Ar Raqqah and Aleppo. Children were wounded during active combat. 
</p>
<p>80. Armed groups assigned child recruits from the age of 12 to 14 years to checkpoints 
and used children to load ammunition. In 2013, minors were seen at ISIS checkpoints in Ar 
Raqqah and at Saddam Hussein Battalion checkpoints in Aleppo. Children received 
weapons training by Jabhat Al-Nusra in Tal Rifat (Aleppo) in July 2013. ISIS used a school 
in Al Bab (Aleppo) as a military training camp for boys in September 2013.  
</p><p>81. Underage YPG fighters were seen in Qamishli (Al-Hasakah) and in Ayn Al-Arab 
(Ar Raqqah) in July and August 2013. In a letter dated 30 September 2013 addressed to the 
commission, the YPG stated its policy not to use children under 18. An order issued on 14 
December from its central command to YPG commanders echoed these guidelines. 
Adherence to this policy continues to be monitored.  </p>


<p>82. Children have been detained and tortured by some armed groups. A 14-year-old boy 
stated that he had been tortured by Ahrar Al-Sham in Ar Raqqah<b> </b>in July in an attempt to 
extract information about his uncle. 
</p>
<p>83. Children have been killed in indiscriminate shelling by armed groups. On 5 October, 
a 13-year-old boy and his friend were killed by a mortar attack while in their schoolyard in 
Nubul (Aleppo). On 31 October, a mortar attack on a school in Damascus killed a girl.  
</p><p>84. Non-State armed groups have perpetrated the war crime of enlisting and using 
children below the age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities, and have recruited and 
used children under the age of 18 years in hostilities contrary to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. They also committed the war crime of torture on 
children. Children&#8217;s right to education has been denied by the use of schools as military 
bases and training camps.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations concerning the conduct of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p>85. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks &#8211; predominantly shelling and aerial 
bombardments &#8211; caused mass civilian death and injuries. Unlawful attacks continue to be 
the primary reason for internal displacement and refugee flows. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Shelling and aerial bombardment 
</b>86. Across the country, the Government shelled civilian areas with artillery, mortars and 
tank fire. In some areas, aerial bombardment by helicopters and jet fighters was a daily 
occurrence. There was a marked increase in the use of highly imprecise and lethal barrel 
bombs dropped into urban areas from helicopters at high altitudes. The use of barrel bombs 
in this manner is indiscriminate (see annex VI).  
87. Government forces fiercely bombarded contested civilian-inhabited areas of 
strategic importance. Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, Idlib and Ar Raqqah governorates came 
under sustained attack.  
</p>
<p>88. Attacks were not directed at distinct military objectives. In areas where armed group 
fighters were present, government forces treated clearly distinct military objectives located 
in densely populated areas as a single target. Area bombardment spreads terror among the 
civilian population and is prohibited under international humanitarian law. Government 
forces did not issue warnings prior to attack.  
</p>
<p>89. Aleppo governorate was the subject of intense indiscriminate attack. Aleppo city 
suffered bombardments throughout the period under review, culminating in an ongoing 
campaign of barrel bombing, which caused hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries, 
including the loss of limbs. Government forces fired mortars and missiles in Azaz in July. 
In August, dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed by missiles fired 
by government jets. On 26 August, civilians, predominantly children, were killed in an 
incendiary bomb attack on a school in Urem Al-Koubra. September and October saw 
concentrated aerial bombardments, including missiles and barrel bombs, on Minbij, Al-
Safirah and Tal Hasel. The camp for displaced persons near Al-Safirah was attacked with 
barrel bombs in early October, causing many civilian deaths. Between November 2013 and 
January 2014, towns in Aleppo, including Abu Taltal and Maarat Al-Arteeq, were hit by </p>


<p>missiles and artillery shelling. In December, Mayer village was indiscriminately shelled 
from army positions in Nubul and Zahra. 
</p>
<p>90. Towns and villages in Damascus governorate came under incessant attack. Between 
mid-September and mid-October, Al-Ghouta suffered intense, often daily, aerial 
bombardment, which had a devastating impact on the densely populated area. Muadamiyah 
and Daraya, also under siege, were shelled and bombarded. Qaboun, Dumayr, Beit Jin and 
Zabadani were also unlawfully attacked. In the Qalamoun region, indiscriminate attacks by 
Government forces during November and December forced more than 4,000 families to 
flee. 
</p>
<p>91. Government forces repeatedly fired shells and missiles on the Tariq Al-Saad and 
Saharra neighbourhoods of Dara&#8217;a city. In July and August, indiscriminate attacks &#8211; usually 
shelling from nearby army positions &#8211; were documented in Nawa, Alma, Naseeb, Dael, 
Inkhel and Yadoudeh in Dara&#8217;a governorate. 
</p>
<p>92. Attacks on villages and towns in Idlib governorate are too numerous to detail. The 
region of Jabal Al-Zawiya and, in particular, the towns of Saraqib, Kafr Nabl and Maarat 
Al-Numan, came under intense aerial bombardment between July and October, including 
by barrel bombs. On 21 July, a market in Ariha was bombarded, resulting in mass civilian 
casualties. Ariha was heavily attacked between 24 August and 3 September. In both attacks, 
there were significant civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>93. Ar Raqqah city came under aerial bombardment, including the use of barrel bombs, 
in July. On 29 September, a jet bombarded a school, killing 16 people, 13 of whom were 
children. 
</p>
<p>94. Shelling and aerial bombardments were also documented in Homs, Hama, Al-
Hasakah and Dayr az Zawr governorates. 
</p>
<p>95. Government forces launched indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks in violation 
of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>96. Government forces continued to position military objectives inside towns and 
villages, including Nubul and Zahra (Aleppo), thereby endangering the civilian population 
and violating international legal obligations.  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Sniper attacks 
</b>97. In Aleppo city, warring parties demarcated areas under their control, positioning 
snipers overlooking the front lines. Bustan Al-Qasr remained as the sole passage between 
government-controlled and non-State armed group-controlled areas of Aleppo city. 
Government snipers positioned on Aleppo City Hall, a high-rise building providing an 
vantage point, target, maim and kill civilians crossing Bustan Al-Qasr.  
98. Doctors in hospitals in opposition-controlled Aleppo described having treated an 
unusually high number of sniper injuries since June 2013. Most victims were civilians 
coming from areas affected by shortages, crossing Bustan Al-Qasr to have access to 
cheaper goods. Victims were of all ages, including children, the elderly and pregnant 
women. One doctor stated that civilians were being used &#8220;for target practice&#8221;. A surgeon 
operating in another hospital confirmed this practice, explaining that, on certain days, he 
saw a clear pattern to sniper injuries. Most victims had a single wound from a high-velocity 
gunshot, causing &#8220;enormous amounts of damage&#8221; and heavy bleeding. Maimed, the victims 
were often left to bleed in the street, as anyone who approached to help would be shot.  
</p>
<p>99. Sniper attacks targeting civilians were also documented in Yarmouk and Dara&#8217;a Al 
Balad (Dara&#8217;a). </p>


<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Shelling 
</b>100. Armed groups continued to shell Nubul and Zahra (Aleppo) using artillery and 
home-made rockets. In mortar attacks in September and October, young children were 
killed and wounded. Kurdish civilian populations in Qamishli, Qiro, Ras Al-Ayn and Al-
Malikiyah (Al-Hasakah) were shelled. 
101. Armed groups based in Al Mlihah, Beit Saham and Ein Tarma in eastern Damascus 
countryside launched home-made rockets and artillery shells into government-controlled 
areas, notably Jaramana and Mezzeh neighbourhoods, causing civilian deaths. In Bab 
Tuma, on 11 November, a mortar hit a school bus, killing five children. 
</p>
<p>102. Non-State armed groups used mortars, artillery shells and home-made rockets in a 
manner that made no distinction between civilian and military objectives, thereby 
committing unlawful attacks. 
</p>
<p>103. While instances were recorded of armed fighters positioned on the outskirts of towns 
away from civilian populations, most fighters, including those in Aleppo and Ar Raqqah 
cities, were based among civilians, exposing them to attack and violating international legal 
obligations to avoid positioning military objectives within or near densely populated areas. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Car and suicide bombings 
</b>104. Armed groups exploded car and suicide bombs in Al-Hasakah, Ar Raqqah, Homs, 
Aleppo and Damascus governorates during the period under review. The use of improvised 
explosive devices was also documented in Homs. 
</p>
<p>105. On 15 August, ISIS exploded a bomb at a train station in Ar Raqqah, near the 
headquarters of the Ahfad Al-Rasoul Brigades. On 4 November, a suicide bombing targeted 
a Hizbullah office in Al-Thabiytiya (Homs). These attacks, while directed at military 
objectives, resulted in a loss of civilian life and injury to civilians, which was 
disproportionate in relation to the military advantage anticipated. 
</p>
<p>106. On 19 September, armed groups remotely detonated landmines placed along a 
bypass road between Jabourin and Homs city. Three civilian vehicles were hit and nine 
civilians killed. On 26 November, armed groups exploded a bomb in Al-Sumariyah main 
station (Damascus), killing dozens of civilians. These three attacks appeared designed to 
target civilians, a war crime. Such attacks, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror 
among civilians, are prohibited under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specifically protected persons and objects  
 1. Hospitals and health-care personnel 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a)  Government forces and pro-government militia 
</b>107. Government forces continue to destroy hospitals and medical units and to target 
medical personnel (see also annex VII). During the period under review, attacks were 
documented in Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a and Homs governorates. Sick and wounded 
civilians and <i>hors de combat</i> fighters were also prevented from having access to medical 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>108. In Damascus, hospitals in eastern Ghouta were shelled. During a ground invasion in 
July, forces destroyed a field hospital in Al-Zemaniyah. After the attack on Al-Ghouta on 
21 August, shells landed near Al-Fatih hospital, which was treating victims of the chemical </p>


<p>attack, forcing the hospital to discharge its patients. In early November, the army attacked 
Al-Rajaa hospital in Irbeen, where armed group fighters were being treated. On 3 
November, the airforce bombarded a field hospital in Beit Jin. 
</p>
<p>109. Hospitals in Aleppo city and Al Bab came under sustained shelling and aerial 
bombardments. In July 2013, Jaban hospital in Aleppo city was destroyed. On 11 
September, a jet fired a missile at Al Bab field hospital, killing 15 people, including a 
doctor, four paramedics and eight patients, and injuring many others. The hospital had 
moved its location three times owing to shelling attacks.  
</p>
<p>110. In August, a field hospital in Naseeb (Dara&#8217;a) was shelled. In October 2013, 
government forces fired rockets on Al-Qaryatayn hospital (Homs), resulting in 30 
casualties and more than 100 wounded. 
</p>
<p>111. Medical personnel were targeted and killed while performing their duties. Snipers 
regularly shot at ambulances in Aleppo city in September and October. In August, a sniper 
shot and killed a nurse in Al-Hilal hospital, Aleppo. Medical staff suspected of treating or 
providing medical supplies to the opposition were detained and tortured, as in the case of 
Dr. Abbas Khan, who died in government detention on 17 December. 
</p>
<p>112. Government forces blocked medical supplies and equipment from besieged areas. 
People seeking medical treatment have been arrested or turned back at checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>113. In attacks on hospitals, medical units and health-care personnel, the Government 
violated binding international humanitarian law to care for the sick and wounded and 
committed the war crime of attacking protected objects. As hospitals have been destroyed, 
and medical personnel killed, detained or fled, the health-care infrastructure has been 
severely weakened, with disastrous consequences for the civilian population.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>  <b></b></i><b>(b) Non-State armed groups 
</b>114. During the attack on Sadad (Homs) from 21 to 28 October, armed groups looted the 
hospital, rendering it dysfunctional. On 11 November, a car bomb was remotely detonated 
outside a Kurdish Red Crescent clinic in Ayn Al-Arab (Ar Raqqah). In an attack on Deir 
Atiyah (Damascus), on 19 November, a suicide bomber exploded in the hospital lobby, 
while other fighters executed nine medical personnel. On 16 August, an armed group 
targeted a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance in Ras Al-Ayn (Al-Hasakah). After attempting 
to destroy it with an improvised explosive device, fighters fired on the ambulance, killing 
its driver and a nurse. In its attacks on hospitals, medical units and health-care personnel, 
armed groups have violated international humanitarian law and committed the war crime of 
attacking protected objects. 
115. During an attack on Tal Hasel (Aleppo) on 28 and 29 July, armed groups positioned 
snipers around its medical centre. Placing military objectives in hospitals constitutes a 
failure to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians from the effects of attack. Such 
acts also contravene the fundamental obligation to respect and protect medical units.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Religious personnel and cultural property 
</b></p>
<p><i> (i) Government forces and pro-government militia 
</i>116. Government forces placed military objectives in and around objects of great cultural 
significance. Satellite imagery showed military posts being constructed in the pre-Roman 
city of Palmyra (Homs). Such posts incorporate ancient structures or were built on their 
remains. The Government, in building and positioning military objectives in and around 
Palmyra, has breached its obligations to respect and protect cultural property under the 
Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. </p>


<p><i> (ii) Non-State armed groups 
</i>117. There was a dramatic increase in attacks on religious personnel and buildings by 
non-State armed groups. Such attacks directly threaten freedom of religion. 
</p>
<p>118. On 28 July, Father Dall&#8217;Oglio was abducted in Ar Raqqah city by ISIS;his fate 
remains unknown. On 4 August, an Alawite Imam was executed during an attack on 
villages in eastern Latakia. On 2 December, nuns were moved from the Martar Monastery 
and Church in Maaloula to Yabroud by an armed group. While this move appeared initially 
intended  to remove them from the area of active fighting, the nuns remain in Yabroud with 
conditions imposed for their release. The Syriac Orthodox and Greek Orthodox 
Archbishops, Yohanna Ibrahim and Paul Yazigi, remain detained following their abduction 
in Aleppo in April. 
</p>
<p>119. On 4 September, armed groups clashed with government forces in Maaloula 
(Damascus). Churches were looted and destroyed. The historic churches of Mar Sarkia and 
Barhos were used as bases for military operations. In October, ISIS damaged the Church of 
Saidat Al-Bishara in Ar Raqqah and established their headquarters there. During the attack 
from 21 to 28 October on Sadad (Homs), armed groups desecrated Christian churches. On 
16 and 17 November, during fighting in Qara (Damascus), the Mar Michael church was 
damaged. As government forces retook Qara, armed groups positioned weaponry near 
Christian churches. 
</p>
<p>120. Armed groups wilfully damaged and destroyed property of great significance to the 
cultural heritage of the Syrian Arab Republic, in contravention of international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>121. During an attack on Tal Hasel and Tal Aran (Aleppo) on 28 and 29 July, ISIS-
affiliated armed groups positioned snipers in mosque minarets, exposing the building to 
lawful attack. 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Journalists 
</b>122. In 2013, 28 journalists were killed in the Syrian Arab Republic, making it the 
world&#8217;s deadliest country for media workers.  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>(i) Non-State armed groups 
</i>123. Journalists in Aleppo and Ar Raqqah governorates received direct threats to their 
safety from ISIS.  
</p>
<p>124. On 4 December, Yasser Al-Jumaili, a veteran freelance cameraman from Iraq was 
executed in Idlib. In his last conversation with Al Jazeera, he stated he was being held by 
ISIS. 
</p>
<p>125. On 31 December 2012, a foreign reporter was held by Jabhat Al-Nusra and other 
armed groups in Aleppo. He was ill-treated in various clandestine detention centres until he 
managed to escape in late July 2013. On 8 April, two foreign journalists were detained in 
Al Qusayr (Homs) by a group affiliated to the Al-Farouk Brigade and repeatedly tortured 
until their release in September. On 24 July, ISIS fighters attacked a media centre in 
Saraqib (Idlib), assaulting its staff and kidnapping a foreign journalist, who reportedly 
escaped in October and left the country. 
</p>
<p>126. In continued attacks on journalists, armed groups, notably ISIS, violated 
international humanitarian law. Such attacks also constitute a direct threat to the right of 
freedom of expression. </p>


<p><b> C. Use of illegal weapons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Chemical weapons 
</b></p>
<p>127. In its report, the United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of 
Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic confirmed that chemical weapons, 
specifically sarin, had been used in multiple incidents during the conflict.4 The commission 
independently collected information, confirming this finding in the case of Al-Ghouta (21 
August), Khan Al-Assal (19 March) and Saraqib (29 April).  
</p><p>128. In Al-Ghouta, significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned 
indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The 
evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 
August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile 
of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate 
safely large amount of chemical agents. Concerning the incident in Khan Al-Assal on 19 
March, the chemical agents used in that attack bore the same unique hallmarks as those 
used in Al-Ghouta.  
</p>
<p>129. Other allegations of chemical weapons use investigated displayed markedly different 
circumstances and took place on a significantly smaller scale. In no incident was the 
commission&#8217;s evidentiary threshold met with regard to the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Incendiary weapons 
</b></p>
<p>130. On 26 August, an army fighter jet dropped two incendiary bombs on the town of 
Urem Al-Koubra (Aleppo), one of which landed on a school. The bomb created &#8220;a ball of 
fire&#8221; that killed 10 civilians and severely injured dozens of others, mostly children and 
teenagers. While it remains unclear what flammable material was used, the bomb caused 
napalm-like effects. Victims, some of whom did not survive, were disfigured, with second- 
and third-degree burns on up to 80 per cent of their bodies, and suffered extreme pain.  
</p>
<p>131.  By using incendiary bombs in the Urem Al-Koubra school incident, the Government 
violated rules of international humanitarian law prohibiting the use of weapons that cause 
superfluous injury, unnecessary suffering or that are indiscriminate by nature. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Sieges and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia  
</b></p>
<p>132. The Government employs siege warfare, instrumentalizing basic human needs for 
water, food, shelter and medical care, as part of its military strategy. Sieges have been 
imposed on towns across the Syrian Arab Republic. Besieged areas have been relentlessly 
shelled and bombarded. Government forces have restricted the distribution of humanitarian 
aid, including surgical supplies, on the grounds that they can be used to treat injured 
combatants. Such tactics are in direct breach of binding international humanitarian law 
obligations to ensure that wounded and sick persons are collected and cared for, and to 
ensure the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. The denial of humanitarian, 
including food aid, has been protracted in many areas, leading to malnutrition and 
starvation. The use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare is 
prohibited. Such acts also violate core obligations under the right to adequate food and the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
  A/67/997-S/2013/553. </p>


<p>133. As at January 2014, 160,000 people were besieged in the towns of Dumah, Arbin, 
Zamalka, Kafr Batna, Harasta, Jisreen, Saqba and Al-Mliha in eastern Ghouta (Damascus 
countryside). The denial of food as a military strategy in this agricultural area began during 
July and August 2013, when crops and farms were shelled and burned. As the siege was 
tightened, government forces blocked access roads and systematically confiscated food, 
fuel and medicine at checkpoints. A woman, who fled in mid-September and had not eaten 
meat or fresh vegetables for more than a year, reported how soldiers at checkpoints would 
harass anyone caught carrying food and destroy it on suspicion that they were &#8220;aligned with 
the opposition&#8221;. In October, soldiers at the Al-Mliha &#8220;Tamico&#8221; checkpoint detained a 
woman because she was carrying bread hidden under her clothes. Also in October, a 
woman attempting to bring in food for her family was harassed by security officers at a 
checkpoint near Douma and told, &#8220;you people will be looking for food like dogs&#8221;. Snipers 
targeted persons who attempted to leave or enter eastern Ghouta without passing through 
checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>134. By early October, residents relied on bulgur wheat, rice and tree leaves as substitutes 
for vegetables to survive. To date, water is available sporadically and in insufficient 
quantities. The Government has repeatedly refused to approve the delivery of surgical 
supplies in humanitarian shipments. This deliberate obstruction of medical supplies has led 
to harrowing conditions for the sick and wounded. One injured man described how doctors 
used material from flour sacks for bandages for patients. Government checkpoints 
prevented those in need from leaving eastern Ghouta to seek medical treatment. Both those 
needing emergency treatment and with chronic medical conditions were denied medical 
access, resulting in deaths.  
</p>
<p><i>(a)  Muadamiyah 
</i>135. Prior to the military truce in December 2013, 12,000 people were trapped inside 
Muadamiyah. The area was besieged from the east and the north by the 4th Division 
stationed near Mezzeh Airport, and from the south and west by the Presidential Guard near 
Jdaydet Artuz. Once routes from Dara&#8217;a to Muadamiyah were blocked on 20 April, food 
supplies were cut off, leading to gradual malnutrition and starvation. Residents described 
surviving off olives, tree leaves, wild grass and herbs once bulgur wheat and rice supplied 
had run out. The water supply was cut off for weeks at a time. A resident of Muadamiyah 
described the humiliation and agony of starvation, explaining that, when her three-year-old 
son was killed in late May, &#8220;my child died hungry&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>136. Children suffering from illnesses and shrapnel injuries had no access to food or 
medication, resulting in their premature death. Many health-care personnel, including most 
midwives, have fled. Owing to lack of food, nursing mothers were unable to feed their 
newborns, leading to malnutrition and at least one death. Government forces had sealed the 
area and positioned snipers targeting those trying to flee.  
</p>
<p>137. On 13 October, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the International Committee of 
the Red Cross supervised the evacuation of 3,500 civilians from Muadamiyah. During the 
evacuation, women and children were separated from the men, many of whom were 
screened at Mezzeh Airport. Several were arrested and detained. Many fighting-age men 
remained inside, fearing being arrested, killed or &#8220;disappeared&#8221; by Government forces. 
During subsequent evacuations, on 15 and 29 October, 5,000 more people left 
Muadamiyah. Despite the truce on 25 December, Muadamiyah remains besieged and no 
humanitarian access has been granted.  
</p>
<p><i>(b) Daraya 
</i>138. In Daraya, surrounded to the east by Mezzeh Airport and by Sahnaya to the south-
west, 8,000 people remain under siege. Government personnel at checkpoints arrested </p>


<p>persons on the basis of their origin as indicated on their identity cards. Residents describe 
the &#8220;humanitarian disaster&#8221; in Daraya, with no food, fuel or medicine allowed inside. 
Malnourishment has spread, drastically affecting children.  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>(c) Yarmouk camp 
</i>139. 20,000 people remain besieged in Yarmouk Palestinian Camp, with no food and 
medical supplies. People have nothing to eat, having exhausted all their supplies and 
resorted to eating plant leaves, selling their belongings and looting abandoned houses. In 
January 2014, reports of deaths from starvation were received. With hospitals and medical 
clinics damaged by shelling, there is a complete lack of health care. No medical supply 
shipments have been allowed into Yarmouk to date. On 15 January, an UNRWA convoy 
was authorized to enter Yarmouk only from the northern gate, where there were ongoing 
hostilities. The UNRWA convoy could not proceed because of insecurity. Since then, 
humanitarian convoys have been able to access the area but have been prevented from 
delivering food supplies by Government security forces inside the camp.  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>(d) Homs<b></b></i><b> </b><i>(Old City) 
</i>140. A siege was imposed on the Old City of Homs in February 2012. Checkpoints and 
barricades, and a 1 km concrete wall erected next to the Political Security Branch contour 
the Old City, blocking all access. Humanitarian aid was last allowed to enter in October 
2012. The 4,000 people remaining inside were faced with insufficient water and electricity, 
and a lack of food and medical supplies. Periodic shelling caused injuries that remain 
untreated and result in high mortality rates. Government snipers, positioned at all access 
points, limited movement and indiscriminately targeted persons.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Aleppo 
</b><i>(i) Nubul and Zahra 
</i></p>
<p>141. Non-State armed groups have encircled Nubul and Zahra, besieging 45,000 people. 
The siege is imposed by groups affiliated to the Islamic Front, Jaish Al Mujahedeen, Jabhat 
Al-Nusra and the Syrian Revolutionary Front by checkpoints erected around the area and 
by cutting off their electrical and water supply lines. These groups have denied access to 
humanitarian convoys, in violation of their obligations under international humanitarian 
law. This has led to dire humanitarian conditions, with residents digging wells for water 
and suffering illnesses due to the lack of sanitation. After a helicopter with humanitarian aid 
and school supplies was attacked in June 2013, government forces ceased the delivery of 
basic necessities. The sole remaining health-care clinic in Nubul and Zahra has few 
supplies, using primitive means to treat persons with chronic illnesses and those wounded 
in the indiscriminate shelling of the towns.  
</p>
<p>142 Armed groups in the region have periodically extended the siege to include Afrin, as 
it provides a supply line to Nubul and Zahra. As the conflict between the YPG and armed 
groups intensified in Al-Hasakah on 17 July, the siege on Afrin was re-imposed. As at 
January 2014, ISIS was preventing humanitarian access to Afrin.  
</p>
<p><i> (ii) Hama 
</i>143. Al-Ghab Valley, an agricultural area, contains a cluster of Alawite villages 
surrounded by a predominantly Sunni population. Government military positions deployed 
within the Alawite villages shell the surrounding area. Non-State armed groups have 
retaliated by deliberately targeting farmers working the fields. Repeated killings and </p>


<p>abductions have made it impossible for the residents of Mirdash and Shatha to cultivate 
their land, depriving them of their main source of income and sustenance. Carrying out 
attacks against farmers cultivating their land with the specific purpose of preventing them 
access to agricultural produce is prohibited under international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b>E. Arbitrary and forcible displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces and pro-government militia  
</b></p>
<p>144. By launching indiscriminate and disproportionate aerial bombardment and shelling, 
the Government has caused large-scale arbitrary displacement. In doing so, it has failed in 
its obligations under international human rights law to protect civilians from such 
displacement. It has failed to comply with its duties under international humanitarian law to 
provide displaced civilians with shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and to ensure 
that members of the same family are not separated.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>145. Two instances of forcible displacement by armed groups, as defined under 
international humanitarian law, were documented. 
</p>
<p>146. On 20 July, ISIS, Jabhat Al-Nusra, the Al-Sakhana Brigades, Saw&#8217;aiq Al-Rahman, 
the Ibn Taimia Brigades and Ahrar Al-Sham clashed with YPG forces in Tal Abyad (Ar 
Raqqah). 
</p><p>147. On 21 July, when YPG forces withdrew, armed groups broadcast orders from 
mosques in Al-Jisr, Harat Al-Leil and Hay Al Shallala neighbourhoods, instructing Kurdish 
civilians to leave the town or face immediate attack. Thousands of Kurdish civilians 
subsequently fled. Many were abducted at checkpoints encircling the area. The property of 
those who fled was looted and burned. 
</p>
<p>148. In Aleppo, on 28 July, clashes erupted in the Kurdish enclaves of Tal Aran and Tal 
Hasel between Jabhat Al-Akrad and YPG forces on the one side, and affiliated groups of 
Jabhat Al-Nusra, ISIS and FSA on the other. The latter groups seized control of Tal Aran, 
setting up checkpoints and sniper positions. Using mosque loudspeakers, armed group 
fighters ordered the Kurdish population to leave, under threat of violence. Thousands fled 
the following day.  
</p>
<p>149. On 29 July, the fighting spread to Tal Hasel, with the YPG engaging in hostilities 
with the above-mentioned armed groups. After short, intensive clashes, the armed groups 
encircled the town and conducted raids on Kurdish houses, abducting fighting-age men. 
Using mosque loudspeakers, the groups called Kurds &#8220;unbelievers&#8221;, declaring that &#8220;swords 
are between us and those who decide to stay in Tal Hasel&#8221;. Specific threats were directed 
against Kurdish women and children, saying that those who remained would be considered 
&#8220;halal for the mujahideen&#8221;.  
</p><p>150. The pattern of conduct perpetrated by non-State armed groups in Ar Raqqah and 
Aleppo in July indicates a coordinated and planned campaign to forcibly displace Kurdish 
civilians. The methods employed, the threat of violence and subsequent abductions 
demonstrate the deliberate displacement of a population on the basis of its ethnic identity. 
Such conduct amounts to the war crime of forcible displacement.  </p>


<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b> <b>A. Conclusions 
</b>  
</p>
<p>151<b>. The Syrian Arab Republic has acted in breach of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Right, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
Government forces have disregarded the basic human rights of people under their 
control and in their custody. As a state, the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for all 
acts committed by its officially sanctioned agents, in breach of its international treaty 
obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>152<b>. In the course of the conflict, the warring parties in the Syrian Arab Republic 
have failed to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. 
They have violated the fundamental prohibitions of common article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions, which are binding on all parties to the conflict. Such violations amount 
to war crimes, incurring individual criminal responsibility. Individual fighters and 
their commanders may be held accountable for their acts under international criminal 
law and by States exercising universal jurisdiction.   
</b>153.<b> External actors that support the belligerents financially and logistically have 
obligations under international law. States should not authorize the transfer of arms if 
there is a risk that they will be used in the commission of crimes against humanity or 
war crimes. In the Syrian Arab Republic, as has been repeatedly documented, this 
risk is real. States parties to the International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism must take measures to prevent persons and organizations that 
collect or donate funds knowing that they will be used to finance attacks on civilians 
or persons taking no active part in hostilities. Private donors, as well as foreign 
advisers providing operational assistance, are responsible for acts and conduct that 
occur under their control. States that exert influence over the parties in the Syrian 
Arab Republic have an obligation to ensure their compliance with the rules of 
international humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>154.<b> On 2 October 2013, the Security Council President issued a statement in which 
he condemned the widespread violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities, as well as any human rights abuses and 
violations of international humanitarian law by armed groups.</b>5<b> Building on this 
acknowledgement, the Security Council must seek a referral to justice to hold the 
perpetrators of these violations and abuses accountable.  
</b></p>
<p>155.<b> The Security Council, in adopting resolution 2118 (2013), demonstrated its 
capacity for unified and effective action in the Syrian Arab Republic. The five 
permanent members have failed to take action on other grave violations that equally 
threaten international peace and security. Such inaction has provided the space for 
the proliferation of actors in the Syrian Arab Republic, each pursuing its own agenda 
and contributing to the radicalization and escalation of violence. The Security Council 
bears this responsibility.

care, and allow unhindered passage of such goods; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Distinguish military from civilian objectives, refraining from all 
indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Not submit anyone, civilian or combatant, to torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, including sexual violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Adhere to the ban on the recruitment and use of children in hostilities;

<p><b>(g) Protect aid workers and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of 
relief supplies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Respect and protect schools and hospitals, and maintain their civilian 
character; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensure safe passage and protection for medical personnel, hospitals and 
ambulances; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Commit to ensuring the preservation of the material evidence of 
violations and international crimes to protect the right to truth of the Syrian people. 
</b></p>
<p>158. <b>The commission recommends that the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Cease using illegal weaponry, such as incendiary weapons and other 
weapons such as barrel bombs, that are unguided or poorly guided, on civilian areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Allow access for an independent humanitarian assessment of needs in 
eastern Ghouta, Yarmouk, Muadhamiyah and Old Homs City; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Allow the commission access to the country. 
 </b>159.<b> The commission recommends that non-State armed groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Allow access for an independent humanitarian assessment of needs in 
Nubul and Zahra; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Detach themselves from extreme elements that fail to comply with 
international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>160.<b> The commission recommends that countries with influence over the warring 
parties, in particular the permanent members of the Security Council work in concert 
to put pressure on the parties to end the violence and to initiate all-inclusive 
negotiations for a sustainable political transition process in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>161.<b> It further recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Curb the proliferation and supply of weapons, and address the sources 
thereof; </b></p>


<p><b>(b) Sustain funding for humanitarian operations, open up access to victims 
in all areas and facilitate expansion of humanitarian relief operations. 
</b></p>
<p>162. <b>The commission recommends that the Human Rights Council support the 
recommendations made, including by transmitting the present report to the 
Secretary-General for the attention of the Security Council in order that appropriate 
action may be taken, and through a formal reporting process to the General Assembly 
and to the Security Council. 
</b></p>
<p>163. <b>The commission recommends that the Security Council:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Support its recommendations; 
(b) Take appropriate action by referring the situation to justice, possibly to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that, in the context of the Syrian 
Arab Republic, only the Security Council is competent to refer the situation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Enhance the enforcement and implementation of international human 
rights and humanitarian law through the range of powers and measures at its disposal 
as part of the imperative of accountability, pertaining to all actors. </b></p>

<p><b>Annex II  
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Political and humanitarian context 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political context 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since March 2011, the conflict devolved from a domestic protest movement into a 
non-international armed conflict. As protests spread from Dara&#8217;a governorate to other parts 
of the country, Government forces resorted to excessive use of force to quell the unrest. In 
parallel, the Government passed legal and political reforms that failed to diffuse the crisis. 
As early as July 2011, small groups of army defectors joined by armed civilians engaged 
with Government forces in restive areas.. The Government framed its military  response to 
the unrest in the context of fighting terrorism, while the opposition insisted on its demands 
for democracy and dignity.  
</p>
<p>2. In response to the deepening crisis, various opposition currents formed the National 
Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces in November 2012. The 
Coalition represents a wide array of civilian and political forces including local councils, 
independent nationalist figures and the Syrian National Council (SNC). The latter forms the 
largest bloc in the Coalition accounting for 22 of its 66 seats. The Coalition also 
encompasses the Supreme Military Council (SMC) which is intended to unify armed 
groups, curb the influence of radical groups and bridge the gap with armed actors. On 25 
September 2013, thirteen of the most influential armed groups renounced their affiliation 
with the SMC and formed the Islamic Front (IF), weakening the credibility of the Coalition. 
The SNC&#8217;s latest withdrawal from the Coalition, further undermined the latter&#8217;s position on 
the eve of the Geneva 2 talks. Despite broadening its representation base to include the 
Kurdish National Council (KNC) and members of the internal opposition, some armed and 
political forces consider that the Coalition lacks effective representation on the ground and 
it is influenced by external factors. However, the Coalition remains the main political 
entity, representing the opposition, in the conduct of foreign affairs. 
</p>
<p>3. Since August 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) reinforced its control 
of captured areas in northern Syria, particularly in Al-Raqqah, Aleppo and Idlib countryside 
as foreign fighters continue to join its ranks. ISIS, an Al-Qaeda affiliate, runs areas under 
its control through local administrations governed by the strict application of Sharia Law. 
Those areas are meant to form the foundation of a future Islamic state extending beyond 
Syria&#8217;s borders. Over past months, restrictions on civil liberties tightened while human 
rights violations significantly increased in these areas under the group&#8217;s control. With the 
surge of the influence of radical groups, including ISIS, the foreign policy of regional and 
international actors, is increasingly geared towards addressing the rising threat of 
extremism.  
</p>
<p>4. In the Syrian Kurdish regions, this dynamic led to an open conflict between the 
Salafi Jihadi and Kurdish groups. A PYD-led coalition established an interim Kurdish 
administration with municipal councils in three provinces, Jazirah, Ayn Al-Arab and Afrin 
in January 2014. Alongside the KNC&#8217;s inclusion in the Coalition, both have engaged in 
policy discussions within the framework of the Supreme Kurdish Council under the 
auspices of the Kurdish Regional Government in Iraq.  </p>


<p>5. The intensity of the conflict reached the threshold of a non-international armed 
conflict by February 2012 with significant local, regional and international implications. 
Lebanon&#8217;s domestic dynamics have been seriously affected by the war in Syria. Political 
polarization has markedly increased against the backdrop of local parties&#8217; conflicting 
positions on the Syrian conflict. Hezbollah&#8217;s subsequent direct military involvement on the 
side of the Government and the mobilization of Sunni fighters to join the ranks of armed 
opposition groups in Syria aggravated existing sectarian tensions.  
</p>
<p>6. By the end of 2011, regional cleavages were evident through the positions of various 
Governments and regional actors either in support of the Syrian Government or the 
opposition. This regional dynamic increasingly defined the military and political conduct of 
warring parties and complicated the prospect of a peaceful settlement. On the international 
stage, differences among the five permanent members of the Security Council prevented an 
effective approach towards resolving the conflict.  
</p>
<p>7. The chemical weapons attacks in Damascus governorate on 21 August 2013 and 
their aftermath have altered the course of international diplomacy vis-&#224;-vis the conflict. As 
consensus for military action against the Government faltered, a framework agreement was 
reached between the United States and Russia for the destruction of the Syrian chemical 
stockpile on 13 September 2013 through Security Council Resolution 2118. Cooperation 
between the two Governments to broker the agreement signaled a closer approach on the 
Syrian conflict, particularly on the need for a political settlement. This was a significant 
departure from their previous positions. International consensus on dealing with the Syrian 
chemical threat and the need for political settlement led some countries in the region to 
moderate their approach towards the crisis and accelerated the diplomatic momentum 
towards the Geneva 2 talks. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite internal dissension, the Coalition voted in favour of participation in the 
Geneva II talks which started on 22 January 2014.  The basis for the talks. mediated by 
Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi, is the June 2012 Communiqu&#233; which calls 
for an immediate ceasefire; the formation of a transitional government with executive 
powers including representatives from the opposition and the government, maintainance of 
the territorial integrity of Syria and allowing humanitarian access among other aspects. The 
nature of the transitional Government and the lack of effective means to enforce a ceasefire 
on the ground remain serious obstacles. Despite serious impediments, the talks represent 
the most serious diplomatic initiative so far to resolve the conflict. Emphasis on the need 
for a political settlement is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s longstanding position, 
specifically that there is no military solution to the conflict and that it is only through an 
inclusive Syrian dialogue that a peaceful transition can be attained.    
</p>
<p><b>  Humanitarian context 
</b></p>
<p>9. Nearly nine million people, more than a third of the population, have fled their 
homes since March 2011. Of these, over 2.4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries, 
stretching hosting communities to their limits. One-fifth of Lebanon&#8217;s population are Syrian 
refugees. In Jordan, Zaatari camp has become one of the country&#8217;s largest &#8220;cities&#8221;. 
Thousands of Syrians are also trying to cross from Egypt or Libya to Italy. Hundreds have 
perished at sea.  
</p>
<p>10. An estimated 6.5 million Syrians are internally displaced. Of concern is the situation 
of approximately 250,000 persons who remain trapped. A third round of vaccinations in 
response to a polio outbreak was carried out in January 2014, reaching more than two 
million children. The provision of assistance is, however, increasingly manipulated by all 
sides, in breach of the principle of non-discrimination. Humanitarian actors continue to 
work in dangerous conditions across the country. </p>


<p>11. Economic sanctions imposed by some Member States adversely affect the 
socioeconomic situation. The Syrian Pound has been devalued by over 50 per cent since the 
outbreak of the crisis. Prices for basic items have risen sharply. Many families are living in 
abandoned buildings, schools or in makeshift shelters, without sufficient food, water or 
medicine. Health and sanitation services have deteriorated, leading to the spread of 
communicable diseases.  
</p>
<p>12. The second International Pledging Conference for Syria was held in Kuwait City on 
15 January 2014. Donors are encouraged to fulfil the $2.4 billion (of the $6.5 billion 
appeal) pledges to help UN agencies and partners provide aid to Syrians affected by the 
conflict.  
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Specific mandate on massacres 
</b>1. The Commission continued to carry out its special mandate to investigate all 
massacres.a The Commission has not been granted access to conduct investigations on the 
territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. This has severely hampered its efforts to establish the 
circumstances of a number of alleged massacres to its evidentiary standard. In many parts 
of Syria, communication lines, including phone and internet, have been restricted or cut. In 
the incidents described, the intentional mass killing and identity of the perpetrator were 
confirmed to the commission&#8217;s evidentiary standards.

</b>2. On 6 June 2013, Government forces and armed men in plain clothes executed five 
civilians, including a four-year-old girl during an incursion into a private house in Qarfah 
village. Government forces raided the house after arresting and killing a male member of 
the family at a military position in Izraa, on the suspicion that he was a member of a non-
State armed group.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Zarra, Tal-Kalkh area, Homs, 15 July 2013   
</b>3. On 15 July 2013, seven members of a local Reconciliation Committee in the village 
of Al-Zarra were shot dead by local pro-Government Popular Committee members from a 
neighbouring Alawite village. The victims were unarmed civilians. Among them were two 
retired Syrian army officers and a former mayor of a village in the area.   
</p>
<p>4. The Reconciliation Committee members were killed as they were accompanying 
unarmed rebels on their way to the State police station in Talkalakh, in order to facilitate 
their surrender. Their convoy was ambushed near an army checkpoint and attacked by 
Popular Committee members from a neighbouring village. Neither the Reconciliation 
Committee members nor those being escorted were carrying arms.    
</p>
<p><b>Karnaz, Hama, 26 September 2013 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 26 September, eight members of a family were killed in their home by 
Government forces and pro-Government militia. The massacre occurred as Government 
forces raided the house in order to confiscate agricultural goods, on the suspicion that they 
were being used to feed armed opposition fighters. When the mother in the family refused 
to hand over the foodstuffs, Government forces killed the woman and seven family 
members.

<p>6. On 5 March 2013, the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade executed nine members of the 
Syrian armed forces who had been captured and were hors de combat. The troops were 
detained during an attack on a military position in Jamlah village. The captured soldiers 
were subsequently executed by gunfire.  
</p>
<p><b>Khan Al-Assal, Aleppo, 22-23 July 2013 
</b>7. On 22 and 23 July NSAGs captured and executed more than 50 government soldiers 
and a number of civilians during an attack on the town of Khan al-Assal, outside Aleppo. 
Video material collected online indicates that the detainees were executed by gunfire after 
their capture by members of the Ansar al-Khilafa Brigade. 
</p>
<p><b>Al Hiffa region,  Latakia, 4-5 August 2013 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the first week of August 2013, more than 100 civilians were killed during a 
military operation conducted by non-State armed groups. The killings occurred in the 
context of a military attack that started on 4 August 2013, in which a number of non-State 
armed groups participated. The operation targeted a cluster of Alawite villages in Al Hiffa, 
and was referred to by some groups as Operation Liberation of the Coast, or Campaign of 
the Descendants of Aisha the Mother of Believers by other groups. The main participating 
non-State armed groups in the operation were Jabhat Al-Nusra, Suqor Al-&#8216;Iz, Ahrar Al-
Sham, Liwa' Al-Mouhajireen and Harakat Sham Al-Islam, as well as Soqoor Al Sahel 
Brigade and Western Central Front of SMC. Small local groups from local Sunni villages 
also participated.   
</p>
<p>9.  Non-State armed groups first attacked a military position on a hilltop around 500 
meters from the villages. The position was equipped with tank, rocket launcher and other 
heavy weaponry, and had been used to fire artillery on the opposition held town of Salma 
and other areas. After capturing this and other military positions in the area, the fighters 
moved to attack the nearby villages, including Inbatah, Al-Hamboushiyah and Blouta, in 
some places engaging Syrian forces in combat, but also firing indiscriminately at civilians 
and civilian houses. Civilians were killed during this assault, while others were killed while 
escaping.  
</p>
<p>10. The victims included men, women and children. During the attack, armed non-State 
groups also abducted an estimated 200 women and children. Their whereabouts remain 
unknown. The discovery of mass graves was reported after Government forces regained 
control of the villages around 16 August 2013.  Victims were killed by gunshot or by sharp 
objects. Several bodies were decapitated, burned or otherwise mutilated.   
</p><p>11. Statements from participating commanders as well as material available online 
strongly suggest that this specific operation received a financial contribution of 400,000 
Euros from an identified individual. A second person of unknown nationality contributed 
150,000 Euros to the operation.  
</p>
<p><b>Al-Madmouma, Idlib, 26 August 2013 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 26 August 2013, several members of a non-State armed group affiliated to Ahrar 
Al-Sham, attacked the village of Al-Madmouma, near Ma'aret Al-Nu'man. During the 
night, armed men entered a house and killed 16 civilians, including six children, three 
women and two elderly men. The killings occurred in the context of disputes between the 
group and a tribe present in the area.  
</p>
<p><b>Maksar Al-Husan, Homs, 10 September 2013 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 10 September 2013, 18 civilians were killed in Maksar Al-Husan in the context 
of a military campaign against a group of three Alawite villages nearby. Non-State armed 
groups affiliated with Jabhat Al-Nusra and Ahrar Al-Sham Movement conducted the 
assault. Victims included several elderly women and men, as well as children. </p>


<p><b>Deir Attiya, Damascus, 20 November 2013

<p>14. Nine medical staff at Basil State Hospital in Qalamoun were taken hostage and 
killed by members of Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) and Al-Khadra Battalion. 
The killings and the attack on the hospital occurred in the context of an assault against 
several locations and positions in Deir Attiya city. Government sources reported to have 
retrieved the bodies of the victims after Government forces regained control of the hospital 
on 13 November 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>Sadad, Homs countryside, 21-28 October 2013

<p>15. On 21 October 2013, multiple non-state armed groups, including Al-Islam Shield 
battalions affiliated to Maghawir Forces and Jabhat Al-Nusra launched an attack on 
Government forces based in the Christian town of Sadad. A number of civilians were killed 
during the ensuing clashes. The perpetrators of the killings have not been established in 
each incident.  
</p>
<p>16. Two elderly civilians were shot and killed by members of a non-State armed group. 
Members of the police force were also killed. Four elderly women were reportedly found 
shot dead in an area controlled by the armed groups. All killings took place in close 
quarters.  
</p>
<p><b>  Unknown perpetrator 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sadad, Homs countryside, October 2013

<p>17. On 21 October 2013, multiple non-state armed groups launched an attack on 
Government forces based in the Christian town of Sadad. On 28 October, Syrian 
Government forces regained full control of Sadad. An entire family, a woman, her two 
young children, two elderly parents and her mother in law, were later found dead in a well. 
One of the victims was handcuffed with his arms behind his back and had been gagged with 
a cloth. All six civilians had been shot in the head. The area in which the victims were 
found dead had been under the control of the Government. Non-state armed groups had 
been positioned in a school near the family&#8217;s home.

<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Without a trace: enforced disappearances in Syria   
</b></p>
<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Women, standing outside detention centres and holding photographs of their 
disappeared male relatives, have become an enduring image of suffering in Syria. It is an 
image which speaks to the essence of the violation of enforced disappearance: the taking of 
a loved one, the desperate search for information through official and unofficial channels, 
and the torment of those left behind. Those who wait are often the only visible trace of the 
violation. 
</p>
<p>2. An enforced disappearance is an arrest, detention or abduction, followed by a refusal 
to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by the concealment of the fate or whereabouts 
of the disappeared. Cases of enforced disappearances were first documented by the 
Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic during the pro-democracy protests in 
March 2011. As the unrest devolved into an armed conflict, the investigation covered 
practices related to enforced disappearances perpetrated by all parties to the conflict. 
Investigations uncovered a consistent country-wide pattern in which people &#8211; mainly adult 
males &#8211; have been seized by the Syrian security and armed forces, as well as by pro-
Government militias, during mass arrests, house searches, at checkpoints and in hospitals. 
In some instances, the disappearances appeared to have a punitive element, targeting family 
members of defectors, activists, fighters as well as those believed to be providing medical 
care to the opposition.  
</p>
<p>3. Over the last year, specific anti-Government armed groups have begun to abduct 
certain categories of civilians and hold them hostage. Persons perceived to be supporting 
the Government, human rights defenders, journalists, activists, humanitarian workers, and 
religious leaders have been seized by various armed groups and held under the threat of 
death until their release was negotiated for ransom or a prisoner exchange. Hostage-taking 
is a war crime, characterized by coercion and the infliction of a threat until the demands of 
the captor are met.   
</p>
<p>4. In contrast, enforced disappearance &#8211;the subject of this paper&#8211; is a denial of the very 
existence of its victims, placing them outside the protection of the law. Authorities across 
Syria have refused to provide information about the fate or whereabouts of disappeared. In 
some instances, there appeared to be a policy of not providing such information to families. 
Many of those interviewed were too frightened of reprisals to make official inquiries. In 
some cases, relatives who approached the security services were themselves arrested. The 
Government has perpetuated a system of arrests and incommunicado detention that is 
conducive to enforced disappearances. There is also evidence that some anti-Government 
armed groups have adopted practices that could be considered tantamount to enforced 
disappearances. This paper charts the major trends and patterns of this phenomenon in 
Syria from March 2011 to November 2013 and draws from numerous first-hand interviews 
conducted by the Commission over this period. The Commission regrets that it was not able 
to access the country. This limited its ability to investigate inside Syria, especially cases of 
anti-Government armed group abuses. </p>


<p>5. The practice of forcibly disappearing persons is prohibited under customary 
international humanitarian law, binding all parties to the conflict in Syria. The definition of 
an enforced disappearance is set out in the United Nations Declaration for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which crystalises custom. Under 
international human rights law, an act of enforced disappearance is committed by agents of 
the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or 
acquiescence of the State, thus resulting in a human rights violation. In the context of 
international humanitarian law, this requirement must be interpreted to include agents of 
non-State actors, in order for this prohibition to retain significance in situations of non-
international armed conflict such as Syria.  
</p>
<p>6. Under international human rights law, the prohibition of enforced disappearances is 
a non-derogable State responsibility. No legitimate aim or exceptional circumstances may 
be invoked to justify the practice of enforced disappearance. When perpetrated as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population, with the intent of removing a 
person from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time and pursuant to or in 
furtherance of a State or organizational policy, enforced disappearances can amount to a 
crime against humanity incurring individual criminal responsibility. Enforced 
disappearances are continuing human rights violations and crimes, persisting for many 
years after the initial deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>7. The Criminal Code of the Syrian Arab Republic does not criminalise enforced 
disappearances as an autonomous crime. Any act of enforced disappearance violates a 
number of fundamental rights enshrined in the 2012 Syrian Constitution, the Arab Charter 
on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
Syria is party. These rights include the right to liberty and security of persons, the right not 
to be arbitrarily detained, the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, the right to a fair trial and the right of all persons 
deprived of their liberty to be treated with humanity and with the inherent dignity of the 
human person. Enforced disappearances also violate and imperil the right to life. 
</p>
<p>8. Enforced disappearance, by definition, requires an absence of information about the 
fate or whereabouts of a loved one. Investigating this violation presents unique challenges 
as physical evidence is elusive or entirely absent. It can be years before the fate of the 
disappeared person comes to light, if ever. The truth regarding the fate of the many 
disappeared in Syria and the extent of the phenomenon of enforced disappearance will 
likely only fully be grasped in the aftermath of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>9. The victims of this violation number far beyond the individuals disappeared. The 
families and loved ones of those disappeared endure a mental anguish that amounts to a 
further violation of their human rights. It is a continuous violation that remains unabated 
until the fate of the disappeared is uncovered. To forcibly disappear a person is to negate 
their being and deny their relatives&#8217; right to know the truth. 
</p>
<p><b>II. The deprivation of liberty: a targeted campaign 
</b></p>
<p>10. Enforced disappearances have been carried out since the beginning of the uprising in 
Syria. Most disappearances were perpetrated by intelligence and security officers, as well 
as by the Syrian army, sometimes in conjunction with pro-government militias acting on 
behalf of the Government. In all the cases documented, the perpetrators operated with 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>11. The violation of enforced disappearance is often a gateway to the commission of 
other offences, most particularly torture. Survivors of enforced disappearances consistently </p>


<p>described being subjected to torture during their detention. In all the instances documented, 
the victims were denied their fundamental right to due process. They were deprived of 
contact with the outside world, including close relatives. No legal assistance was provided. 
They were placed outside the law, at the mercy of their captors.  
</p>
<p><b>A.   Silencing the opposition 
</b></p>
<p>12. Consistent accounts indicate that in the early days of Syria&#8217;s unrest, enforced 
disappearances were employed by the Government to silence the opposition and spread fear 
amongst relatives and friends of demonstrators, activists and bloggers.  
</p>
<p>13. Military commanders undertook a coordinated policy together with intelligence 
agencies to target civilian protesters through mass arrests and enforced disappearances in 
2011 and early 2012. A former officer of an army brigade operating in Al-Waer in Homs 
stated that during the army operations in Bab Amr in January 2012, soldiers attacked 
protesters in the streets while intelligence officers systematically arrested all those who 
were not killed. Following the attacks against demonstrators, the same brigade carried out 
house raids, jointly with intelligence officers, indiscriminately arresting more individuals. 
Their families were never informed of their whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>14. One survivor, arrested by the Air Force Intelligence in March 2011 after taking part 
in a demonstration, was transported to the Mezzeh Airport Prison, where he was 
interrogated and tortured. Subsequently, he was transferred to the premises of the Air Force 
Intelligence, where a high-ranking officer openly threatened to kill him should he 
participate in further demonstrations. Throughout his ordeal and despite repeated attempts 
to locate him, his family was never notified of his arrest, detention and whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>15. Another interviewee who, together with his cousin, participated in protests in Jisr El 
Shoughour, Idlib in June 2011, reported that security forces raided his cousin&#8217;s house 
shortly after the demonstration, and abducted him from his bed. His cousin was taken to an 
unknown location and his whereabouts were never disclosed. The interviewee said &#8220;on 
more than one night, my daughter woke up after she heard her mother crying. Every night, 
we thought that the security services were coming to get us&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. Consistent testimonies reveal a pattern; the vast majority of those disappeared in 
2011 and early 2012 were young men. A man, who defected from the political security 
branch of Aleppo in March 2012, reported that officers received orders to arrest every 
young male and adolescent between 16 and 40 years old that participated in 
demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>17. The available accounts indicate a policy targeting civilians executed through various 
organs of the Syrian Government, aimed at stifling the protest movement.  Enforced 
disappearances were employed to instil fear, oppress and assert control over persons taking 
part in demonstrations against the Government and were undertaken during coordinated 
attacks on the civilian population. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Enforced disappearance as reprisals and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>18. In certain cases, enforced disappearances had a strong punitive element, targeting 
those perceived to be either supportive of the opposition or insufficiently loyal to the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>19. Several interviewees indicated that soldiers who refused to execute orders or were 
suspected of harbouring opposition sympathies were subjected to reprisals, including 
disappearance. A former army conscript, who operated in the town of Tseel in Dara&#8217;a in </p>


<p>November 2011, revealed that four of his fellow soldiers were arrested by their superiors 
after they refused to open fire on a group of peaceful demonstrators. The interviewee never 
saw them again, inferring that insubordination was punished by disappearance.  
</p>
<p>20. Relatives of those individuals wanted by the Syrian security apparatus have also 
been victims of enforced disappearances. A young man, who defected from the Republican 
Guard in June 2011, explained how his superiors came to his village in Dara&#8217;a, three weeks 
after his defection. They arrested his younger cousin, in an apparent reprisal. His cousin 
was taken to an unknown location and his fate never uncovered. Another protester reported 
that after he participated in several peaceful demonstrations in Dael, Dara&#8217;a, in March 
2011, agents of the Political Security raided his house and forcibly disappeared one of his 
brothers. He stated plainly, &#8220;my brother was probably detained because of me&#8221;. He 
believed that his brother&#8217;s abduction was aimed at instilling fear in the relatives of 
protesters to deter them from participating in demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>21. Doctors were disappeared as punishment for their perceived support of anti-
Government armed groups. An employee of Zarzor hospital in an anti-Government armed 
group-held part of Aleppo testified about a series of disappearances targeting medical 
personnel carried out by the Aleppo Air Force Intelligence between June and December 
</p><p>2012. These disappearances appeared to be aimed at punishing doctors who provided 
medical services in opposition areas, and deterring others who would consider doing the 
same. 
</p>
<p><b>C. A tactic of war 
</b></p>
<p>22. As the unrest devolved into a full-blown conflict, those affiliated or perceived to be 
affiliated with anti-Government armed groups became targets for disappearance. The initial 
arrests and abductions most often took place during Government searches of restive areas 
or at the checkpoints encircling those localities.  
</p>
<p>23. Bab Amr was the scene of mass arrests and disappearances during ground attacks by 
Government forces between February and May 2013. In March 2013, clashes between the 
Free Syrian Army and the national army broke out in the Homs city neighbourhood of Bab 
Amr. Aided by pro-Government militias, the army raided Bab Amr and abducted several 
residents whose location and fate remain unknown. In May 2013, campaigns of arrest took 
place in Hama, many of those taken remain disappeared. 
</p>
<p>24. Men were also abducted at checkpoints manned by Government-affiliated militias 
and popular committees. One eyewitness described how his neighbours were arrested at a 
checkpoint controlled by what he believed to be <i>shabbiha</i>, in Al Ghantoo, Homs, on 4 April 
2013. Men wearing civilian clothing stopped their car and arrested a man. He was 
subsequently taken to an unknown location. His family does not know where to look for 
him. On 8 June 2013, a family of internally displaced persons was trying to make their way 
into Jordan when military forces positioned in the Al-Waer neighbourhood of Homs 
stopped their car at a checkpoint. The husband was arrested and taken to an unknown 
location, while his wife and children were ordered to return to their hometown, despite on-
going violence. He has not been seen or heard from since.  
</p>
<p>25. As noted in &#8220;Assault on medical care in Syria&#8221; (A/HRC/24/CRP.2), wounded 
civilians perceived to be affiliated with the opposition are being disappeared from hospitals. 
This alarming phenomenon has significantly increased over the past months. An 
interviewee from Nabak, Dara&#8217;a governorate, explained that due to a lack of medical 
facilities in FSA-controlled areas, injured civilians were forced to go to governmental 
hospitals, where many disappeared between April and May 2013.  </p>


<p><b>   Without a trace 
</b></p>
<p>26. Defectors who participated in mass arrests as well as survivors revealed that in the 
majority of cases, the officers in charge of the initial arrest took the abductees to the 
premises of their respective security or military branches. Despite the organised nature of 
the arrests and detentions, authorities often failed to record the personal details of detainees, 
including those who died in detention, making it difficult to trace them and inform their 
families. The family of a person arrested in Idlib in September 2011 attempted to determine 
his whereabouts. The interviewee described how &#8220;Wherever they searched, the authorities 
said that his name was not recorded&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. A defector told of a mass arrest in Jisr Al Shoughour, Idlib in June 2011, where 
those detained were taken to a school that was used as an ad hoc detention facility. There, 
detainees were subjected to painful and humiliating physical treatment. Their names were 
never registered rendering any attempts to determine their whereabouts futile. In late 
August 2011, officers of the Military Security in Latakia arrested four family members of 
an interviewee and took them to an unknown location. Three weeks later, a young man who 
was arrested together with the interviewee&#8217;s cousins informed him that his relatives had 
been transferred to the military hospital of Latakia. Upon inquiry, it was discovered that 
their names never appeared in the hospital&#8217;s registry. 
</p>
<p><b>   Anti-Government armed groups 
</b>28. In 2013, specific anti-Government armed groups adopted a practice of hostage-
taking, targeting civilians perceived to be supporting the Government, human rights 
defenders, journalists and religious leaders. The emergence of a pattern of abductions and 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty has characterized the ever-growing presence of certain 
armed groups, particularly in northern Syria.  
</p>
<p>29. The fear of such kidnappings and hostage-takings has gripped the civilian 
populations living under the control of certain armed groups. The perpetrators seize, detain 
and threaten to kill their victims in order to coerce a third party &#8211; whether the families of 
the kidnapped, their communities or the Syrian authorities &#8211; to fulfill their conditions for 
the release of the hostage. Such acts, motivated by material gain and extortion, intimidate 
and coerce the families of the kidnapped and their communities. 
</p>
<p>30. Hostages are taken with the intent to instrumentalise their liberty and security for 
ransom or prisoner exchange. Such offenses leave families in a state of uncertainty 
regarding the whereabouts of their relatives, but do not amount to enforced disappearances 
as the fate of the victims is not denied or concealed. In the current context in Syria, such 
conduct may amount to war crimes.  
</p>
<p>31. Information collected in recent months indicates that opposition armed groups such 
as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al Sham (ISIS) have taken control of territory in northern 
Syria and begun to adopt practices, such as incommunicado detention, that may lead to 
disappearances. In one incident, armed men believed to be members of ISIS were reported 
to have abducted two civilians on grounds of non-adherence to their interpretation of 
Islamic dress code. The group later denied holding them in captivity. The whereabouts of 
the detainees remain unknown.  </p>


<p><b>III.  Not knowing: the enduring agony of Syrian families 
</b>32. The victims of enforced disappearance are not only those who have been 
disappeared. Enforced disappearances wreak havoc on families, tearing the social fabric of 
entire communities. Perpetrators intentionally create a paralysing uncertainty that leaves 
families hanging between hope and despair. Not knowing whether their loved ones are dead 
and, if so, what has happened to their bodies, they can neither mourn nor adjust to their 
loss.  
</p>
<p><b> A. A climate of fear 
</b></p>
<p>33. Enforced disappearances are characterised by situations where family members fear 
retaliation if they question the authority of the disappeared person&#8217;s captors. Where the 
State maintains a climate in which family members are too intimidated to inquire about 
detentions by security services, this is tantamount to a refusal or a denial of the person&#8217;s 
fate. 
</p>
<p>34. In Syria, silence and fear shroud enforced disappearances. In several cases, 
individuals who reported a disappearance were themselves detained. The mother of two 
young men who disappeared in Idlib in June 2011 reported that her eldest son was arrested 
when he inquired at the Idlib Military Security Branch about the whereabouts of his 
brothers. He never returned. One interviewee further reported that while detained in Homs 
prison in 2012, she met a 60 year-old woman who had been arrested after she went to the 
Homs Security Branch to inquire about the fate of her disappeared son. 
</p>
<p>35. The result of such a climate of fear is that only a fraction of the number of 
disappearances is officially reported because relatives of those disappeared fear being 
targeted and punished by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>36. In the overwhelming majority of cases, when asked whether they inquired about the 
disappearance of their relatives, interviewees reported that they could not approach the 
authorities because of a well-founded fear of reprisal. Families revealed that attempts to 
locate their relatives would expose them to a fate similar to their loved ones and may 
subject the disappeared to greater danger. A young man whose brother disappeared in 
December 2012 in Homs explained, &#8220;Families constantly pray for their relatives, but will 
not risk sending another family member to detention.&#8221; Another interviewee, whose son was 
arrested during a house search by Military Security officers in late October 2012 in 
Damascus, stated that he did not go to the Military Security branch himself, as he feared 
that by requesting information, he would also be arrested. 
</p>
<p>37. Reporting on the arrest of his cousin by pro-Government militias and Air Force 
Intelligence officers in December 2012 in Nabul, Aleppo, an interviewee explained, &#8220;If you 
go to the branch to ask about detainees, they will interrogate you. If you are a man, you will 
be tortured and detained too. If you are a woman, they will harm you and might detain you 
instead.&#8221;   
</p>
<p><b>B.       A policy of concealment 
</b></p>
<p>38. Syrian families are in desperate need of official acknowledgment of what has 
happened to their relatives. An indication of this desperation are the 30 requests seeking 
official information from the Government, filed by Syrian families to the United Nations 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, over the course of 2012 
(A/HRC/22/45).  </p>


<p>39. Those who dared to approach the authorities to inquire about a loved one faced a 
systematic refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared or to even 
acknowledge the deprivation of liberty. One survivor, who was arrested by pro-Government 
militias and Air Force Military Security officers in Latakia in July 2012, recalled the shock 
of his family upon his release, &#8220;No one informed my family about my detention; no one 
would dare ask the Air Force Military Security about their relatives. If you asked, no one 
would tell you.&#8221; A relative of a man arrested in Naime, Dara&#8217;a, in 2011 stated, &#8220;His mother 
searched everywhere, but received no information from anyone&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>40. The brother of a former Syrian Air Defence Force officer reported that after he 
decided to defect, in December 2011, his brother called his family expressing serious fears 
of being arrested or punished. This phone call was the last anyone heard of him. The 
interviewee explained that his family repeatedly approached all Syrian security services, 
including the Air Force Intelligence, the police, the army, and the state security services. He 
further described how they had to use intermediaries to approach the Air Force Intelligence, 
whose officers were instructed to fire upon anyone who came within 300 metres of their 
building. Despite the measures taken by the interviewee and his family, each security 
apparatus denied any knowledge of the arrest, detention or whereabouts of his brother.  
</p>
<p>41. A doctor who survived a disappearance in 2011 explained that after months of 
searching, his family managed to locate his place of detention. However, when they directly 
inquired to the authorities administering the detention facility, the authorities denied that 
their relative was held there.  
</p>
<p>42. In a revealing account, a man who defected from the Hama Air Force Intelligence at 
the end of 2012, described orders he received not to provide information about the 
whereabouts of detainees or to speak to their relatives. He added that cameras were placed 
at the gates of the Air Force Intelligence premises, to monitor the officers and deter them 
from speaking to families inquiring about their relatives. 
</p>
<p>43. In some instances, the families only discover the fate of the disappeared when their 
bodies are recovered or in a minority of cases, are returned to them. However, several 
accounts indicate that Government forces take deliberate steps to conceal the cause and 
circumstances of the death, violating the families&#8217; right to truth. Interviewees who had lost 
families members consistently described how their bodies were returned by Government 
authorities without explanation. In April 2011, a child was arrested in Dara&#8217;a, and taken to 
an Air Force Intelligence facility in Damascus. His family searched for their son in 
hospitals to no avail, fearing that he had been detained or killed. His body, bearing 
extensive signs of torture, was returned to his family in June 2011. No information was 
provided about the grounds for his detention or the circumstances of his death. The father 
of a young activist, arrested by security forces in late July 2012 in Latakia and whose 
whereabouts were unknown, received a phone call eleven days after his son&#8217;s 
disappearance. He was asked to go to Damascus to recover the body of his son, who, he 
was told, had been killed in a car accident. The body bore traces of severe torture.   
</p>
<p><b>C. The anguish 
</b></p>
<p>44. The heart of the anguish suffered by families lies in the authorities&#8217; systematic 
refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or to disclose any information about the 
relatives. Across Syria, parents, siblings, husbands, wives, children and friends wait 
anxiously to know the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones. Not knowing whether the 
disappeared is still alive, and if so in what state of health and under which conditions, 
causes a level of grief impossible to convey. The secrecy surrounding the fate of the 
disappeared has the effect of intimidating and punishing families by leaving them in a state </p>


<p>of uncertainty and mental distress. This mental anguish may rise to the level of torture or 
inhuman treatment and makes entire families the victims of enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>45. The husband of a woman abducted by Military Intelligence officers in Hama in 
December 2011 and whose whereabouts were never disclosed, explained how traumatized 
his two-year old daughter has been since, &#8220;She cries when she sees a military uniform&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>46. Consistent accounts have revealed that the principal means to obtain information is 
when a fellow detainee is released. A man held for over a year in the Military Police 
Branch of Hama described, in a harrowing account, how immediately after his release in 
May 2013, he was assailed by dozens of women thrusting photographs of their husbands, 
sons and fathers towards him. Another interviewee, released after a court hearing in 
Damascus in August 2013, was confronted with hundreds of people waiting outside the 
court, begging for news of their loved ones, in the hope that he had seen them in detention.  
</p>
<p>47. The desperation of families has left them vulnerable to extortion. Some pay bribes to 
those who, often falsely, claim they can provide information. One interviewee reported that 
his cousin, who had participated in peaceful demonstrations in Latakia, was arrested mid-
2011 by Government security forces and taken to an unknown location. His family was too 
frightened to approach the forces responsible for his arrest. Instead they paid a bribe to a 
person who claimed to be connected to the security forces. This middleman informed the 
family that the disappeared was detained in the Air Force Intelligence detention centre. 
Shortly afterwards, the contact revealed, for more money, that he had been killed.  
</p>
<p>48. Another interviewee reported that his cousin was arrested by security officers on his 
way to Damascus in September 2013 and taken to an unknown location. His family learned 
of his arrest from a taxi driver who witnessed it. The disappeared&#8217;s father repeatedly 
inquired about the fate and whereabouts of his son, to no avail. Only after he bribed one of 
his contacts was he able to learn that security officers belonging to the 4th Army Division 
had arrested his son for having published pro-opposition messages on a social media 
webpage. He was, however, unable to obtain any information about his son&#8217;s location or 
state of health. The interviewee insisted that less privileged families are abandoned to their 
grief, saying that it was only because his uncle &#8220;had money and contacts&#8221; that he was able 
to obtain some information.  
</p>
<p>49. Besides the grave emotional and psychosocial impact, families also often have to 
cope with the economic consequences of disappearances. The absence of the main 
breadwinner creates financial difficulties that add to the extreme vulnerability of families. 
Women and children face specific hardships. The uncertainty created by the disappearance 
of their husbands or fathers has social and legal consequences, including on the status of 
marriage, right to inheritance and social welfare, and the management of the property of the 
disappeared person. Children of disappeared experience acute suffering with the loss of a 
parent. One young woman interviewed about the disappearance of her husband stated &#8220;I do 
not know how to live and care for my young children without their father&#8221;.    
</p>
<p>50. Syrian authorities created a climate of intimidation such that families did not dare 
inquire about their loved ones or file any formal complaints, and systematically denied the 
disappearance or refused to disclose any information. They also violated their duty to duly 
investigate enforced disappearances. The Government has further violated families&#8217; non-
derogable right to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the enforced 
disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the disappeared 
person. </p>


<p><b>IV.  Conclusions and Recommendations  
</b>51. The accounts presented in this paper only hint at the scope of the crisis of enforced 
disappearance in Syria and the state of fear in which ordinary citizens live.  
</p>
<p>52. Enforced disappearances are perpetrated as part of a widespread campaign of terror 
against the civilian population. Government forces have engaged in enforced disappearance 
in violation of their international legal obligations. Given the geographic spread of the 
documented cases and the consistent manner in which abductions and arrests are carried 
out, there are reasonable grounds to believe that enforced disappearances were committed 
by Government forces, as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian 
population, and therefore amount to a crime against humanity.  
</p>
<p>53. The direct victims of enforced disappearances were systematically denied their 
fundamental human rights, more particularly their rights not to be arbitrarily detained, not 
to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as 
well as their rights to liberty and security, to be recognized as a person before the law and 
to be treated with humanity and with the inherent dignity of the human person.  
</p>
<p>54. By failing to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty, the Government has violated 
the family&#8217;s right to the truth. The ensuing mental anguish suffered may breach family 
members&#8217; rights not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment. Where family members have been arrested when they sought to make 
inquiries from the authorities, their rights to liberty and security have also been violated. 
</p>
<p>55. The absence of an autonomous definition of enforced disappearance in the Syrian 
Criminal Code and the lack of an official register or bureau that manages records of 
detainees and responds to inquiries made by relatives, contributes to a system that is 
conducive to enforced disappearances. Moreover, the persistent failure to notify the 
families of the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones coupled with the systematic practice 
of withholding information, reprisals, bribery or intimidation in response to the search for 
information by relatives, and the absence of genuine investigations into allegations of 
disappearances, constitute the many factors that create an environment of impunity in Syria. 
Such a climate not only contributes to the perpetuation of the phenomenon of enforced 
disappearance, but is also a major obstacle to the elucidation of its true extent.  
</p><p>56. International human rights law imposes on Syria the obligation to take all 
appropriate measures to investigate enforced disappearances and to bring those responsible 
to justice. 
57. Disappearances are losses that cannot be mourned. They bear consequences on the 
individuals, their families and the community as a whole and will remain among Syria&#8217;s 
deepest wounds. The damage inflicted upon the victims, including their relatives, is 
permanent and irreparable. Reconciliation cannot happen until each individual case of 
enforced disappearance is clarified and the perpetrators brought to justice. No statute of 
limitations applies to this violation. Investigating each case of enforced disappearance will 
remain the responsibility of the Syrian state regardless of the Government in power.  
</p>
<p><b>  The Commission recommends that the Government of Syria: 
</b></p>
<p>i. Inform families of the whereabouts of all persons in their custody; 
ii. Ensure that all those detained are registered, and afforded legal review of the 
</p>
<p>grounds of their detention; 
iii. When a disappeared person is found dead, return the remains to the family and 
</p>
<p>inform them of the circumstances of the death; </p>


<p>iv. Ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and recognise the competence of the Committee 
under Articles 31 and 32 of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>v. Ensure that all cases of enforced disappearance as well as acts tantamount to 
enforced disappearances are duly investigated, that those responsible are 
prosecuted, and, where appropriate, punished; 
</p>
<p>vi. Ensure that military commanders and civilian superiors enforce the prohibition 
of enforced disappearances within their ranks and among their subordinates; 
</p>
<p>vii. Ensure that those involved in the search for victims of enforced disappearance, 
notably the relatives, have full and unimpeded access to justice and are 
protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. To that effect, effective 
victim and witness protection measures, offering guarantees of safety for those 
who wish to lodge a complaint or testify, should be established; 
</p>
<p>viii. Survivors and families of disappeared should also be granted reparations that 
include rehabilitation, satisfaction, compensation and, in particular, 
psychological and social support for the relatives; 
</p>
<p>ix. To the extent possible, special social and financial support should be provided 
to dependent women and children. 
</p>
<p><b>  The Commission recommends that anti-Government armed groups: 
</b></p>
<p>i. Ensure that military commanders enforce the prohibition of enforced 
disappearances; 
</p>
<p>ii. Take all feasible measures to account for persons reported disappeared as a 
result of the armed conflict; 
</p>
<p>iii. Provide the family members of disappeared with any information concerning 
their fate and whereabouts;  
</p>
<p>iv. Register and hold all detainees in a recognized place of detention; 
v. Promptly inform the detainees of the reasons for their detention; 
</p>
<p>vi. Ensure that any person deprived of liberty has contact with the exterior, 
including legal assistance.   
</p>
<p><b>  The Commission recommends that all parties to the conflict: 
</b></p>
<p>i. Maintain an updated register of all persons deprived of liberty; 
ii. Set up a process to centralize information on persons deprived of liberty, to 
</p>
<p>transmit such information to their next of kin directly or through a neutral 
intermediary, and to respond to inquiries about the whereabouts of disappeared 
persons; 
</p>
<p>iii. Ensure that any person deprived of liberty is held in a recognized place of 
detention and has the opportunity to challenge his or her detention before an 
independent and impartial body.

<p><b>Annex V 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Government detention centres     
</b>1. The majority of detainees interviewed by the Commission stated that they had been 
tortured or ill-treated during their interrogation. Methods of torture documented by the 
Commission were consistent across the country. They included mock executions; electric 
shocks applied to sensitive parts of the body, including genitals; cigarettes burns; and 
beating with electric cables, whips, metal and wooden sticks and rifle butts. There were 
multiple reports of detainees being beaten about the head and on the soles of the feet. The 
Commission also received reports of detainees being placed into prolonged stress positions 
(shabeh) and the use of vehicle tires to hold hands and feet in uncomfortable positions 
(dulab) while beatings were administered. In many of the interviews, scars and wounds, 
consistent with their accounts, were still visible.b Detainees were denied medical care, left 
to die of chronic illnesses and untreated wounds and injuries. Children were often detained 
in the same detention facilities as adults and subject to the same levels of torture. As prisons 
have become overcrowded, the detention conditions have become deplorable. Sanitary 
facilities are limited and inadequate, spreading illnesses among detainees. Detainees are not 
accorded adequate food, leading to reports of starvation and malnourishment.  
</p>
<p>2. The list presented below identifies the Government detention facilities in which 
cases of torture have been documented. Others cases of tortures have also been documented 
in other locations controlled by Government forces, such as ad hoc detention places or 
checkpoints, which were not included in this list.

<p><b>Annex VI 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Use of barrel bombs  
</b></p>
<p>1. Barrel bombs, also called explosive barrels, are makeshift explosive devices 
increasingly employed by the Syrian Air Force against opposition strongholds in Syria.  
</p>
<p>2. The use of barrel-bombs by Government forces was first documented in August 
2012 in Homs city and Al-Qusayr in Homs governorate. In September 2012, army 
helicopters dropped barrel bombs on opposition-controlled neighbourhoods of Aleppo city. 
Since then, they have increasingly formed part of the arsenal of Government forces, with 
devastating consequences for civilians and civilian objects. 
</p><p>3. Cheaper than conventional munitions and deliverable by transport helicopters, they 
are made from simple containers packed with explosives, scrap metal, and in many cases 
additional incendiary material. Locally made in different shapes, sizes and composition, 
they lack exact technical specifications available with conventional projectiles, in terms of 
accuracy and lethality. The enhanced anti-aircraft capabilities of non-State armed groups 
have forced Government helicopters to fly at higher altitudes, further reducing their 
accuracy. 
</p>
<p>4. The use of barrel bombs, in this manner, is indiscriminate. In areas where armed 
group fighters were present, Government forces treated clearly separate and distinct 
military objectives located in densely populated areas with high concentrations of civilians, 
as a single military objective. The use of barrel bombs in this context amounts to &#8216;area 
bombardment&#8217;, prohibited under international humanitarian law. Such bombardments 
spread of terror among the civilian population. Some barrel bombs are constructed as 
rudimentary incendiary weapons, causing superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering. 
</p><p>5. Since 15 July 2013, barrel-bombs have been dropped on civilian-inhabited areas in 
Idlib, Hama, Al-Raqqa, Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a and Damascus governorates. Aleppo city and 
Daraya in Damascus countryside suffered intense and highly lethal attacks with barrel-
bombs between November 2013 and January 2014. 
</p>
<p>6. Civilians are killed in the initial blast, in the shrapnel that results and from the 
collapse of buildings in and around the impact site. Video footage of barrel bomb 
explosions and their aftermath show the loss of limbs and deep cuts as a result of shrapnel 
injuries. The impact of the Government&#8217;s campaign of barrel-bombing of civilian-inhabited 
areas extends beyond mass civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>7. The terror that the Government&#8217;s barrel-bombing campaigns generate should not be 
underestimated. Barrel-bombs, particularly when dropped from high altitudes, cannot be 
properly targeted. Nor is it likely that anyone at the impact site would survive the initial 
blast. The Government does not provide early warning of attacks and there is little chance 
of being able to move from the area once a barrel bomb is released from a helicopter 
overhead. Victims of barrel bombs emphasized the extreme fear and mental suffering they 
felt as they came under attack. Survivors and witnesses consistently described that as a 
result of the barrel bombing campaign, much of the civilian population lived in a state of 
terror.  </p>


<p>8. The impact of barrel bombs causes the collapse of buildings around its explosion, 
leaving neighbourhoods in ruins. Where such buildings are residences, this further 
contributes to the mass displacement of civilians inside Syria and over its borders. 
</p>
<p><b>  Idlib governorate 
</b></p>
<p>9. On 14 July, a helicopter released three barrel bombs on Al-Bara market and 
residential areas in Al-Bara. The first barrel hit a truck carrying fuel, causing a massive 
blaze killing the driver and 5 nearby civilians. The bodies were burnt almost beyond 
recognition. Others sustained serious injuries, including a loss of limbs. The other two 
barrels hit residential buildings, destroying them but causing no casualties. 
</p>
<p>10. In the last two weeks of July, Saraqib came under intense shelling and aerial 
bombardment by Government forces. This attack included the heavy use of barrel bombs 
on 18, 19, 20, 27, 28 and 31 July. In the course of this sustained assault, scores of civilians 
were killed and many more injured. As buildings collapsed under the bombardments, 
families were buried in the rubble. In the 31 July attack, four civilians, including women 
and children, were killed when a barrel bomb exploded as it struck their house. 
</p>
<p>11. Throughout August, the Jabal Al-Zawiya region in southern Idlib countryside was 
bombarded by barrel-bombs. In two separate instances in August 2013, army helicopters 
dropped barrel bombs into villages populated by significant numbers of civilians. In the 
first attack, taking place in the second week of August, two children and a woman were 
seriously injured. One of the children lost a limb to shrapnel. In the second attack, which 
took place days later, the bomb hit a residential building. The building was flattened and its 
occupants, a family of 6 children and their parents, were killed. 
</p>
<p>12. On 3 August, shortly before the breaking of the Ramadan fast, a helicopter dropped 
five barrels bombs on civilian houses in Balyoun village. The impact killed a 40-year-old 
woman and injured three others, including a three-year-old boy. Three buildings were 
flattened. Two days later, on 5 August, several barrel bombs were dropped on the market in 
Balyoun, killing 20 people outright and injuring dozens. An unknown number of additional 
civilians were killed when the building collapsed on them due to the force of the blast. A 
large number of houses were destroyed, further fuelling the displacement of residents to 
other areas. 
</p>
<p>13. On 18 August, two barrel bombs were released over Bdama, a town to the south-
west of Jisr Al-Shughour near the Turkish border. The first hit a residential neighbourhood, 
killing four civilians including two boys, aged 13 and 7 years. An unspecified number of 
people were injured and there was significant property damage. The second hit civilian 
homes in a nearby neighbourhood, killing at least 5 and severely injuring 20 people. Further 
casualties resulted from the collapse of houses near the impact site. 
</p>
<p>14. On 25 September, barrel bombs were dropped on Maarat Hurmah from a helicopter 
hovering high overheard. The village lies 13 km south of Ma&#8217;rat Al-Numan. Six people 
were killed, including three women and two children. 
</p>
<p>15. On 8 October, a Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on Bizabur, a village 
just south of Ariha. In the same month, Government forces used barrel bombs on Al-Hobait 
in southern Idlib. In one attack, the bomb landed on a family home, killing a woman, her 
two teenage daughters and two sons. 
</p>
<p>16. On 11 October, the Government launched a barrel bomb attack on Kansafra, a town 
with approximately 30,000 inhabitants, situated 20km west of Maarat Al-Numan. The 
explosion, the shrapnel generated and the collapse of approximately five building caused 
mass civilian casualties. </p>


<p><b>  Hama governorate 
</b></p>
<p>17. Government helicopters, flying at high altitudes, dropped barrel bombs on towns 
and villages inhabited by civilians in Hama governorate. On 9 August, the Government 
targeted Al-Hawwash with barrel-bombs, causing significant civilian death and injuries. On 
14 October, on Eid Al-Adha, Government helicopters launched six aerial strikes, dropping 
barrel bombs on each occasion. Two people were killed, including one child while 20 were 
injured. The next day, helicopters targeted Al-Latamneh with three barrel bombs. One hit a 
house, killing three children from one family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Al-Raqqah governorate 
</b></p>
<p>18. Government helicopters dropped barrels bombs on Al-Raqqa city in July and August 
</p><p>2013. In all instances documented, there were significant civilians casualties, a high 
proportion of which were children.  
</p>
<p>19. On 30 July, shortly before the breaking of the Ramadan fast, a helicopter flew over 
the Al-Raqqa city twice, dropping two barrel bombs in each sortie. The residential areas of 
Ta&#8217;meer and Badow were hit, killing 13 civilians including 7 children and 3 women. 
Twenty people were injured and there was significant damage to houses.  
</p><p>20. On 2 August 2013, a helicopter dropped two barrel bombs in two consecutive raids 
on residential areas. While one hit a vacant park, the other struck a residential building, 
killing a woman and her brother. Thirty-two others were injured. 
21. On 10 August, four barrel bombs were dropped on residential areas, again in Al-
Raqqa city, killing 36 people and injuring many more. 
</p>
<p><b>  Aleppo governorate 
</b></p>
<p>22. The campaign of shelling and aerial bombardment of Aleppo governorate has been 
prosecuted with shocking intensity. The Government&#8217;s on-going campaign has made liberal 
use of barrel bombs on Al-Safirah in September and on Aleppo city and the Al-Bab region 
in particular, between November 2013 and January 2014. 
</p>
<p>23. Al-Safirah, a town 25 kilometres east of Aleppo city, is home to a large number of 
internally displaced persons, many of whom live in a camp on the outskirts of the town. In 
early September, Government helicopters released several barrel bombs over Al-Safirah 
and its IDP camp. While rebel fighters were present in the town and numbered among the 
casualties, the majority of those killed were civilians. The shelling and bombardment, 
including with barrel bombs, continued into October. On 20 October, civilians fleeing the 
town were killed in barrel bomb attacks on their vehicles. 
</p>
<p>24. Barrel bombs were dropped by Government helicopters on Aleppo city throughout 
November and December. Attacks have continued into January 2014. Use of barrels bombs 
in Aleppo city was documented as taking place on 23 November, on 9, 16, 17, 20, 24, 28 
December and on 1 January 2014. Across the span of these attacks, several hundred of 
civilians have been killed, many of them children.  
</p>
<p>25. On 23 November, a helicopter targeted Al-Marjeh neighbourhood in Aleppo city 
with three barrel bombs. Twenty-eight people were killed and 25 others were injured. All 
the victims were civilians. Ten civilian homes were also destroyed.  On the same day, 
barrel bombs exploded in a vegetable market in Tariq Al-Bab neighbourhood, killing 25 
civilians, many of them women and children. The blast caused a fire which led to further 
civilian casualties and injuries. </p>


<p>26. On 9 December, a barrel bomb exploded near to a school and a medical point in Al-
Zabedia neighbourhood. At least four people were killed, including a pregnant woman. All 
victims were civilians. 
</p>
<p>27. On 17 December, Government helicopters targeted civilians gathering in a crowded 
market in Al-Maadi neighbourhood. Twenty people were killed, including three women and 
five children. Some survivors lost limbs. 
</p>
<p>28. On 20 December, a barrel bomb was dropped on a family home in Al-Sukkari 
neighbourhood. Five civilians were killed including one woman and two children. At least 
forty were injured including a five-year-old boy. Due to shrapnel injuries to the head, the 
boy now has limited ability to move and speak. Ten residential buildings were destroyed. 
</p>
<p>29. Again on 24 December, multiple barrel bombs struck Al-Sukkari neighbourhood. 
The bombs fell on residential areas and the shopping district. At least 30 people were killed 
and more injured. Twelve residential building collapsed. One bomb hit a gas station, 
causing deaths by burning as well as serious injuries. Another bomb hit a mosque where 
children were receiving religious instruction.  Consequently many children were killed.  
</p>
<p>30. At noon on 28 December, a Government helicopter released multiple barrel bombs 
over Al-Myasser neighbourhood. One of the injured was a 14-year-old boy who received 
shrapnel injuries to the head. He underwent an operation to remove the shrapnel from his 
brain but this proved unsuccessful. Consequently, the boy has lost the ability to speak and 
is partially paralysed. In a separate barrel bomb attack, helicopters dropped barrel bombs on 
a vegetable market, while civilians sought to buy food. Over 25 people were killed. 
</p>
<p>31. On 1 January, a helicopter also dropped barrel bombs on Al-Sukkari neighbourhood. 
The bombs landed in the main shopping area, killing 20 people and injuring many others. 
Commercial premises were destroyed. 
</p>
<p>32. Barrel bomb attacks occurred in Al-Bab on 30 November, 1 December and 12 
January 2014.  
</p>
<p>33. Government forces dropped barrel bombs on other civilian-inhabited towns and 
villages in Aleppo governorate. On 21 November, a helicopter dropped barrel bombs on 
Souran, killing 14 civilians, including women and children. At least one man, a passenger 
in a car, lost his leg in a shrapnel injury. 
</p><p>34. On 23 November, helicopters targeted the industrial zone of Sheikh Najar with 
barrel bombs. Three people &#8211; civilian workers &#8211; were killed. There were an unspecified 
number of injuries as well as significant destruction of property. On the same day, 
helicopters released barrel bombs over Tadef, south of Al-Bab city killing 15 people. 
Children were among the dead. One bomb struck a fuel seller. The ensuing blaze burnt 
people to death and caused serious burns to survivors. 
</p>
<p>35. On 28 November, a Government helicopter dropped barrel bombs over Dawar Qadi 
Askar during the day when people were out shopping. At least 14 people were killed 
including children and one pregnant woman. The barrel bombs caused a residential building 
to collapse and severed the main water supply line. 
</p>
<p>36. On 19 December, a nine-year-old girl lost both of her legs in a barrel bomb attack on 
Hreitan. The girl was playing with some other children on the roof of her apartment block 
when they heard the sounds of a helicopter overhead. The helicopter was flying too high to 
be visible. While the other children ran, the girl was the last off the roof and lost her limbs 
in a shrapnel injury. On the same day, in a barrel bomb attack on Minbij, five civilians, 
including three children, were killed and nine were injured. A residential building and 
several cars were also destroyed. </p>


<p><b>  Dara&#8217;a governorate 
</b></p>
<p>37. December 2013 and January 2014 saw an increase in the use of barrel-bombs.  
</p>
<p>38. In mid-December, a warship helicopter dropped barrel bombs on Jasem city, killing 
over twenty civilians. On 3 January 2014, barrel bombs were dropped from helicopters on 
residential areas in Inkhil and Jasem, following an attack by armed group fighters&#8217; on an 
army checkpoint. 
</p>
<p><b>  Damascus governorate 
</b></p>
<p>39. January 2014 saw a dramatic increase in the use of barrel-bombs on Damascus 
governorate, with Daraya being particularly hard hit.  
</p>
<p>40. On 7 January 2014, barrel bombs killed an unspecified number of civilians in 
Douma, a suburb of Damascus city. On 14 January, Government helicopters dropped barrel 
bombs on civilian-inhabited areas in Daraya, Arbin and Zabadani, all in the Damascus 
countryside. This campaign is ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>41. Government forces consistently failed to employ precision weapons when attacking 
targets in dense urban areas. Repeatedly throughout the reporting period, they deployed 
highly imprecise munitions with an expansive impact zone. Inevitably, these weapons 
killed and injured large numbers of civilians. Such weapons included barrel bombs. 
</p><p>42. Where barrel bombs were built as de facto incendiary weapons, they also violated 
rules of international humanitarian law prohibiting the use of weapons that cause 
superfluous injury, unnecessary suffering or that are indiscriminate by nature. 
43. Government helicopters dropped barrel bombs in the hours before break of fast 
during Ramadan, on fuel depots, and on busy market areas. The information strongly 
indicates that the manner in which the attacks were carried out, the timing and duration of 
the attacks demonstrates that the aim of the Government&#8217;s campaign of barrel-bombing was 
to terrorise the civilian population present in the areas attacked, with the clear message that 
no civilian was safe anywhere at any time of the day or night.

<p><b>Annex VII 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Assaults on medical care 
</b></p>
<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The deliberate targeting of hospitals, medical personnel and transports, the denial of 
access to medical care, and ill-treatment of the sick and wounded, has been one of the most 
alarming features of the Syrian conflict. According to multiple accounts collected by the 
Commission of Inquiry, Government forces and affiliated militias interfere with and 
instrumentalise medical care to further strategic and military aims. Evidence collected by 
the Commission leads to an overwhelming conclusion: Government forces deny medical 
care to those from opposition-controlled and affiliated areas as a matter of policy. The 
policy is implemented through attacks on medical units, by endangering hospitals, targeting 
medical personnel, and interfering with patients receiving treatment. Victims relay 
harrowing accounts of the wounded and sick languishing at checkpoints unable to reach 
medical treatment, coming under renewed attack in hospital and doctors providing impartial 
aid being arrested and targeted. There is also evidence that some anti-Government armed 
groups have attacked hospitals in certain areas.  
</p>
<p>2. Article 3, common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, binding all parties to 
the non-international armed conflict in Syria, requires the wounded and sick be collected 
and cared for. Customary international humanitarian law also affords special protection to 
hospitals, medical units and healthcare personnel. Under Syria&#8217;s constitution, adopted in 
2012, the Government must &#8220;protect citizen&#8217;s health and provide means of prevention, 
treatment and medication.&#8221; International Human Rights Law prohibits the arbitrary 
deprivation of life. The right to health, enshrined in the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Syria is party, contains a non-derogable 
core obligation to ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a 
non-discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups, as set out in 
General Comment No. 14. Intentionally directing attacks against hospitals and places 
containing the sick and the wounded and against medical units using the Red Cross or Red 
Crescent emblem is a war crime in non-international armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>3. The Commission is presenting this thematic conference room paper to the 24th 
session of the Human Rights Council to highlight an enduring and underreported trend in 
the ongoing conflict. The findings that follow are emblematic examples documented by the 
Commission working within its methodological limitations and within the constraints on 
access imposed by the Government. The incidents described are indicative of wider 
patterns. The denial of medical care as a weapon of war is a distinct and chilling reality of 
the war in Syria. By rejecting the irrefutable and universally accepted principle that those 
wounded in hostilities must be treated, the parties to the conflict in Syria are setting a 
dangerous precedent.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Attacks on hospitals and medical units 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since the beginning of Syria&#8217;s unrest, Government forces have strategically 
assaulted hospitals and medical units to deprive persons perceived to be affiliated with the 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>opposition of medical care. In an early example, Special Forces raided and closed down a 
hospital in Mouadamieh, Damascus because it treated injured protesters. They arrested 
patients, doctors and nurses.  
</p>
<p>5. As the violence escalated in early 2012, Government forces bombed and shelled 
opposition-operated field hospitals providing treatment to the wounded. The pattern of 
attacks indicates that Government forces deliberately targeted hospitals and medical units to 
gain military advantage by depriving anti-Government armed groups and their perceived 
supporters of medical assistance. These attacks continue to date.  
</p>
<p>6. In Homs, hospitals and medical units came under violent attack throughout 2012. In 
February and March, Government forces shelled field hospitals in Bab Amr from nearby 
villages. Three field hospitals providing emergency first aid were hit multiple times, 
causing considerable damage. The operating room of one field hospital was entirely 
destroyed. According to one victim, &#8220;The only warning was the noise made by the shell as 
it was fired.&#8221; Following aerial surveillance by Government helicopters, a field hospital in 
Al Qusayr received repeated artillery fire throughout May and June. Medical staff 
explained that the hospital did not use distinctive emblems, so as not to attract fire from 
Government forces. 
</p>
<p>7. Government forces repeatedly targeted hospitals in Tal Rifat during military 
operations in northern Aleppo governorate between April and August 2012. On 5 April, a 
private hospital was aerially bombarded, reportedly from Mennagh airport. Also in April, 
Tal Rifat public hospital was destroyed by airstrikes and forced to close. Field hospitals 
attempted to continue providing care but were attacked by fighter jets from May to early 
August. There was a strong belief among survivors that the hospitals were targeted because 
they provided treatment to opposition fighters and civilians affiliated with the opposition. 
</p>
<p>8. As anti-Government groups took control of eastern and southern Aleppo city on 19 
July 2012, Al Zarzou Hospital in Ansari neighbourhood came under mortar fire by 
Government forces, damaging the fifth floor and forcing an evacuation of patients. The 
hospital became administered by the opposition-affiliated Aleppo City Medical Council and 
was subsequently attacked by Government mortars in December 2012 and aerially 
bombarded in February and March 2013, causing considerable damage.  
</p>
<p>9. Aleppo&#8217;s Dar Al Shifa public hospital also suffered repeated attacks between August 
and November 2012. On 12 August, helicopters fired artillery shells at the hospital, and in 
early October rockets hit the hospital. On 12 November, the hospital was targeted by a 
missile strike. These attacks injured and killed civilians receiving treatment in the hospital 
and medical personnel, significantly damaged the hospital&#8217;s infrastructure and substantially 
reduced its ability to treat patients. On 11 August 2012, the state hospital in Tafas, Dara&#8217;a 
was attacked after helicopters surveyed the area. Patients receiving treatment at the time 
were evacuated, while others were killed in the attack. On 20 June 2013, a fighter jet 
dropped a bomb on the National Hospital of Al Raqqa, causing the total destruction of the 
intensive care unit and injuring three medical staff members. 
</p><p>10. In June 2012, Government forces began a concerted targeting campaign on field 
hospitals in Al Haffe, Latakia. One field hospital, located in a private home in Jingil village, 
was shelled on 5 June, and another field hospital, operating from a mosque in Al Zankoufa 
village, was hit on 13 June. The field hospitals were providing first aid to the sick and 
wounded and were staffed by volunteers and several doctors and nurses. Throughout 
December 2012 and January 2013, Government forces attacked field hospitals in Yarmouk 
Camp, Damascus. Fayiz Halwa and Al Basil hospitals were repeatedly hit with mortar fire, 
causing extensive damage to their infrastructure and ability to provide medical aid. 
</p>
<p>11. Al Huda private hospital in Sbaneh, Damascus was shelled on 25 July 2012. As well 
as a floor dedicated to wounded fighters, the hospital contained a maternity ward and an </p>


<p>emergency trauma care unit. Survivors and eyewitnesses believed the hospital was 
deliberately shelled from a Government military base in Mount Qassioun. The Al Majana 
private hospital in Ariha, Idlib, was hit by rocket fire on 28 August 2012. The attack 
damaged the emergency wing. The following day on 29 August, Government and pro-
Government forces raided the hospital, destroying equipment, harassing the medical staff 
and accusing them of providing medical treatment to anti-Government armed group 
fighters. One doctor present during the attack explained, &#8220;If doctors treated opposition 
fighters, they were considered to be part of the opposition.&#8221; Al Saeed private hospital in Al 
Arfi, Dayr az Zawr treating wounded civilians and fighters alike was repeatedly targeted 
between 19 July and 26 November by Government forces positioned on the bank of the 
Euphrates River. It was shelled on five occasions, injuring numerous patients and medical 
personnel. The hospital closed due to damage suffered.   
</p>
<p>12. In 2013, hospitals in Dara&#8217;a came under concerted attack. Since February, after 
Government forces withdrew from Jasem, field hospitals inside the town have been 
repeatedly shelled and aerially bombarded. Doctors and medical volunteers operating the 
field hospitals have been forced to relocate every few days to avoid being targeted. Since 
February, field hospitals in Tariq Asad in Dara&#8217;a Al Balad have been shelled almost 
continuously, killing doctors and patients. As such attacks continue, field hospitals have 
literally been driven underground, forced to operate in the basements of houses. 
</p>
<p>13. Anti-Government armed groups have also attacked medical facilities. On 14 April 
2012, 250 Al Farouk Brigade fighters attacked the National Hospital in Jurat Al Shayyah, 
as part of a military offensive on Homs city. After several days&#8217; resistance from 
Government forces, the Al Farouk Brigade took control of the hospital. The Brigade took 
no precautions to avoid civilian casualties or to protect the sick and wounded during the 
attack. Government forces responded with aerial bombardment, which largely destroyed the 
hospital on 17 April. 
</p>
<p>14. In a recent incident, in late May 2013, anti-Government armed groups attacked the 
National Hospital in Dara&#8217;a, causing considerable damage. A member of the FSA brigade 
that carried out the attack on the hospital said that his group believed that there were 
approximately 50 patients in the hospital, and that all were affiliated with the Government. 
When orders were given to attack the hospital, none of the fighters involved protested that 
it was a protected object and no warnings were given prior to the attack.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Endangering hospitals  
</b></p>
<p>15. Placing military objectives in hospitals constitutes a failure to take all feasible 
precautions to protect civilians from the effects of attack. Such acts also contravene the 
fundamental obligation to respect and protect medical units. Using hospitals, outside their 
humanitarian function for acts harmful to the enemy, such as sheltering able-bodied 
combatants, storing arms or ammunition, as military observation posts or shields for 
military action, leads to a loss of their protection, exposing such hospitals to a risk of attack. 
This may prevent the impartial provision of medical treatment, endanger patients and 
medical professionals, and compromise the humanitarian function of medical facilities. 
Ultimately, this has a grave impact on the fulfillment of the obligation under common 
article 3 to care for the sick and wounded. Further, failing to respect the emblem of the 
Geneva Conventions undermines its protective purpose.  
</p>
<p>16. On 22 March 2011, Government forces entered the National Hospital in Dara&#8217;a city, 
cleared the hospital of non-essential medical staff and positioned snipers on the roof of the 
hospital overlooking the Omari mosque. The following day, the snipers fired on protesters. 
Snipers remained stationed on the National Hospital until May 2013, firing on sick and </p>


<p>wounded persons attempting to approach the hospital entrance. Security forces also 
continued to occupy the hospital until that date, ensuring only Government soldiers or 
civilians from Government-controlled areas of Dara&#8217;a received care. In late May 2013, anti-
Government armed groups attacked the National Hospital in Dara&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>17. As Government forces withdrew from Jasem in February 2012, Military Security 
retained control of Amal Hospital until 28 April 2013. At least three tanks were stationed in 
its courtyard, yet the hospital remained operational.    
</p>
<p>18. In Homs, Government forces conducted hostilities from several hospitals. In April 
2012, Government forces established two military checkpoints at the perimeter of Al 
Rastan hospital. Following attacks by opposition fighters, Government forces occupied the 
hospital, positioning military personnel, snipers and tanks within the hospital grounds. By 
October 2012, the sick and wounded could not approach the hospital for fear of being fired 
upon, stating, &#8220;the hospital has become a military base.&#8221; Since at least December 2011, 
Government armed forces have been positioned inside the National Hospital in Al Qusayr, 
Homs Governorate. In 2012, wounded and sick persons seeking medical care were hit by 
sniper fire from the hospital. Passersby and nearby residents were also targeted. As the 
Government began its Al Qusayr operation in May 2013, it positioned tanks and heavy 
artillery within the hospital. Snipers, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery 
were also placed around and inside Abdul Qadir Al Shaqfa Military Hospital in Al Waer, 
Homs. According to former hospital staff, the hospital was used to launch attacks on Al 
Waer and Jurat Al Shayyah neighbourhoods in May 2013. 
</p>
<p>19. Accounts from June 2012 describe the occupation of the National Hospital in Al 
Haffe, Latakia by soldiers and military personnel. Snipers positioned on the hospital roof 
targeted all those approaching the hospital, preventing access to medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>20. In September 2012, a Free Syrian Army (FSA) brigade in Mo Hassan, Dayr az 
Zawr, established a compound in an elementary school, exposing the field hospital located 
in the adjacent high school to attack. On 9 September and 29 September, the schools were 
targeted by airstrikes from fighter jets, causing significant damage to the field hospital. 
During the FSA offensive on Helfaya, Hama, around 18-20 December 2012, another FSA 
brigade attacked checkpoints surrounding the National Hospital, gaining control of the 
hospital. The National Hospital had been used as a base by Government forces.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Targeting of medical personnel and transport 
</b></p>
<p>21. One of the most insidious trends of the armed violence in Syria has been the 
targeting of healthcare personnel. Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors and medical 
volunteers have been attacked, arrested, unlawfully detained, and disappeared. Anti-
terrorism laws issued on 2 July 2012 effectively criminalised medical aid to the opposition. 
Laws 19, 20 and 21 contravene the customary international humanitarian law rule that 
under no circumstances shall any person be punished for carrying out medical activities 
compatible with medical ethics, regardless of the person benefiting therefrom. 
</p>
<p>22. From April to June 2011, Government forces carried out a wave of arrests against 
medical professionals in Damascus. In April, five doctors working at Al Fateh Hospital and 
Al Mowasah University Hospital were arrested and detained after they refused to comply 
with Military Intelligence orders to deny treatment to injured protesters. Three doctors were 
tortured in Air Force Intelligence custody. Security forces arrested and mistreated a 
pharmacist in Mouadamieh, accused of providing treatment to protesters. In June 2011, two 
doctors working at the Tishrin Military Hospital were summoned to Military Security 
Branch 291 in Kafr Sousa, where they were detained, interrogated about their activities in </p>


<p>support of demonstrators and ill treated. Upon release, the Military Services Administration 
discharged them from duty. 
</p>
<p>23. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies have forcibly disappeared medical 
personnel providing treatment to perceived opposition supporters. From June 2011 until 
early 2012, Government security services repeatedly raided Bab Sbaa National Hospital in 
Homs, arresting doctors and nurses. One nurse explained that &#8220;at one point there were no 
more doctors left in the hospital.&#8221; During 2012, Government forces conducted a wave of 
arrests and extra-judicial executions of medical personnel working at Aleppo&#8217;s opposition 
affiliated Al Zarzou Hospital. In June 2012, Air Force Intelligence arrested three medical 
professionals at the hospital. Their burned bodies were found three days later. In July 2012, 
Dr. Nur Maktabi, a senior doctor at Al Zarzou Hospital went missing. In December 2012, 
he was found dead. A surgical assistant at Al Zarzou Hospital disappeared in October 2012. 
In mid-December 2012, the hospital&#8217;s anaesthetist disappeared at a Government-controlled 
checkpoint on his way home from Aleppo.  
</p>
<p>24. In early 2012, a doctor was arrested by soldiers of the 6th Division while treating 
patients at a state hospital in Idlib. In February 2012, Government forces arrested a doctor 
who treated FSA soldiers at Meydani Hospital in Latakia. On 28 June 2012, police in 
Damascus arrested, detained and subjected a nurse to psychological torture while 
interrogating her about patients she had treated. 
</p>
<p>25. Persons who received treatment in field hospitals often faced arrest and interrogation 
as to the names and locations of the hospitals and doctors who provided them with medical 
care. This has led to the arrest of doctors, as recorded in Dara&#8217;a in April and July 2011. In 
2012 and 2013, doctors operating in field hospitals in Homs were allegedly declared 
wanted persons by Government security forces for providing support to the opposition. 
After a Government forces ground operation on Al Haffe, Latakia in June 2012, pro-
Government militia fighters killed a doctor working at the field hospital operating in a 
mosque in Al Zankoufa village.  
</p>
<p>26. Persons delivering medical supplies have also been targeted. In March 2012, 
Government security forces reportedly listed a pharmacist who established first aid clinics 
in Idlib as a wanted terrorist and member of the armed opposition. In August 2012, officers 
at a Government checkpoint in Athman, Homs, stopped and searched an ambulance 
delivering medical supplies. The driver of the ambulance was taken to an intelligence 
service detention facility. Two weeks later, the National Hospital in Dara&#8217;a released his 
body, bearing extensive injuries consistent with severe torture. 
</p><p>27. Since the beginning of the conflict, at least 20 Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers 
have been killed, in some cases by sniper fire, while aiding the wounded or delivering relief 
supplies. Dozens others have been arrested and detained by the Government. On 7 
September 2011, a Red Crescent ambulance evacuating wounded civilians was attacked 
next to a Government checkpoint in Al Hamediyah, Homs, killing one paramedic and 
injuring three others. In May 2012, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent unit in Azaz, Aleppo 
discontinued frontline work having suffered consistent sniper fire while attempting to 
evacuate the wounded. Also in May, the Red Crescent office in Azaz was shelled. In July 
2012, a Red Crescent volunteer was killed by a sniper near Abdel Aziz mosque in Dara&#8217;a 
city&#8217;s Al Mahatta neighbourhood, while carrying out humanitarian duties. On 24 August 
2012, a Government sniper shot and injured a Red Crescent nurse near Al Omari mosque in 
Dara&#8217;a. The sniper was located 200 metres away and would have seen his uniform and 
distinctive emblem. In early September 2012, a sniper in Al Midan neighbourhood in 
Aleppo city shot a medical emergency worker in full medical uniform and holding a 
medical bag bearing the Red Crescent logo. In March 2013, Government forces seized a 
Red Crescent ambulance in Jobar, Damascus. The ambulance personnel, all in uniform </p>


<p>bearing the Red Crescent emblem, were arrested and detained by security services for 10 
days.   
</p>
<p>28. Recently, a Syrian surgeon working in an Aleppo hospital operated by M&#233;decins 
Sans Fronti&#232;res, was killed. His body was found on 3 September 2013. He had been 
treating victims of the conflict. 
</p>
<p>29. The clearly established pattern indicates that Government forces deliberately target 
medical personnel to gain military advantage by depriving the opposition and those 
perceived to support them of medical assistance for injuries sustained. While Government 
harassment and targeting of medical personnel continues, it appears to have diminished in 
2013 because a considerable number of doctors have left the country or accepted the 
restrictions that security forces imposed on hospitals. 
</p>
<p>30. Other doctors have left Government-controlled areas and attempted to ensure 
continuity of medical care in opposition-controlled areas. However, there are increasing 
indications that certain anti-Government armed groups also fail to respect medical 
personnel. In late April 2013, the head doctor of a field hospital in northern Aleppo city 
was detained by members of Jabhat Al Nusra after he refused to display their banner in the 
hospital, insisting that the hospital was a neutral space. The doctor was held by the Sharia 
Committee for several days.  
</p>
<p>31. The Commission documented one case in which an armed opposition group targeted 
an ambulance. This occurred on 16 August 2013, when Hamad Abd al Jalil Battalion 
fighters attacked a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance in Al Hasakah, killing the patient, the 
ambulance driver and paramedic. Before firing upon the clearly marked ambulance, the 
fighters had targeted it with an IED on the Ras Al Ain - Desbasiyeh road.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Interference with care and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p>32. Security forces have arrested and detained wounded persons in medical facilities, 
claiming bullet or shrapnel wounds as evidence of participation in opposition activities. The 
overbroad formulation of Law 19, article 10 allows its application in a manner that requires 
doctors to inform on patients in all cases, which is inconsistent with international 
humanitarian law&#8217;s insistence that &#8220;persons engaged in medical activities shall not be 
compelled to perform acts or to carry out work contrary to medical ethics or to other 
medical rules designed for the benefit of the wounded and sick&#8221;. In several instances, 
medical personnel refused to treat persons for fear of arrest. In Aleppo, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, 
Dayr az Zawr, Hama, Homs, Idlib and Latakia governorates, wounded and sick persons 
were denied treatment on sectarian or political grounds by Government forces. Healthcare 
has become militarized to the extent that many in need elect not to seek medical assistance 
in hospitals for fear of arrest, detention, torture or death. Through such measures, the 
Government has deliberately obstructed the efforts of the sick and wounded to receive help. 
</p>
<p>33. In exploiting medical care to further strategic and military aims, Government forces 
have engaged in agonizing cruelty against the sick and wounded. The Commission has 
recorded consistent accounts spanning the conflict of the ill-treatment and torture of 
persons in military hospitals. There are strong indications of collusion between military 
hospitals and various security agencies in the use of torture. 
</p>
<p>34. Between April and August 2011, security officers, at times with the involvement of 
medical personnel, beat persons in the emergency trauma ward of the Military Hospital of 
Tishrin, Damascus. Most victims of this ill-treatment were protesters that had been injured 
by Government forces. </p>


<p>35. The Military Hospital of Aleppo contains a detention ward operated by the Aleppo 
Military Security branch. According to former doctors and medical personnel who worked 
in the hospital between November 2011 and December 2012, patients in this ward are 
heavily guarded by security officers, chained to their beds and blindfolded. Security 
personnel act as intermediaries between patient and doctor, often obstructing medical care 
as a torture and interrogation tactic. 
</p>
<p>36. Former patients, doctors and medical personnel have consistently described the 
alarming treatment of persons in Military Hospital No. 601 in Al Mezzeh, Damascus. 
Accounts indicate that some medical professionals have been co-opted into the 
maltreatment. Since 2011, Military Security, Military Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, 
the Security Department of the Syrian Army&#8217;s 4th Division and the Republican Guard have 
brought detainees to separate security wards inside the hospital. Detainees, including 
children, have been beaten, burned with cigarettes, and subjected to torture that exploits 
pre-existing injuries. Many patients have been tortured to death in this facility.  
</p><p>37. Consistent accounts from Abdul Qadir Al Shaqfa Military Hospital in Al Waer, 
Homs, indicate that security officers tortured persons brought for medical treatment from 
April 2011 to September 2012. Doctors were ordered to keep victims alive so that they 
could be interrogated further. Eyewitnesses describe how patients were chained to their 
beds and blindfolded, provided minimal food and water and subjected to harsh treatment.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion   
</b>38. Violence against healthcare has significant compound effects, causing dramatic 
increases in mortality among the sick and wounded. The breakdown of medical services in 
wartime disproportionately affects vulnerable segments of the population, such as children 
under the age of five, nursing mothers, the disabled and elderly. In Syria, their suffering is 
exacerbated by the conduct of the parties to the conflict. As documented in the 
Commission&#8217;s previous reports, both Government forces and anti-Government armed 
groups have employed siege warfare, preventing the passage of humanitarian aid and basic 
necessities, including medicine and medical supplies. Such tactics have long-term 
repercussions on the ability of entire communities to treat war-related and chronic 
healthcare problems.  
</p>
<p>39. Syria&#8217;s healthcare system has fragmented along conflict lines. According to 
UNRWA, 32 of the country&#8217;s 88 public hospitals have closed. Twenty-six of those closed 
are in Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and Dayr az Zawr, the four governorates most affected by 
the conflict. The Government reported in March 2013 that 10-15% of doctors have left the 
country. In contested areas, the healthcare system has largely fallen apart and is being 
replaced by an improvised, inadequate system, constantly at risk of attack by Government 
forces. Hospitals that remain operational under Government control often lack impartiality. 
</p>
<p>40. Government forces have abused the vulnerable, the wounded and the sick, exploiting 
their need for medical aid to further military aims. By attacking medical facilities, using 
hospitals as bases for military action, targeting medical personnel and interfering with 
patients receiving treatment, Government forces have perpetrated a concerted policy of 
denying medical aid to those affiliated with or part of the armed opposition. The first efforts 
to humanise warfare focused on the protection of the sick and wounded and those providing 
them with care. The incidents and patterns recorded reveal that the actions of the Syrian 
Government from 2011 to date have been a cynical betrayal of this fundamental principle. 
</p>
<p>41. The documented incidents of anti-Government armed group attacks against hospitals 
are of grave concern, as they demonstrate a disregard for the specially protected status of </p>


<p>healthcare facilities and a failure to take precautions to avoid civilian casualties and 
protected the sick and wounded.  
</p>
<p>42.  The Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms its 
recommendations (A/HRC/24/46) regarding the need to ensure the protection of civilians 
and compliance with international humanitarian law. The parties to the conflict must 
respect the special protection afforded to medical facilities and personnel. The Commission 
entreats the Government to fulfill its obligations under international human rights law to 
ensure the right to health, a right that is closely and inextricably linked to the rights to life, 
human dignity, non-discrimination, equality and the prohibition against torture and ill-
treatment.
