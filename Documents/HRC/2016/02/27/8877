<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Commission on the Status 
of Women resolution 39/5, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/43, and 
Human Rights Council resolution 6/30. A joint workplan is prepared annually by the 
Division for the Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). The workplan for 2009 is contained in document A/HRC/10/42-
E/CN.6/2009/7. 
</p>
<p>2. Cooperation between OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of 
Women continued in 2009 with the goal of achieving equality between women and 
men and the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s human rights. The major 
activities that were carried out jointly are outlined below, as are plans for joint 
activities for 2010. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Review of the implementation of the joint workplan for 2009 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. During the implementation of the current joint workplan, the exchange of 
information continued between OHCHR, the Office of the Special Adviser on 
Gender Issues and Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs and the Division for the Advancement of Women. The Division and 
OHCHR continued to cooperate within the framework of inter-agency mechanisms, 
especially the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, under the 
leadership of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. 
The Division and OHCHR participated in the eighth session of the Inter-Agency 
Network from 24 to 26 February 2009 in New York, contributing to discussions on 
all items on the agenda. Both entities participated in several of the task forces of the 
Inter-Agency Network, including its Task Force on Violence against Women, 
convened jointly by the Division and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 
Both entities also participated in a working group of the Inter-Agency Network 
related to the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. OHCHR also 
contributed to the inventory of activities of the United Nations system on violence 
against women, compiled twice yearly by the Division as part of the activities of the 
Task Force on Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>4. Both entities continued to participate in the Inter-Agency Cooperation Group 
against Trafficking in Persons, chaired by the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, as well as in decision-making concerning grants by the United Nations Trust 
Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women. The Division and 
OHCHR also continued their collaboration within the context of the Executive 
Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, specifically in the cluster on the 
advancement of women, which is convened jointly by the Division for the 
Advancement of Women and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).  
</p>
<p>5. Two regional OHCHR staff members participated in an expert group meeting 
on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices in Addis Ababa from 25 
to 28 May 2009, organized jointly by the Division for the Advancement of Women 
and ECA. The expert group meeting was part of the Division&#8217;s ongoing work to 
develop tools for stakeholders to address violence against women. Based on the </p>

</b></p>
<p>outcomes of the meeting, the Division will prepare a supplement to the <i>Handbook 
for legislation on violence against women</i> developed by the Division in 2009 (see 
http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/v-handbook.htm). 
</p>
<p>6. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
support the work of human rights treaty bodies and the implementation of the major 
international human rights instruments, including through exchange of information 
and dissemination of information about the human rights treaty system. The Director 
of the Division for the Advancement of Women addressed the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 21 July 2009 during the forty-
fourth session of the Committee, held in New York. The Division provided inputs to 
documentation prepared by OHCHR in connection with the Committee, in particular 
to the report submitted to the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly on the 
status of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (A/64/342). The report described progress in alleviating the backlog of 
reports under review during 2009; the working methods with regard to the Optional 
Protocol; the elaboration and adoption by the Committee of general 
recommendation No. 26 on migrant workers; and the adoption by the Committee of 
statements on the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, Gaza, the international financial crisis and its 
consequences for the human rights of women and girls, and gender and climate 
change.  
</p>
<p>7. The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR continued to 
update their databases and websites. In particular, in view of the thirtieth 
anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, both entities have established a link to the website 
that was developed for the anniversary by the working group of the Inter-Agency 
Network on Women and Gender Equality, which included the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women, OHCHR, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, UNFPA and the Division. A 
commemorative event was also jointly organized by the working group on 
3 December 2009 in New York. The event featured an interactive panel with 
selected activists, academics, journalists and members of national judiciaries, who 
shared personal experiences of how the Convention and its Optional Protocol have 
shaped national responses to women&#8217;s human rights issues. The working group also 
prepared kits on the Convention for United Nations country teams to support 
country and regional anniversary events to celebrate advances made in women&#8217;s 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR and the Division for the Advancement of Women, respectively, 
convened a number of meetings, including training seminars and other capacity-
building activities, to support implementation of human rights treaties, including 
with respect to preparation of reports and follow-up to concluding observations at 
the national level. The Division supported the convening of workshops in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Guinea Bissau and Timor-Leste. The Division 
continued its multiphased support to the Government of Liberia to strengthen 
capacity for implementation of the Convention and supported the participation of 
Government officials from Liberia at the forty-fourth session of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The Division supported the 
convening of a multi-stakeholder workshop in Sierra Leone. OHCHR participated in </p>

and 63/155 on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>10. Collaboration in support of intergovernmental bodies continued. In March 
2009, the Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences addressed the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-
third session. The Special Rapporteur addressed the Commission following the

creation of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, requested the mandate holder to 
make an annual oral presentation to the Commission.  
</p>
<p>11. Coordination of the preparation of reports to be submitted to 
intergovernmental bodies continued. At the invitation of the Division, OHCHR 
provided inputs to the reports of the Secretary-General on intensification of efforts 
to eliminate all forms of violence against women (A/64/151) and on violence 
against women migrant workers (A/64/152), which were submitted to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. OHCHR also provided inputs to the reports of

which were submitted to the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-third 
session. OHCHR contributed to the report of the Secretary-General on
