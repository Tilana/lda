<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala 
and the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Guatemala (OHCHR-Guatemala) during 2012. OHCHR-Guatemala 
conducted monitoring activities and provided advisory and technical assistance to State 
institutions and civil society to contribute to the implementation of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations and the recommendations contained in previous 
reports. 
</p>
<p> A new Government took office in January 2012. The High Commissioner visited the 
country in March, and urged the implementation of a comprehensive human rights agenda 
to address important, long-standing gaps in the enjoyment of human rights, such as high 
levels of insecurity, impunity and poverty; malnutrition and discrimination and violence 
against women; as well as the situation of indigenous peoples and the discrimination they 
face in the political, economic, cultural and social spheres. The universal periodic review in 
October 2012 presented a unique opportunity to strengthen the commitment of Guatemala 
to the protection of human rights, in meaningful dialogue with civil society.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) signed an agreement with the Government of Guatemala for the 
establishment of a country office. The functions of OHCHR-Guatemala are to monitor the 
human rights situation and to provide technical cooperation and advice to State institutions 
and civil society. The agreement was extended for three years in 2008 and 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context   
</b></p>
<p>2. President Otto P&#233;rez Molina took office on 14 January 2012. During his inaugural 
speech, he announced the establishment of three national covenants reflecting national 
priorities: security, justice and peace; fiscal policy and competitiveness; and hunger 
eradication. Guatemala took its seat as a non-permanent member of the Security Council 
and was examined for a second time under the universal periodic review in October. It also 
presented a proposal to the General Assembly on a new approach to combating drug 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner visited Guatemala from 11 to 15 March. She met with 
high-level State authorities, civil society organizations, the international community and 
indigenous authorities in Totonicap&#225;n. She publicly shared her observations and 
recommendations on impunity; insecurity and violence; indigenous peoples and the right to 
consultation; and human rights defenders.1 
</p>
<p>4. The Government launched a strategy to combat corruption, and important efforts 
were made to implement a results-based framework. Despite this, complaints were made 
about the lack of transparency regarding the distribution of fertilizers, the purchase of 
medication and the granting of public licences and concessions. Congress eventually 
approved a series of legal reforms to combat corruption and illicit enrichment.  
</p>
<p>5. The Executive launched constitutional proposals for structural reforms of the justice 
system, the use of public funds, the operation and structure of Congress and the recognition 
of the rights of indigenous peoples. It later asked Congress to postpone their consideration. 
The merging of existing human rights institutions into a Secretariat for Human Rights and 
Peace was announced. 
</p>
<p>6. In August, Jorge de Le&#243;n Duque took office as Human Rights Ombudsman, and 
started a full restructuring of his Office. His election is an opportunity to renew the 
institution, its oversight capacity and its mandate to promote and protect human rights, and 
expand nationwide coverage.  
</p>
<p>7. In November, an earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale hit eight western 
departments, killing 44 and injuring 186, according to official data. Some 27,770 people 
were severely affected, and 21,800 houses damaged. The Government declared a state of 
public emergency and coordinated humanitarian assistance and early reconstruction.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Overall human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner welcomes the President&#8217;s commitment to enact the 
essential transformations contained in the 1996 Peace Agreements. These include the 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>agenda that Guatemala needs to undertake to reach lasting peace, reconciliation and 
development within the framework of the rule of law and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Violent deaths have decreased since 2010, but high rates of violence and impunity 
persisted, including for atrocious crimes against women and children. Twenty-eight 
dismembered bodies of adults and children were found throughout the country, illustrating 
the extreme violence typically employed by members of organized crime. The High 
Commissioner condemns such brutality, and calls on the State to continue to investigate 
and prosecute these crimes and to adopt all possible preventive measures.  
</p>
<p>10. Cooperation and coordination among the Attorney General&#8217;s Office (Ministerio 
P&#250;blico), the Ministry of the Interior and the National Civil Police (PNC) in criminal 
investigation and prosecution translated into important results. 
</p>
<p>11. In October, 6 indigenous people were shot dead and over 20 allegedly were injured 
by military personnel during a protest organized by the indigenous authorities of 
Totonicap&#225;n against the high cost of electricity and the proposed constitutional and 
educational reforms. This provoked a serious questioning of the use of the military in law-
enforcement functions, motivated the revision of regulations and policies regarding its role, 
including Decree 40-2000,2 and revealed the urgent need to consolidate the reform of the 
PNC. These events also showed the need for the State to continue to fulfil its duty to protect 
the right to life and the integrity of demonstrators while they exercise their right to protest. 
The High Commissioner acknowledges the establishment by the Government of a 
&#8213;dialogue table&#8214; with indigenous authorities, as well as the Attorney General&#8217;s Office&#8217;s 
prompt response and the collaboration of the military in the judicial investigations, resulting 
in the detention and indictment of nine military personnel, including a colonel, on charges 
of extrajudicial execution.  
</p>
<p>12. The High Commissioner acknowledges the adoption of the Tax Update Law (Decree 
10-2012) and the Anti-Evasion Law II (Decree 4-2012). According to the Ministry of 
Finance, the Tax Update Law allowed for an increase of 0.2 per cent in the 2012 gross 
domestic product (GDP), and is expected to facilitate an increase of 1.2 per cent in 2013. 
The reform constitutes a necessary basis to increase the State&#8217;s capacity to collect taxes. 
</p>
<p>However, at 11.8 per cent of GDP, Guatemala continues to have one of the lowest taxation 
rates in Latin America.3 
</p>
<p>13. Combating chronic malnutrition became the guiding principle of social policy, 
through the Zero Hunger Plan. The Government moved forward in the institutionalization 
of social programmes, and important efforts were made to reactivate rural policy, focusing 
on promotion of the peasant economy. However, important challenges remain: delivery of 
quality services to the poorest communities, improvement of inter-institutional coordination 
and, above all, eliminating negative trends in the economic structure, such as land 
concentration and precarious working conditions, which generate exclusion and 
marginalization of indigenous and rural communities. 
</p>
<p>14. Social conflicts persisted during 2012. Until October, the Agrarian Affairs 
Secretariat had registered 1,293 cases of land conflicts involving 1,059,873 people (81 per 
cent indigenous), 66 per cent of which were concentrated in the Alta Verapaz, 
Huehuetenango, Pet&#233;n and Quich&#233; departments. According to the Agrarian Affairs 
Secretariat, until October 2012, 346 out of 405 conflicts had been resolved through

</p>
<p>dialogue and mediation.4 During the reporting period, OHCHR-Guatemala monitored 39 
social conflicts linked to land, extractive and/or monoculture projects, environmental 
threats and labour issues. Protests by student teachers against the reform of teacher training 
were particularly intense, spreading to all 86 public teacher-training schools in the country. 
Social conflicts tested the capacity of dialogue mechanisms, making it necessary to 
continue to strengthen them and ensure a intercultural approach that addressed the 
structural causes of conflicts to prevent resorting to the security forces as a response. 
</p>
<p>15. The incorporation of a multicultural vision is still pending in Government plans and 
policies. Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants continue to suffer exclusion in the 
exercise of their rights in all spheres, including in access to basic services and justice, land 
ownership, and participation in decision-making entities and processes. Some of their 
leaders have been criminalized for claiming their rights. In view of the impact of economic 
investment projects on indigenous land, the State still faces the challenge of ensuring a 
development model in which indigenous peoples have the opportunity to be legitimate 
partners. 
</p>
<p>16. Draft laws relevant to human rights protection in the areas of security and justice, 
including reforms to the Statutory Law of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, <i>amparo</i> (writ of 
protection), impeachment, arms and ammunitions and the National Reparations Programme 
and the creation of a search commission for victims of enforced disappearance are still 
pending in Congress. So is a bill on migrants, which includes fundamental human rights 
principles and moves away from an approach based solely on national security. 
</p>
<p>17. Homophobic prejudices and stereotypes have marginalized lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex persons. Such persons have also suffered physical and verbal 
attacks, and 12 transgender people were murdered in 2012.5 In addition, the right of 
transgender and intersex persons to identity documents is restricted and not coherent with 
their gender identity. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Security and justice 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Covenant for Security, Justice and Peace, launched in May, is an opportunity 
for the Government to move towards a strategic approach to reduce violence and generate a 
culture of peace. The Task Force for Security, Justice and Peace was created to promote 
implementation and follow-up to the Covenant, but it does not take into account existing 
institutions established in the 2008 Framework Law on Security (Decree 18-2008). Its 
peace component should comprehensively include the rights to truth, justice, reparation and 
guarantees of non-repetition. The High Commissioner is concerned that reference to citizen 
co-responsibility in guaranteeing security could be interpreted as replacing the State&#8217;s 
responsibility to guarantee human rights for all.   
</p>
<p>19. The High Commissioner welcomes the adoption by Congress of the law creating a 
criminal investigation body within the Ministry of the Interior (Decree 15-2012). This 
should contribute to the creation of a sustainable institutional mechanism, provided its 
regulations are rapidly approved. To ensure improved coordination, the National Institute of 
Forensic Science (INACIF) should be given full participation in the Coordinating Body for 
the Modernization of the Justice Sector.

</b></p>
<p>20. The ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is an 
important step towards ending impunity for serious crimes, and an acknowledgement of 
principles of international law&#8212;including non-admissibility of amnesties, non-application 
of statutes of limitations, and command responsibility&#8212;in cases of genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes. 
</p>
<p>21. The High Commissioner welcomes the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice to 
commute the last death sentence, which should constitute a definite step towards abolition.  
</p>
<p>22. Three nominating commissions were established for the elections of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman, the Director of INACIF and the rapporteurs of the national torture 
prevention mechanism (NPM). Progress was made in terms of publicity during the 
processes, although weaknesses persisted in the latter stages, particularly a lack of 
discussion on each candidate based on objective criteria and justification of the 
commissions&#8217; final decision. Concerns were raised over the NPM selection process, which 
</p>
<p>may compromise the effectiveness of the mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Security 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Government launched the National Security Policy in September, as part of the 
Covenant on Security, Justice and Peace. While the Policy contains some human rights 
elements and prevention measures, it would benefit from the incorporation of a 
comprehensive rights-based approach.  
</p>
<p>24. There was a notable increase in military presence nationwide, through the 
establishment of two brigades: one based in Pet&#233;n and another in the outskirts of Guatemala 
City. Furthermore, the creation of two additional brigades to combat drug trafficking and 
organized crime has been announced. Military presence was also increased in some areas of 
the capital through checkpoints, and joint military-police patrols continued. The High 
Commissioner reiterates that deployment of the military in citizen security duties should 
take place only under exceptional circumstances, be limited in time and placed strictly 
under civilian command and control, as recognized by the Government itself. The risk 
relating to such deployment was exemplified by the above-mentioned Totonicap&#225;n case. 
The High Commissioner acknowledges subsequent efforts by the authorities to regulate 
military intervention (the Protocol for Inter-institutional Actions: Army Support to Civil 
Security Forces, created through Governmental Agreement 285-2012) noting that this 
regulation still needs to limit clearly the participation of the military, assign responsibilities, 
and establish precise criteria for intervention, following international standards. 
</p>
<p>25. The Minister of the Interior announced that 2013 would be the year of strengthening 
the PNC, contemplating additional measures to those already taken, such as vetting and 
opening a police officers academy. Nevertheless, in 2012 the police force increased only by 
4.7 per cent,6 compared to an 11.8 per cent increase in the military. This does not appear to 
be compatible with the proclaimed prioritization of PNC reform, including the need for 
adequate working conditions. 
</p>
<p>26. Although all homicide data indicate that the homicide rate has decreased since 2010, 
the rates obtained from different official sources vary. At the end of October, the PNC had 
registered 4,185 homicides, an 11.6 per cent reduction over 2011, while INACIF7 had 
registered 4,941, reflecting a 4.94 per cent reduction. According to the PNC, 83 per cent of 
</p>

 7 INACIF figures provided to OHCHR-Guatemala.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>violent deaths were by firearms, which demonstrates the need to establish a disarmament 
plan and stronger arms controls.  
</p>
<p>27. Like its predecessors, the current Government resorted to exceptional measures and 
declared a state of siege in Santa Cruz Barillas, Huehuetenango. This followed the 1 May 
killing of peasant Andr&#233;s Pedro Miguel, allegedly by a private security guard. In response, 
some members of the community damaged a hotel and other buildings, allegedly detained a 
judicial official and forcibly entered the military barracks. The decree establishing the state 
of siege lacked a clear justification and analysis of necessity, exceptionality and 
proportionality. The Government withdrew the measure after 18 days. 
</p>
<p>28. On 2 May, during the state of siege, nine arbitrary and/or illegal detentions were 
carried out without a court order by private individuals who claimed to be victims of the 
events the day before. Those detained were accused of participating in the disturbances. 
They were not able to present their initial statement before a competent judge until over two 
weeks after their detention. Eight were indicted on 19 September and remain in detention, 
while one was released. 
</p>
<p>29. Private security agents continue to far outnumber the police force. However, none of 
the existing companies had completed the compulsory registration process before the 
General Directorate, two years after the adoption of the law on private security services 
(Decree 52-2010).  
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of the Interior, over 1,000 legally established 
civilian security groups exist&#8212;either local security committees8 or local security 
commissions9. They carry out tasks ranging from community based&#8211;prevention activities to 
maintenance of public order. Some members perform policing functions and have even 
committed abuses. The High Commissioner welcomes efforts to investigate and prosecute 
those responsible for such abuses, for example the sentences in April 2012 against three 
local security commission members in Panajachel, Solol&#225;, for injuries they inflicted when 
beating up alleged criminals, and the sentence in August against the former mayor and 
president of the local security commission in San Juan Cotzal, Quich&#233;, for the torture, 
kidnapping and extrajudicial execution of Pedro Rodr&#237;guez Toma in 2009. The High 
Commissioner encourages the authorities to continue taking legal action against abuses by 
these groups and reiterates her recommendation to derogate General Order 11-99 of the 
PNC establishing local security committees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice system   
</b></p>
<p>31. Despite persistent high levels of impunity, progress was made by the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office in the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes affecting the right to 
life. The number of indictments and convictions increased on average by 7.3 per cent in 
comparison to 2011; according to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, its unit responsible for 
investigating murders increased its rate of resolution of cases from 5 to 28 per cent between 
2009 and 2012.  
</p>
<p>32. A weak professional career system persists within the judiciary and the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office. A proposed reform to the Law on the Judicial Career drafted by the 
Supreme Court of Justice with assistance from OHCHR-Guatemala has yet to be presented 
before Congress; it is expected to be presented in 2013. There is no progress in the 
separation of administrative functions from jurisdictional ones in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Regulated by General Order 11-99 of the PNC. 
 9 Established under article 24 of the Law on Urban and Rural Development Councils (Decree 11-2002).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>principle of judicial independence. Moreover, the transfers of judges ordered directly by the 
Supreme Court without the knowledge of the Judicial Career Council continues to 
undermine their independence.  
</p>
<p>33. The 2010 and 2011 legal reforms that sought to expedite penal proceedings and 
contribute to the effectiveness of the administration of justice, including through oral 
hearings and the broadening of jurisdictional competencies, have not yet had the desired 
impact. This is partly due to the lack of adequate resources of the institutions involved, 
particularly the Institute of Public Defence. To comply with the obligations established in 
the reforms, a proportional budgetary increase for the justice system is needed. 
</p>
<p>34. The delay in resolving labour conflicts is worrying, particularly the lack of 
implementation of resolutions favouring workers. The creation of a unit for the 
implementation and verification of reinstatement (Supreme Court Agreement 26-2012) is a 
step forward, but to achieve effective implementation, the unit should have nationwide 
coverage.  
</p>
<p>35. The justice system still has to transform its monocultural vision of justice, recognize 
legal pluralism, and guarantee access to justice for indigenous peoples. This includes 
providing free services that are culturally relevant and geographically accessible. 
</p>
<p>36. The Constitutional Court adopted crucial decisions, specifically developing the 
concepts of &#8213;constitutional block&#8214; and &#8213;conventionality control&#8214;, which consolidate the 
</p>
<p>Court&#8217;s function to control the consistency of laws and administrative acts with 
international human rights standards and to facilitate the interpretation of the national legal 
framework in the light of international human rights law and standards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>37. Investigation and prosecution of human rights violations committed during the 
internal armed conflict continued. On 12 March, a fifth person was convicted for the 1982 
Dos Erres massacre; on 20 March, five people were convicted for their participation in the 
1982 Plan de S&#225;nchez massacre; and on 20 August, a former police chief was convicted for 
his participation in the enforced disappearance of student Edgar S&#225;enz Calito in 1981. 
Proceedings began in September regarding the rape and sexual slavery of 15 women on a 
military base in Izabal between 1982 and 1986. On 26 January, former Head of State Efra&#237;n 
R&#237;os Montt was charged with genocide and crimes against duties of humankind, allegedly 
committed in the Ixil region between 1982 and 1983. On 21 May, he was charged in 
connection with the Dos Erres massacre. These unprecedented steps in the quest for justice 
must be sustained.  
</p>
<p>38. Despite attacks and threats, &#8213;high-risk&#8214; tribunals continued working in line with the 
State&#8217;s international obligations to investigate, prosecute and judge those responsible for 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, including intellectual authors. The security of judicial officials and 
other parties to the proceedings, including victims, witnesses and plaintiffs, needs to be 
guaranteed. The use of delay tactics by defence attorneys constituted an impediment to 
justice.  
</p>
<p>39. The High Commissioner reiterates the inadmissibility of amnesties in cases of 
serious human rights violations, and underscores that the interpretation of national 
legislation should be consistent with this principle. She salutes the fact that the Supreme 
Court reaffirmed this principle in its appeal judgment of 8 August in the Dos Erres case. It 
is hoped that the pending actions regarding the non-applicability of amnesties to serious 
crimes will be resolved in accordance with the State&#8217;s obligations under international law. </p>

</p>
<p>40. Exhumations began in February inside military facilities in Cob&#225;n, Alta Verapaz. By 
October, the remains of 466 victims, including at least 75 children, had been exhumed; 
many displayed possible signs of torture. This process, as well as the identification of three 
persons buried in a former military barrack in San Juan Comalapa, Chimaltenango, all of 
whom appear in entries in the &#8213;Military Diary&#8214;, is the result of efforts of civil society and 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to investigate and prosecute past human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>41. The archive of the Presidential Chief of Staff was transferred to the General 
Archives of Central America (AGCA). It is hoped that this will guarantee their institutional 
safekeeping. The High Commissioner underscores that sufficient resources must be 
allocated to AGCA to continue the work carried out by the Peace Archives.   
</p>
<p>42. The National Reparations Programme announced a restructuring process, aimed at 
improving transparency and implementation, focused on productive projects. A State policy 
with consistent criteria and a gender perspective should be elaborated to ensure the 
comprehensive implementation of all reparation measures, including cultural reparation, 
dignity of victims and acknowledgment by the State of the violations committed during the 
internal armed conflict. Special attention should be given to women victims of sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>43. In compliance with the High Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation, the regulation of the 
2006 Law on the Penitentiary System (Decree 33-2006) was approved; however, it lacked 
some of the necessary provisions for the implementation of the law. The penitentiary 
system continues to face serious challenges, including overcrowding (118 per cent above 
capacity), which is directly linked to the excessive recourse to pretrial detention (51 per 
cent of all inmates).10 Several riots, including one at the maximum security prison Fraijanes 
II over prison conditions and the visiting regulations in November, illustrate the neglect of 
the penitentiary system by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>44. Detention centres operated by the PNC continued to function illegally, and inmate 
violence continued. In Quetzaltenango, a detainee was beaten to death by other detainees in 
July because he was unable to pay the jail extortion fee (<i>talacha</i>). Four police officers were 
subsequently indicted for homicide by omission.  
</p>
<p>45. Detention conditions for persons with mental disabilities are of particular concern. 
Detainees and patients share the same overcrowded space and lack appropriate medical 
treatment, adequate food, water and sanitation, electricity and security. Complaints were 
made by patients, detainees and staff of sexual, physical and psychological abuse by the 
PNC, which is in charge of the inmates.  
</p>
<p>46. Detention centres for minors do not guarantee adequate conditions or rehabilitation. 
On 15 August, 40 youths accused of planning an uprising were reportedly forced to lie on 
the floor in a line and beaten by the guards at &#8213;Las Gaviotas&#8214; (the Juvenile Provisional 
Detention Centre). OHCHR-Guatemala acknowledges the important role that judges 
overseeing the implementation of correctional measures play in monitoring these situations, 
but underscores the need to ensure that perpetrators of such crimes are prosecuted.

<p><b> V. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Human Rights Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office had registered 282 attacks 
against human rights defenders through October 2012.11 The Protection Unit for Human 
Rights Defenders (UDEFEGUA) had registered a slight decrease of 10 per cent in attacks 
in the same period, although it registered 15 murders during that period. 
</p>
<p>48. These attacks particularly affect the work of defenders of economic, social, cultural 
and environmental rights, as well as indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, as evidenced in the cases of 
San Rafael las Flores, Santa Rosa; Santa Cruz Barillas, Huehuetenango; and Nebaj, Quich&#233;, 
all related to the exploitation of natural resources and a lack of consultation with and 
provision of information to the affected communities. The shooting of Yolanda Oquel&#237;, the 
leader of a community group protesting against a gold mine in San Jos&#233; del Golfo, 
Guatemala, could be ascribed to this context. Indigenous women in leadership roles, such 
as Lolita Ch&#225;vez in Santa Cruz del Quich&#233;, are victims of prejudice through numerous acts 
of stigmatization and disqualification. 
</p>
<p>49. Protests by indigenous and peasant communities and social organizations, as in the 
land conflicts in Los Regadillos, Quich&#233;; Santa Mar&#237;a Xalap&#225;n, Jalapa; San Rafael Las 
Flores, Santa Rosa; and Santa Cruz Barillas, Huehuetenango, often resulted in the use of 
disproportionate criminal charges, such as those of resistance, attack, terrorism and illegal 
association.  
</p>
<p>50. The involvement of non-State actors in practices that could result in the vulnerability 
of or direct attacks against human rights defenders needs to be investigated. In October, the 
head of security for the Guatemalan Nickel Company was indicted for the 2009 murder of a 
community leader, Adolfo Ich Cham&#225;n, in Izabal. 
</p>
<p>51. Attacks against union leaders continued during 2012. In March, Luis Ovidio Ortiz, a 
well-known leader of the health workers&#8217; union, was shot and killed in the street along with 
four others. In August, &#193;ngel Tzul, from the Palo Gordo refinery, was killed after having 
participated in a peaceful protest in which 35 workers claimed the reinstatement of union 
leaders who had been fired. No progress has been made in the resolution of these cases. 
OHCHR-Guatemala recognizes the efforts of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to systematize 
the investigations into the violent deaths of union leaders.  
</p>
<p>52. Attempts have been made in the media to discredit victims, civil society 
organizations, public prosecutors and judicial officers working on human rights abuses 
committed during the internal armed conflict. Legal actions were brought against 
journalists, human rights defenders and others, some deceased or immune from 
prosecution, alleging they were guerrilla members or accusing them of having committed 
crimes during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>53. The appearance of racist and violent content in the media and social networks 
branding defenders as terrorists and criminals increases their vulnerability. This is 
exacerbated by the absence of public recognition by the Government of the importance of 
human rights defenders&#8217; work. 
</p>
<p>54. The High Commissioner highlights the reactivation in August of the Unit for the 
Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights Defenders, as an important mechanism to carry 
out analyses on attack patterns. However, on its own, this Unit cannot replace the functions 
of a protection mechanism that should be put in place, and which could prepare a

measures.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. </b>Women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>A. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>55. Despite an overall decrease in violent death statistics, violence against women 
continued to erode Guatemalan society, as reflected by the 573 violent deaths between 
January and October.12 Brutal sexual violence against women was allegedly committed by 
an illegal group suspected of kidnapping and sexually assaulting at least 14 women in 
Guatemala City. Joint efforts of the security forces and the justice system led to the 
dismantling of this group and the detention of 19 of its members in June. A task force 
against genocide was created in January. 
</p>
<p>56. The High Commissioner welcomes the results obtained by specialized tribunals 
against femicide and other forms of violence against women. Between January and May, 
150 sentences were issued out of 424 cases filed, reducing the high rates of impunity found 
in other spheres of justice.13 Acknowledging the establishment of two more tribunals and a 
specialized appeals chamber, the High Commissioner encourages the judiciary to expand 
the national coverage of these tribunals.  
</p>
<p>57. Lack of adequate statistics from the National Information System on Violence 
against Women hindered an adequate analysis of the causes of such violence and the 
identification of possible preventive measures.   
</p>
<p>58. The Presidential Secretariat for Women and the National Coordinator for the 
Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women should continue to 
strengthen their coordination in the implementation of existing public policies as well as 
with civil society.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive rights 
</b></p>
<p>59. The number of child and adolescent pregnancies remained high. According to the 
Ministry of Health, between January and August, 38,645 adolescent pregnancies were 
registered, 1,865 of which were in girls under 14. Sixty per cent of the pregnant adolescents 
were indigenous, 70 per cent lived in poverty and 80 per cent had dropped out of school.14 
According to domestic legislation, sexual intercourse with a child under 14 constitutes rape 
and should be reported to and investigated and prosecuted by the competent authorities. 
During her visit to Guatemala in August, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography expressed concern over the high number of births 
to child mothers due to domestic sexual abuse. The inter-institutional coordination to 
address this issue should be strengthened with decisive action to prevent and combat sexual 
violence against children and adolescents.

</b></p>
<p>60. Maternal mortality is a continuing challenge, as 318 cases were reported between 
January and October, including 27 deaths of adolescents aged between 13 and 19. The three 
most affected departments are those with an indigenous majority.15 The Regulations for the 
Law on Healthy Maternity (Governmental Decree 65-2012), once approved, will promote 
access to maternal and neonatal services that are culturally appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>61. The High Commissioner welcomes the commitment expressed by the President to 
strengthen indigenous institutions and to establish a policy against discrimination and 
racism, and calls for the adoption of concrete measures in this direction. Combating racism 
and discrimination and guaranteeing the right to autonomy and free determination of 
indigenous peoples have yet to be incorporated in the legal framework of Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>62. The lack of representation of indigenous peoples in State institutions persists, 
particularly at the national level; only 22 out of 158 members of Congress, 3 out of 22 
governors and one third (111) of the mayors are indigenous. Indigenous women continue to 
be excluded from these posts. The Cabinet has only one indigenous minister&#8212;for culture 
and sports. 
</p>
<p>63. The Presidential Commission against Discrimination and Racism against Indigenous 
Peoples in Guatemala (CODISRA) and the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women 
(DEMI) require additional political leverage and adequate resources to fulfil their 
mandates. The post of Ombudsperson for Indigenous Women has been vacant since 
February. The Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Unit in the Supreme Court should be strengthened and 
</p>
<p>institutionalized.   
</p>
<p>64. The High Commissioner regrets that reforms to the General Telecommunications 
Law (Decree 94-96) were approved by Congress without discussion and participation by 
different sectors, did not ensure the principle of transparency in the concession and 
extension processes of radio frequencies, and did not regulate the ability of indigenous 
peoples to obtain and exploit radio frequencies as indicated by a Constitutional Court 
resolution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to lands and territories 
</b></p>
<p>65. To avoid the risk of potentially ungovernable situations and violence, social 
conflicts relating to the exploitation of natural resources in or around ancestral indigenous 
territories require a decisive response. Such situations should be addressed from a human 
rights perspective, focusing on the rights of indigenous peoples to property (including 
collective property), to health, and to establish their own forms of development as part of 
their right to free determination. 
</p>
<p>66. Legislation that recognizes traditional forms of collective land tenure, possession 
and use by indigenous communities needs to be adopted. The January 2012 admission and 
subsequent hearing by the Constitutional Court of a partial unconstitutionality action 
against the Civil Code, as several of its articles fail to recognize the right to communal

</p>
<p>property and the principles of ancestral tenure of indigenous peoples, was important 
progress.  
</p>
<p>67. The right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making processes in the 
exploitation of natural resources, incorporated into domestic law following the ratification 
of International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, is not guaranteed by the State. The voluntary 
agreement to increase royalties signed between the Government and the mining sector in 
May16 and the reforms to the Mining Law presented to Congress in October are not in line 
with the State&#8217;s obligation to consult indigenous peoples. Indigenous organizations 
</p>
<p>presented an unconstitutionality action against the current Mining Law. 
</p>
<p>68. Legal gaps and deficiencies in the procedures to grant licences persisted. The 
approval process of environmental-impact studies lacks the consultation required by 
international standards, and although Governmental Decree 431-2007 contemplates the 
realization of social-impact studies, these are not demanded by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>69. The Ministry of Energy and Mines announced an increase of 600 megawatts in the 
energy grid in the next five years. While this is an important initiative for providing 
sustainable energy resources, indigenous territories are especially affected, and indigenous 
people must therefore be consulted. There is an opportunity to guarantee this right in the 14 
projects pending approval and to reopen a dialogue on projects already approved.  
</p>
<p>70. In addition to the 276 exploitation licences and 111 exploration licences that have 
already been granted and the 734 pending requests, and in line with plans and policies 
presented in 2012, the Ministry of Energy and Mines granted 7 exploration licenses without 
consultation with indigenous peoples. As the majority of those projects are located in 
indigenous territories, the High Commissioner calls on the State to respect all individual 
and collective rights of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of such policies, including the 
right to consultation in granting individual licences. The Government reported that it had 
initiated the process of drafting a law and regulation on consultation, taking into account 
regional good practices. 
</p>
<p>71. Indigenous communities carried out three &#8213;good-faith community consultations&#8214;, 
and another two were carried out by multi-ethnic communities, for a total of 74 
consultations undertaken since 2005, which resulted in the rejection of the exploitation of 
natural resources in their territories.  
</p>
<p>72. The analysis developed by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples in his 2012 report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/21/47) provides important 
criteria that should be taken into account before granting licenses for exploitation of natural 
resources. Such criteria include the need for both the Government and the companies to 
take into account social and political factors in relation to projects, beyond respect for the 
State&#8217;s duty to consult with indigenous peoples, and the realization of environmental-
impact studies. This &#8213;social licence&#8214;17 is essential to build confidence for constructive and 
good-faith dialogue among all actors involved and to prevent possible problematic 
situations.

<p><b> VIII. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>73. The High Commissioner acknowledges that the creation of the Ministry of Social 
Development (MIDES) provided the legal and institutional frameworks for the 
Government&#8217;s social programmes, in line with her previous recommendations.18 She also 
highlights the efforts made to improve transparency through a register of beneficiaries, 
transfers through the banking system, and the creation of a digital system to deliver the &#8213;Mi 
</p>
<p>bolsa segura&#8214; programme. To maintain the 2011 level of coverage and address the high 
levels of poverty (53.71 per cent, with 13.33 per cent in extreme poverty),19 the budget 
allotted to MIDES, which amounted to only 2.07 per cent of the total budget and 0.31 per 
cent of GDP, should be progressively increased.20 Until October, the &#8213;Mi bono seguro&#8214; 
programme had delivered assistance to 543,870 people in 262 municipalities, although the 
register of beneficiaries reached 746,682.21   
</p>
<p>74. The High Commissioner welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to combat 
malnutrition through the Zero Hunger Programme, aimed at reducing chronic malnutrition 
by 10 per cent by 2015. The Programme gave visibility to the chronic malnutrition of 
children as a national problem, affecting mainly the rural indigenous population.   
</p>
<p>75. The Zero Hunger Programme focuses on immediate factors of malnutrition, but goes 
beyond a vision that is restricted to health, and addresses some long-term factors, such as 
low income, lack of basic water and sanitary infrastructure, and means of production. There 
has also been more inclusion of the participant bodies of the National System of Food and 
Nutritional Security as well as a strengthening of municipal decision-making bodies.  
</p>
<p>76. However, the programme met with financial and operational obstacles. An official 
study conducted with the technical assistance of the United Nations country team inter-
agency working group on food indicated that the total budget needed for the 
implementation of the programme in the 166 prioritized municipalities would be four times 
higher than foreseen.22 Challenges remain regarding coordination and execution of funds by 
relevant ministries, particularly in the most excluded rural areas.23  
</p>
<p>77. The rural indigenous protest march carried out between 19 and 27 March placed 
structural problems of rural development at the centre of the political agenda.24 The 
President, recognizing the historic State debt to indigenous and peasant communities in 
promoting equitable development, initiated negotiations with protesters, opening a path 
towards a possible solution in four conflicts, including the one relating to the families 
evicted from the Polochic Valley in 2011.25 No agreements were reached on general issues, 
such as a moratorium on the granting of mining licenses and the agrarian debt relief linked

<p>to the Land Fund programme to provide land to peasant communities. The Government 
later offered to absorb 75 per cent of the debt. The Presidential Commissioner for Rural 
Development gave strong support to the rural economy within the framework of the 
National Policy on Comprehensive Rural Development. As it currently devotes only 15.93 
per cent of its budget to this area,26 the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food should 
realign its financial and operational priorities to sustain this effort. Specific programmes for 
the 37.1 per cent of rural families who do not have access to land should be elaborated in 
line with the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to 
Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security.27 To ensure a solid legal and 
institutional framework for the full implementation of the National Policy, Congress should 
adopt draft law 4084 on comprehensive rural development without delay. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>78. Since 74.5 per cent of the jobs in Guatemala are considered informal employment,28 
in an effort to foster formal employment, the Ministry of Labour&#8217;s budget was increased by 
15.62 per cent. The Ministry allocated a substantive amount of the new resources to 
strengthen the General Labour Inspectorate by hiring 100 inspectors. Efforts were made to 
optimize the work of its offices through the separation of administrative from substantive 
functions and by expanding its inspectorate functions. Deficiencies of the Inspectorate 
remain in monitoring, particularly as regards agricultural workers&#8217; rights. Only 6 per cent of 
temporary agricultural workers earn the minimum wage (Q 2,324 per month), and 70 per 
cent receive less than Q 1,000 per month.29 There is an important difference between the 
current minimum wage and the cost of the basic food basket (Q 4,668.61 per month).30 
Only 3 per cent of temporary agricultural workers receive a wage that is sufficient to satisfy 
their basic needs. The National Wages Commission announced a 5 per cent increase in the 
minimum wage for 2013. Legislative reforms being discussed in Congress to allow part-
time employment in this sector may further undermine the right to an adequate salary. 
</p>
<p>79. The May 2012 labour dispute in four African-palm producing companies in 
Sayaxch&#233;, Pet&#233;n illustrates the difficulties faced by agricultural workers in receiving the 
minimum wage, as well as the challenges for the General Labour Inspectorate to ensure 
respect for labour rights in the agricultural sector. Despite workers&#8217; complaints, including 
</p>
<p>against the failure to comply with the minimum wage, the use of subcontractors, poor 
transportation and child labour, the Inspectorate faced obstacles in inspecting these 
companies. It was only when 14,000 workers blocked the companies&#8217; entrances that 
measures were taken and the management agreed to pay the minimum wage and improve 
working conditions. The Government set up a dialogue table with the participation of all 
parties. The National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labour and a roadmap for 
this objective were also launched.

<p><b> B. Evictions 
</b></p>
<p>80. The adoption of a protocol on evictions by the Ministry of the Interior is a positive 
step. However, it is still necessary to reform articles 256 and 257 of the Penal Code on the 
crime of usurpation and to adopt a comprehensive protocol that is binding for the judiciary 
and all the institutions in the Executive involved in evictions. OHCHR-Guatemala 
continued to monitor violent evictions, such as the eviction of 325 people in Cahab&#243;n, Alta 
Verapaz, in November. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office adopted a new General Instruction 
that places evictions as a precautionary measure which may be requested by the prosecutor 
and ordered by a judge before a public hearing during criminal proceedings relating to the 
aforementioned articles.31 These articles, amended in 1996, are incompatible with due-
process guarantees, in particular the rights to an adequate defence and presumption of 
innocence<b>.  
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala  
</b></p>
<p>81. OHCHR-Guatemala carried out 70 monitoring missions, and met with authorities, 
civil society organizations, victims and their families and witnesses. The office followed up 
on allegations of human rights violations concerning labour rights; rights of indigenous 
peoples; insecurity and social conflict; deprivation of liberty; persons with disabilities; due 
process and judicial guarantees; access to land; violence against women; and attacks on 
human rights defenders, among others. 
</p>
<p>82. OHCHR-Guatemala monitored the selection of the Human Rights Ombudsman, the 
Director of INACIF, and the rapporteurs of the NPM, as well as judicial proceedings in 
emblematic cases. 
</p>
<p>83. The office was invited to witness negotiations between authorities and indigenous 
leaders relating to the March demonstration, and followed up other cases of social and rural 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>84. OHCHR-Guatemala conducted an assessment of possibilities for strengthening the 
institution of the Human Rights Ombudsman and its regional offices and supported the visit 
of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>85. Technical assistance was provided to Congress for reforms of anticorruption 
measures; legislation relating to migrants; implementation of the Rome Statute; ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights; acceptance of the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination in accordance with article 14 of its governing Convention; and for the 
constitutional reform. Assistance was also provided to the Supreme Court for reforms to the 
Law on the Judicial Career, and to the Ministry of Labour on a protocol to strengthen the 
General Labour Inspectorate. 
</p>
<p>86. Training for the School of Judicial Trainers continued, and programmes targeting 
judges for children and adolescents and High-Risk Tribunals were launched. The office 
provided the Constitutional Court with documents on human rights standards; continued the 
training programme for its legal clerks, supported the thematic systematization of 
international human rights standards for its website, and organized a roundtable discussion 
with the magistrates.

</p>
<p>87. OHCHR-Guatemala continued to build capacities in the areas of transitional justice, 
discrimination, women&#8217;s rights, and rights of indigenous peoples for the Unit for Amparos 
of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. Together with civil society organizations, a curriculum 
was created for prosecutors in the Human Rights Unit. 
</p>
<p>88. Training was given to Ministry of Energy and Mines staff on international human 
rights standards and the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>89. Support was provided to the Presidential Secretariat for Women in the preparation of 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and to the 
State delegation before the Human Rights Committee. The office assisted State institutions 
and civil society organizations in the preparation of the first State report to the Committee 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the universal periodic review reports. 
</p>
<p>90. With civil society organizations, OHCHR-Guatemala organized a seminar on 
comprehensive protection of human rights defenders in Mexico and Central America. The 
office participated in the launch of the report of the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights on persons deprived of liberty; a forum on challenges to implementation of the 
Rome Statute; and a forum on strategic human rights litigation in Latin America. Together 
with the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), a 
virtual course on citizen security was launched for members of Congress.  
</p>
<p>91. Support was provided in the creation of a human rights course at San Carlos 
University, and workshops were carried out in Santa Cruz del Quich&#233; for the 
implementation of the &#8213;Guide to the use of indicators on the right to access to justice that is 
culturally relevant for indigenous peoples&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>92. OHCHR-Guatemala convened the Working Group on Transitional Justice, provided 
advice to the UNDP Transitional Justice Programme and participated in United Nations 
inter-agency working groups and the establishment of the Peacebuilding Fund. 
</p>
<p>93. Meetings with indigenous actors were organized to analyse the recommendations 
made during the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit and to discuss the proposed constitutional 
reform. The office organized jointly with the Guatemalan independent expert of the 
Permanent Forum of Indigenous Peoples and UNDP four regional meetings to evaluate the 
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in 
view of the 2014 World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>94. Within the framework of the Maya Programme (financed by the Government of 
Norway), implementation of 18 strategic litigation projects continued, as did the 
Programme on Technical Capacity-Building in Strategic Litigation for the Human Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, in collaboration with the Mariano G&#225;lvez, San Carlos and Rafael 
Land&#237;var Universities.  
</p>
<p>95. Through press releases, opinion pieces and interviews, OHCHR-Guatemala 
promoted public debates on relevant human rights topics. It presented and disseminated the

45,000 copies of human rights publications. An illustrated book and an audio book of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the manuals <i>Girls and Boys have 
Rights</i> for primary school children and <i>Youth with Rights</i>, written for secondary school 
students, were published.

supported various cultural activities, including the Seventh Theatre Exhibit for Human 
Rights, with the theme &#8213;For a culture of peace&#8214;; the Film Festival on Sexual Diversity, with

<p><b> X. Follow-up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>97. The High Commissioner acknowledges the ratification of the Rome Statute, the 
adoption of the tax laws and the creation of MIDES, in line with her previous 
recommendations. However, despite this progress, most of her past recommendations are 
still pending.  
</p>
<p>98. Ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the recognition 
of the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and 
accession to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, are pending in Congress. 
</p>
<p>99. Strengthening the professional careers of judges and prosecutors is urgent. Despite 
progress in reducing crime rates, further measures should be in place to protect the right to 
life and integrity, mainly through strengthening the PNC and controlling firearms 
possession. Efforts should also be made to implement the recommendations on monitoring 
and law-enforcement mechanisms relating to labour conditions. Recommendations on 
justice, on the fight against racism and discrimination and on consultation with indigenous 
people are also pending.
