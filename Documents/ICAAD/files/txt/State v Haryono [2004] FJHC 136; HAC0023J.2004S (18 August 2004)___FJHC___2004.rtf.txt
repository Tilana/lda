CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL CASE NO: HAC0023 OF 2003S

STATE

v.

SLAMET HARYONO

Hearing: 10th August 2004
Judgment: 18th August 2004

Counsel: Ms K. Bavou for State
Ms B. Malimali for Accused

JUDGMENT

The three assessors have given their unanimous opinions that the accused is not guilty of either murder or manslaughter. Their decision is possible on the facts on the basis that they believe that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the accused who stabbed Agus Sunarto.

I concur with their opinions and I acquit him accordingly. You may stand down.
