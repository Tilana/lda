<p><b>8/&#8230; Elimination of discrimination against persons affected  
 by leprosy and their family members 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including article 1, 
which states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that they are 
endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of 
brotherhood, </p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, including article 12,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to enjoy the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to enjoy the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (A/58/427), in which he reported that persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members often suffer stigma and discrimination born of 
ignorance and prejudice,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that more than 16 million people affected by leprosy have been cured 
worldwide since the 1980s and that leprosy as a disease has been scientifically and medically 
proven to be curable and manageable,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that tens of millions of people and their family members still suffer from 
leprosy not only as a disease but also from political, legal, economic or social discrimination and 
ostracization due to society&#8217;s lack of knowledge and misguided notions, such as that leprosy is 
incurable or hereditary, and that the issue of leprosy is not only a matter of medicine or health 
but can also give rise to a clear violation of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the previous work done by the Commission on Human Rights and its 
mechanism on discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members,  
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging </i>States to share best practices on combating discrimination against persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members and also on their efforts to ensure full recovery 
from and management of this disease, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be treated 
as individuals with dignity and are entitled to all basic human rights and fundamental freedoms 
laid down in customary international law, relevant conventions and national constitutions and 
laws; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> Governments to take effective measures to eliminate any type of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, including 
awareness-raising; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
include the issue of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members 
as an important matter in its human rights education and awareness-promotion activities;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to collect information on the measures that Governments have taken to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and, if 
extrabudgetary funding is available, to hold a meeting to exchange views among relevant actors, 
including Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, 
specialized agencies and programmes, non-governmental organizations, scientists, medical 
experts as well as representatives of persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and 
to submit a report to the Council and the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to examine the report 
referred to in paragraph 4 above, and to formulate a draft set of principles and guidelines to 
eliminate discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and to 
submit it to the Council for its consideration by September 2009; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue based on these reports submitted to the Council in 
September 2009.
