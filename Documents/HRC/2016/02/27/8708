<p><i>Summary 
</i> This report analyses the progress made by Brazil in implementing recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
following his visit to the country from 4-14 November 2007 (A/HRC/11/2/Add.2). During 
his visit, the Special Rapporteur documented widespread killings by on-duty police, by off-
duty police participating in death squads and militias, killings in prisons, and pervasive 
impunity. 
</p>
<p> The Government deserves significant credit for implementing a number of important 
reforms since 2007 to address these issues. Federal ministries have endorsed a set of human 
rights guidelines (&#8220;Programa Nacional de Direitos Humanos 3&#8221;), which incorporate some 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, demonstrating the commitment of the 
federal Government to bring human rights into the core of the State&#8217;s planning and to 
productively engage with special procedures. In addition, the federal Government has 
specifically stated that it is committed to reducing deaths resulting from police actions. 
Tangible measures taken by the federal or state Governments include increasing police 
salaries, investigating militias, arresting death squad members, promoting a sustained 
police presence in some favelas, and creating a task force in Rio de Janeiro to address 
prison overcrowding, a major cause of prison violence. In S&#227;o Paulo, an important proposal

<p>has been made that, if passed, would permit a special group of prosecutors to investigate 
police killings. 
</p>
<p> However, no concrete action has been taken on many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
other recommendations.  In fact, extrajudicial killings remain widespread, and the numbers 
of killings by police continue at unacceptably high levels. Police officers are responsible 
for unlawful killings of suspected criminals and others, through the use of excessive force 
or targeted killings in poorly conceived and counter-productive police operations. Militias 
and death squads continue to operate with the participation of both current and former 
members of the police, and sometimes with links to senior officials and politicians. Overall, 
the norm remains that citizens, especially residents of favelas, remain hostage to violence 
from gangs, militias and the police. Few of the perpetrators are prosecuted or convicted, 
especially when they are police officers. In addition, gangs reign supreme in the prisons, 
leading to continued violence and deaths in penitentiaries throughout the country.

<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with established practice, this follow-up report was prepared on the 
basis of all available information. The Special Rapporteur requested information from the 
Government and from other actors on the steps that had been taken to implement his 
recommendations. Information on the non-implementation of recommendations was also 
sought. In addition, information was sought on the current situation concerning 
extrajudicial executions in the country, and particularly on whether and how the situation 
had improved, deteriorated or remained static since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The 
Government of Brazil provided information to the Special Rapporteur, which he has 
reviewed closely and taken into full account in the preparation of this report. Extensive 
consultations were also undertaken with domestic and international civil society groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. This follow-up report is an important component of one of the principal working 
methods of the Special Rapporteur &#8211; conducting country visits to investigate allegations of 
violations of the right to life. Country visits provide an opportunity to ascertain the facts on 
a first-hand basis, to analyze in detail the forms and causes of unlawful killings, and to 
engage in constructive dialogue with the country concerned. Following the visit, the Special 
Rapporteur prepares a detailed report on his findings, including recommendations directed 
at reducing unlawful killings and promoting accountability. Country visits can only achieve 
their full potential if governments give careful consideration to these recommendations. 
Accordingly, the Commission on Human Rights requested States to carefully examine 
recommendations and to report to the Special Rapporteur on actions taken on the 
recommendations (2004/37). 
</p>
<p>3. In order to assess the extent to which States had implemented recommendations, in 
2006, the Special Rapporteur initiated follow-up reports on visits conducted. The first 
follow-up report (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2) concerned the recommendations made by his 
predecessor, Asma Jahangir, on her visits to Brazil, Honduras, Jamaica, and the Sudan. In 
2008, a follow-up report (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3) was issued on the first two missions 
conducted by Special Rapporteur Philip Alston to Sri Lanka and Nigeria. In 2009, follow-
up reports were issued on Guatemala (A/HRC/11/2/Add.7), and the Philippines 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.8). The present report accompanies a follow-up report on the Central 
African Republic (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5). 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is especially grateful to Sarah Knuckey, as well as to Erika 
Sasson and Nishant Kumar, from the Project on Extrajudicial Executions at the Center for 
Human Rights and Global Justice, New York University School of Law, for their excellent 
assistance in the preparation of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur visited Brazil from 4 to 14 November 2007, and his final 
report was published on 23 March 2009. His report highlighted killings by the police, 
militias and death squads as well as killings committed in prisons. 
</p>
<p>6. In his original report, the Special Rapporteur documented the high rate of killings by 
police officers while they are on duty, and analysed the causes behind such behaviour. The 
Special Rapporteur also analysed the involvement of police officers in death squads and 
militias, which are especially prevalent in S&#227;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco. 
These militias seek out neighbourhoods to control in order to extort money from citizens, 
and commit murder to maintain their territorial control. Citizens in certain parts of Brazil 
live in fear of police violence and militias just as much as they fear violence from drug-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>trafficking gangs and criminals. The Special Rapporteur also examined deaths in prisons 
and the lack of necessary oversight and protection of persons in custody. Impunity for most 
killings was rampant because of deficiencies throughout the criminal justice system, 
including with respect to police investigations, forensic analysis, prosecutors&#8217; powers, the 
judiciary, witness protection, and ombudsman offices. The Special Rapporteur proposed a 
range of recommendations to address these issues. 
</p>
<p>7. The state and federal Governments have since made noteworthy improvements in 
certain areas. There have been new efforts towards community policing in some of the 
favelas in Rio de Janeiro, and the federal Government has promised increased salaries to 
improve security in anticipation of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016. 
The State of Rio de Janeiro also conducted in-depth investigations into militias, which 
brought the reality of the problem into sharp focus and led to the arrest of many militia 
members. There have been similar arrests in S&#227;o Paulo as well as Pernambuco with respect 
to death squads. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite these improvements, some of the problems identified by the Special 
Rapporteur following his visit continue largely unabated. In particular, the numbers of 
killings by on-duty police officers remain at unacceptably high levels, with perpetrators 
continuing to enjoy impunity. From 2003 to 2009, police in Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo 
alone killed over 11,000 individuals, and the evidence suggests that many of these killings 
were unlawful. Gangs continue to dominate the prisons, with few meaningful reforms to 
address violence. Few measures were taken to improve the criminal justice system or 
accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Extrajudicial executions by police 
</b></p>
<p>9. In his 2007 report, the Special Rapporteur concluded that the police forces in Brazil 
all too often contributed to the problem of extrajudicial executions, rather than its solution. 
He described two general types of police killings: (a) on-duty police using excessive force 
in a purported effort to combat crime; and (b) off-duty police forming criminal 
organizations that also engage in killings. 
</p>
<p>10. Most of these killings occur in favelas &#8211; slum areas of major cities where 
concentrated populations are grossly economically disadvantaged and largely left without 
any state services. Predictably, poverty and years of state neglect made favelas ripe for the 
unfettered growth of violent street crime and the formation of criminal organizations. Those 
organizations, in order to maintain control of favelas and continue their unlawful activities 
(extortion, drug and weapons trafficking), engage in extensive violence &#8211; mostly against the 
residents of favelas, but also against residents in other areas of the cities, and against police 
and other officials. Brazil&#8217;s homicide rates have been notoriously high for years, and the 
victims are mostly young, male, black and poor. Between 1980 and 2002, the homicide rate 
(per 100,000 residents) nearly tripled &#8211; to a peak in 2002 of 30.4. The figures dropped in 
the following years, to 28.3 (2004), 27 (2005), and 25 (2006).1 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The homicide rate in Rio de Janeiro was significantly higher. In 2007, it was 37.71 (per 100,000, or 
</p>
<p>6,122 homicides); in 2008 it was 34.5 (5,717), and in 2009 it was 34.36 (5,794). It is important to note 
that police killings are excluded from these Government figures, and thus the actual rate is even 
higher. In his report on his 2007 mission, the Special Rapporteur noted that the number of homicides 
in S&#227;o Paulo fell from 12,638 in 2000, to 6,057 in 2006. Since his visit, the numbers have been 5,153 
(2007), 4,621 (2008), and 4,778 (2009). In Pernambuco, homicides have fallen over the last few 
years, from 4,592 (2007), 4,531 (2008), to 4,012 (2009). See Pernambuco State Social Defense 
Secretariat, &#8220;Boletins Trimestrais,&#8221; 2007, 2008, 2009. The Government credits the programme &#8220;Pacto 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>11. In this context, the police have an unenviable and daunting task in attempting to 
promote security. However, a background of extreme criminal violence does not authorize 
or justify unlawful killings by state officials. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings by on-duty police  
</b></p>
<p>12. In his 2007 report, the Special Rapporteur explained that on-duty police killings 
formed a significant proportion of all killings in Brazil.2  At that time, the Special 
Rapporteur found that police were killing criminal suspects instead of investigating and 
arresting them, and that a high number of suspected criminals and bystanders were being 
killed during brief large-scale war-style police operations in favelas. His report addressed 
two central issues: the practice of registering police killings as &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings, and the 
policing methods adopted in favelas. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. &#8220;Resistance&#8221; killings 
</b></p>
<p>13. One of the most significant issues at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was 
the way in which police classified and registered killings. It is standard practice across 
Brazil for the police to label killings they commit as &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings.3  The 
classification indicates that a person was killed while committing the crime of resisting 
arrest or disobeying other lawful orders of police. It is intended to signify that the police 
used lawful (necessary and proportionate) lethal force against a suspect. 
</p>
<p>14. However, during his 2007 visit, the Special Rapporteur gathered strong evidence 
that many of these killings were, in fact, unlawful killings, and that the practical effect of 
the &#8220;resistance&#8221; classification was to prejudice and limit objective follow-up inquiries into 
killings by police. He recommended that reducing unlawful killings by the police must start 
with abolishing this classification, and that police killings should be registered in the same 
way as any other killings and thoroughly investigated. 
</p>
<p>15. The submission from the Government to the Special Rapporteur for this follow-up 
report states that the federal Government is committed to working with relevant institutions 
to &#8220;combat&#8221; the practice of classifying police killings in this manner, that reducing police 
killings was a &#8220;fundamental objective&#8221; of the Government, and indicated that it intended to 
conduct a performance review with the Rio de Janeiro Government of the police with 
regard to such cases.4  These are very welcome announcements. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2010, however, the police continue to register cases as &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings. In 
S&#227;o Paulo, such cases have actually increased since 2007. Government statistics record 543 
&#8220;resistance&#8221; cases in 2009, 397 in 2008, and 401 in 2007.5  In Rio de Janeiro, government 
numbers indicate a decrease from 1,330 resistance killings in 2007 to 1,048 in 2009. In an 
interview reported in January 2009, the State Security Secretary of Rio de Janeiro, Jos&#233; 
Beltrame stated that police killings fell from around 80 per month at the start of 2008, to 36 
</p>
<p>  
pela Vida&#8221;, in which the Government pledged to significantly improve security in the state through 
138 different programmes in conjunction with civil society. See the Government of Pernambuco

 3 The terminology differs from region to region. In S&#227;o Paulo, the term used is <i>resist&#234;ncia seguida de 
</i></p>
<p><i>morte </i>(resistance followed by death). In Rio de Janeiro, the term is <i>autos de resist&#234;ncia </i>(acts of 
resistance).

<p>in September 2008. He was quoted as saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a big fall &#8211; show that to Mr 
Alston.&#8221;6  While the dramatic recorded fall from January 2008 to August and September 
2008 was a significant positive development, the monthly &#8220;resistance&#8221; rate jumped back up 
to the prior numbers in the following months. In October 2008, for example, there were 74 
&#8220;resistance&#8221; deaths, in January 2009 there were 94, in June 2009 there were 107, and in 
January 2010 there were 77. In fact, after October 2008, the monthly rate never fell below 
71 killings per month. 
</p>
<p>17. Some concerns have been expressed about the integrity of Rio de Janeiro 
Government statistics on resistance killings, and homicides more generally. Evidence 
suggests that incidents are being classified under different statistical categories in order to 
demonstrate a reduction in, for example, the homicide rate. Whether or not there has been 
an intentional manipulation of the statistics, the allegations highlight the need for 
independent statistics gathering. The Government should ensure that the statistics agency 
remains independent of the Security Secretariat, which currently oversees police statistics. 
An independent statistics agency should have access to police records in order to 
independently oversee the gathering of vital statistics regarding the police killings and the 
types of categorizations used to explain the incidents. 
</p>
<p>18. In the preparation of this report, the Special Rapporteur was provided with credible 
evidence that many of the reported &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings continued in fact to be unlawful 
killings covered up by the police. In one recent study, an examination of autopsy and police 
reports indicated that at least 51 &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings were in fact unlawful killings.7 In 17 
of those cases, there was evidence of point blank shots to the head, contradicting the police 
claim that the victims had been killed in &#8220;shootouts&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur was provided 
evidence of the various methods by which police attempted to cover up their killings, 
including by disrupting crime scenes and taking deceased victims to hospital for 
&#8220;treatment&#8221;.8  The very disproportionate numbers of killings <i>by </i>and <i>of </i>police also suggest 
that claims of shootouts may often be false. In 2009, for example, Rio de Janeiro recorded 
1,048 resistance killings, and 31 on-duty police killed. This is a ratio of 34:1, far greater 
than would normally be expected if police were shooting in self-defence in 
&#8220;confrontations&#8221; with armed criminals. The study provided to the Special Rapporteur 
compares police killings between Rio de Janeiro, S&#227;o Paulo, South Africa, and the United 
States of America. Particularly concerning is comparative data on the number of police 
killings compared to the general homicide rate. According to this study, for every 100 
homicides in 2008, the Rio de Janeiro police killed 19.89 people. The S&#227;o Paulo police 
killed 8.46. The rates in South Africa (2.58) and the United States of America (2.62) were 
dramatically lower.9 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Large-scale police operations in favelas 
</b></p>
<p>19. In 2007, the Special Rapporteur documented unlawful killings committed during 
brief large-scale police operations involving hundreds of police, armoured vehicles and 
attack helicopters &#8220;invading&#8221; favelas. These brief &#8220;war&#8221;-like operations, while

</p>
<p>police killings. In the United States of America, police arrested 37,751 people for every one person 
they killed. In Rio de Janeiro, the police arrested 23 people for every one person killed; in S&#227;o Paulo, 
the rate was 348. Ibid., p. 34. </p>

</p>
<p>appropriately aimed at dismantling gang control of favelas and promoting security for 
residents, have proven to be both ineffective and counterproductive. Confiscations of drugs 
and arms and arrests of gang members are often minimal, and because police forces 
withdraw quickly, the gangs simply re-establish themselves and punish residents who were 
seen as helping the police. One of the best-known examples was the Complexo do Alem&#227;o 
operation in June 2007. Despite the use of over 1,400 police, the operation was a failure 
from a crime-control perspective, and resulted in the deaths of 19 people.10 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur detailed in his original report the reasons for the failure of 
such operations, and recommended that the Government eschew large-scale &#8220;mega&#8221; 
operations in favour of a planned and sustained police presence, coordinated with the 
provision of social services.11  
</p>
<p>21. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission, the Rio de Janeiro Government has 
introduced Unidades de Pol&#237;cia Pacificadora (UPPs, &#8220;Pacifying Police Units&#8221;) into a small 
number of favelas in the city of Rio de Janeiro. These units are a sustained police presence 
in each favela, and aim to re-take control from gangs, and promote security in the long 
term. The UPP experiment is currently under way in seven favelas.12  The officers deployed 
are given special training, including human rights training, and increased salaries. The Rio 
de Janeiro Government plans to have some 3,500 police in 15 UPPs by the end of 2010, and 
intends to ultimately extend UPPs to 100 favelas, at a rate of at least 10 new favelas per 
year. 
</p>
<p>22. This new strategy is largely to be commended. Where it has been implemented, it 
represents a significant departure from the &#8220;war&#8221; approach of the brief, large-scale, violent 
operations. The UPP approach avoids the &#8220;shoot-out&#8221; scenarios that so often result from 
rapid, heavily armed police incursions into the favelas. According to information provided 
to the Special Rapporteur, for those favelas under UPPs, the Government has made real 
progress in preventing gangs from re-asserting their presence. There is also strong evidence 
to date of community support for the UPPs.13  Residents have reported that they feel safer, 
and that relationships with police have improved. In some areas, there have also been 
improvements to the provision of basic services. 
</p>
<p>23. Notwithstanding these positive developments, concerns have been expressed about 
the way in which the UPPs have been conducted. The government language used to 
describe UPPs is heavily laced with warlike terminology &#8211; they &#8220;invade&#8221; a favela, and 
maintain an &#8220;occupation&#8221;. Some civil society members expressed concerns that this policy 
will continue to criminalize favela residents who will be living under de facto militarized 
police control. There has been concern about harassment of residents, through increased 
searches and seizures, and heavy police control over the daily lives of residents, including 
by banning popular music concerts and funk dance parties. Some interlocutors also 
expressed concern that the promised social services, including those related to education, 
health, and sports activities, were slow to be implemented, and that residents&#8217; associations 
were not always consulted on social projects. The Government must ensure that its retaking 
of favelas includes both improved security for residents, as well as the provision of basic

of those surveyed in 2009 in the Santa Marta and Cidade de Deus favelas approved of the UPP.

the UPPs should take place, to provide an unbiased account of their successes, and areas 
where improvement is needed. 
</p>
<p>24. It is also important to recognize that community policing and a sustained police 
presence in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro is the exception, rather than the norm. The UPPs 
are only in a small number of the roughly 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, and large-scale 
violent operations resulting in deaths continue in non-UPP favelas. For example, it has been 
reported that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A December 2008 operation in Favela Mare resulted in 4 deaths.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; A February 2009 operation in Coreia, Taquaral, Rebu and Vila Alian&#231;a favelas, 
involving 300 police, resulted in 9 deaths.

<p>&#8226; A March 2009 operation in A&#231;o, Salgueiro, and Duque de Caxias favelas led to 9 
deaths.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; An April 2009 operation involving 100 officers led to 8 deaths in Santa Theresa and 
Estacio. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A May 2009 operation in Manguinhos favela involving 170 officers resulted in 4 
deaths, and one wounded officer.

<p>&#8226; A June 2009 operation in Mare resulted in 7 deaths, including of 2 officers. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A July 2009 operation in Mangueira involving 100 officers led to 4 deaths.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; An August 2009 operation in Morro do Juramento involving 80 officers, led to 9 
deaths and 5 wounded police. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A September 2009 operation in Morro do Juramento involving 50 police backed by 
a helicopter, led to 4 deaths, and the wounding of 2 news cameramen.

<p>&#8226; A February 2010 operation in Jacarezinho led to 8 deaths, including that of 1 officer.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by off-duty police  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Militias and para-policing 
</b></p>
<p>25. As noted in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report on Brazil, militias are groups 
composed of military and civil police, ex-police, firefighters, prison guards, and private 
citizens who attempt to &#8220;take over&#8221; geographical areas, and engage in extra-state 
&#8220;policing&#8221;.14 These groups are responsible for extrajudicial executions and other violent 
crimes including torture and kidnapping. As with criminal gangs, their violence is largely 
compelled by efforts to exercise geographic control in order to make a profit by extorting 
&#8220;protection money&#8221; from communities and the provision of services such as illegal cable 
television, household gas and transportation. 
</p>
<p>26. Since the Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, militias in Rio de Janeiro have been the subject of 
significant and much-needed attention. At the time of his visit in 2007, it was generally 
believed that militias were in control of roughly 92 favelas in Rio de Janeiro city. 
Following public outrage over the kidnapping and torture of three undercover journalists by

</p>
<p>a militia in May 2008,15 two militia members were arrested and the state Government set up 
a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry to investigate militias in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>
<p>27. Led by state deputy Marcelo Freixo, the Commission published a lengthy report in 
November 2008.16  It concluded that 171 areas in Rio de Janeiro were dominated by 
militias, nearly double the number previously thought to exist, and it was able to discover 
the identities of militia members, the communities under militia rule and the nature of 
profits engendered by militia activities. The Commission uncovered extensive evidence of 
official state involvement in militias, including election-related corruption, official 
membership in militias, and militias benefiting from the use of public resources (such as 
weapons and cars). 
</p>
<p>28. In response, the Government took a number of important steps. Two hundred 
suspected militia members were arrested, including a state deputy17  Certain militias, such 
as the Liga da Justi&#231;a (&#8220;Justice League&#8221;) were particularly hard hit. The Government also 
created a task force within the police to specifically investigate militias. According to 
information provided by interlocutors, this task force has kept up sustained pressure on key 
militias. 
</p>
<p>29. Given the extent of militia activity and control, these actions are important, but they 
constitute just the beginning. Militias continue to seek control of territory and of state 
politics, and remain a major threat to security in Rio de Janeiro. Many militias remain 
untouched, and recent examples of militia violence abound. In August 2009, seven 
residents of the Barbante favela were shot dead by members of a militia, and one victim 
was killed for refusing to pay the militia&#8217;s security &#8220;tax&#8221;.18  In the same month, a member 
of Governor Cabral&#8217;s personal security detail was arrested on charges of alleged 
participation in a militia that had recently murdered four people.19  In a raid on the Rio das 
Pedras militia, Brazilian authorities discovered the militia&#8217;s plans to assassinate state 
deputy Marcelo Freixo.20 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Death squads 
</b></p>
<p>30. Death squads, extermination groups, and vigilante groups are often formed by police 
along with others whose goal is to kill, generally for profit. These groups are also known to 
justify their actions as an extralegal &#8220;crime-fighting&#8221; tool.21 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report focused largely on death squads in Pernambuco. 
During his 2007 mission, he was provided with evidence that 70 per cent of homicides in 
Pernambuco were committed by death squads. Pernambuco has taken significant steps to 
address this problem. On 29 January 2009, the state Government announced that about 30 
police operations carried out since late 2007 had resulted in some 400 people being

<p>imprisoned for their participation in death squads.22  The scope of death squad activity is so 
expansive, however, that intensive investigations and arrests will need to continue for many 
years if it is to succeed. 
</p>
<p>32. Efforts to combat death squads have been met with violent resistance. Human rights 
activist and former city councilor Manoel Mattos had been active in denouncing deaths 
squads in Pernambuco and Paraiba for many years, and, following repeated threats on his 
life, was shot to death in his home on 24 January 2009.23  
</p>
<p>33. For this report, the Special Rapporteur was also presented with evidence of 
significant death squad activity in S&#227;o Paulo. According to the S&#227;o Paulo Police 
Ombudsman, in 2008 there were 97 cases of suspected death squad killings, and 61 cases in 
2009.24  In January 2008, Colonel Jose Herminio Rodrigues was shot to death on the street 
after he began an investigation into death squads in northern S&#227;o Paulo which appeared to 
involve over 50 military police.25 In a positive step, 14 members of the military police were 
arrested in 2009 for links to 12 murders committed by the &#8220;Highlanders&#8221;, a death squad 
infamous for decapitating its victims.26 
</p>
<p>34. In another positive move, the Government of Paraiba recently launched an 
investigation into a death squad allegedly responsible for some 300 murders over the last 
decade.27 The group involved 30-40 active and retired police officers, from regular officers 
to a colonel and including corrections officers, who were operating on behalf of the jailed 
members of a drug trafficking gang. At the time of writing, none of the police officers has 
been arrested, although the investigation is ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Police salaries 
</b></p>
<p>35. In his report, the Special Rapporteur explained that police participation in organized 
criminal activity was at the extreme end of a spectrum of police activity that began with 
extortion and the taking of prohibited second jobs, generally in the security sector. Much of 
this activity was motivated by the poor pay that police received. It was also easy for police 
to take second jobs because of their shift structure, and the reluctance of commanders to 
discipline police for doing so. Consistent with this analysis, Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Commission 
into militias specifically identified inadequate police salaries as a cause for police 
participation in militias.28 
</p>
<p>36. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Brazilian Federal Government has taken 
some important steps to increase police salaries. In November 2009, President Lula stated 
that adequate pay was the key way to prevent officers from accepting bribes and engaging 
in other unlawful activity, and he announced a new career plan for the Federal District 
whereby the Government would hire 3,000 new officers and would promote 12,000 current

<p>officers.29  In anticipation of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016, 
President Lula also announced an increase in police salaries by providing for a Bolsa Copa 
(World Cup Grant) and a Bolsa Ol&#237;mpica (Olympic Grant). For the Bolsa Copa, which will 
be paid to both firefighters and police in the lead up to the World Cup, the increase begins 
in 2010 with 550 reais, increasing in 2011 to 665 reais, in 2012 to 760 reais, in 2013 to 865 
reais and finally to an extra 1,000 reais for 2014.30 The Bolsa Ol&#237;mpica will be fixed at 
1,200 reais for all civil and military police. In order for any police officer to receive the 
grant, the officer must attend one training course per year. 
</p>
<p>37. However, the negative consequences of low police salaries also exist outside of Rio 
de Janeiro, independently of the upcoming sporting events. Brazilian police staged strikes 
in early 2010 in order to protest unequal salary differentials between Federal District police 
and military police nationwide.31 In February 2010, the police demanded a national 
minimum wage to ensure that police officers across the country receive pay increases. 
</p>
<p>38. As part of a strategy to improve the police forces through salary increases, 
professional police tactics and human rights training must also be on the agenda. The 
Olympic and World Cup Grants described above link increased salaries and advanced 
training to a minor extent. However, the training must be serious and of high quality in 
order to rectify the systematic use of excessive force. Interlocutors provided information to 
the effect that in Pernambuco, for example, training courses for military police officers in 
2009 were deficient in a number of respects. The four-month course decreased from 1,246 
hours in 2004 to only 800 hours in 2009. Classes were crowded, there was insufficient 
training on self-defence techniques and expert training with firearms, just three hours of 
training on the preservation of evidence at a crime scene, and no training on dealing with 
vulnerable groups in society. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any changes having been made to the 
policing shift structure. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Killings in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>40. During his 2007 mission, the Special Rapporteur investigated killings in prisons, 
which generally take place during riots or gang-related inmate violence. In his report, he 
analysed in detail the reasons behind prison violence in Brazil. These include severe 
overcrowding and poor conditions, and especially the practice of giving responsibility for 
internal prison management to gangs or powerful prisoners. Tasks such as internal 
discipline and the distribution of food and medicine are generally left to inmates. 
Independent external oversight of prisons is minimal, and prisoners are afraid to report 
abuses. In all but a very small number of specially designed &#8220;neutral&#8221; prisons, prisoners are 
required by prison administration officials to pick a gang identity upon arrival. 
</p>
<p>41. In response to the resulting crisis, the Special Rapporteur made a number of 
recommendations, including that gang affiliations should not be forced upon new inmates; 
the number of neutral prisons should be increased; prison oversight should take place

<p>regularly and be visible to inmates; prison authorities should reassert control of internal 
prison administration; inmate records should be recorded electronically; and overcrowding 
should be reduced by, for example, increasing the use of alternative sentences. 
</p>
<p>42. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit there have been some positive developments. 
The Government provided information on a new law that was passed in December 2009 to 
establish a new &#8220;Department of Monitoring and Oversight of the Penitentiary System.&#8221;  It is 
too early to judge the success of this new department, but its responsibilities are to monitor 
and report on prisons.32  In Rio de Janeiro, a task force was created to address overcrowding 
by reviewing inmates&#8217; sentences and status to determine whether any should or could be 
released.33  Separately, in response to over 100 deaths in the Urso Branco Prison (Rond&#244;nia 
State) in October 2008, the Prosecutor General of Brazil petitioned the Supreme Court to 
order federal intervention in the prison. As of the writing of this report, the case was still 
pending. In Minas Gerais, a court ruled in favour of the families of 25 inmates killed by a 
fire arising from a gang dispute in 2007 and ordered the Government to pay damages.34 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was not provided with any information to indicate that the 
authorities had taken steps to regain internal control of prisons from gangs, or to improve 
conditions. On the contrary, many riots and killings have taken place since the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. In 2008, the Ministry of Justice reported that 2,000 prisoners were 
involved in riots in the federal prison system. In January 2008, in a prison in Minas Gerais, 
eight prisoners died in a fire after a guard left his post with the only key, evidence either of 
gross negligence or complicity.35 In October 2009 in Jo&#227;o Pessoa, Paraiba  state, prisoners 
protested the transfer of an inmate and set fire to their mattresses, starting a blaze in which 
7 inmates died and 48 were injured.36 In December 2009, in Rio Grande do Sul, three 
inmates burned to death when members of a rival gang entered their cell and set it alight 
and prevented their escape.37 In another case in Rio Grande do Sul, gunmen broke into a 
prison and executed a specific inmate.38 In early 2010, in Paran&#225;, gang rivalry in a prison 
led to a riot that spanned more than a day, in which 1,200 prisoners (out of 1,600) 
participated. In that incident, three people burned to death and two died from physical 
attacks.39 A few days later, in Bahia, rioters were demanding to be transferred to the capital 
and took a number of hostages, one of whom had been murdered by the time the riot ended 
50 hours later.  
</p>
<p>44. The situation for inmates in Brazil is dire and requires immediate intervention. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>45. As explained by the Special Rapporteur in his report, the reality is that there is 
impunity for most homicides, especially those committed by police officers. Today, as in 
2007, the vast majority of extrajudicial killings in Brazil do not result in arrests and 
convictions, due in large part to problems with police investigations and forensics,

</p>
<p>impediments to the work of prosecutors, the judiciary and court processes, witness 
protection, and ombudsman offices. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Police investigations and forensic evidence 
</b></p>
<p>46. During his 2007 visit, the Special Rapporteur found that police investigations, 
especially of police killings, were often inadequate. No information has been provided to 
suggest that the situation has improved. On the contrary, interlocutors provided detailed 
evidence that investigations were delayed, that police investigation records often lacked 
basic evidence (including that of eyewitnesses, or forensic evidence from the crime scene), 
and police officers involved in shootings were often questioned in a perfunctory manner. 
Forensic evidence remained poor in many cases, and the forensic institutes have not been 
made independent from the police. Similarly, police internal affairs offices are not 
independent and are thus often unable to effectively investigate police killings. In this 
respect, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the government plan, described in the 
information provided by the Government for this follow-up report, to formulate proposals 
to improve internal affairs, including by making them more &#8220;professionalized, autonomous, 
and independent&#8221;, and to create a separate career track for internal affairs officers.40 
</p>
<p><b> B. Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
</b></p>
<p>47. During his mission the Special Rapporteur observed that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office is a widely respected institution and that, where progress had been made against 
police impunity, prosecutors had often played a key role. However, their role in 
investigations, particularly important with respect to police killings, was impeded in 
practice because the Civil Police often did not notify prosecutors of crimes until after 30 
days, and because of challenges to prosecutors legal power to conduct investigations. The 
Special Rapporteur recommended that the Civil Police consult with prosecutors from the 
start of a homicide investigation, that prosecutors conduct independent inquiries where 
police were implicated in a killing, and that the right of prosecutors to conduct their own 
investigations should be clarified and affirmed. 
</p>
<p>48. Today, the Civil Police continue to delay notification of police killings to 
prosecutors for 30 days, and sometimes even longer,41 seriously undermining the ability of 
prosecutors to gather important evidence. Disputes over the legal power of prosecutors to 
investigate are ongoing at the time of this report, although the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes comments by the Government that &#8220;today the majority of Court decisions 
favours&#8221; investigations by prosecutors.42 
</p>
<p>49. There is currently no specialized prosecution unit dedicated to police killings in 
either Rio de Janeiro or S&#227;o Paulo. Instead, police killings are assigned to prosecutors on a 
geographic basis, together with other killings.43 In S&#227;o Paulo, the State Prosecutor&#8217;s office 
has a Special Action Group of External Control of Police Activities (GECEP), which has a 
mandate for police oversight, but cannot currently cover police intentional killings, or any

<p>abuses by the military police.44  The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Attorney-
General for S&#227;o Paulo has proposed that the GECEP be given the authority to investigate 
police killings, including &#8220;resistance killings&#8221; in the greater S&#227;o Paulo region. This would 
be a key step in addressing police impunity for killings. It is important that the proposal be 
approved by the college of appellate-level prosecutors, and that it have the mandate to 
investigate off-duty police killings (including those by militias and death squads), and 
killings by both civil and military police. It is also essential that it be given the necessary 
resources and staff to function effectively. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Judiciary and court processes 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was provided with no information on relevant reforms to the 
overburdened judiciary. 
</p>
<p>51. His report noted that reforms to allow some cases involving human rights violations 
to be transferred from state to federal courts (and to be investigated by federal police) held 
promise. However, the general trend has been that cases have not been transferred. An 
application to transfer the case regarding the killing of Manoel Mattos, described above, 
was pending at the time of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>52. In his report, the Special Rapporteur noted the need for an effective witness 
protection programme in order to combat impunity. He observed that many witnesses 
feared police, militia, or gang reprisals, and thus refused to come forward. 
</p>
<p>53. Some reports have indicated that detainees have been permitted to leave detention in 
order to threaten or kill witnesses to their crimes.45 In August 2008 in Pernambuco, 
indigenous leader Mozeni Ara&#250;jo de S&#225; &#8211; a witness to two murders of Truk&#225; people &#8211; was 
shot to death in broad daylight.46 Similarly, in March 2009, a military police officer was 
convicted for organizing a militia to kill seven people. Three months after the trial, four 
relatives of the main witness were reported missing.47 
</p>
<p>54. The most significant witness protection programme in Brazil is the Programa de 
Assist&#234;ncia a V&#237;timas e a Testemunhas Amea&#231;adas (PROVITA). As the Special Rapporteur 
observed, PROVITA is a model for witness protection in many respects, but requires some 
improvements. The Special Rapporteur recommended that state governments provide 
adequate, timely and reliable funding and that they ensure the police cooperate in escorting 
witnesses to court. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the federal Government 
conduct a study to determine the appropriateness of the use of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) as implementing partners for the programme.  
</p>
<p>55. To date, most state governments have disbursed fewer funds than the federal 
Government had committed to PROVITA, except S&#227;o Paulo, Cear&#225; and Esp&#237;rito Santo, 
which maintain adequate funding levels. These funding deficiencies undermine the ability 
of NGOs to fulfil their mandates, and ensure protection for witnesses. The states have also 
been slow in setting up systematic relocation programmes, which further weakens the 
objectives of PROVITA.

<p>56. In Santa Catarina, the authorities have set up specialized training for police officers 
responsible for the protection of witnesses. These police squads have become an asset to 
PROVITA as they are actively concerned with issues of relocation, risk assessment, and 
protection at court appearances. In those states that do not have specialized protection 
police officers, the effect remains predictably poor. Police officers are unfamiliar with the 
needs of the programme, and are unable to carry out its mandate most effectively. 
</p>
<p>57. The federal Government has not pursued a national study to assess the viability of 
NGOs as implementing partners. In some regions of Brazil, the refusal by the federal 
Government to engage civil society in a meaningful discussion about the structural issues at 
the heart of PROVITA has led to NGO dissent. At least one NGO has unilaterally cut ties 
with PROVITA because the Government did not address its concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Ombudsman offices 
</b></p>
<p>58. In his report, the Special Rapporteur recognized the important role for police 
ombudsman offices in contributing to police oversight, and he encouraged the Government 
to strengthen the institution through more resources, powers and independence.48 
</p>
<p>59. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the S&#227;o Paulo office has taken some important 
proactive measures to address police accountability. The office has started a project to 
quickly send information on suspected unlawful police killings to the Attorney-General, 
who forwards them to the relevant prosecutor. In this way, reporting delays by the Civil 
Police can be circumvented, and prosecutors&#8217; work can be focused on suspect cases. The 
office also makes data on police killings available on its website. 
</p>
<p>60. Generally, however, all police ombudsman offices continue to have restrictive 
mandates, independence and budgets. The Rio de Janeiro Police Ombudsman is still 
selected by the State Secretary for Security (who is also responsible for the police), and 
neither the Pernambuco or Rio de Janeiro offices appear to publicly disseminate data on 
police killings. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes the positive announcement in the information 
provided by the Government for this follow-up report that one of its strategic targets 
(within the PNDH-3 framework) is to &#8220;establish independent police ombudsman units&#8221; for 
the federal police departments.49 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> Brazil has taken a number of very important steps to address unlawful killings 
since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s November 2007 visit. In particular, Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s 
major inquiry into militias &#8211; which are often composed of police and have ties to 
officials &#8211; led to a comprehensive and wide-ranging report, as well as a number of 
arrests and prosecutions. Similarly, Pernambuco has made progress in investigating 
and arresting death squad members. In a small number of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, 
violent and counter-productive police operations have been replaced with a sustained 
police presence and the introduction of some basic services. Increases have also been 
made to some police officers&#8217; salaries, and the S&#227;o Paulo Police Ombudsman has 
taken important steps to promote accountability for police.

<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur has been greatly encouraged by Brazil&#8217;s willingness to 
receive Special Rapporteurs, to engage in dialogue with the international community, 
and its willingness to implement reforms to improve respect for human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> However, extrajudicial executions remain pervasive. Almost no steps have been 
taken to address the grave problem of on-duty police killings, or to reduce the high 
numbers of so-called &#8220;resistance&#8221; killings. Most of the killings are still never 
investigated in any meaningful way. And little action has been taken to reduce prison 
violence. Key reforms to address these problems are listed in the Appendix to this 
report. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Policing strategies  
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>State Governors, Secretaries for Public Security, and Police Chiefs and 
Commanders should take the lead to make publicly clear that there will be zero 
tolerance for the use of excessive force and the execution of suspected criminals by 
police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>2. <b>The state Government of Rio de Janeiro should eschew large-scale, or &#8220;mega&#8221;, 
operations in favour of systematic and planned progress in reasserting a sustained 
police presence and government authority in gang-controlled areas. Present policies 
are killing large numbers of people, alienating those whose support is needed for 
potential success, wasting precious resources, and failing to achieve the stated 
objectives. Designing policing strategies solely with electoral objectives in mind does a 
disservice to the police, the communities affected, and society at large.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p>3. <b>The use of armoured vehicles should be monitored by equipping them with 
audio and visual recording equipment. The results should be regularly monitored in 
cooperation with community groups</b>.  
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>4. <b>In the longer term the Government should work towards abolishing the 
separate system of military police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented, although it is presently being 
discussed by officials.  
</i></p>
<p>5. <b>The federal Government should implement more effective measures to tie state 
funding to compliance with measures aimed at reducing the incidence of extrajudicial 
executions by police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> B. Police involvement in organized crime  
</b></p>
<p>6. <b>In each State, the State Secretariat for Public Security should establish a 
reliable specialized unit to investigate and prosecute police involvement in militias and 
extermination groups.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>  
 a As contained in A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, paras. 77-100. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>7. <b>Off-duty police should under no circumstances be permitted to work for 
private security firms. To facilitate such changes: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Police should be paid significantly higher salaries;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (b) The shift structure of police work should be reformed so that police 
cannot regularly work for large blocks of time and then receive multiple days off.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> C. Police accountability  
</b></p>
<p>8. <b>Systems for tracking the use of firearms should be established in all states, and 
where some procedures already exist, they must be improved and the Government 
must ensure they are followed. The weapon and the quantity of ammunition provided 
to each policeman should be recorded, and every bullet should systematically be 
accounted for. Every instance in which a police officer fires his or her weapon should 
be investigated by internal affairs and recorded in a database. This database should 
be accessible by police ombudsman offices and used by police chiefs and commanders 
to identify police in need of closer supervision.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>9. <b>The current practice of classifying police killings as &#8220;acts of resistance&#8221; or 
&#8220;resistance followed by death&#8221; provides a carte blanche for police killing and must be 
abolished. Without prejudicing the outcome of criminal trials, such killings should be 
included in each state&#8217;s homicide statistics. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>10. <b>The federal Secretariat for Human Rights should keep a detailed database of 
human rights violations by police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>11. <b>The integrity of work by the internal affairs services of the police should be 
ensured by:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establishing a separate career path for those working in internal affairs;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establishing clear procedures and time limits for investigations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Making all information regarding investigations and recommended 
disciplinary sanctions freely accessible to ombudsman offices.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>12. <b>In cases involving police killings and other allegations of serious abuse, internal 
affairs services should publicly provide information on the status of individual cases, 
including the measures recommended to police chiefs and commanders.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>13. <b>Police under investigation for crimes constituting extrajudicial executions 
should be removed from active duty.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>14. <b>Police ombudsman offices, as they exist in most states, should be reformed so as 
to be better able to provide external oversight: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) They should report directly to the state governor rather than to the state 
secretary of public security;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) They should be provided with the resources and legal powers necessary 
to reduce dependence on information from the internal affairs services of the police 
forces;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) They should issue regular public reports providing accessible 
information on patterns of police abuse and on the effectiveness of disciplinary and 
criminal proceedings. This information should be compiled so as to enable meaningful 
comparisons across time and geographical areas;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) In order for them to provide more reliable information on the strengths 
and weaknesses of existing policing strategies in terms of both respecting and 
protecting rights, they should be provided with the resources to conduct or 
commission surveys on citizen experiences with crime and the police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> D. Forensic evidence  
</b></p>
<p>15. <b>The routine failure of police to preserve crime scenes must end; should 
problems persist, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office should use its authority to exercise 
external control of the police so as to ensure the integrity of its prosecutions.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>16. <b>Hospitals should be required to report to police precincts and police internal 
affairs all cases where the police bring a deceased criminal suspect to hospital.   
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>17. <b>State Institutes of Forensic Medicine should be made fully independent from 
public security secretariats, and expert staff should receive employment guarantees 
that ensure the impartiality of their investigations. Additional resources and technical 
training should also be provided.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> E. Witness protection  
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>In many respects, the existing witness protection programmes constitute a 
model, but reforms are also needed:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) State governments should provide adequate, timely, and reliable 
funding;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (b) State governments should ensure that police cooperate in escorting 
witnesses to court appearances in a safe and non-threatening manner;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The federal Government should conduct a study on whether there are 
ways to protect witnesses who are unwilling to comply with the current programmes&#8217; 
strict requirements, and on whether the use of NGOs as implementing partners 
should be phased out or restructured.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> F. Public prosecutors  
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>The involvement of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in building criminal cases 
must be strengthened:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) State governments should ensure that the Civil Police notify public 
prosecutors at the outset of investigations so that prosecutors can provide timely 
guidance on what evidence must be gathered in order to obtain a conviction;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (b) The legal authority of public prosecutors to independently gather 
evidence admissible in court should be unequivocally affirmed;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (c) Public prosecutors should routinely conduct their own investigations into 
the lawfulness of killings by the police.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> G. Judiciary and legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>The period of prescription (statutory period of limitation) for intentional 
crimes against life should be abolished.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>21. <b>Recognizing that permitting persons convicted of murder by a trial court to 
remain free while their appeal is ongoing facilitates the intimidation of witnesses and 
fosters a sense of impunity, judges should give careful consideration to alternative 
interpretations of the norm guaranteeing the &#8220;presumption of innocence&#8221; found in 
foreign and international jurisprudence.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b>22. The National Council of Justice and other appropriate bodies should take 
measures to ensure that:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) In making docket management decisions, judges do not put off dealing 
with cases involving killings by powerful actors, including the police, or prioritize civil 
above criminal cases;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Judges of penal execution conduct prison inspections pursuant to a 
written protocol which requires private interviews with prisoners randomly selected 
by the judge.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> H. Prisons  
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>While avoiding steps that would further endanger inmates, the Government 
should take steps to end gang-control of prisons, including:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) All practices that encourage or require new prison inmates to choose a 
gang affiliation should be discontinued. Inmates should be able to identify as 
&#8220;neutral&#8221; and be placed in truly neutral prisons;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (b) Mobile phones should be eliminated from prisons through the more 
rigorous use of metal detectors and through the installation of technology that blocks 
mobile phone signals;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (c) Prison authorities should reassert day-to-day control of internal prison 
administration so that prison guards, not inmates, are responsible for internal 
discipline;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (d) All inmates&#8217; benefits and location in the prison system should be 
recorded electronically, and prisoners moved from one type of detention to another 
when they are so entitled. Inmates and judges of penal execution should be able to 
access the digital record of prisoner entitlements;  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> (e) Overcrowding should be reduced through more use of alternative 
sentences, open prison regimes, and the construction of new prisons.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p>24. <b>The Government should ensure that this report is disseminated widely to 
officials at all levels. The federal Secretariat for Human Rights should take 
responsibility for monitoring the progress of the implementation of these 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
