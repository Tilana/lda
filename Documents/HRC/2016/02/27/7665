<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights was established pursuant to Human 
Rights Council resolution 7/4 of 27 March 2008. By its resolution 16/14, the Council 
extended the mandate of the independent expert for a further period of three years. The 
present report is submitted in accordance with that resolution. Since this is his last thematic 
report to the Council, the independent expert briefly reflects on his tenure from 2008 to 
</p><p>2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert is grateful for the opportunity to work with Member States 
towards the realization of human rights for all &#8211; a key purpose of the United Nations. He 
takes this opportunity to thank the Human Rights Council for its support since his 
appointment. Nevertheless, he regrets the lack of support to the mandate by some members 
of the Council, notably the European Union and the United States of America. He hopes 
that these Member States will review their position and begin to cooperate fully with the 
mandate in line with their commitments in terms of General Assembly resolution 60/251.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the mandate  
</b></p>
<p>3. In his first report to the General Assembly (A/63/289, para. 27), the independent 
expert undertook to actively engage with all stakeholders &#8211; Governments, international 
organizations and civil society as spelled out in Human Rights Council resolution 7/4. To 
this end, he has consulted a broad range of stakeholders on a number of issues relating to 
his mandate, including notably in the process of elaborating the guiding principles on 
foreign debt and human rights which were endorsed by the Council in June 2012. He has 
also participated in workshops and meetings organized by civil society organizations and 
national human rights institutions, as well as contributed to the development of human 
rights standards by other special procedures. He takes this opportunity to thank the various 
organizations for their unstinting support to the mandate. It is impossible to mention them 
all, but he is very grateful in particular to the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and 
Development; Center of Concern; Europe Third World Centre (CETIM); Committee for the 
Abolition of Third World Debt (CADTM); Jubilee Debt Campaign UK; Jubilee Australia; 
Jubilee USA; Jubilee South; European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad); 
African Forum and Network on Debt and Development (AFRODAD); Latin American 
Network on Debt and Development (LATINDAD); Norwegian Coalition for Debt 
Cancellation (Slett U-Landsgjelda (SLUG)); International Network for Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (ESCR-Net); German Institute for Human Rights; and the European 
Group of National Human Rights Institutions.  
</p>
<p>4. Since his appointment in 2008, the independent expert has conducted several studies 
and presented his findings and recommendations to the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly addressing the following issues: the negative impact on human rights of 
the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin in the countries of origin (A/HRC/22/42 and 
A/HRC/25/52); the global partnership for development &#8211; lessons for the post-2015 
development framework (A/68/542); the human rights impact of international debt relief 
initiatives (A/HRC/23/37); the impact of sovereign debt and related economic reform 
policies, such as austerity measures, on women&#8217;s human rights (A/67/304); export credit 
agencies and human rights (A/66/271); the need for policy coherence in the areas of 
international trade, finance and human rights (A/65/260 and Corr.1); the impact of &#8220;vulture </p>


<p>fund&#8221; litigation on debt relief and human rights (A/HRC/14/21); and the shared 
responsibility of creditors and debtors for &#8220;illegitimate debt&#8221; (A/64/289).  
</p><p>5. The independent expert has also conducted official visits to: Norway and Ecuador 
(A/HRC/14/21/Add.1), Australia and Solomon Islands (A/HRC/17/37/Add.1), Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/20/23/Add.2), Viet Nam (A/HRC/20/23/Add.1), Latvia 
(A/HRC/23/37/Add.1), Greece (A/HRC/25/50/Add.1), Japan (A/HRC/25/50/Add.2) and 
Argentina (A/HRC/25/50/Add.3). He is grateful to these States for their invitations and 
cooperation, and he hopes that they will remain engaged with the mandate for the purposes 
of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the respective mission reports. 
The independent expert further wishes to thank the Government of Egypt for its recent 
invitation to the mandate holder to visit the country. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Foreign debt as a human rights issue  
</b></p>
<p>6. The issue of foreign debt and its impact on the realization of human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, has preoccupied the Human Rights 
Council and its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, for many years. However, 
its efforts (and those of the Commission) have been undermined by the differences 
concerning whether or not foreign debt should be treated as a human rights issue.2 While 
acknowledging the potentially adverse impact of excessive debt burdens on development, 
the developed countries continue to argue that the Council was not the &#8220;appropriate&#8221; body 
to address the debt problem and that there were &#8220;other international fora which are much 
better equipped to deal with questions of foreign debt and debt forgiveness&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>7. The arguments advanced by the countries contesting the competence of the Human 
Rights Council to address sovereign debt as a human rights issue are untenable for a 
number of reasons. First, they reflect an incorrect understanding of international human 
rights law which envisages a holistic approach to the promotion and protection of human 
rights comprising both proactive and reactive elements. Thus, for example, paragraph 13 of 
the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action calls upon States to &#8220;eliminate all 
violations of human rights and their causes, as well as obstacles to the enjoyment of these 
</p>

Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Mauritania, Nepal, Nigeria,

Britain and Northern Ireland and United States) and 10 abstentions (Armenia, Bahrain, Chile, Costa 
Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine); Human Rights Council decision 
12/119, adopted on 12 October 2009 by a vote of 31 in favour (Angola, Argentina, Bahrain, 
Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chile, China, Cuba, 
Djibouti, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Mauritius, 
Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South 
Africa and Uruguay), 13 against (Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan,

and 2 abstentions (Mexico and Norway).

  &#8220;U.S. EOV on foreign debt as a human rights problem&#8221;, explanation of vote by the United States, 
</p>
<p>mandate of the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social 
and cultural rights, Human Rights Council, sixteenth session, Geneva, 23 March 2011. Available 
from www.geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/23/eov-foreign-debt/. See also summary records of the 
Human Rights Council (21 March 2013). </p>


<p>rights&#8221;. As several studies and the concluding observations of the various treaty bodies 
indicate, excessive foreign debt burdens constitute an obstacle to the enjoyment of human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>8. Secondly, these contentions are inconsistent with the spirit and purport of General 
Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights Council and the commitments 
which candidate States for membership of the Council make. In resolution 60/251, the 
Assembly recognized &#8220;the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-
selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double 
standards and politicization&#8221; and decided that the work of the Council should &#8220;be guided by 
the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive 
international dialogue and cooperation, with a view to enhancing the promotion and 
protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to development&#8221;. It should also be noted that members of the Council 
are required to &#8220;fully cooperate with the Council&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. Thirdly, as the report of the independent expert assessing the human rights impact of 
international debt relief initiatives shows (A/HRC/23/37), the &#8220;[r]ules other than human 
rights law&#8221;4 and &#8220;other international fora which are much better equipped to deal with the 
questions of foreign debt and debt forgiveness&#8221; (presumably, the international financial 
institutions and the Paris Club5) have thus far failed to deliver an equitable and enduring 
solution to the sovereign debt problem. As creditors, these institutions cannot realistically 
be expected to focus on finding a solution to the debt crisis that prioritizes social and 
economic justice over debt repayment.6 It is also notable that these institutions have neither 
a human rights mandate nor the expertise to properly factor human rights into their policies 
and programmes. Furthermore, the &#8220;[r]ules other than human rights law&#8221; afford no 
protection for States that face debt repayment difficulties as is the case with individuals and 
entities in comparable situations under national insolvency laws,7 nor do they acknowledge 
or address the unjust or odious circumstances in which some of the sovereign debt was 
incurred.  
</p>
<p>10. Fourthly, the various United Nations human rights treaty bodies have recognized the 
adverse impacts of high debt burdens and related economic adjustment programmes on the 
realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights.8 They have

 The Paris Club is an informal group of creditor countries which serves as a forum for renegotiating 
</p>
<p>official sector debts (that is, debts that have been issued, insured or guaranteed by creditor 
governments) owed to its members. Its permanent members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of 
America. Other creditors are allowed to participate in negotiations on an ad hoc basis. See

 For example, it has been asserted that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund &#8220;helped 
</p>
<p>to create the very situation of indebtedness that they themselves had responsibility for fixing&#8221;. (Luke 
Fletcher and Adele Webb, <i>Alternatives to Debtors Prison: Developing a Framework for International 
Insolvency</i>,&#8221; Policy Paper by Jubilee Australia (October 2011), p. 19, available from

 See the following concluding observations, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights:

(Nepal); E/C.12/1/Add.63 (Syrian Arab Republic); E/C.12/1/Add.62 (Senegal); E/C.12/1/Add.60

<p> </p>


<p>also emphasized that the human rights obligations of States are relevant in the context of 
their external debt arrangements,9 and have encouraged creditor countries to do all they can 
to ensure that the policies and decisions of the international financial institutions of which 
they are members are consistent with the international human rights obligations of States, 
for example, under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.10 
These observations do not appear to have been contested by any of the States which oppose 
the Human Rights Council&#8217;s consideration of the issue. 
</p>
<p>11. Fifthly, the declarations, resolutions and decisions of major United Nations 
conferences and bodies have also confirmed the link between sovereign debt, human rights 
and development. These include the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 
which acknowledged the importance of reducing foreign debt particularly where it was 
aggravated by the net transfer of resources for the benefit of developed countries;11 the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which called upon the international 
community to make all efforts to help alleviate the external debt burden of developing 
countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to attain 
the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their people;12 and the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration, which expressed a determination by Member 
States &#8220;to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low and middle-
income developing countries, through various national and international measures designed 
to make their debt sustainable in the long term&#8221;.13

(France); E/C.12/1/Add.77, para. 37 (Ireland); and E/C.12/1/Add.79, para. 26 (United Kingdom). It is 
further notable that the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
deem a human rights violation of omission, &#8220;[t]he failure of a State to take into account its 
international legal obligations in the field of economic, social and cultural rights when entering into 
bilateral or multilateral agreements with other States, international organizations or multinational 
corporations&#8221; (para. 15 (j)).  
The Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provide that: &#8220;The 
obligations of States to protect economic, social and cultural rights extend also to their participation in 
international organizations, where they act collectively&#8221; (para. 19).

 Paragraph 13 of the Vienna Declaration underscored the &#8220;need for States and international

the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of human 
rights&#8221;.

<p>12. Lastly, it is worth recalling as the independent expert on structural adjustment 
policies observed more than a decade ago, no single institution has a monopoly on how to 
establish a just and sustainable world order. 
</p><p>13. The link between sovereign debt and human rights is clear: excessive debt burdens 
reduce the maximum resources available to States for the fulfilment of human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, and to establish and strengthen the 
institutions that promotes and protects civil and political rights.  
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert calls upon all Member States to support the work of the 
mandate to ensure that it can make an effective contribution to finding a lasting and just 
solution to a problem which has plagued developing countries for decades and now also 
affects developed countries. This would be in line with the obligations set out in General 
Assembly resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Support and resources 
</b>15. Inadequate funding and staffing support remain a key challenge for all the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, but more particularly for those mandates that do 
not receive any extrabudgetary resources, including the mandate of this independent expert. 
In addition, the funding cuts implemented across the United Nations over the last few years 
have serious implications for the effective and efficient implementation of the special 
procedures mandates and for the ability of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to enhance its support to the special 
procedures. At the same time, the Council has established a number of new mandates to 
address pressing human rights issues of global concern but without a corresponding 
increase in resources. This situation has resulted in an increased workload for mandate 
holders beyond that envisaged when they were appointed.  
</p>
<p>16. The arrangement where special procedures are expected to do their work outside 
their normal professional commitments, supported only by a single, often overburdened 
OHCHR staff member, is neither desirable nor helpful for the effective implementation of 
the work of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>17. The independent expert is grateful for the professional support he has received from 
OHCHR over the course of his mandate despite the challenges, including lack of resources 
and staff, which it has and continues to face. However, he also considers that the level of 
administrative support provided by OHCHR could be improved through more transparency 
in relation to the relevant policies. For example, there are often issues concerning 
interpretation of policy provisions on entitlements which are in place to assist mandate 
holders effectively discharge their mandates. These include issues of travel and 
reimbursement of expenses. In other cases, there are no policies in writing &#8211; a situation 
which may lead, and has led, to inconsistent application of policies.

session, 23-28 June 1997 (resolution S/19-2, annex, paras. 20 and 82); Copenhagen Declaration on

<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b>18. <b>Sovereign debt and its negative impact on the capacity of Governments, in 
developing and developed countries alike, to fulfil their human rights obligations, 
particularly those relating to economic, social and cultural rights, remain an 
important, if not very urgent, issue. The independent expert therefore urges the 
Human Rights Council to continue its engagement with the issue. However, for the 
Council&#8217;s efforts in this regard to be successful, Member States need to be mindful of 
the principles elaborated in General Assembly resolution 60/251, particularly &#8220;the 
importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the 
consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and 
politicization&#8221; and to consider this important issue accordingly.
