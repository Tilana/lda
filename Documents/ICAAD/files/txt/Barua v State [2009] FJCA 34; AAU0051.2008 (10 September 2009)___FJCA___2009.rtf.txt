SUPPLEMENTARY JUDGMENT

[1.0]   
Since delivering my Judgment in this matter on the 8th September 2009 I have had occasion to reconsider the judgment. 

[2.0]   
On further consideration I am now of the opinion that this case should be referred to the Full Court of the Court of Appeal on the ground that I granted Leave to Appeal to the Full Court.

[3.0]   
I direct that the appeal be listed at the next Call Over of the Criminal List which will be held later this year.
