JUDGMENT

1. Following a trial lasting six days, the assessors have returned with an unanimous verdict of not guilty, on all three counts, mentioned in the information, against the accused.

2. I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. I find that the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept their verdict.

3. I therefore find the accused not guilty as charged, on all three counts in the information. I acquit him accordingly.
