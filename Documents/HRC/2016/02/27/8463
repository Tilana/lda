<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011.  The review of Namibia was held at the 12th 
meeting on 31 January 2011. The delegation of Namibia was headed by Hon. Pendukeni 
Iivula-Ithana, MP, Minister of Justice. At its 16th meeting held on 2 February 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Namibia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Namibia: Pakistan, Brazil and Mauritius. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Namibia: 
</p>

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom was transmitted 
to Namibia through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Namibia welcomed the opportunity of participating in the review process to provide 
an overview of its human rights landscape.   
</p>
<p>6. Namibia noted that it had become independent only in 1990, after more than 100 
years of oppressive apartheid rule, and that its history had been characterized by 
widespread human rights violations and brutal repression.  At independence, Namibia had 
put in place a framework to promote and protect human rights. Chapter 3 of the 
Constitution protected most of the human rights referred to in the various international 
human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>7. To repeal past discriminatory laws, the Government established the Law Reform and 
Development Commission (LRDC) in 1991 to review such laws with a view to enacting 
progressive legislation. Both the higher courts and the LRDC have made important 
contributions to reform Namibia&#8217;s pre-independence legislation and policies. 
</p>
<p>8. The Constitution established the Office of the Ombudsman with a specific mandate 
to investigate alleged violations of human rights and recommend remedial action. 
</p>
<p>9. Namibia ratified the core international human rights instruments, which are directly 
applicable in the national legal order. The Government submitted various reports in line 
with its international treaty obligations and intends to submit those that were still 
outstanding. The Ministry of Justice has put in place the necessary measures to address this 
backlog, but capacity-building remained a challenge. </p>


<p>10. Namibia has made significant strides in gender equality, education, law reform, land 
reform and the transformation of the public service and economic sector. Significant 
progress has also been made in enabling Namibians to share in its natural resources. A food 
security strategy had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>11. Namibia has adopted policies and laws to strengthen the social protection of 
vulnerable groups by providing a monthly social grant to war veterans, the elderly, persons 
with disabilities, orphans and vulnerable children. Special assistance programmes have 
been put in place to provide free access to health services, housing, employment and other 
services to previously marginalized communities. The Social Security Commission 
administers a number of social welfare funds. 
</p>
<p>12. Namibia has enacted labour laws to promote good industrial relations, recognizing 
the freedom to organize, the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding civil and political rights, there is an open playing field for political parties 
to contest elections, supervised by the Electoral Commission of Namibia. Individuals are 
free to associate and form political parties. Since independence, Namibia has held regular 
presidential and national elections. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding the rights of indigenous communities, the Government identified certain 
communities that were particularly deprived (the San, the Ovatue and the Ovatjimba) and 
had implemented support programmes to raise their standard of living.  
</p>
<p>15. There are approximately 60,000 San people in Namibia, but only about 2,000 of 
them still follow a traditional way of life. As Namibia is a signatory to the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it is committed to ensuring that these 
formerly marginalized groups are fully integrated in mainstream society and the economy. 
</p>
<p>16. The 1991 Land Conference resolved that there would be no claims to ancestral lands 
by any person in Namibia. In an effort to assist indigenous groups, the Government bought 
and continues to acquire land for formally disadvantaged Namibians for resettlement.  
</p>
<p>17. All the indigenous communities have free access to health facilities and 
antiretroviral medicine is offered to them free of charge.  
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration employed mobile teams in all 13 
regions to go to the remote areas and assist citizens, and especially the formally 
marginalized groups, in obtaining national identity documents. Parliament had passed 
legislation to enable members of the formally marginalized groups to actively take part in 
economic activities without being discriminated against as was the case before 
independence.  
</p>
<p>19. Violence against women and children is a serious problem and had increased in 
recent years. A number of rape cases had been prosecuted, resulting in sentences of 5 to 45 
years&#8217; imprisonment for convicted rapists, while other cases were pending before the courts 
for further police investigation. However, a lack of police vehicles, of expertise in dealing 
with violence against women and children, and of facilities to accommodate vulnerable 
witnesses, as well as the withdrawal of complaints by victims, continued to hamper 
investigations and prosecution.  Legislation that the Government had enacted to curb 
violence against women and children included the Combating of Domestic Violence Act 
No. 4 of 2003, the Combating of Rape Act No. 8 of 2000, the Combating of Immoral 
Practices Amendment Act No. 7 of 2000 and the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act No. 
24 of 2003. 
</p>
<p>20. Women and Child Protection Units have been established in all 13 regions in 
Namibia to handle and investigate cases relating to sexual offences. The Ministry of Gender 
Equality and Child Welfare and various stakeholders launched an annual awareness </p>


<p>campaign against gender-based violence. The Government has also launched a &quot;Zero 
Tolerance Campaign against Gender-Based Violence including Human Trafficking&quot;. 
</p>
<p>21. On homosexuality, it was noted that the Constitution outlawed discrimination of any 
kind. Since independence, no single case of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference 
or orientation had appeared before the courts. Homosexuals were not prosecuted for 
practising same-sex activities in private, although this practice was not condoned, and was 
considered immoral and prohibited in public. Same-sex marriages were not recognized. The 
Government has no intention of amending current laws.   
</p>
<p>22. With reference to the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or torture, Namibia stated that incidents of excessive use of force by members of 
the Police Force during arrest of suspects had been noted with concern. The Police had 
embarked on awareness campaigns and training on the use of minimum force during 
arrests.  The Namibian Police Force also offers human rights training during its Basic and 
Developmental Courses. 
</p>
<p>23. According to the Constitution, evidence obtained by torture shall not be admitted in 
court.  A bill to criminalize torture was under consideration. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding the signing of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), the relevant 
Ministries would do the necessary research and make submissions to the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee on Human Rights, which would then make a recommendation to the Cabinet. 
This approach applies to all outstanding treaties which Namibia has not yet ratified. 
</p>
<p>25. Namibia noted that police holding cells were seriously overcrowded because of a 
lack of detention facilities.  The Cabinet has authorized the Ministry of Safety and Security 
to budget for the construction of remand prisons. 
</p>
<p>26. Convicted minors are detained separately from adults at a Juvenile Centre, which 
has educational facilities. However, the availability of juvenile detention facilities, 
especially in police cells, remained a major challenge.  
</p>
<p>27. There is no Government policy authorizing the forced sterilization of HIV-positive 
persons. The alleged forced sterilization of women living with HIV/AIDS is a matter that is 
before the court and the outcome of the case will determine what action to take.  
</p>
<p>28. All Namibians have access to health facilities and antiretroviral medicine is offered 
free of charge. 
</p>
<p>29. Namibia provides constitutional guarantees to a fair trial. The Government has taken 
measures to reduce the backlog of criminal cases through the appointment of additional 
judicial officers and prosecutors, with the provision of legal aid to indigent persons. The 
Government was also working on a strategy to improve the working conditions of legal 
officers in order to reduce staff turnover, which contributed to the backlog in the courts.  
Both the High and Lower Courts were implementing case management systems to 
overcome administrative bottlenecks in the management of the case flow. 
</p>
<p>30. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare had embarked on awareness-
raising campaigns as one way of addressing the problem of human trafficking.  In 2009, the 
Ministries of Labour and Social Welfare, Gender Equality and Child Welfare, and Safety 
and Security had conducted joint inspections on child labour and trafficking in the 
agricultural sector in nine regions. The purpose was to withdraw all children found to be 
engaged in child labour; to issue Compliance Orders; to lay criminal charges against 
persons employing children under-age as prohibited by the Labour Act 2007; and to raise 
public awareness of child labour through the media, regional councillors and traditional 
leaders. </p>


<p>31. Whenever children were found to be engaged in child labour they were placed in the 
care of social workers while a criminal case was opened by the Namibian police. 
</p>
<p>32. The Electoral Commission of Namibia had always been mindful to compile and 
publish an accurate Voters&#8217; Register.  The Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration has 
embarked upon a project to automate all birth, marriage and death records in order to 
eliminate possible errors in the data required by the Electoral Commission. 
</p>
<p>33. With respect to media freedom, Namibia referred to Article 21 of the Constitution. 
Parliament had enacted the Broadcasting Act No. 9 of 1991 and the Communications Act 
No. 8 of 2009 to provide the legal framework and create a liberal environment for the 
media. In 2007, Namibia was ranked 25th out of 169 countries in the world on the World 
Press Freedom Index rankings of Reporters Without Borders, and, in 2010, Namibia topped 
Africa on press freedom on the same rankings.  
</p>
<p>34. Regarding the establishment of a national human rights institution, Namibia stressed 
that the Office of the Ombudsman was in full compliance with the Paris Principles and had 
received &#8220;A&#8221; status in April 2006. 
</p>
<p>35. With reference to cooperation with special procedures, it was noted that thus far 
there had been only one request for a visit, namely from the independent expert on the right 
to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, who would visit in July 2011. While the 
Government did not see the need to have a standing invitation, it was open to requests for 
more visits. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the interactive dialogue, 48 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. A number of 
delegations commended Namibia for its human rights accomplishments in such a short 
period of time, since its independence in 1990. They commended Namibia for the 
comprehensive report and for the co-operative attitude of the Namibian Government in this 
process, identifying the main challenges, commitments, progresses and difficulties in the 
protection of human rights. Delegations appreciated Namibia for its open and constructive 
consultations in preparation of the National report.  
</p>
<p>37. Botswana commended Namibia for maintaining a stable democratic and political 
culture since independence, and for its commitment to promoting a policy of national 
reconciliation, after years of human rights violations under minority white administration. It 
also commended Namibia for several impressive legislative and administrative measures to 
ensure effective enjoyment of human rights, including the adoption of more than 20 Acts of 
Parliament. It also noted Namibia&#8217;s desire to review legislation with respect to human 
trafficking. Botswana made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>38. South Africa welcomed Namibia&#8217;s efforts to enhance the protection of women&#8217;s 
rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women, and encouraged it to 
continue this trend and to take further action in this regard.  It welcomed the priority given 
to the health sector and applauded the encouraging decrease in the HIV/AIDS infection 
rate, sought additional information on the progress made in fighting this pandemic. It noted 
that violence against women remained a challenge. South Africa made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. Nigeria recognized that Namibia is facing enormous challenges in the fulfilment of 
its commitments to the promotion and protection of human rights, including inadequate 
financial and other resources, capacity-building and technical assistance needs, lack of 
technology and technical know-how. Nigeria urged Namibia to intensify efforts in </p>


<p>enhancing the effectiveness of the various mechanisms entrusted with the enforcement of 
human rights. Nigeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Zimbabwe commended Namibia for its socio-economic, judicial and political 
actions regarding the promotion and protection of human rights. Zimbabwe was fully 
cognizant of the fact that more is yet to be done and achieved, noting that further progress 
is needed; it called on the international community to assist Namibia in consolidating gains 
made. Zimbabwe made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Swaziland noted Namibia&#8217;s policy of national reconciliation entailing forgiveness of 
those who resisted freedom and independence. It commended its efforts to integrate 
indigenous minority groups into mainstream society and economy, particularly the San 
Development Programme aimed at improving the San&#8217;s socio-economic lives. It also 
acknowledged, inter alia, the establishment of the Ombudsman Office, prohibition of 
torture, inhuman treatment and of racial discrimination, the rights to health and access to 
safe drinking water and affirmative action and gender equality programmes. Swaziland 
commended the Zero Tolerance Against Gender-based Violence, including Human 
Trafficking, and passing the Prevention of Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p>42. Portugal welcomed Namibia&#8217;s efforts to define and criminalize torture and, 
regarding the Traditional Courts and Traditional Authorities Act, requested clarification on 
the powers of traditional judges, their knowledge of and abidance by human rights law, 
including the prohibition of torture. Acknowledging progress concerning gender issues, 
Portugal noted persisting societal discrimination against women, particularly regarding 
inheritance, land ownership and school access for young pregnant women and asked about 
measures taken. Portugal expressed concern about discrimination, violence and punitive 
acts against homosexuals and enquired about measures taken regarding HIV/AIDS 
campaigns. It also asked about measures to ensure the right of access to safe drinking water 
and basic sanitation. Portugal made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Cuba recalled Namibia&#8217;s colonial history and the consequences of apartheid on the 
economy, including structural difficulties in employment creation and the perpetuation of 
poverty and inequality. International exploitation and pillaging of resources was key to 
Namibia&#8217;s underdevelopment. Cuba acknowledged the policies and measures adopted since 
independence to mitigate the negative effects of the past. It recognized difficulties to ensure 
food security. It noted improvements in areas of health, primary education, rights of 
women, children and ethnic minorities including the San and efforts to address HIV/AIDS. 
Cuba made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. China noted the implementation by Namibia&#8217;s parliament of the constitutional 
protection accorded to the economic, social and cultural rights, including through enacting 
legislation. It acknowledged Namibia&#8217;s investment in education and efforts to improve 
health services. China also noted its commitment to reducing inequalities and improving 
social welfare, while understanding the challenges it faces as a developing country. China 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. Algeria acknowledged Namibia&#8217;s palpable achievements including on national 
reconciliation, combating racial discrimination, empowerment of women, rights of the 
child, and access to health and education, reflecting the country&#8217;s wish to break with its 
colonial history of human rights denial. Algeria noted income distribution inequalities, 
despite relatively high per capita income. Noting that HIV/AIDS remained a challenge for 
the population&#8217;s welfare and the economy, it appealed to stakeholders to contribute to 
combating this pandemic. Algeria made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. Palestine welcomed the progress made in Namibia regarding women&#8217;s 
empowerment, socially and legally, in addition to the number of constitutional and 
legislative provisions and Government policies that support gender equality. Palestine </p>


<p>commended Namibia for its accession to the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), on 11 November 1982. Palestine made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. India commended Namibia&#8217;s transition to parliamentary democracy from apartheid 
and a colonial past, noting inherited socio-economic inequalities and structural distortions. 
It acknowledged the establishment of judicial oversight mechanisms and the Office of the 
Ombudsman and emphasized efforts towards environmental protection, despite challenges 
of water scarcity and food security and the mining sector&#8217;s economic importance, and 
commended high public expenditure on education and health. Efforts to combat 
discrimination were welcomed. India sought information on planned measures to reduce 
high income inequalities and address perennial food deficits and encouraged Namibia to 
continue improving the administration of justice and expanding participation of indigenous 
peoples and minorities in development.  
</p>
<p>48. Singapore noted that, given its painful experience under apartheid colonial rule, 
Namibia has since its independence enacted various laws aimed at protecting human rights. 
It noted that Namibia had been among the countries with the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence 
rates, leaving many children orphaned. It noted that Namibia has rightly prioritized 
HIV/AIDS in its overall national human and economic development agenda.  It also noted 
that Namibia is among the countries in the world that spend the highest share of GDP on 
public expenditures such as education and the health sector. It noted that Namibia has 
implemented a Comprehensive Primary Health Care Programme in all health districts in the 
country. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Turkey welcomed the enactment of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act and the 
database on gender-based violence, including human trafficking statistics and child labour 
victims.  It noted restoration of social facilities as shelters for victims of trafficking and 
gender-based violence and a social awareness campaign on these issues. Turkey welcomed 
the establishment of the Communication Regulatory Authority, the Media Ombudsman 
Office including the nomination of a human rights lawyer to the latter, and commended 
Namibia for collaborating with UNICEF regarding birth certificates for newborns and 
identity cards for orphans. It noted decreasing HIV/AIDS infections. Turkey made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>50. Italy welcomed Namibia&#8217;s abolitionist stance towards the death penalty, and its 
cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNHCR and the Namibian 
Red Cross. Concerning freedom of press and information, Italy noted that criticism of the 
ruling party could, in some political circles, provoke harsh reactions including intimidation 
of journalists, which induced journalists to practice self-censorship. Italy sought 
information about measures to address this specific problem. It noted overcrowding of 
prisons and detention centres, which are poorly maintained. Italy touched on the prevalence 
of domestic violence and alleged forced sterilizations of women affected by HIV/AIDS in 
public hospitals. Italy made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>51. Namibia noted that it has gone into farms where child labour was reported to be a 
concern. Namibia has taken action to stop this offence and has taken measures to stop the 
perpetuation of this crime. Namibia will continue to look into child labour issues and will 
combine that issue with trafficking issues, including across the borders of neighbouring 
countries.  
</p>
<p>52. Namibia is working towards eliminating social inequality. It has decided to 
formulate a policy entitled the New Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework.   
</p>
<p>53. In response to questions and comments, Namibia explained, inter alia, that 
traditional leaders were recognized to the extent that their practice of traditional laws did 
not contradict the Constitution. Traditional leaders were not instruments for the subjugation </p>


<p>of women and it was incorrect to presume that the traditional leaders were perpetuating 
gender inequality and violence.  Instead, they were part of that reform process.   
</p>
<p>54. Almost 65 per cent of the population now had access to safe drinking water on tap. 
Namibia was doing everything possible to improve upon this achievement. 
</p>
<p>55. Namibia would continue to build on its achievements in education.  The education 
sector had received eight per cent of annual GDP ever since independence.  Health received 
the second highest budget support annually.   
</p>
<p>56. To eliminate social inequality, the Government had formulated the New Equitable 
Economic Empowerment Framework. 
</p>
<p>57. On the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the Government had made great strides.  In the 1990s, 
some 22 per cent of pregnant women had HIV, against the current 16 per cent.  With the 
introduction of free antiretroviral medicine, the death rate had also dropped. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government was introducing free meals at schools and had enacted grants for 
orphans and other programmes for orphans, vulnerable children, the elderly and war 
veterans.  
</p>
<p>59. The policies of the apartheid regime did not allow Namibians to be educated in order 
to man the court. The number of judges and lawyers was therefore very low. Namibia was 
now using the expertise of its own citizens. The Supreme Court still received support from 
neighbouring countries, for which Namibia is grateful. 
</p>
<p>60. On the issue of forced sterilization of women of child-bearing age living with 
HIV/AIDS, Namibia stated that it did not have such a policy, and the assumption was based 
on allegations which were before the courts.  
</p>
<p>61. Morocco noted Namibia&#8217;s commitment and its rich culture and traditions, reflected 
in its legal and institutional framework, which is constantly being improved. Morocco 
welcomed inter alia the draft law on the realization and protection of children, which, once 
adopted, will cover all its international commitments. Morocco asked about the importance 
given to the draft law on trafficking. At the institutional level, Morocco welcomed the 
annual children&#8217;s Parliament in promoting and respecting the rights of children by ensuring 
that they freely participate effectively in public life. Morocco asked for more information 
on the role of the Office of the Ombudsman in human rights training. Morocco made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Chile noted the awareness of the international community of the reality that affected 
Namibia and its efforts to achieve national reconciliation and overcome structural 
inequality, which are vital for the proper working of multiparty democracies and the 
upholding of human rights.  Chile believed that the creation of the Ombudsman as a 
national human rights institution with &#8220;A&#8221; status in line with the Paris Principles, reveals 
Namibia&#8217;s commitment to society to protect and uphold human rights. Chile highlighted the 
efforts made to implement public policies that guarantee economic, social and cultural 
rights, in particular the action of the Government in the area of education and primary 
education.  Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Austria commended Namibia for its achievements since its independence, but noted 
remaining challenges. Expressing concerns that the accused in the Caprivi High Treason 
Trial remain detained without judgement, it enquired about measures to ensure their right to 
be tried without undue delay. Concerning gender-based violence, it commended Namibia&#8217;s 
zero-tolerance policy, but noted the call by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women to review the Married Persons Equality Act to eliminate 
discrimination against women in customary marriages, and enquired about the entry into </p>


<p>force of the related draft bill. It also requested information on steps taken to end 
discrimination of indigenous groups and minorities. Austria made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>64. Norway was concerned about reported harassment of journalists, media 
organizations, human rights defenders and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It 
noted that the right to fair trial is implemented in the Namibian Constitution, but that 
reports from civil society indicate serious delays in hearing cases and frequent 
postponement of criminal court cases, while the accused are being kept under arrest. It also 
noted that there is still room for improvement regarding women&#8217;s rights. Norway 
commended Namibia for its initiative in protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and 
marginalized communities. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Malaysia was encouraged to note Namibia&#8217;s democratic principles and successive, 
regular and peaceful elections at the local, regional and national levels. Malaysia noted that 
some areas require further efforts, including difficulties related to unemployment, income 
disparity, HIV/AIDS, and the rights of the indigenous and minority groups. Malaysia was 
convinced of the Government&#8217;s commitment to make improvements in those areas. 
Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Ghana noted that challenges Namibia faces in the timely submission of reports to the 
human rights treaty bodies are due to human resource constraints. Ghana commended 
Namibia&#8217;s Comprehensive Primary Health Care Programme, which has been implemented 
since independence in all districts in the country. It also commended Namibia for the 
educational reforms it has pursued since 2000 and urged Namibia to remain steadfast in its 
quest to achieve universal education for all its citizens. It observed that in 2010 UNICEF 
noted widespread violence against children. The response of the legal system in cases of 
rape and gender-based violence remained inadequate, especially concerning the reporting of 
cases through to the courts. Ghana made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>67. Sweden welcomed information provided on efforts to address overcrowding of 
prisons and detention centres. While acknowledging that the Constitution provides for 
freedom of speech and of the press, it noted reports of limitations to press freedom. Sweden 
sought an assessment of the Communications Regulatory Authority Act and its impact. It 
noted continued discrimination of women in practice and through traditional practices. 
Sweden made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>68. Azerbaijan noted that Namibia&#8217;s national human rights institution is accredited with 
&#8220;A&#8221; status. It also noted the measures taken for prevention of gender-based discrimination 
and violence against women, including the anti-rape legislation, the Married Persons 
Equality Act and Combating of Domestic Violence Act. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Lesotho acknowledged Namibia&#8217;s strides to harmonize domestic legislation with 
regional and international human rights instruments and noted with satisfaction its efforts in 
the field of education, by ensuring free and compulsory education in Government schools. 
Lesotho noted remaining challenges, mainly due to limited capacity and resources and 
appealed to the international community to provide needed technical and financial 
assistance. Lesotho made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>70. Angola emphasized its ties with Namibia and noted that its policy of reconciliation 
and pardon had contributed to the successful and peaceful transition from apartheid to 
multi-party democracy and to consolidating institutions, including regular elections. It 
commended Namibia for its example given in protecting human rights reflected by the 
incorporation of a Charter of Rights into the Constitution and welcomed its contribution to 
regional peace and stability. Angola recognized efforts targeting the Khoisan groups 
towards their economic and social inclusion. It also acknowledged the reduction of </p>


<p>HIV/AIDS rates and easier access to anti-retroviral medication and thanked Namibia for its 
assistance on refugee issues. Angola made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>71. Zambia acknowledged the accreditation with &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International 
Criminal Court of Namibia&#8217;s National Human Rights Institution. Applauding socio-
economic achievements, including with regard to education and health, it expressed 
concerns that violence against women and children remained a challenge and urged 
Namibia to address this issue as well as child labour and migrants, and to make torture a 
specific crime. Zambia welcomed the HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and the Policy calling on 
all stakeholders to contribute in fighting HIV/AIDS. Zambia made recommendations.

Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>77. Pakistan reminded the Council to keep in mind during the review process for 
Namibia that it must remain cognizant of the harsh fact that the present situation of human

horrific violations of human rights for more than 100 years during the apartheid colonial </p>


<p>rule. Pakistan took note of a number of measures taken to promote economic, social and 
cultural rights, in particular efforts to provide health and education services at the grass-

concerned at the lack of legislative protection and prevention measures. It made 
recommendations.

African Union, Namibia has always supported regional and international initiatives to 
protect fundamental rights, including the African Charter. Mauritius commended Namibia

<p>94. In response to comments, Namibia confirmed once more that it would set in motion 
a process of reviewing treaties to which it was not yet a party and that it might want to

obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights by all Namibians. Namibia would take into 
consideration all concerns expressed during the review. Its main priorities at this time are 
food security, education and health, which take up much of its budget. Bearing in mind that 
it had reached independence only recently, Namibia asked the international community to 
show understanding for its continued need for international assistance
