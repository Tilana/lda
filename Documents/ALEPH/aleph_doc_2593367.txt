ALEXCO RESOURCE CORP.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FOR THE THREE MONTH AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") of Alexco Resource Corp. ("Alexco" or
the "Corporation") is dated August 10, 2016 and provides an analysis of Alexco's unaudited
condensed consolidated financial results for the three month and six month periods ended June
30, 2016 compared to the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2015.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the Corporation's June 30, 2016
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements with accompanying notes (the
"2016-Q2 Interim F/S"), which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting, and with the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements with
accompanying notes and related MD&A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which
were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The 2016-Q2 Interim F/S follow the
same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with the most recent fiscal
financial statements.  All dollar figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise
stated. These documents and additional information on the Corporation are available on the
Corporation's website at www.alexcoresource.com and on the SEDAR website at
www.sedar.com.
Except where specifically indicated otherwise, the disclosure in this MD&A of scientific and
technical information regarding exploration projects on Alexco's mineral properties has been
reviewed and approved by Alan McOnie, FAusIMM, Vice President, Exploration, while that
regarding mine development and operations has been reviewed and approved by Scott Smith,
P.Eng., former Bellekeno Mine Manager, both of whom are Qualified Persons as defined by
National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101").
2016-Q2 HIGHLIGHTS AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE
Overall, Alexco reported a net income for the second quarter of 2016 of $152,000 or $0.00 per
share basic and diluted, compared to a net loss in the second quarter of 2015 of $1,866,000 or
$0.03 per share basic and diluted. Before recovery of taxes in the second quarter of 2016 Alexco
recorded a loss of $124,000, including non-cash costs of $522,000 for depreciation and
amortization and $332,000 for share-based compensation offset by an unrealized gain of
$1,518,000 on warrants held as an investment and a realized gain on the disposal of shares and
warrants of $111,000. This compares to a loss before recovery of taxes in the second quarter of
·
2015 of $1,920,000, including non-cash costs of $530,000 for depreciation and amortization and
$139,000 for share-based compensation. The decrease in net loss from prior period is mainly
attributed to the unrealized increased value in the held-for-trading investment the Corporation
holds in Golden Predator Mining Corp. ("Golden Predator") warrants.  Furthermore, the
Corporation's general and administrative expenses and site based costs have decreased by
$106,000 for the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period as the Corporation continues to
realize on cost reduction measures implemented in 2015.
The Corporation's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 totaled $18,100,000 compared to
$8,163,000 at December 31, 2015, while net working capital totaled $26,048,000 compared to
$12,602,000 for the same dates respectively. The increase in cash and cash equivalents in
2016-Q2 is mainly attributable to the non-brokered equity financing, where the Corporation
·
received net proceeds of $12,193,000. Furthermore, warrant exercises with an expiry of August
21, 2016 provided cash proceeds of $1,040,000 during the second quarter.  The Corporation's
available-for-sale and held-for-trading investments in Golden Predator have fair value
adjustment gains further increasing working capital.
AEG recognized revenues of $2,831,000 in the second quarter of 2016 for a gross profit of
$710,000 and a gross margin of 25.1% compared to revenues of $2,610,000 in the second
·
quarter of 2015 for a gross profit of $579,000 and a gross margin of 22.2%. The increase in gross
profit from the prior period is mainly attributed to improved employee utilization in the fee-for-
service business.
 
2
On May 17, 2016, the Corporation closed a non-brokered private placement of units of the
Corporation ("Units") at a price of $1.20 per Unit pursuant to which the Corporation issued
10,839,972 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of $13,007,966.  Each unit consisted of one
 
·
common share and one-half of one non-transferable warrant, each whole such warrant entitling
 
the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Corporation at a price of $1.75 per
share for a period of 24 months following the date of issuance.
In June 2016 the Corporation commenced an 8,000 meter surface exploration diamond drill
program at its Bermingham deposit in the Keno Hill District. The program is under-budget and
ahead of schedule and has been expanded to approximately 14,000 meters at an estimated
additional cost of $0.7 million. As of August 10, 2016, Alexco completed 25 holes for a total of
·
7,708 meters. The drilling program is expected to be completed by early October with results for
the complete program expected to be available by the end of October 2016 with interim drill
results expected to be available mid-September.
During the second quarter 770,800 warrants were exercised for proceeds of $1 million.
·
Subsequent to quarter end, a further 2,433,575 warrants were exercised for additional proceeds
of $3,402,000 further improving the Corporations cash position.
OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
Alexco owns substantially all of the historic Keno Hill Silver District ("KHSD"), located in
Canada's Yukon Territory. The Bellekeno silver mine, one of the world's highest-grade silver
mines with a production grade averaging 779 g/t, commenced commercial production at the
beginning of 2011 and was Canada's only operating primary silver mine from 2011 to 2013,
producing a total of 5.6 million ounces of silver during that time. In September 2013 Alexco
suspended Bellekeno mining operations in light of a sharply reduced silver price environment.
Since the suspension Alexco has focused on evaluating the Flame & Moth deposit, renegotiating
third party contracts and reviewing other opportunities to reduce future All-In Sustaining Costs,
with the aim of repositioning the District for long-term, sustainable operations. Alexco is
developing a plan to return to operations incorporating production from the Bellekeno, Flame &
Moth and Lucky Queen silver deposits while also evaluating other higher grade deposits for
possible inclusion in a future production schedule.
Alexco also owns and operates an environmental consulting business, AEG, which provides a
variety of mine and industrial related environmental services, including management of the
regulatory and environmental permitting process, remediation technologies and reclamation and
mine closure services. AEG provides these services to both government and industry clients
through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alexco Environmental Group Inc. (formerly Access Mining
Consultants Ltd.), Alexco Environmental Group (US) Inc. ("AEG US") (formerly Alexco Resource
U.S. Corp.) and Elsa Reclamation & Development Company Ltd. ("ERDC"). Alexco also owns
certain patent rights allowed and pending related to mine reclamation and closure processes
including the in situ immobilization of metals in groundwater, soils, waste stacks and pit lakes.
Alexco is a public company which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (under the symbol
AXR) and the NYSE MKT Equities Exchange (under the symbol AXU).

OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY
Keno Hill Silver District
Alexco's current primary focus is on further building high grade silver resources in the KHSD as
well as further refining plans to optimize operations and the future underlying fixed cost structure
of the Keno Hill District mining operations with the goal of re-starting mining operations,
commodity prices and markets considered. Ore throughput rates, grade, prices and the influence
of the Silver Wheaton silver stream have a material impact on unit costs and profitability at Keno
Hill. Bringing the larger Flame & Moth deposit into production is a key aspect of restarting
operations at Keno Hill, and the permitting process for development of the Flame & Moth deposit
is progressing through the final phases of the Water Use Licence process.  Similarly, results from
the recent discovery and current evaluation of very high grade mineralization at Bermingham, will
need to be considered when developing options and priorities for the ultimate plan to return the
KHSD to production.
Alexco's Keno Hill mineral properties comprise mineral rights spanning approximately
244 square kilometers, which contain numerous occurrences of mineral deposits and prospects
including more than 35 historical silver mines. The KHSD's historical mines produced from
approximately 1913 through 1989, with the Yukon Government's published Minfile database
reporting that District production from 1941 totaled more than 214 million ounces of silver with
average grades of 44 oz/t silver, 6.7% lead and 4.1% zinc. All of Alexco's mining, development
and exploration activities have been conducted on its KHSD properties. The KHSD is located in
the Yukon Territory approximately 330 kilometers north of Whitehorse in the vicinity of the
villages of Mayo and Keno City and lies within the traditional territory of the First Nation of Na-
Cho Nyak Dun ("FNNND"). Alexco is party to a Comprehensive Cooperation and Benefits
Agreement ("CCBA") with the FNNND, setting out common understandings, obligations and
opportunities arising from all of Alexco's activities within the Keno Hill District including
exploration, care and maintenance, District closure activities and mine production.
On May 4, 2016, the Corporation and FNNND entered into an Amended and Restated CCBA
relating to exploration, mine development, mining, and environmental activities of Alexco and its
subsidiaries in the KHSD. The revised agreement includes enhanced language in respect of
project implementation, the cooperative environmental engagement process, business
opportunities and wealth sharing.
In December 2014, Alexco completed the KHSD Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA"). For
details of the PEA, please refer to Alexco's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Alexco Environmental Group
Alexco owns and operates AEG which carries out a variety of fee for service and turnkey project
activities related to environmental management and assessment, project permitting, remediation,
water treatment and project closure mandates in North America and elsewhere. AEG remains
committed to the on-going environmental care and maintenance program and reclamation and
closure projects at Keno Hill under its contract through ERDC with the Government of Canada
("Canada") and in accordance with the Amended and Restated Subsidiary Agreement ("ARSA").
AEG has developed a strong client base within the mining industry in the last several years, and
has also been able to establish new lines of business related to industrial site soil remediation,
water treatment and historical mine pool remediation as well as emergency water treatment
services.
As part of Alexco's acquisition in 2006 of the UKHM mineral rights in the Keno Hill District,
ERDC is party to the ARSA with Canada. Under the ARSA, ERDC is retained by Canada as a
paid contractor responsible on a continuing basis for the environmental care and maintenance
and ultimate closure reclamation of the former UKHM mineral properties. The ARSA provides
that ERDC share the responsibility for the development of the ultimate closure plan with Canada.
Upon regulatory approval, the closure plan will be implemented by ERDC. During the period
required to develop the plan and until the closure plan is executed, ERDC is also responsible for
carrying out the environmental care and maintenance at various sites within the UKHM mineral
rights, for a fixed annual fee established on a per-site basis totaling $850,000, adjustable for
material changes in scope. ERDC receives agreed-to commercial contractor rates when retained
by Canada to provide environmental services in the Keno Hill District outside the scope of care
and maintenance and closure and reclamation planning under the ARSA.
 
4
ERDC currently holds a Type B Water Use Licence under the Yukon Waters Act to undertake
care and maintenance activities, which licence term continues until January 29, 2018. The final
Existing State of Mine ("ESM") Reclamation Plan at Keno Hill will undergo assessment by the
Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board (YESAB), likely starting in 2016.
Subsequent to completion of the YESAB assessment process, a Water Use Licence renewal will
be required from the Yukon Water Board to licence aspects of the plan that affect use of water
and placement of waste.  After licencing, funding approval from AANDC for the project will be
subject to review and acceptance of the project by the Treasury Board of Canada.  The ESM
Reclamation Plan is subject to amendment that may result from requirements during the
assessment, licencing, and funding approval processes.
Economic Climate
Silver, lead and zinc are the primary metals found within the Keno Hill District historically. With
respect to the economic climate during 2016, prices were steadily increasing. Silver traded from
a high of US$20.71 on August 2, 2016 to a low of $13.58 on January 28, 2016, while lead traded
between US$0.86 to US$0.73 and zinc traded between US$1.03 to US$0.66 per pound. As at
the date of this MD&A, prices are approximately US$20.15 per ounce silver, US$0.83 per pound
for lead and US$1.04 per pound for zinc and the Canadian-US exchange rate is approximately
US$0.76 per CAD. Consensus investment analyst forecasts over the next two years for silver
average approximately US$19.50 per ounce, for lead average approximately US$0.85 per
pound, and for zinc US$0.95 per pound, with the Canadian-US exchange rate forecast at
US$0.78 per CAD (see "Risk Factors" in the MD&A for the for the year ended December 31,
2015, including but not limited to "Potential Profitability Of Mineral Properties Depends Upon
Other Factors Beyond the Control of the Corporation" and "General Economic Conditions May
Adversely Affect the Corporation's Growth and Profitability" thereunder).
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Alexco Environmental Group (AEG)
AEG Highlights during 2016-Q2:
AEG recognized revenues of $2,831,000 in the second quarter of 2016 for a gross profit of
$710,000 and a gross margin of 25.1% compared to revenues of $2,610,000 in the second
·
quarter of 2015 for a gross profit of $579,000 and a gross margin of 22.2%. The increase in gross
profit from the prior period is mainly attributed to improved employee utilization in the fee-for-
service business.
At the Gold King Project in southern Colorado, the US EPA has recently extended the Interim
Water Treatment Plant (IWTP) operations contract with AEG to the end of September 2016, as
·
well as authorized an interim expansion of the plant to approximately double the treatment
capacity of the IWTP. Construction related to this expansion is complete.
On the Globeville Smelter Project, a Completion Report which documents the work completed at
the site and the monitoring results was submitted to the State of Colorado in July. The
·
Completion Report will support the release of a portion of restricted cash to reduce the majority
of the $4.24 million (US$3.28 million) held in escrow. Management classified $3.82 million as
current asset as it anticipates the release of the majority of these funds in the next 60 to 90 days.

Keno Hill Silver District
2016 Exploration Program - Bermingham
The Corporation originally planned an exploration program of 8,000 meters and have now
increased that exploration program to approximately 14,000 meters of surface diamond drilling to
follow up on the identification in 2015 and 2014 of high grade silver results at the Bermingham
prospect. The expanded exploration program is budgeted to cost approximately $3.3 million and
the majority is funded by way of the $3 million flow through funds that were raised in December
2015. The surface drilling program, initiated with two drills and recently expanded to three
diamond drills was commenced in early June and is expected to be complete in early October.
The Corporation will expend additional funds to gather important geotechnical and
hydrogeological information, as well as undertake a preliminary metallurgical program to test the
Bermingham mineralization.  As at August 10, 2016, Alexco drilled 25 holes for a total of 7,708
meters at Bermingham. Drill results for the complete program are expected to be available by the
end of October 2016 with interim drill results expected to be available mid-September.
The drill objectives are firstly to increase confidence, infill and expand the previously identified
zone of high grade infill around the previously obtained high grade silver intercepts on the Bear
Vein with sufficient density to permit resource estimation; and secondly, to explore up and down
plunge of the high grade zone for possible extensions to other favourable structural and
stratigraphic positions in which additional mineral deposition may have occurred.
The Bermingham mineralized system is open not only at depth but also over 600 meters strike
length to the northeast where potential linkage to the Hector-Calumet mine remains to be
resolved, and also to the southwest where there remains a kilometre of prospective ground to the
historic Coral Wigwam prospect.
Mineral Resource Estimate
On April 30, 2015 Alexco announced updated mineral resource estimates for the Flame & Moth
and Bermingham deposits. With an effective date of April 28, 2015 the Flame & Moth mineral
resource is estimated at 1,638,000 tonnes indicated grading 506 g/t silver, 1.89% lead and 5.40%
zinc and 0.43 g/t gold plus another 348,000 tonnes inferred grading 366 g/t silver, 0.47% lead,
4.37% zinc and 0.26 g/t gold. With an effective date of April 28, 2015 the Bermingham mineral
resource was estimated at 377,000 tonnes indicated grading 430 g/t per tonne silver, 1.59% lead
and 1.74% zinc plus another 52,000 tonnes inferred grading 477 g/t silver, 1.22% lead and 1.88%
zinc. The drill results from the 2015 surface exploration drill program are not included in this
mineral resource update.
The Corporation plans to provide an updated mineral resource estimate for the Bermingham
deposit in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Keno Hill Development Update
The Corporation initiated a mill assessment and maintenance program in the second quarter of
2016.  A mechanical assessment and maintenance of equipment is part of the routine process of
maintaining the crushing and milling equipment assets in a condition where resumption of
processing operations could be completed.
In July the Corporation commenced developing an underground portal entrance at the Flame &
Moth mine along with establishing the necessary surface infrastructure to drive the first 20 meters
of the production ramp. This will allow resumption of development activities to begin at full scale
in the future. This ramp will ultimately be driven to the upper production levels of the Flame &
Moth silver deposit. Based on prior work (see the December 10, 2014, Alexco Resource Corp.
PEA Technical Report entitled "Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Eastern
Keno Hill Silver Project - Phase 2, Yukon Canada"), the Flame & Moth deposit has
approximately 585,000 tonnes of potentially mineable material grading 693 g/t silver, 2.19% Pb,
5.35% Zn and 0.52 g/t gold.
 
6
Engineering Update
In 2016-Q2 Alexco continued to work on re-engineering and optimizing the mine plan for Flame
and Moth and Lucky Queen, incorporating the expanded mineral resource from April 30, 2015.
Mine plans will be updated and optimized based on geotechnical information and the Flame and
Moth and Lucky Queen economic model will be revised using current consensus pricing and
updated estimated costing. Once results from this work are compiled, the study will move to
develop an optimized multi mine model.
The Corporation plans to provide an updated PEA in the fourth quarter of 2016 which will
incorporate the re-engineering and optimization of the mine plan along with an updated mineral
resource estimate on Bermingham.
Permitting Update
On February 17, 2016 the Corporation was granted the amended Quartz Mining Licence ("QML")
for the Flame & Moth deposit. The QML allows development of the Flame and Moth deposit. The
only remaining permit required to commence mining operations at the Flame & Moth deposit is
the Water Use Licence ("WUL") which is granted through the Yukon Water Board. This process
is well underway and the Corporation expects a Water Licence amendment hearing to occur in
the fourth quarter of 2016.
As part of the QML amendment application, the Corporation filed an updated Reclamation and
Closure Plan for its current operations and the future development of the Flame & Moth deposit.
This review is required every two years. As a result, the QML requires that Alexco increase its
posted financial security from $4.2 million to $6.3 million. The $4.2 million currently posted is
included in the Corporation's non-current restricted cash and deposits. The Yukon Mine Site
Reclamation and Closure Policy Financial Guidelines provide several forms of acceptable
security, which includes pledging assets, bank letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance. On
July 26, 2016 the Corporation posted the additional $2.1 million in cash for security and are
currently working with the Yukon Government to substitute a portion of the cash posted in
exchange for a pledge of assets.
Mine Site Care and Maintenance
Mine site care and maintenance costs in 2016-Q2 totaled $477,000 compared to $575,000 in
2015-Q2. The decrease in costs is due to continuing operating efficiencies while in care and
maintenance.  Included in mine site care and maintenance costs is depreciation expense of
$405,000 in second quarter of 2016 compared to $431,000 in same period of 2015.
Mine site care and maintenance costs during the first six months of 2016 totaled $999,000
compared to $1,165,000 for the same period of 2015. The decrease in costs is due to continuing
operating efficiencies while in care and maintenance.  Included in mine site care and
maintenance costs is depreciation expense of $816,000 during first six months of 2016 compared
to $874,000 in same period of 2015.
General and Administrative Expenses
Corporate
Corporate general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2016 totaled $1,224,000
compared to $1,049,000 in the second quarter of 2015. The corporate general and administrative
expenses were consistent over both periods.  The 2016 period incurred lower office expenses,
including reduced corporate salaries, offset by increased share based compensation compared
to the 2015 period.
7
Corporate general and administrative expenses during the first six months of 2016 totaled
$2,202,000 compared to $2,228,000 for the same period of 2015. The corporate general and
administrative expenses were consistent over both periods.
Environmental Services
Environmental Services general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2016
totaled $700,000 compared to $884,000 in the second quarter of 2015. AEG general and
administrative expenses reflect overall utilization of the AEG workforce as well as business
development and administrative activity. The general and administrative expenses decreased
compared to the same period of 2015 as the AEG further utilized its personnel to billable projects.
Environmental Services general and administrative expenses during the first six months of 2016
totaled $1,702,000 compared to $1,857,000 for the same period in 2015. AEG general and
administrative expenses reflect overall utilization of the AEG workforce as well as business
development and administrative activity. The general and administrative expenses in the 2016
period decreased compared to the same period of 2015 as the AEG further utilized its personnel
to billable projects.

The net loss of 2014-Q4 reflects the impact of impairment charges recorded in respect of the
Keno Hill district mining assets and exploration and evaluation assets. The net losses for 2015
and Q1 of 2016 reflect site based expenditures along with general and administrative expenses
partially offset by AEG profits. The net income of 2016-Q2 reflects the fair value adjustment gain
from the Corporation's available-for-sale and held-for-trading investments.

The expenditures on mineral properties incurred in 2014 reflect a drill program primarily at the
Bermingham and Flame and Moth deposits. The mineral property expenditures in 2015 reflect
the drill program at the Bermingham deposit and the re-engineering work being done on the
Flame and Moth deposit. Furthermore, the mineral property expenditures reflected the ongoing
costs of modeling, data logging and resource estimation work for Bermingham and the Flame
and Moth deposits.  The 2016 mineral property expenditures reflect the work on the 2016 drill
program at Bermingham and continued re-engineering work being done on the Flame and Moth
deposit.
Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources
Liquidity
At June 30, 2016 the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents of $18,100,000, and net
working capital of $26,048,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $8,163,000 and net
working capital of $12,602,000 at December 31, 2015. The Corporation faces no known liquidity
issues in any of its financial assets.
With its cash resources and net working capital on hand at June 30, 2016, and assuming no re-
start of mining operations, Alexco anticipates it will have sufficient capital resources to carry out
all of its currently anticipated exploration and development programs, and service the working
capital requirements of its mine site care and maintenance, exploration activities, environmental
services business and corporate offices and administration, for at least the next 12 month period.
As noted elsewhere in this MD&A, re-start of mining operations is dependent on a number of
factors, including sustained improvement in the silver market and the efficiencies identified by on-
going engineering studies related to future mine plan options. Furthermore, a re-start of
underground production operations is likely to require additional capital investment, potentially in
excess of the capital resources currently on hand. In addition, Alexco has the right, which expires
December 31, 2016, to trigger the June 16, 2014 silver streaming agreement (see 'Capital
Resources' section for further detail), which would have significant positive implications to
Alexco, can only be triggered, by a payment of US$20 million. Discussions to further address the
Silver Wheaton silver streaming agreement are ongoing. Because of these factors, combined
with its long term objectives for the exploration and development of its mineral properties, the
Corporation is likely to require future additional funding.
Historically, Alexco's main sources of funding have been from mining operations, AEG and
equity issuances, though all sources of finance reasonably available to it will be considered,
including but not limited to issuance of new capital, issuance of new debt and the sale of assets
in whole or in part, including mineral property interests. There can be no assurance of a re-start of
mining operations or continued access to finance in the future, and an inability to generate or
secure such funding may require the Corporation to substantially curtail and defer its planned
exploration and development activities.

Cash used in operating activities was $1,877,000 for the second quarter of 2016 versus
$183,000 for the second quarter of 2015.  The majority of cash consumed in operating activities
during the 2016 period were expended on environmental services, site based operations and
general and administrative costs.  The cash consumed in second quarter of 2015 when
compared to 2016 mainly relates to the timing of collections of receivables in the 2015 period. 
Cash outflow from investing activities was $485,000 for the second quarter of 2016 versus an
inflow of $474,000 for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in cash used in the second
quarter of 2016 related primarily to expenditures from the 2016 drill program.  Compared to the
second quarter of 2015, were there was a decrease of restricted cash of US$750,000 from the
release of the Globeville Smelter Project security, which offset expenditures to mineral
properties. Cash inflow from financing activities was $13,407,000 for the second quarter of 2016
versus $nil for the second quarter of 2015.  The cash inflow relates to a non-brokered equity
financing, along with stock option and warrant exercises.

Cash used in operating activities was $2,960,000 for the first six months of 2016 versus
$2,003,000 for the same period of 2015.  The majority of cash consumed in operating activities
during the 2016 and 2015 periods were expended on environmental services, site based
operations and general and administrative costs.  The main difference between the two periods
relates to the timing of collections of receivables in the 2015 period.  Cash outflow from investing
activities was $510,000 for the first six months of 2016 versus an inflow of $870,000 for the same
period 2015. The increase in cash used for the first six months of 2016 related primarily to
expenditures on the 2016 surface drill program on Bermingham whereas the 2015 period
included a decrease of restricted cash of US$1,250,000 from the release of the Globeville
Smelter Project security, which offset expenditures to mineral properties. Cash inflow from
financing activities was $13,407,000 for the first six months of 2016 compared to $nil for the same
period of 2015.  The cash inflow relates to a non-brokered equity financing, along with stock
option and warrant exercises.

On October 2, 2008 (with subsequent amendments on October 20, 2008, December 10, 2008,
December 22, 2009, March 31, 2010, January 15, 2013, March 11, 2014 and June 16, 2014), the
Corporation entered into a silver streaming interest agreement (the "Silver Streaming
Agreement") with Silver Wheaton under which Silver Wheaton will receive 25% of the life of mine
silver produced by the Corporation from its Keno Hill Silver District properties.  The Silver
Streaming Agreement anticipated that the initial silver deliveries would come from the Bellekeno
property.  Under the Silver Streaming Agreement, the Corporation received up-front deposit
payments from Silver Wheaton totaling US$50 million, and received further payments of the
lesser of US $3.90 (increasing by 1% per annum after the third year of full production) and the
prevailing market price for each ounce of payable silver delivered, if as and when delivered. After
the initial 40 year term of the streaming interest, the Corporation is required to refund the balance
of any advance payments received and not yet reduced through silver deliveries. The
Corporation would also be required to refund the balance of advance payments received and not
yet reduced if Silver Wheaton exercised its right to terminate the streaming interest in an event of
default by the Corporation. As of September 2013, Bellekeno mining operations were suspended
in light of a sharply reduced silver price environment.
On June 16, 2014, Alexco entered into an agreement with Silver Wheaton to amend the original
Silver Streaming Agreement such that, upon payment of US$20 million to Silver Wheaton on or
before December 31, 2014 (the "Deadline"), the fixed US$3.90 per ounce silver streaming
production payment will be replaced with a variable production payment based on the spot price
of silver. The variable production payment was defined by a pricing curve with an apex at
US$19.45 spot silver price where Silver Wheaton would make a production payment to Alexco of
US$18.00 per ounce of silver delivered; that payment decreasing by US$0.91 per ounce for each
US$1.00 increase or decrease in silver price, returning to a fixed US$3.90 per ounce for spot
silver prices of US$35.00 per ounce and higher.  Upon payment of the US$20 million to Silver
Wheaton, the pricing amendment would be effective for a 10 year term from the time mining
production re-commences in the district, with an option for Alexco to extend the amendment for
another 5 or 10 years for an additional US$10 million or US$20 million, respectively.
The Deadline was initially extended until December 31, 2015 and Silver Wheaton subsequently
confirmed that Alexco has the right, by written notice delivered at any time up to December 31,
2016, to extend the Deadline to December 31, 2016.  If the Deadline is extended by Alexco and
the US$20 million payment is made to Silver Wheaton on or before the Deadline, the deposit
owing under the original silver purchase agreement will be reduced from US$50 million to
US$30 million and the deposit will be considered fully repaid.
 
10
Effective on signing the June 16, 2014 amending agreement, the date for completion of the 400
tonne per day mine and mill completion test date was extended to December 31, 2017. If the
Deadline is extended by Alexco and the US$20 million payment is made to Silver Wheaton on or
before the Deadline, the amendments provide that the deadline for this completion test would be
further extended to 24 months following the recommencement date.  In addition, pursuant to the
June 16, 2014 amending agreement, the Silver Wheaton area of interest was expanded to
include additional Alexco currently owned and future acquired properties within one kilometer of
existing Alexco holdings in the Keno Hill District.
If Alexco decides to extend the June 16, 2014 amending agreement, it is not obligated to make
the US$20 million payment to Silver Wheaton.  However, in order for certain of the amendments
to take effect (including the amendment to the fixed price), the Corporation would need to make
this payment.  The Corporation may require additional financing to make this payment and there
is no assurance that additional financing can be obtained by December 31, 2016 (or such later
date as the parties may agree).  If the Corporation is unable to, or chooses not to, make this
US$20 million payment, the fixed price payment terms of the original silver purchase agreement
remain in effect and, to satisfy the completion test under the Silver Purchase Agreement, the
Corporation will need to recommence operations on the KHSD Property and operate the mine
and mill at 400 tonnes per day on or before December 31, 2017. If the completion test is not
satisfied by December 31, 2017, the Corporation would be required to pay a capacity related
refund to Silver Wheaton in the maximum amount of US$9.75 million.
On May 17, 2016, the Corporation completed a non-brokered private placement financing and
issued 10,839,972 Units for aggregate gross proceeds of $13,008,000. Each Unit consisted of
one common share and one-half of one non-transferable common share purchase warrant, each
Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional common share at a price of $1.75.  In
connection with the financing, the Corporation paid a cash commission equal to 5% of the gross
proceeds from the sale.    Sprott Private Wealth LP and certain of its affiliates also received an
aggregate of 225,300 warrants.  Each warrant is exercisable for one common share at a price of
$1.49. Of the gross proceeds, $10,654,000 has been attributed to issued common shares and the
remaining $2,354,000 has been attributed to issued warrants. The warrants include an
acceleration clause whereby if on or after September 18, 2016 the closing price of the Alexco
shares is higher than $2.50 for a period of ten consecutive trading days (with the last day of such
period being the Acceleration Trigger Date), the expiry date of the warrants may be accelerated
to be ten days after the Acceleration Trigger Date.
Effective December 8, 2015, the Corporation completed a bought deal financing and issued
5,662,500 flow-through common shares on a private placement basis at a price of $0.53 per
share for aggregate gross proceeds of $3,001,125. Of the gross proceeds, $2,627,000 has been
attributed to issued common shares, and the remaining $311,000 has been attributed to the sale
of tax benefits. The underwriter to the financing received a cash fee of 6.5% of gross proceeds
plus 368,063 compensation warrants, each warrant exercisable for one common share of the
Corporation at an exercise price of $0.53 per share at any time until December 8, 2017.  Net
proceeds from the issuance were $2,713,000, after issuance costs comprised of the agent's
commission of $195,000, and other issuance costs of $93,000. Concurrently, the Corporation
issued 2,000,000 common shares on a private placement basis at a price of $0.48 per share for
aggregate gross proceeds of $960,000. Net proceeds from the issuance were $902,000, after
issuance costs comprised of the agent's commission of $57,600. As of June 30, 2016 the
Corporation had spent $1,412,859 of the flow-through funds raised.
On July 29, 2016 the Corporation filed a short form base shelf prospectus with the securities
commissions in each of the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and
Ontario and a corresponding amendment to its registration statement on Form F-10 (Registration
Statement) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the
U.S./Canada Multijurisdictional Disclosure System, which would allow the Corporation to make
offerings of common shares, warrants, subscription receipts and/or units up to an aggregate total
of Cdn$50 million during the 25-month period following July 29, 2016.

Share Data
As at the date of this MD&A, the Corporation has 91,685,372 common shares issued and
outstanding, including 29,997 shares held by the Corporation's restricted share unit plan trustee.
In addition, there are outstanding incentive share options for a further 6,414,495 common shares,
restricted share units that can be settled by way of shares issued from treasury for a further
490,906 common shares, and purchase warrants for a further 6,772,448.
Use of Financial Instruments
All of Alexco's cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 were held in the form of demand
deposits. Alexco's restricted cash and deposits were held in the form of term deposits and
demand deposits. Alexco's other financial instruments were its trade and other accounts
receivable, its accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and its investment in Golden Predator
Mining Corp common shares and warrants.
At June 30, 2016, a total of $4,173,000 of Alexco's restricted cash and deposits represent
security provided to regulatory bodies under safekeeping agreements in accordance with its
various operating permits. This security is in respect of mine-site reclamation at certain of
Alexco's mineral properties, and is releasable back to Alexco as and when reclamation activities
are completed. A further $4,241,000 (US$3,283,000) represents security provided in the first
quarter of 2012 to support certain cost performance commitments under an AEG remediation
contract. The balance of Alexco's restricted cash and deposits represent security provided in
respect of certain long-term operating lease commitments. Though a portion of term deposits held
at June 30, 2016 are included in long term restricted cash, as individual financial instruments
they carried initial maturity periods of one year or less. They have been classified as investments
held to maturity and accordingly are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All term deposits held are high grade, low risk investments, generally yielding between 1% and
2% per annum, and their carrying amounts approximate their fair values given their short terms
and low yields.
The carrying amounts of Alexco's trade and other accounts receivable and accounts payable and
accrued liabilities are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair values, while the carrying
amount of investments in common shares and warrants Golden Predator Mining Corp are
marked to fair value at each balance sheet date.  The fair values of all of Alexco's financial
instruments measured at June 30, 2016, other than the common shares and warrants Golden
Predator Mining Corp included in  investments, constitute Level 2 measurements within the fair
value hierarchy defined under IFRS. The fair value of the common shares and warrants in
Golden Predator constitute Level 1 measurements.
12
Substantially all of Alexco's cash, demand deposits and term deposits are held with major
financial institutions in Canada. With respect to these instruments, management believes the
exposure to credit risk is insignificant due to the nature of the institutions with which they are
held, and that the exposure to liquidity and interest rate risk is similarly insignificant given the
low-risk-premium yields and the demand or short-maturity-period character of the deposits.
Alexco's accounts and other receivables at June 30, 2016 total $2,735,000, comprised primarily
of AEG trade receivables and goods and services tax refunds receivable from government.
Alexco's maximum credit risk exposure in respect of its receivables is represented by their
carrying amount. Management actively monitors exposure to credit risk under its receivables,
particularly AEG trade receivables, and considers the risk of loss to be significantly mitigated due
to the financial strength of AEG's major customers which include government organizations as
well as substantial corporate entities. As at June 30, 2016, AEG trade receivables are recorded
net of a recoverability provision of $575,000.
Substantially all of Alexco's property, plant and equipment and mineral properties are located in
Canada; all of its mining operations and mineral exploration occur in Canada; and a significant
majority of AEG's revenues are earned in Canada. However, a portion of AEG's revenues are in
US dollars, and receivables arising therefrom are accordingly denominated in US dollars. Also,
while a significant majority of the Corporation's operating costs are denominated in Canadian
dollars, it does have some exposure to costs, and therefore accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, denominated in US dollars.
The Corporation has not employed any hedging activities in respect of the prices for its payable
metals or for its exposure to fluctuations in the value of the US dollar.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Alexco has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the valuation of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the period reported.
Management uses its best estimates for these purposes, based on assumptions that it believes
reflect the most probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action. Notes 3 and
5 of Alexco's 2015 annual consolidated financial statements describes all of the significant
accounting policies as well as significant judgment and estimates.
 
13
Changes In and Initial Adoption of Accounting Standards and Policies
Alexco had no changes to its accounting standards or policies during the period.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with the accounting principles under which the Corporation's financial
statements are prepared.  As required under National Instrument 52-109, management advises
that there have been no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the most recent interim period, being the six months ended June 30, 2016, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal
control over financial reporting.
Risk Factors
For a detailed listing of major risk factors management has identified which relates to Alexco's
business activities, please refer to Alexco's MD&A and Annual Information Form for the year

All mineral resources are classified following the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014), in accordance with the CIM Estimation of
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines and the guidelines of NI
43-101.
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
All numbers have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.
The Keno Hill Silver District is comprised of five deposits:  Bellekeno, Lucky Queen and Flame
& Moth, Onek and Bermingham, of which Bellekeno, Lucky Queen and Flame & Moth are
incorporated into the current mine plan outlined in the technical report filed on SEDAR dated
December 10, 2014 entitled "Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Keno Hill
Silver District Project – Phase 2, Yukon, Canada". The mineral resource estimates for the
project are supported by (a) disclosure in the news release dated December 23, 2014 entitled
"Alexco Updates Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment for Expanded Silver Production
from Keno Hill Silver District, Yukon"; and (b) a technical report filed on SEDAR dated
December 10, 2014 entitled "Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Keno Hill
Silver District Project – Phase 2, Yukon, Canada". The mineral resource estimates for the
Flame & Moth and Bermingham deposits are further supported by disclosure in the news
release dated April 30, 2015 entitled "Alexco Announces Indicated Silver Resource Estimate
Increases of 17% at Flame & Moth and 26% at Bermingham, Resulting in a 10% Increase
Overall for Keno Hill Silver District".
The resource estimates for the Bellekeno deposit are based on a geologic resource estimate
having an effective date of September 30, 2012. The Bellekeno indicated mineral resources
are as at September 30, 2013, and reflect the geologic resource less estimated subsequent
depletion from mine production.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This MD&A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information within the meaning of
applicable Canadian securities laws (together, "forward-looking statements") concerning the
Corporation's business plans, including but not limited to anticipated results and developments in
the Corporation's operations in future periods, planned exploration and development of its
mineral properties, plans related to its business and other matters that may occur in the future,
made as of the date of this MD&A.
Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future
remediation and reclamation activities, future mineral exploration, the estimation of mineral
reserves and mineral resources, the realization of mineral reserve and mineral resource
estimates, future mine construction and development activities, future mine operation and
production, the timing of activities, the amount of estimated revenues and expenses, the success
of exploration activities, permitting time lines, requirements for additional capital and sources and
uses of funds. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions,
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance
(often, but not always, using words or phrases such as "expects", "anticipates", "plans",
"estimates", "intends", "strategy", "goals", "objectives" or stating that certain actions, events or
results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of
any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be
"forward-looking statements".
Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, risks
related to actual results and timing of exploration and development activities; actual results and
timing of mining activities; actual results and timing of environmental services operations; actual
results and timing of remediation and reclamation activities; conclusions of economic
evaluations; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; future prices of silver,
gold, lead, zinc and other commodities; possible variations in mineable resources, grade or
recovery rates; failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; accidents,
labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry; First Nation rights and title; continued
capitalization and commercial viability; global economic conditions; competition; and delays in
obtaining governmental approvals or financing or in the completion of development activities.
Furthermore, forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently
uncertain, and actual achievements of the Corporation or other future events or conditions may
differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks,
uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those referred to in this MD&A under
the heading "Risk Factors" and elsewhere.
Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions that management believes are
reasonable at the time they are made.  In making the forward-looking statements included in this
AIF, the Corporation has applied several material assumptions, including, but not limited to, the
assumption that:  (1) additional financing needed to fund certain contingent payment obligations
to Silver Wheaton and, the US$20 million payment to Silver Wheaton referred to above will be
available on reasonable terms; (2) additional financing needed for the capacity related refund
under the silver purchase agreement with Silver Wheaton will be available on reasonable terms;
(3) additional financing needed for further exploration and development work on the
Corporation's properties will be available on reasonable terms; (4) the proposed development of
its mineral projects will be viable operationally and economically and proceed as planned; (5)
market fundamentals will result in sustained silver, gold, lead and zinc demand and prices, and
such prices will not be materially lower than those estimated by management in preparing the
annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015; (6) market fundamentals will
result in sustained silver, gold, lead and zinc demand and prices, and such prices will be
materially consistent with or more favourable than those anticipated in the PEA (as defined under
"Description of the Business – KHSD Property"); (7) the actual nature, size and grade of its
mineral resources are materially consistent with the resource estimates reported in the
supporting technical reports; (8) labor and other industry services will be available to the
Corporation at prices consistent with internal estimates; (9) the continuances of existing and, in
certain circumstances, proposed tax and royalty regimes; and (10) that other parties will continue
to meet and satisfy their contractual obligations to the Corporation.  Statements concerning
mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking
information to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered
if the property is developed.  Other material factors and assumptions are discussed throughout
this MD&A and, in particular, under both "Critical Accounting Estimates" and "Risk Factors".
 
16
The Corporation's forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations and
opinions of management on the date the statements are made and should not be relied on as
representing the Corporation's views on any subsequent date. While the Corporation anticipates
that subsequent events may cause its views to change, the Corporation specifically disclaims
any intention or any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or
management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change, except as required by applicable
law.  For the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-
looking statements.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors – Information Concerning Preparation of Resource Estimates
This MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in
effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws.  The terms
"mineral reserve", "proven mineral reserve" and "probable mineral reserve" are Canadian mining
terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy
and Petroleum (the "CIM") – CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral
Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the definitions
in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Industry Guide 7 under the
United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards,
mineralization cannot be classified as a "reserve" unless the determination has been made that
the mineralization could be economically and legally extracted at the time the reserve
determination is made.  As applied under SEC Industry Guide 7, a "final" or "bankable" feasibility
study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve
or cash flow analysis to designate reserves, and all necessary permits and government
authorizations must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority.
In addition, the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral
resource" and "inferred mineral resource" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-
101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally
not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC.  Investors are
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral deposit in these categories will ever be
converted into reserves. "Inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to
their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility.  It cannot be
assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher
category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis
of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases.  Investors are cautioned not to
assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally
mineable.  Disclosure of "contained ounces" in a resource is permitted disclosure under
Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization
that does not constitute "reserves" by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and
grade without reference to unit measures.
Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits contained in this MD&A may not be
comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and
disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
