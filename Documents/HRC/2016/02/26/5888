<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested the Secretary-General and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of their 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The present interim report provides 
information about some of the activities undertaken under the aegis of the Office within the last 
18 months to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples. The report by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people is 
contained in document A/HRC/9/9. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the adoption by the General Assembly of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, the Office has undertaken activities aimed at promoting the wide 
dissemination, understanding and implementation of the Declaration. In cooperation with the 
International Labour Office, it convened a meeting of the Inter-Agency Support Group on 
Indigenous Peoples Issues on 26 and 27 February 2008 to discuss integration of the Declaration 
into United Nations programmes and policies. A communications strategy has been developed 
within the Office, products of which include a pocket-sized version of the Declaration in all 
United Nations languages, a poster for promotion of the Declaration, a short film clip for use by 
the Office for public information, and a booklet for the general reader on the main provisions of 
the new instrument. These publications will be available in the course of the year. Briefings on 
the Declaration have been given at the Annual Meeting of Special Procedure mandate holders in 
June 2008 and to several of the treaty bodies. The Office has also developed a comparative 
review of the Declaration and the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention No. 169 of the 
International Labour Organization. The OHCHR field presences have been active in promoting 
the Declaration; the Nepal office, for example, has produced a version in the Nepali language. 
The Office also plans to prepare a manual on the Declaration for policymakers giving 
explanations of each of its provisions that would be available early in 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  EXPERT MECHANISM ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>3. The first session of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples will meet 
from 1 to 3 October 2008. The five members of the Expert Mechanism appointed by the 
President of the Council are: John Henriksen (Norway), Jannie Lasimbang (Malaysia), 
Jos&#233; Mencio Molintas (Philippines), Jos&#233; Carlos Morales Morales (Costa Rica) and 
Catherine Odimba Kombe (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The mandate of the new body is 
to assist the Human Rights Council in the implementation of its mandate by providing thematic 
expertise on the rights of indigenous peoples in the manner and form requested by the Council. 
The thematic expertise will focus mainly on studies and research-based advice. The Expert 
Mechanism may also suggest proposals to the Council for its consideration and approval. The 
provisional agenda of the session is available on the website of the Office. </p>

</p>
<p><b>III.  PERMANENT FORUM ON INDIGENOUS ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>4. OHCHR gives high priority to the work of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and 
participated at its seventh session held in New York from 21 April to 2 May 2008. The theme of 
the session was &#8220;Climate change, bio-diversity and livelihoods: the stewardship role of 
indigenous peoples and new challenges&#8221;; the Office contributed to an inter-agency paper on 
climate change, indigenous peoples and the United Nations system. The Office also drew 
attention to the ongoing study requested by the Human Rights Council on the human rights 
impact of climate change and solicited the active involvement of the Permanent Forum members 
and indigenous representatives. As requested by the Forum, the Office assisted the participation 
of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education as part of its efforts to 
strengthen cooperation between the Forum and international human rights mechanisms. The 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations provided assistance to 78 representatives of 
indigenous organizations to enable them to participate in the Forum. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>5. The annual meeting of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues (IASG) 
was hosted in Montr&#233;al by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(17-19 September 2007). The IASG is constituted of the focal points on indigenous issues from 
some 30 intergovernmental organizations with the purpose of enhancing cooperation among 
United Nations agencies on indigenous issues including through participation in the Permanent 
Forum. At the request of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), the IASG was asked 
to prepare guidelines for the integration of indigenous issues into United Nations country 
programmes. OHCHR and ILO elaborated the normative framework for the guidelines based on 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and ILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples. The UNDG approved the Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Issues in 
February 2008 and since then they have been sent to all Resident Coordinators as well as to all 
OHCHR field presences. Copies of the Guidelines in English and Spanish are available on the 
OHCHR website. In August 2008, a workplan to implement the Guidelines was agreed upon and 
OHCHR forms part of the management committee. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  VOLUNTARILY ISOLATED INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>6. In the Programme of Action for the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous People (A/60/270), the General Assembly recommended that a global mechanism be 
established to monitor the situation of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. OHCHR has 
taken leadership in the United Nations system for responding to the recommendation and 
organized an expert seminar on voluntarily isolated indigenous peoples in the Amazon and 
Gran Chaco regions in Santa Cruz, Bolivia in cooperation with the Government of Bolivia, the 
Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB) and the International Work Group for 
Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) in November 2006. The seminar heard case studies drawn from the 
region and elaborated a common platform and recommended inter alia that OHCHR elaborate, in 
cooperation with States in the region and other interested parties, guidelines to assist public 
policy on the issue. Since that seminar a further workshop supported by OHCHR was organized 
in Quito (19-20 October 2007). Comments have also been received on the draft guidelines 
elaborated by the Office; a further workshop is planned in November 2008 to finalize them. </p>

<p><b>VI. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>7. OHCHR has been cooperating with UN-HABITAT on the right to adequate housing and 
indigenous peoples, publishing a joint study in 2006. In March 2007, OHCHR and 
UN-HABITAT organized an expert seminar on urban indigenous peoples and migration in 
Santiago de Chile. Arising from the seminar, the two organizations were invited to prepare a 
study and policy guide on indigenous peoples in urban environments. Preparations of the policy 
guide are ongoing and a final document is expected at the end of the year. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  INDIGENOUS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMME 
</b></p>
<p>8. The establishment of the Indigenous Fellowship Programme was recommended by the 
General Assembly as part of the Plan of Action for the First International Decade of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous People and is now in its eleventh year. In 2008, indigenous fellows nominated by 
their organizations followed the 4-5 month programme; countries and communities represented 
were: Bolivia (Quechua), Colombia (Pasto), Guatemala (Maya - Tz&#8217;utuj&#8217;il), India (Boro), 
Kenya (Yaaku), Nepal (Gurung), Nicaragua (Telpaneca), Peru (from the Chynchaycocha 
community and the Awajun Wambisa community) Thailand (Lisu), and the United States of 
America (Oneida). In November and December 2008, eight indigenous persons from the 
Russian Federation will participate in a two-month programme, implemented partly in Moscow 
in cooperation with the Peoples Friendship University of Russia and partly at OHCHR in 
Geneva. In 2007 and 2008, OHCHR also provided grants to four former indigenous fellows to be 
able to spend four months in OHCHR field presences in Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and Panama as 
national fellows. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  VOLUNTARY FUND FOR INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>9. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations was established pursuant 
to General Assembly resolution 40/131 of 13 December 1985 for the purpose of assisting 
representatives of indigenous communities and organizations to participate in the deliberations of 
the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights, now replaced by the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, by providing them with financial assistance, funded by means of voluntary 
contributions from Governments, non-governmental organizations and other private or public 
entities. The General Assembly extended the mandate of the Fund in its resolution 56/140 of 
19 December 2001 by deciding that the Fund should be used to assist representatives of 
indigenous communities and organizations in attending, as observers, the sessions of the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The Fund is administered in accordance with the 
Financial Regulations of the United Nations by the Secretary-General, with the advice of a Board 
of Trustees, and can receive voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and other private or public entities. In 2008, the Board considered 154 admissible 
applications and recommended 78 travel grants for indigenous representatives to attend the first 
session of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples for a total amount of 
approximately US$ 209,066. In addition, the Board of Trustees considered 303 admissible 
applications and recommended 78 grants for indigenous representatives to attend the seventh 
session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues for a total amount of approximately 
US$ 357,199.  </p>

<p><b>IX.  ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA 
</b></p>
<p>10. The General Assembly in adopting the Plan of Action for the Second Decade of the 
World&#8217;s Indigenous People (A/60/270) recommended that cooperation be developed with the 
Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous Populations/Communities of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples Rights with a view to increasing participation of indigenous 
peoples from Africa in the implementation of the Decade and to enhancing the understanding of 
indigenous issues in the region. OHCHR has developed its relations with the Working Group and 
the African Commission and organized activities with the African Commission in May and 
November 2007 to raise awareness of indigenous issues in the region. The Office will organize 
further briefings in cooperation with the African Commission, in particular on the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, at the next session of the African Commission in 
November 2008. 
</p>
<p>11. The Office has responded to requests from the Government of the Republic of the Congo 
to give technical advice in relation to the drafting of a law on indigenous peoples. Comments on 
the draft law were sent by the Office to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of the 
Republic of the Congo, in particular to help the drafters align the document with existing human 
rights standards, in particular with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. OHCHR 
organized together with ILO, the Ministry and NGOs, two workshops on the draft law in May 
and July 2006. A further workshop is being organized by the Ministry of Justice and Human 
Rights from 18 to 19 August 2008 in Brazzaville for Parliamentarians to facilitate the passage of 
the law through Parliament. OHCHR is supporting the workshop both financially and 
substantively. 
</p>
<p><b>X.  STUDY ON GOOD PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>12. In the course of 2007 and 2008, a study was commissioned on good practices, obstacles 
and challenges in the implementation of recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
indigenous peoples, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. The project is part 
of the Andean Programme on the rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants and was 
co-organized and co-financed by OHCHR, UNICEF and UNIFEM. The purpose of the study is 
to understand better the causes for the so-called implementation gap between laws and 
governmental commitments and their practical application on the ground. The study was 
completed in July 2008 and will be published in the course of the year by the sponsors of the 
project. 
</p>
