Tariff

7.      
The maximum prescribed penalty for the said offence would be life imprisonment or fine of $1000,000.00 or both.

8.      
The tariff for drug related offences was stated in the FCA matter of Kini Sulua & Micheal Chandra v State Criminal Appeal No. AAU0093 & AAU0074 of 2008. At page 57 by majority decision it was accepted as follows:

In summary, the four categories are as follows:

(i) Category 1: possession of 0 to 100 grams of cannabis sativa - a non-custodial sentence to be given, for example, fines, community service, counselling, discharge with a strong warning, etc. Only in the worst cases, should a suspended prison sentence or a short sharp prison sentence be considered.

(ii) Category 2: possession of 100 to 1,000 gram of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 1 to 3 years imprisonment, with those possessing below 500 grams, being sentenced to less than 2 years, and those possessing more than 500 grams, be sentenced to more than 2 years imprisonment.

(iii) Category 3: possessing 1,000 to 4,000 grams of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 3 to 7 years, with those possessing less than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to less than 4 years imprisonment, and those possessing more than 2,500 grams, be sentenced to more than 4 years.

(iv) Category 4: possessing 4,000 grams and above of cannabis sativa. Tariff should be a sentence between 7 to 14 years imprisonment. 

Sentence

9.      
The offending in this case as suggested in Kini Sulua & Michael Chandra v State (supra) falls into category 3 i.e. possession of between 1,000 to 4,000 grams sentence should be between 3 to 7 years, with those possessing less than 2,500 grams be sentenced to less than 4 years imprisonment and those possessing more than 2,500 grams be sentenced to more than 4 years. 

10.     
In your case for the first count I take a starting point of 4 years. I don't see any aggravating factors except elements of the offence.

11.     
This being your first offence and other mitigation I reduce the sentence by 1 year. For your guilty plea I further deduct the sentence by 1 year 4 months.

12.     
You sentence for the first count is 2 years 8 months.

13.     
For the second count considering the circumstances of offending and giving appropriate discount for mitigating factors I sentence you to 3 months imprisonment.

14.     
Both counts are to be served concurrently hence in total your sentence will be 2 years 8 months. I reduce 5 days for your time in custody thus your final sentence will be 2 years 7 months & 25 days.

15.     
I've considered whether to suspend your sentence. Although this is your first offence, the offending is prevalent in community and there is a need to impose a sentence to deter other would be offenders and also act as a lesson for you. Further I don't see any exceptional circumstance to suspend your sentence. Your sentence will not be suspended.

16.     
You will serve an immediate imprisonment term of 2 years 7 months & 25 days.

17.     
I further order that you serve a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months before being eligible for parole.

18.     
28 days to appeal.
