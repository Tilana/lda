<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/1. It 
briefly outlines the activities of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, from 1 August 2012 to 28 February 2013, and contains a thematic 
analysis of the integration of a human rights-based approach in measures to discourage 
demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, 
and which leads to human trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>2. With regard to the activities carried out from 1 March 2012 to 31 July 2012, the 
Special Rapporteur refers to her most recent report submitted to the General Assembly 
(A/67/261). Her activities from 1 August 2012 to 28 February 2013 are briefly outlined 
below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation in conferences and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 28 February 2013, during the twenty-second session of the Human Rights 
Council, the Special Rapporteur participated in the side event on the topic &#8220;Women&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>Access to Justice: Models, Strategies and Practices from the Field&#8221;, held by the 
International Development Law Organization. 
</p>
<p>4. On 12&#8211;13 November, 2012, the Special Rapporteur convened a two-day expert 
meeting in Ankara on issues relating to human trafficking and supply chains, in particular 
to deepen the discussion on the standards applicable to businesses in addressing trafficking 
in the context of global supply chains. During the consultation, international experts from 
different stakeholder groups shared information on current trends, good practices and 
lessons learned in addressing trafficking in global supply chains and discussed elements of 
possible standards and indicators for achieving a trafficking-free supply chain. The 
summary report of the expert meeting is presented as an addendum to the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. On 26 October 2012, she participated as a panellist on the topic of trafficking in 
persons and the smuggling of migrants in international law in the Seminar on the 
Trafficking of Persons and Smuggling of Migrants, held in Santiago by the National 
Institute of Human Rights of Chile. 
</p>
<p>6. On 18 October 2012, the Special Rapporteur attended as a panellist the conference 
&#8220;Working together towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings: The Way 
</p>
<p>Forward&#8221;, organized in Brussels by the Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the European 
Union and the European Commission on the occasion of the Sixth European Union Anti-
Trafficking Day. 
</p>
<p>7. On 16 October 2012, she participated in the sixth session of the Conference of the 
Parties the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in Vienna. 
At this event, she made a statement highlighting the role of multilateral and regional 
cooperation in alleviating factors that make persons vulnerable to trafficking; developing 
and effectively implementing strategies to prevent trafficking in persons and in setting 
relevant standards; as well as a potential role of the private sector in the fight against 
trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>8. On 28&#8211;30 September 2012, the Special Rapporteur participated as a speaker in the 
Atlantic Dialogues, an annual gathering of public- and private-sector leaders from around </p>


<p>the Atlantic basin for a discussion on cross-regional issues ranging from security to 
economics and migration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur visited the United Arab Emirates from 11 to 17 April 2012, 
Gabon from 14 to 18 May 2012 and the Philippines from 5 to 9 November 2012 at the 
invitation of the respective Governments. The full reports of these visits are presented as 
addenda to this report. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Integration of a human rights-based approach in measures to 
discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation 
of persons, especially women and children, and which leads 
to human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>10. In her first report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/16), the Special 
Rapporteur stressed the continued existence of huge demand and supply of trafficking, and 
the need for an in-depth study into the demand. The Special Rapporteur has noted that 
different United Nations experts have drawn different conclusions about what measures are 
appropriate to discourage demand, particularly in the case of demand for sexual services.1 
</p>
<p>11. Over the past decade, anti-trafficking practitioners have debated what actions are 
required to discourage demand and what measures have proved effective. Progress in 
answering these questions has been notably slow. One reason is that the term &#8220;demand&#8221; is 
still subject to different interpretations, with some States and organizations putting the 
emphasis on measures to discourage exploitation associated with services, particularly 
sexual services and the exploitation of the prostitution of others, considering it appropriate 
to discourage men and boys from paying for commercial sexual services in any 
circumstances, whether the women, girls or men and boys with whom they pay for sex have 
been trafficked or not.2 Another reason is that addressing the demand side requires giving 
priority to measures in the places where trafficked persons are exploited,3 rather than in the 
locations (and States) where adults and children are recruited to be trafficked and exploited 
elsewhere. This has been a challenge for States that have either made no estimate of the 
scale of trafficking and exploitation of persons occurring in their territory or which refuse 
to acknowledge the scale of such abuse (with the result that they have not given priority to 
measures to prevent human trafficking). It also calls for an analysis and understanding of 
the factors that allow demand to be met by the exploitation of trafficked persons, including 
economic, social and cultural factors.

<p><b> B. The role of demand as a factor in fostering exploitation and trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>of persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>12. As noted in the earlier report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/10/16, paras. 51&#8211;
52): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The definition of demand, which is an economic term, can be adapted to the 
context of trafficking to describe it as the desire &#8222;for labour that is exploitative or 
services which breach the human rights of the person delivering those services&#8223;. It 
includes demand for sexual exploitation; for cheap labour and domestic workers; for 
organ removal and sale; for illicit adoption and forced marriages; for criminal 
activities or begging or for exploitation within the army &#8230; &#8222;The demand side of 
trafficking generally refers to the nature and extent of the exploitation of the 
trafficked persons after their arrival at the point of destination, as well as the social, 
cultural, political, economic, legal and developmental factors that shape the demand 
and facilitate the trafficking process&#8223;. As such, it does not have to be &#8222;properly 
understood as the demand for a trafficking victim&#8223;s prostitution, labour or services. 
</p>
<p>Rather, demand must be understood expansively, as any act that fosters any form of 
exploitation that, in turn, leads to trafficking&#8223;.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>13. The Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIFT) has identified three 
levels of demand related to human trafficking: employer demand (employers, owners, 
managers or subcontractors); consumer demand clients or prostitute-users (in the sex 
industry), corporate buyers (in manufacturing), household members (in domestic work); 
and third parties involved in the process.4 
</p>
<p>14. In the context of demand that fosters exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking 
in persons, one can differentiate direct and derived demands. Direct demand is for a service 
which is specifically provided by a person who has been subjected to one of the forms of 
exploitation listed in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking in Persons Protocol). Demand is also direct 
when it is for goods produced by a person who has been trafficked and subjected to one of 
these forms of exploitation. Examples of direct demand are: for domestic workers or care 
workers who have no alternative but to obey. Such demand is routinely for either migrants 
or children, in conditions where the workers concerned are unable (or unauthorized) to 
leave their employer &#8211; conditions which are sometimes due directly to legislation in force 
in the State concerned and sometimes a lack of protection measures, particularly child 
protection measures &#8211; for particular commercial sexual services which are not available 
from someone who has not been trafficked. &#8220;Derived demand&#8221; is not directly for the 
services of a trafficked or exploited person or for a commodity which they have helped 
produce, but for something else, usually for products or services that are particularly cheap. 
However, in some circumstances it is apparent that the service or commodity in question is 
highly unlikely to be available unless provided by trafficked persons. Examples of derived 
demand are: employer demand for cheap and docile workers; demand from businesses or 
institutions for the products or services of others (i.e., with what is called a &#8220;supply chain&#8221;), 
sometimes in other countries; consumer demand for cheap goods or particular services.5 
</p>
<p>15. On the basis of commissioned research in five Asian countries (in six sectors of 
income-generating activity), an International Labour Organization (ILO) report concluded 
that &#8220;the trafficking phenomenon is to a very high extent a result of employers&#8223; 
</p>

<p>unchallenged ability to create their own &#8211; often exploitative &#8211; working conditions for 
women and children in informal &#8222;hidden&#8223; sectors where they easily can take advantage of 
</p>
<p>the legislative weaknesses.6 The same report notes that &#8220;demand and supply factors are 
closely intertwined &#8230; Poverty and expectations of better earning opportunities induce 
thousands &#8230; to migrate and seek employment in unregulated and informal sectors where 
they are extremely vulnerable to exploitation. This abundant labour supply &#8230; fuels a level 
of demand that would not otherwise be there&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>16. Businesses that take advantage of trafficked persons aim to minimize production 
costs and maximize profits by not paying wages, requiring excessive overtime or otherwise 
failing to meet basic health and safety standards in environments that are inherently dirty, 
difficult or dangerous. Legitimate businesses may also maximize profit by subcontracting 
the recruitment of workers to a labour provider who uses methods associated with 
trafficking in persons, such as debt bondage or intimidation. 
</p>
<p>17. In the case of services provided by trafficked persons, the person who purchases or 
uses such services as sexual, care for the elderly or infirm, or domestic work generally 
comes into direct contact with the person being exploited. In contrast, consumers seeking 
cheap products generally have no personal contact and are often situated in a different 
country altogether. However, in both cases it is conceivable that the users of the services 
provided are unaware that those involved in producing goods or providing services for them 
have been trafficked or subjected to illegal force or coercion.  
</p>
<p>18. In some regions there is a specific demand for children to work in circumstances 
which are inconsistent with internationally recognized standards and frequently violate 
national law. For example, some children who are recruited to work in private homes as 
domestic workers are sought by employers because they are too young to resist their 
authority or pose a threat. While not all such cases involve trafficking or forced labour, 
some do. In various regions of the world, including industrialized countries, children are 
also deliberately sought by beggar masters.8  
</p>
<p>19. On a number of occasions over the past decade, concern has been voiced that large-
scale sporting events create a demand for the services of people who are trafficked and 
therefore require preventive action specifically to discourage demand. This concern led 
various agencies to inform the media before sporting events that large numbers of women 
or children were about to be trafficked. Some recent campaigns to discourage demand 
associated with sporting events have taken a wider perspective, pointing out that the 
organizers of sporting events have a responsibility to prevent not only people being 
trafficked to provide sexual services to fans, but also trafficking in the context of 
construction and the production of merchandise for sale at the events. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Existing international and regional legal frameworks and initiatives on 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing demand 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International legal and policy frameworks and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>20. The fundamental international instrument containing specific provisions on demand 
is the Trafficking in Persons Protocol. Its article 9, paragraph 5, states that States parties 
shall adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or 
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>trafficking in South Eastern Europe: A preliminary analysis</i> (2006).  </p>


<p>cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage 
the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, 
that leads to trafficking. The Protocol refers to the generic categories of measures that 
should be taken to discourage demand,9 but is not more precise. The guide published to 
advise States on what steps to take to implement the Protocol points out that &#8220;demand 
reduction &#8230; could be achieved in part through legislative or other measures targeting those 
who knowingly use or take advantage of the services of victims of exploitation&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>21. The role of individual consumers in fuelling the exploitation of children, including 
cases when children are trafficked, is recognized in the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
In this Protocol, the need is expressed for raising public awareness to reduce consumer 
demand for the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. In addition to 
requiring them to punish specified acts and activities by criminal or penal law, the Optional 
Protocol requires States parties to &#8220;promote awareness in the public at large, including 
</p>
<p>children, through information by all appropriate means, education and training, about the 
preventive measures and harmful effects of the offences referred to in the present Protocol&#8221; 
and &#8220;take appropriate measures aimed at effectively prohibiting the production and 
</p>
<p>dissemination of material advertising the offences described in the present Protocol&#8221; (art. 9, 
paras. 2 and 5). 
</p>
<p>22. In the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended a set 
of principles and guidelines to put the human rights of trafficked persons at the centre of all 
efforts to prevent and combat trafficking and protect, assist and provide redress to victims. 
The document provides specific recommendations on addressing demand as part of 
prevention strategies. It highlights the importance of addressing demand as a root cause of 
trafficking and raising the effectiveness of law enforcement to discourage demand, and 
recommends analysing the factors that generate demand for exploitative commercial sexual 
services and exploitative labour and taking strong legislative, policy and other measures to 
address these issues. Principle 2 provides that States have a responsibility under 
international law to act with due diligence to prevent trafficking, to investigate and 
prosecute traffickers and to assist and protect trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2010 the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) published a commentary on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, which provided further details about the human 
rights approach to preventing trafficking in persons, including measures to discourage 
demand. 
</p>
<p>24. The United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons 
includes several provisions suggesting that action be taken to discourage demand, including 
one referring to the need for &#8220;specific measures at national level to combat trafficking for 
labour exploitation and strive to educate consumers on those measures&#8221; (art. 22). 
</p>
<p>25. In 2011 the General Assembly in resolution 66/141 repeated a call to States &#8220;to 
combat the existence of a market that encourages such criminal practices [all forms of the 
sale of children, including for the purposes of the transfer of organs of the child for profit, 
child slavery, commercial sexual exploitation of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography] and take measures to eliminate the demand that fosters them&#8221;.

</i></p>
<p><i>the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto</i> 
(2004), part two, para. 74. 
</p>
<p> 10 Ibid. </p>


<p>26. The main international standard on employment agencies, ILO Convention No. 181 
(1997) concerning Private Employment Agencies specifies that &#8220;private employment 
agencies shall not charge directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, any fees or costs to 
workers&#8221; (art. 7.1). If respected, this provision should stop workers being put into debt 
bondage by recruitment agents; however, the Convention has not yet been widely ratified.11 
The Convention also requires States to &#8220;adopt all necessary and appropriate measures &#8230; to 
provide adequate protection for and prevent abuses of migrant workers recruited or placed 
in its territory by private employment agencies&#8221; (art. 8). The measures specified include 
penalties for private employment agencies which engage in fraudulent practices and abuses, 
including their prohibition. 
</p>
<p>27. The responsibilities of States with respect to the activities of businesses operating in 
their territory and/or jurisdiction were summarized in 2011 in the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31), developed by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises. They point out what States are required to do the necessary to ensure 
that what is called a &#8220;foundational principle&#8221; is respected: this requires that &#8220;States should 
</p>
<p>set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or 
jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations&#8221; (principle 2). It also 
stipulates that States should, inter alia, &#8220;provide effective guidance to business enterprises 
on how to respect human rights throughout their operations&#8221; and &#8220;encourage, and where 
appropriate require, business enterprises to communicate how they address their human 
rights impacts&#8221; (operational principle 3 (c) and (d)). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional legal frameworks and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>28. A number of regional legal instruments include provisions on discouraging demand. 
Article 5 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union specifically prohibits 
trafficking in human beings. Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and 
protecting its victims includes specific provisions on discouraging demand. Furthermore, 
article 18, paragraph 1, of the Directive provides that &#8220;Member States shall take appropriate 
measures, such as education and training, to discourage and reduce the demand that fosters 
all forms of exploitation related to trafficking in human beings&#8221;, and article 18, paragraph 
4, says that &#8220;in order to make the preventing and combating of trafficking in human beings 
more effective by discouraging demand, Member States shall consider taking measures to 
establish as a criminal offence the use of services which are the objects of exploitation as 
referred to in Article 2, with the knowledge that the person is a victim of an offence 
referred to in Article 2.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>29. The European Union Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human 
Beings 2012&#8211;2016 contains specific provisions on addressing demand. It is planned that a 
European business coalition against trafficking in human beings will be established in 2014 
to improve cooperation with businesses and other stakeholders, respond to emerging 
challenges and discuss measures to prevent trafficking in human beings, in particular in 
high-risk areas. In 2016, the European Commission intends to work together with the 
coalition to develop models and guidelines on reducing the demand for services provided 
by victims of trafficking in human beings, in particular in high-risk areas, including the sex 
industry, agriculture, construction and tourism. 
</p>
<p>30. Several provisions are also included in the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings. For instance, its article 6 provides that: 
</p>
<p>  
 11 As of July 2012, ILO Convention No. 181 had been ratified by 23 States.  </p>


<p>&#8220;To discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, 
especially women and children, that leads to trafficking, each Party shall adopt or 
strengthen legislative, administrative, educational, social, cultural or other measures 
including:  
</p>
<p>a research on best practices, methods and strategies;  
</p>
<p>b raising awareness of the responsibility and important role of media and 
civil society in identifying the demand as one of the root causes of trafficking 
in human beings; 
</p>
<p>c target information campaigns involving, as appropriate, inter alia, 
public authorities and policy makers;  
</p>
<p>d preventive measures, including educational programmes for boys and 
girls during their schooling, which stress the unacceptable nature of 
discrimination based on sex, and its disastrous consequences, the importance 
of gender equality and the dignity and integrity of every human being.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>31. The 2003 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Action Plan to 
Combat Trafficking in Human Beings recommended &#8220;adopting or strengthening legislative, 
educational, social, cultural or other measures, and, where applicable, penal legislation, 
including through bilateral and multilateral co-operation, to discourage the demand that 
fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, and that leads 
to trafficking&#8221;. Furthermore, in its decision No. 8/07 on combating trafficking in human 
beings for labour exploitation, the Organization&#8223;s Ministerial Council urged participating 
States to &#8220;develop programmes to curb the fraudulent recruitment used by some 
</p>
<p>employment agencies that can make persons more vulnerable to being trafficked&#8221; (para. 
16). 
</p>
<p>32. The Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT) 
adopted in 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding in which Member States recognize the 
&#8220;link between the demand for trafficking and the growing demand for exploitative labour 
and exploitative sexual services&#8221;. It also lays emphasis on the importance of bilateral 
</p>
<p>arrangements in &#8220;promoting safe, orderly and well-regulated migration as this serves to 
reduce the demand for illegal migration services which provide opportunities for 
traffickers&#8221; and &#8220;encouraging destination countries, including those from outside the 
Greater Mekong Sub-region to effectively enforce relevant national laws in order to reduce 
the acceptance of exploitation of persons that fuels the demand for the labour of trafficked 
persons&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Inter-Parliamentary 
Organization&#8223;s resolution on the role of Parliament in combating trafficking in women and 
children in the ASEAN region, adopted in 2004, appeals to the Governments of ASEAN 
countries to &#8220;strengthen existing legislation and enforcement mechanisms to punish 
particularly those who create demand for illicit sex or who use force or fraud to traffic 
women or minors into the international sex trade, while protecting the rights of the 
trafficking victims&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Initial Plan of Action 
against Trafficking in Persons (2002&#8211;2003) provided that member States, in partnership 
with NGOs, other civil society groups, and public and private media, shall develop and 
disseminate public awareness materials focusing on raising public understanding that 
trafficking in persons is a crime, and discouraging the demand that leads to trafficking, 
particularly by addressing those who might exploit victims of trafficking, for example as 
child domestics or farm labourers. </p>


<p><b> D. Overview of existing approaches and measures undertaken by States 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>35. While there is wide consensus that addressing demand for labour and services 
provided by trafficked persons plays a critical role in preventing trafficking in persons, the 
term &#8220;demand&#8221; is not defined in sufficient detail in existing legal instruments and the 
interpretation of the term has been the subject of much debate. 
</p>
<p>36. Although States reporting on the measures taken to discourage demand have 
reported on a wide range of methods, including some intended to address supply,12 the 
Special Rapporteur recognizes that not all prevention measures, even those specifically 
affecting the places where trafficked persons are exploited, should be regarded as measures 
to discourage demand. Further, in the debate about what to do to discourage demand, many 
stakeholders have focused exclusively on demand for commercial sexual exploitation, 
particularly of women and girls, and neglected other forms of demand, such as demand for 
exploitative labour and organs.

<p>37. The Working Group on Trafficking in Persons of the Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime has reviewed some of 
the measures which States have taken to discourage demand. Details about the measures 
implemented by 33 States were reported to the sixth session of the Conference of the 
Parties to the Convention (15&#8211;19 October 2012). In addition to mentioning general 
measures to combat trafficking in persons, several States provided information on their 
labour laws and codes, which they felt reduced trafficking in persons for forced labour. 
Some pointed out that they had adopted specific legislation regulating working conditions, 
especially for foreign workers. Some made reference to specific legislation to address the 
issue of demand by establishing the responsibility of employers for the management of their 
supply chains. A few States reported that they had addressed the issue of demand by 
adopting legislation prohibiting the advertisement of sexual services and criminalizing the 
purchase of sexual services. Those States commented that such legislation was aimed at 
eliminating the main pull factors in trafficking persons for sexual exploitation. Some States 
reported establishing monitoring mechanisms with a specific focus on: the conditions of 
employment of women, youth and foreign workers hired on a temporary basis; assessing 
the authenticity of job offers, especially job offers for foreign workers, whether temporary 
or not; and ensuring the mandatory compliance of employers with the established rules and 
regulations of employment.13 
</p>
<p>38. Following its second meeting in 2010, the Chair of the Working Group on 
Trafficking in Persons of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime noted the range of measures for States parties to 
take:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;States parties should adopt and strengthen practices aimed at discouraging demand 
for exploitative services, including considering measures to regulate, register and 
license private recruitment agencies; raising the awareness of employers to ensure 
their supply chains are free of trafficking in persons; enforcing labour standards 
through labour inspections and other relevant means; enforcing labour regulations; 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See report of the Secretariat Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime on best practices for addressing the demand for labour, services or 
goods that foster the exploitation of others, CTOC/COP/2012/4. 
</p>
<p> 13 Ibid., paras. 9&#8211;11 and 16.  </p>


<p>increasing the protection of the rights of migrant workers; and/or adopting measures 
to discourage the use of the services of victims of trafficking.&#8221;14 
</p>
<p>39. United Nations agencies have also summarized the measures they perceived to be 
needed to discourage demand, noting that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Examples of measures to address the demand side are measures to broaden 
awareness; attention and gender-sensitive research into all forms of exploitation and 
forced labour and the factors that underpin its demand; to raise public awareness on 
products and services that are produced by exploitative and forced labour; to 
regulate, license and monitor private recruitment agencies; to sensitize employers 
not to engage victims of trafficking or forced labour in their supply chain, whether 
through subcontracting or directly in their production; to enforce labour standards 
through labour inspections and other relevant means; to support the organisation of 
workers; to increase the protection of the rights of migrant workers; and/or to 
criminalize the use of services of victims of trafficking or forced labour.&#8221;15 
</p>
<p>40. In the course of her country visits and from other sources, the Special Rapporteur 
has heard about a variety of other measures taken by States to discourage demand. She has 
learned that the measures needed to address direct and derived demand are usually 
different. In the case of direct demand (which inherently seeks the services of individuals 
who have been trafficked), legislative or other measures that have a direct influence on 
purchasers&#8223; decisions are appropriate. However, when only some of the identical services 
</p>
<p>or products available to purchasers have involved the exploitation of persons, a different 
approach is appropriate: one which moves the focus from final purchasers onto whoever 
makes key purchasing decisions earlier in the supply chain and is in a position to discern 
which services or products involve human trafficking and which do not. This approach, 
which seeks to influence the purchasing decisions of such intermediaries by legislation or 
other measures, often introduces an element of regulation into the supply of services or 
products. Other States have adopted legislation or policy to regulate recruitment and 
employment in sectors where, in the absence of such regulation, trafficking is deemed 
likely to occur. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>41. As stated in the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, factors that make people vulnerable 
to trafficking and demand must be addressed in the strategies to prevent trafficking. This is 
further reinforced by the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking. Principles 4 and 5 and guideline 7 provide that strategies to prevent 
trafficking shall address demand as a root cause and States shall ensure that their 
interventions address the factors that increase vulnerability to trafficking, including 
inequality, poverty and all forms of discrimination. States may be held legally responsible 
for their failure to take adequate measures to prevent trafficking in persons, including 
measures to discourage demand.16 States in which exploitation of persons occurs or is 
alleged to occur have a particular responsibility to take action to discourage demand. 
</p>
<p>42. Educational measures involve providing information to students in schools or higher 
education, about trafficking in persons and about equality between women and men. States 
have also supported awareness-raising initiatives to inform the general public or particular

<p>audiences. Some public information is about trafficking in persons in general, while some 
focuses more specifically on the risk that the purchase of certain services (particularly 
sexual services) or products will contribute to the exploitation of people who have been 
trafficked, so the intention of providing information is to influence the spending decisions 
of those who receive information. For information to be effective in discouraging demand, 
it needs to be provided to specific audiences which have been identified as constituting a 
demand factor or being able to influence demand, with the content of the information being 
tailored to have the intended influence. During the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s country visits, she 
has heard of examples in which information has not been well-designed or targeted (and 
has therefore not had the desired effect). She has concluded that people who have been 
trafficked should routinely be consulted in the design, monitoring and evaluation of such 
efforts.17 
</p>
<p>43. A variety of social and child protection measures are aimed at alleviating harsh 
social or economic conditions which might otherwise encourage demand. States in various 
parts of the world have reported implementing measures that specifically concern migrant 
domestic workers employed in private households, especially in the context of employers 
who enjoy privileges, immunities and facilities. In such cases, States have generally 
concluded that the migrant domestic worker should have a formal contract establishing a 
minimum wage and stipulating the maximum number of working hours per week, as well 
as other conditions.18 
</p>
<p>44. Some measures reported explicitly address cultural practices which generate demand 
that fosters exploitation. For instance, for several decades children were reportedly 
trafficked to Gulf States from other countries to ride as jockeys in camel races. From 2005, 
some countries in the region banned the use of children as camel jockeys. 
</p>
<p>45. Giving charity to beggars is intrinsic to the culture and religious beliefs of people in 
many regions. When traffickers take advantage of this (for example, supplying children to 
beggar masters or maiming children or adults so they inspire more pity and earn more 
money for the beggar masters who take their earnings), a response is required which 
respects the values and beliefs of donors, but nevertheless intervenes to protect beggars 
who have been trafficked and discourages donations which go partly or largely to 
traffickers or to beggar masters. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur has analysed the question of trafficking in persons in 
business supply chains, including corporate responsibilities to prevent and combat human 
trafficking in their supply chains, in her 2012 report to the General Assembly (A/67/261). 
In the report, she noted that in today&#8223;s globalized world, the risks of human trafficking in 
</p>
<p>supply chains are significant throughout economic sectors, and have not been adequately 
dealt with, either by States or by businesses themselves (ibid., para. 48). 
</p>
<p>47. Some businesses are reported to have taken a series of measures to discourage child 
labour in general and the commercial sexual exploitation of children in particular. 
Businesses and other organizations which buy services or products from others can take a 
wide range of measures to discourage demand for the exploitation of persons, both in terms 
of discouraging any demand that they potentially create themselves (for example, when 
seeking to lower their production costs by cutting wages) and discouraging demand by 
others with whom they do business. Many of these are voluntary commitments (including 
some which involve a business entering into legally binding commitments with other 
businesses in its supply or product chain). Commitments routinely take the form of codes of 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Report of the Special Rapporteur on her mission to Thailand, A/HRC/20/18/Add.2, para. 77 (c).  
 18 CTOC/COP/2012/4, para. 28.  </p>


<p>conduct (with which businesses require their suppliers to comply) or procurement policies. 
A few of them focus on stopping human trafficking, but many more mention specific forms 
of exploitation, such as forced labour or child labour, alongside other corporate social 
responsibility commitments. Some are accompanied by compliance or verification 
procedures designed to check that commitments are being respected by all involved, but the 
independence and quality of such checks varies, raising questions about the effectiveness of 
such commitments. 
</p>
<p>48. Consumers and investors play an important role in pressing businesses to take 
appropriate action. However, they depend on accurate information being provided by 
others. In this context, journalists and NGOs that investigate supply and product chains 
have played an important role and organizations representing exploited workers or 
providing assistance to them are well-placed to provide accurate information. 
</p>
<p>49. Evidence suggests that when businesses work together to stop human trafficking, 
they can have a significant impact. For example, 10 food corporations in the United States 
of America involved in selling fast food, food services and groceries signed what were 
called &#8220;fair food agreements&#8221; in 2010 with an organization representing migrant 
</p>
<p>farmworkers.19 Retailers purchasing large quantities of tomatoes accepted a legal obligation 
&#8220;to cut off purchases in the event slavery is discovered in their supply chain&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>agreement came after a consumer boycott of one retailer, organized as a result of a 
campaign by the migrant farmworkers&#8223; organization. The consumer boycott was started 
</p>
<p>after it became known that labourers subjected to forced labour had worked on several 
farms that were supplying tomatoes to major retailers. 
</p>
<p>50. Another example, as highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of slavery, including its causes and consequences, is the experience of Brazil, where to 
address the pattern of exploitation known as &#8220;slave labour&#8221; in farming industry the 
Government initiated a series of measures, including the launching of 2005 National Pact 
for the Eradication of Slave Labour, which businesses were encouraged to join. The Pact 
was supplemented by a code of conduct that all signatories of the Pact are required to 
respect. That Special Rapporteur has recommended that the National Pact be extended to 
cover the textile industry of Brazil, as cases of forced labour have also been found there 
(A/HRC/15/20/Add.4, para. 123). By 2011, the Pact&#8223;s website reported that it had been 
backed by more than 220 businesses, business organizations or civil society organizations, 
with a collective turnover worth more than 20 per cent of country&#8223;s gross domestic product. 
Nevertheless, despite evidence that numerous companies have stopped doing business with 
suppliers on the basis of their commitments under the Pact, there has been a notable lack of 
engagement by companies whose business focuses on some of the commodities linked most 
closely with slave labour, such as cattle-ranching and the production of beef, soya and 
cotton. 
</p>
<p>51. In the case of any Government-run organizations which function or carry out 
transactions outside the national territory, this responsibility requires taking measures to 
discourage demand while individuals employed by the Government are based in another 
country. In this case, it is not only the procurement policies of the institutions involved 
which the State must check; it must also influence the personal behaviour of civil servants 
who might themselves employ or pay for the services of someone who has been trafficked.  
</p>

<p><b> 2. Protection 
</b></p>
<p>52. States have a duty to protect against human rights abuses (including trafficking in 
persons and exploitation of persons) by third parties, including business enterprises and 
criminal associations, through appropriate policies, regulation and adjudication. States 
should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their 
territory and/or jurisdiction will respect human rights throughout their operations, both at 
home and abroad, and take appropriate action to stop trafficking in persons or the 
exploitation of persons from occurring, regardless of the size, sector, operational context, 
ownership and structure of the business enterprise.20 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur has noted that leaving the labour market to regulate itself in 
circumstances where substantial numbers of people are exposed to exploitation, in informal, 
unprotected and low-status income-generating activities, creates a vacuum in the rule of 
law, which is likely to be filled by unprincipled employers and criminals. Evidence to 
support this hypothesis is available from several regions where trafficking in persons and 
the exploitation of persons have been reported as disproportionately high in the sectors of 
the economy that have been established relatively recently, where there is a lack of 
established procedures for collective bargaining, or that, for various reasons, have escaped 
the scrutiny of labour inspectors or other law enforcement officials. Recent examples of 
emerging sectors in which trafficking in persons and exploitation of persons have been 
reported include the garment industry, mushroom and other agricultural production in 
various parts of Europe, and the picking of wild berries for the cosmetic industry. 
</p>
<p>54. The fact that certain income-generating activities are not regarded by States as 
legitimate or acceptable, such as prostitution or begging, is not a justification for States to 
ignore the abuse being experienced by individuals involved, nor for States to allocate 
inadequate resources to protect the adults or children who are trafficked into these 
activities. Similarly, the fact that certain States cannot afford to finance all the law 
enforcement activities required to enforce labour laws is not a justification for them to 
ignore violations of such laws (and of human rights). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>55. Law has been used in specific ways to try to affect demand, sometimes to prohibit 
demand for specific services or products and sometimes to introduce regulation or other 
administrative systems. 
</p>
<p>56. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings 
covers &#8220;criminalisation of the use of services of a victim&#8221;. Without making it obligatory for 
States parties to make it an offence for someone to purchase services from a person who 
they know has been trafficked, it requires States parties to consider doing so (art. 19). 
According to the reports of Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings, some States of the Council of Europe have criminalized the 
known use of the services of trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>57. Some States have preferred to encourage self-regulation among employment 
agencies. This was the approach in some European countries which later adopted tighter 
control and a system of licensing of agencies, for instance due to tragic incidents caused by 
trafficking in persons.21 
</p>
<p>

 21  See for example, Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland; for more information see <i>Gangmasters Licensing Authority Annual Report and 
Accounts: 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012</i> (London, The Stationery Office, 2012).   </p>


<p><b> 4. Promotion of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>58. The importance of bilateral and international cooperation in discouraging the 
demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, 
that leads to trafficking has been noted in article 9 of the Trafficking Protocol. As 
globalization has increased demand for cheap labour and services and for sex tourism, there 
is an increasing need for international cooperation on the part of both State and non-State 
actors. 
</p>
<p>59. Following the First World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children in Stockholm in 1996, the efforts in preventing children from being sexually 
exploited in holiday resorts focused on measures to be taken by hotels and travel 
businesses, rather than simply on public information intended to discourage tourists for 
paying for sexual services with children. A Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children 
from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism was adopted in 2001 to protect children 
from sex tourism for tourism businesses. At the end of 2012, the Code was reportedly being 
implemented by over 1,030 companies in 42 countries. 
</p>
<p>60. The Third World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, 
held in Brazil in November 2008, resulted in the Rio Declaration and Action Plan to 
Prevent and Stop the Sexual Exploitation of Child and Adolescents, setting the agenda for 
international efforts in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Lessons learnt and remaining challenges in integrating a human rights-
</b></p>
<p><b>based approach 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Challenges on implementation of existing frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>61. At the global level, the mechanisms to enforce the Protocol obligations under article 
9 on the prevention of human trafficking, including discouraging &#8220;the demand that fosters 
all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to 
trafficking&#8221;, need to be further strengthened. While comparable treaties, such as the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, have 
their implementation overseen by a committee &#8211; which acts as the most powerful 
enforcement body ensuring that the obligations within the conventions are met &#8211; there is no 
such committee established to govern compliance with the Protocol. 
</p>
<p>62. It was highlighted by researchers and experts that migration policies that restrict 
access to legal channels of migration, trade policies liberalizing the movement of money, 
goods and services but not labour, and the &#8220;explosive growth&#8221; of the global sex industry are 
all contributing to the increase of incidents of trafficking in persons. Due diligence on the 
part of States should require action on these wider processes, all of which foster demand 
for, and vulnerability to, trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>63. States are also responsible for implementing appropriate measures to guarantee 
internationally recognized labour rights in all categories of workplaces, particularly the 
&#8220;core labour rights&#8221;, which include the two ILO conventions on forced labour,22 as well as 
ILO conventions to guarantee the right to freedom of association and against child labour 
</p>
<p>  
 22 ILO Conventions Nos. 29 (1930) concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour and 105 (1957) 
</p>
<p>concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour.  </p>


<p>and discrimination. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur and her predecessor have noted in 
the course of country visits that Government authorities make repeated exceptions, in law 
or in practice, creating spaces where employers can violate labour rights with impunity. 
</p><p>64. To guarantee labour rights, States are required to develop and resource a suitable 
body of professional labour-law enforcement officials, generally known as labour 
inspectors. States which fail to develop a labour inspectorate with appropriate expertise and 
adequate resources to carry out its mandate are in effect condoning abuses of labour rights. 
Nevertheless, even a well-resourced labour inspectorate is likely to face challenges in 
reaching the numerous places where exploitation of persons occurs. 
</p>
<p>65. Evidence collected over the past decade indicates that a substantial proportion of the 
workers who are trafficked and subjected to forced labour are contract workers who are not 
recruited or employed directly by the business for which they are working (on a work site, 
such as a farm or construction site). Instead, they are supplied by an agency or 
intermediary. In such circumstances, States should consider regulating the activities of 
recruitment agents and agencies. If they decide not to introduce a system of regulation, 
States still have a responsibility to ensure that recruitment agents and agencies are not 
contributing to human trafficking, both by checking on the effectiveness of any system of 
self-regulation practiced by the employment industry and ensuring that suitably trained law 
enforcement officials are available to investigate whenever abuses are reported. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights impacts of business activities 
</b></p>
<p>66. According to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, &#8220;the 
responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises: (a) avoid causing 
or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, and address 
such impacts when they occur; (b) seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts 
that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business 
relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts&#8221; (guiding principle 13). 
</p>
<p>67. Even businesses which invest significant amounts in checking their supply chains 
suffer from the fact that there is no internationally recognized standard for the process of 
checking whether minimum labour standards and human rights standards are respected in 
the workplace. It is challenging for other businesses and individual consumers to assess 
whether the cheap cost of a product was due to good business management or due to abuse 
in the production process. It is the responsibility of the State (in addition to being the 
responsibility of employers, business owners and investors) to ensure that keeping 
production costs and wage bills to a minimum is not achieved by illegal or abusive means. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. C</b>hildren&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. The principal responsibility of States in such cases is to protect the children 
concerned. When there is evidence that the majority of children to be found begging have 
been trafficked or are being subjected to either forced labour or a practice similar to 
slavery, the relevant Government authority with appropriate child protection expertise 
should consider what response is appropriate, notably whether it should involve 
discouraging children of a certain age from begging, making it a criminal offence to profit 
from a child&#8223;s begging or discouraging the public from donating money to child beggars in 
</p>
<p>some or all circumstances. When trafficked children are reported to be moved from one 
State to a neighbouring State, it would be in the best interests of the children concerned for 
the various States involved to harmonize their responses, so that traffickers cannot simply 
move on, accompanied by the children they exploit, to take advantage of different laws and 
regulations in a neighbouring State. </p>


<p>69. In particular, as highlighted by both the Committee on the Rights of the Child 23 and 
the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,24 
States have a responsibility to listen to and take into account the views of children who may 
be affected by policy measures that are planned, in particular paying attention to ensuring 
that marginalized and disadvantaged children, such as exploited children, street children or 
refugee children, are not excluded from consultative processes. 
</p>
<p>70. Measures to boycott or ban goods made by child labourers were reported to have had 
a negative impact on some of the children who were intended to benefit, because most often 
employers reacted by laying off underage workers, en masse, without warning and without 
compensation.25 
</p>
<p>71. The campaign alleging forced child labour in the cultivation of cocoa in one or more 
West African countries deserves particular mention, as several publications have reported 
that children have been trafficked for the purpose of subjecting them to forced labour 
working on cocoa farms. Following publicity in the media at the end of 2000 and again in 
April 2001 that children from within the region were being trafficked into slave labour or 
forced labour on cocoa farms, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association convened a 
meeting of those it considered to be key stakeholders. In September 2001 these 
stakeholders signed the Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and their 
Derivative Products in a Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. 
Nevertheless, in 2012 the news agency CNN widely documented and reported cases of 
trafficked children still working in cocoa farms in the West African region  as part of its 
year-long campaign, the Freedom Project on ending human trafficking and modern-day 
slavery. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Unintended negative consequences of measures for addressing demand 
</b></p>
<p>72. Principle 3 of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking highlights the potential for negative interaction between established 
rights and new measures to address trafficking. The commentary on the Recommended 
Principles and Guidelines stresses, in relation to the responses of States to human 
trafficking, that &#8220;human rights law also confirms that States cannot violate non-
discrimination principles or norms protecting economic, social and cultural&#8232;rights when 
developing or implementing their response to trafficking&#8221;.26 Principle 3 also mentions 
particularly the rights of those in potentially vulnerable situations due to immigration 
status, stating:<b> </b>&#8220;Anti-trafficking measures shall not adversely affect the human rights and 
dignity of persons, in particular the rights of those who have been trafficked, and of 
migrants, internally displaced persons, refugees and asylum-seekers.&#8221; It makes explicit a 
responsibility to extend the principle of proportionality to all people, regardless of 
citizenship of immigration status. 
</p>
<p>73. In its general comment No. 27 (1999) on freedom of movement, the Human Rights 
Committee emphasized the importance of the principle of proportionality, in the context of 
principles which were applicable when determining what restrictions it is legitimate for 
States to impose on freedom of movement. It reads: &#8220;Restrictive measures must conform to 
the principle of proportionality; they must be appropriate to achieve their protective 
</p>
<p>  
 23 In its general comment No. 12 (2009) on the right of the child to be heard, para. 118. 
 24 A/67/291, para. 11. 
 25 For example, Alec Fyfe, <i>The worldwide movement against child labour </i>&#8211;<i> Progress and future 
</i></p>
<p><i>directions</i> (Geneva, ILO, 2007), p. 53.  
 26 <i>Recommended principles and guidelines: Commentary</i>, p. 38. </p>


<p>function; they must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve 
the desired result; and they must be proportionate to the interest to be protected.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur does not wish to contribute to a rise in protectionism in 
world trade, but is aware that, by allowing the importation of goods which are known to 
have been produced wholly or partially by trafficked persons, States are failing to use this 
opportunity to discourage demand. There are important distinctions to make between 
exploitation of persons (associated with trafficking in persons) and the exploitation of child 
labour, with ILO estimating that the latter involves well over two hundred million 
children.27 It might be relatively easy for organizations with protectionist motives to claim 
that particular products are tainted by exploitation, in the absence of credible evidence. The 
Special Rapporteur consequently reaffirms the importance of States, as well as businesses, 
promoting the collection and publication of evidence by independent monitors. 
</p>
<p>75. Demand-oriented measures taken by the authorities in importing States, in 
combination with or separate from measures by retailers or businesses that import a 
commodity suspected of being produced by people subjected to exploitation of persons, 
may not generate the intended results unless accompanied by appropriate measures in the 
countries where exploitation (and possibly trafficking in persons) occurs. It also shows the 
importance of taking practical conditions on the ground into account, including the nature 
of the product and the production process. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Consultation as integral to a human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>76. Commitment to consulting those who will be or would have been affected by 
potential measures is essential to a human rights-based approach to human trafficking. 
States should aim to set a high standard for consultation, which may counteract a discourse 
in which trafficked persons are seen only as victims with little agency, and thus excluded 
from negotiations. It may also act as a further precedent for such groups to be involved as 
active subjects in any proposals which would affect their futures. 
</p>
<p>77. A report by the Global Alliance against Traffic in Women states that &#8220;a human 
rights approach to trafficking is empty and meaningless if it does not place at the very core 
the voice and agency of trafficked and migrant women&#8221;.28 Whilst measures to address 
demand must evidently also include consultation with men and children, a human rights-
based approach to human trafficking must foreground the rights and wellbeing of those who 
have been trafficked, placing them and their views at the centre of discussions around 
measures to discourage demand. Genuine inclusion of the views and voices of those who 
have been trafficked assists in developing a proportionate response and reflecting the rights 
and desires of victims, as well as the inherent complexity of the issue. A consultative 
approach encourages the implementation of strategies focusing on the potential impact on 
such individuals, in keeping with international human rights principles around human 
trafficking. As the High Commissioner for Human Rights noted, a human rights-based 
approach &#8220;requires us to consider, at each and every stage, the impact that a law, policy, 
</p>
<p>practice or measure may have on persons who have been trafficked and persons who are

<p>78. An increased focus on consultation of the key groups affected by measures to reduce 
demand may reduce the possibility of unanticipated negative impacts of such strategies

<p>arising, or of the implementation of measures which are not wanted by those they will 
primarily impact upon. A range of human rights are violated in human trafficking cases, 
covering a broad area in the social sphere and linked to different kinds of activities. 
Responses, therefore, require a multidisciplinary approach. Consultation with those affected 
by measures to reduce demand can highlight the complexity of the issues, as well as 
suggesting further courses of action and research. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Freedom of movement  
</b></p>
<p>79. A human rights-based approach to human trafficking must ensure legislation and 
policy does not infringe upon other human rights. A key issue here concerns the freedom of 
movement and the risks involved with measures to reduce demand. Such measures have the 
potential to provide States with a rationalization for the intensification of efforts to prevent 
immigration. Furthermore, a recent UNESCO report notes that anti-trafficking measures 
often disproportionately focus on combating irregular migration, rather than on the 
conditions to which victims are subjected, and lack assistance and protection services for 
victims.30 In many countries, assistance, protection and even temporary regularization of 
immigration status are dependent upon compliance with law enforcement authorities. 
</p>
<p>80. Indeed, issues relating to migration and freedom of movement are perhaps the most 
problematic of human rights concerns surrounding anti-trafficking measures. Measures 
which restrict legal migration channels risk exacerbating both human trafficking and human 
smuggling, as well as the human rights violations which surround them. Trafficking is an 
outcome of global political and economic realities, particularly massive disparities of 
wealth and standard of living. This must be taken into consideration in the formulation of 
any response to the demand for human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>81. A proportionate response to the demand problem must take into account the 
potential of anti-trafficking measures that restrict freedom of movement to increase the risk 
of human smuggling. Higher prices will be commanded from smugglers and those who 
cannot pay may become more vulnerable to exploitation. 
</p>
<p>82. In addition, a disproportionate focus on tighter migration controls also risks 
exacerbating the situation further along the trafficking cycle. Studies have noted that 
traffickers often exploit victims&#8223; fear of possible deportation, their illegal residence or 
labour status to prevent victims from escaping. Such observations provide further support 
for avoiding measures which focus disproportionately on human trafficking as a migration 
issue.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations

<p>83.<b> Under the terms of article 9 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, States parties are

<p>required to &#8220;adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures &#8230; <b>to discourage the 
</b></p>
<p><b>demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and

</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In the context of trafficking in persons and the exploitation of persons,

<p><b>labour rights. This desire is usually expressed in the form of money which supplies 
</b></p>
<p><b>income for traffickers and their associates. Discouraging such demand requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to address the nature and extent of the exploitation of trafficked victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>(primarily in the places where they are exploited), as well as measures to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>social, cultural, political economic, legal and development factors that shape demand 
</b></p>
<p><b>and influence or enable the trafficking process. This can be done by influencing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>purchasing decisions of individuals and business entities, who contribute, wittingly or 
</b></p>
<p><b>unwittingly, to the income of traffickers and their associates. States have a 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility to act with due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>taking measures to discourage demand. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> </b>Taking in account States&#8217; oblig<b>ations under international human rights law, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to offer a set of recommendations which may serve as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis for human rights-based measures to discourage the demand that fosters or leads 
</b></p>
<p><b>to trafficking in persons: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should identify and analyse factors that generate demand for 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitative sexual services and exploitative labour and take strong legislative, policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other measures to address these issues. Measures to discourage demand should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on existing experience and accurate information about patterns of trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons occurring in their jurisdiction (concerning people trafficked into, through or 
</b></p>
<p><b>out of their territory); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States have a responsibility to protect against human rights abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including trafficking in persons and exploitation of persons) by third parties, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including business enterprises and criminal associations, through appropriate policies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulation and adjudication. States should set out clearly the expectation that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction will respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights throughout their operations, both at home and abroad, and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate action to stop trafficking in persons or the exploitation of persons from 
</b></p>
<p><b>occurring, regardless of the size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the business enterprise; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Discouraging demand routinely requires measures to stop 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, notably discriminatory practices which contribute to the exploitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of persons. These include discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, national origin 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other criteria, such as discrimination against migrant workers in employment 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices. States should eliminate acts or practices of discrimination on such grounds 
</b></p>
<p><b>and should amend laws and policies that institutionalize discrimination and thereby 
</b></p>
<p><b>also shape demand, particularly ones concerned with employment or migration, just 
</b></p>
<p><b>as they must challenge discriminatory social attitudes, practices and beliefs, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>also shape demand; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) It is necessary to put regulatory and supervisory mechanisms in place 
</b></p>
<p><b>whenever they encourage or facilitate any forms of labour migration, as the absence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>such mechanisms has had the effect of facilitating trafficking in persons. Legislation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>required to protect anyone who, in the absence of appropriate protection, can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploited with relative ease (such as migrant workers in general, child 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers,particularly those below the minimum age for admission to employment) and 
</b></p>
<p><b>anyone working outside a formal or regulated workplace (such as migrant domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers and other migrants, particularly women, who work in unregulated or 
</b></p>
<p><b>informal workplaces). Legislation may also be required to ensure that any places 
</b></p>
<p><b>where trafficked persons may be deployed to work or earn money, including informal 
</b></p>
<p><b>workplaces or settings, are subject to the rule of law and can be checked by law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement officials, if necessary; </b></p>


<p><b>(e) Measures to discourage demand should conform with general principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>associated with the rule of law, i.e., should not make it an offence to commit an act 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including purchasing a particular service or produce) in circumstances in which the 
</b></p>
<p><b>purchaser could not reasonably be expected to be aware that he or she was 
</b></p>
<p><b>committing an offence, for example if a particular product or service is made or 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by someone who has been trafficked, unless there is evidence that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>purchaser was negligent. This means that States should publicize any changes in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>law that make it an offence to purchase certain types of services or products made or 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by people who have been trafficked, and provide unambiguous information 
</b></p>
<p><b>to potential purchasers about such services or products; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Measures to discourage demand which involve restricting the exercise of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the human rights, including by individuals who are judged to be especially vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>to being trafficked, should conform with the principle of proportionality (i.e., they 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be the least 
</b></p>
<p><b>intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve the desired result; and they 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be proportionate to the interest to be protected); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) It is necessary to ensure that anti-trafficking measures do not adversely 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect the human rights and dignity of persons, in particular the rights of those who 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been trafficked, migrants, internally displaced persons, refugees and asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>seekers. States should actively monitor the impact and possible side effects of 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to discourage demand and take appropriate action to address any 
</b></p>
<p><b>unintended side effects which restrict the exercise of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should seek the views of representatives of any particular group of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people who would potentially be affected by measures to prevent human trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>a significant way and take these views into account when designing measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>discourage demand. Seeking the views of such people means collecting relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>information from people who, on account of their experience, are likely to be well-
</b></p>
<p><b>informed about the shortcomings, gaps or unintended consequences of existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and practices. In particular, as highlighted by the Committee on the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Child, States have a responsibility to listen to and take into account the views of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children who may be impacted by any measures to discourage demand. 
</b></p>
