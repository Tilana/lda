HIGHLIGHTS
Yarraloola Project – West Pilbara
Robe Mesa Deposit
-  Review  completed  on  block  model  from  Robe  Mesa  Deposit  which  reports  a  total 
pisolitic iron-stone (CID) resource of 84.5 Mt @ 53.8% Fe (equivalent calcined iron, FeCa 
of  60.2%)  +  8.3%  SiO2  +  3.4%  Al2O3  +  0.04%  P  +  10.6%  LOI  that  includes  65.7  Mt  of 
Indicated Resource and 18.8 Mt of Inferred Resource above a cut-off grade of 50% Fe.
-  A higher grade resource (Fe >55%) which totals 24.7 Mt as 19.5 Mt Indicated Resource + 
5.2 Mt of Inferred Resource @ 56% Fe (equivalent calcined iron, FeCa of 62.7%) + 5.9% 
SiO2 + 2.7% Al2O3 + 0.04% P + 10.7% LOI appears to be contiguous in the upper parts of 
both the upper and lower zone mineralisation. 
Future work will focus on delineating potential extensions and a metallurgical study.

Soil sampling extends the prospectivity for base-metals (lead, zinc and silver) associated 
with  felsic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks  and  identifies  new  prospectivity  for  gold  and 
nickel from meta-volcanic rocks in the Cleaverville Terrain. 
Lead  (Pb)  to  786  ppm,  zinc  (Zn)  to  1150  ppm  and  silver  anomalism  in  soils  over  felsic 
rocks is more extensive than historical results suggested and extends beyond the scope 
of the 2015 programme which covered an area of 8 km by 1 km.
-  A rock-chip sample showing evidence of epidote alteration reports lead (Pb) at 0.9% and 
silver (Ag) at 6g/t from the margin of a new soil-based anomaly and extends evidence for 
base-metal mineralisation to a strike length of over 2.5km.
-  Gold  (Au)  to  61  ppb  in  soil  is  associated  with  a  less  magnetic  zone  in  the  interpreted
basaltic footwall of the base-metal anomaly.
-  Nickel (Ni) to 1100 ppm in soil is associated with elevated chromium (Cr to 1350 ppm) 
and indicates potential for mineralised ultramafic rocks within the mafic meta-volcanic 
rock suite. 
Future work will focus on the delineation of targets for drilling.

Project Summaries
Yarraloola Project – West Pilbara
Background
The Yarraloola tenements cover an area of 853 km2 in the western part of the Hamersley Basin and 
adjacent parts of the Ashburton Trough in the West Pilbara. The project has a basement of Archaean 
and Proterozoic-aged rocks that are in parts overlain by younger sediments of the Carnarvon Basin. 
All the sequences are prospective for iron mineralisation. In the east, Archaean-age sediments in the 
Hamersley  Basin  include  iron-rich  members  of  the  Marra  Mamba,  Brockman  and  Boolgeeda  Iron 
Formations.  In  the  central  and  western  parts,  Proterozoic-age  metasediments  of  the  Ashburton 
Trough have interbedded iron formation.  In the south, the Coziron tenements are transected by the 
Robe River pisolitic iron-stone. The pisolitic iron-stones are basin margin sediments of the Carnarvon 
Basin and currently support large-scale mining operations at Warramboo, Mesa A and Mesa J (Fig 1).
In addition to prospectivity for iron-ore, the Yarraloola tenements are well serviced by established 
infrastructure  that  includes  bitumen  roads  and  gas-pipelines  and  these  provide  opportunities  to 
lower the cost of development for a new discovery. There are also proposals for additional facilities 
to be developed within the region. BC Iron Ltd has approval for a new haul-road and port at Cape 
Preston  East,  while  the  API  joint-venture  controls  an  easement  for  a  railway  through  the  West 
Pilbara  to  a  proposed  port  at  Anketell  Point.  These  infrastructure  corridors  traverse  the  Coziron 
tenements.
Coziron currently has exploration focussed on two prospects.
1.  The Robe Mesa Deposit on E08/1060 and E08/1686 which contains two intervals of pisolitic
ironstone (CID) representing recently deposited material from the Carnarvon Basin (Fig 1).
2.  Outcrop  and  subcrop  of  magnetite-bearing  schists  in  the  Proterozoic-aged,  Ashburton
Trough on tenements E08/1686 and E08/1826 (Fig 1).

Robe Mesa Deposit
The  Robe  Mesa  deposit  is  defined  by  78  vertical  RC  drill-holes  completed  during  2014  and  2015 
which intersected an upper and lower interval of pisolitic iron-stone with Fe>50% (Figs 2 to 6). The 
geology  and  geochemistry  from  the  drilling  has  been  used  to  revise  the  independently  calculated 
Inferred  Resource  which  was  announced  in  detail  on  the  ASX  on  7th  December  2015  and  8th  of 
February 2016 and is summarised in the following tables.

The  Inferred  Resource  on  the  Robe  Mesa  provides  a  well-defined  opportunity  for  further  work  to 
increase the resource confidence and examine potential extensions to the ore-system.
Robe Mesa – Block Model Review and Update
The block model produced by Optiro for the Robe Mesa  Deposit high-lights the distribution of the 
Fe-grades  >50%  within  the  geological  model.  The  review  of  the  model  by  Coziron  indicates  the 
following.
1.  The lower and upper zones of pisolitic ironstone, characterised by Fe > 50%, each have an
upper high-grade interval with Fe > 55% (Figs 2 to 5).
2.  The high-grade interval (>55% Fe) of the upper zone outcrops and shallowly subcrops on the
mesa.
3.  The  high-grade  interval  (>55%  Fe)  of  the  lower  zone  which  underlies  the  drilled-grid  is
projected to outcrop to the east and west of the mesa.
4.  The eastern extension on the lower zone has been mapped and chip-sampled in places.  It is
proposed that drilling will be conducted on this area in 2016.
5.  There  is  potential  for  further  thick,  high-grade  mineralisation  in  the  western  zone.    This 
potential was identified when the revised topographic model showed the base of the lower 
channel is perhaps 30m lower the adjacent plain and some cross-sections indicate that the 
lower  zone  of  pisolitic  iron-stone  extends  and  thickens  to the west  of  the  drill-grid  (Figs  2 
and  3).  The  area  of  interest  also  has  a  spectral  signature  indicating  Fe-rich  debris  on  the
3
surface  that  extends  some  700m  to  the  west  of  the  current  drill-grid  and  this  requires 
drilling.
6.  There are areas within the current resource model where infill drilling has the potential to
increase the resource confidence from Inferred to Indicated.
7.  Reducing the cut-off grade to Fe>45%, results in the global ore-grade being maintained with 
Fe@52%,  but  increases  the  volume  of  material  in  the  model.  The  mineralogical  and 
metallurgical  characteristics  of  the  material  between  the  45  and  50%  cut-offs  requires 
assessment.
Robe Mesa Deposit – Future Work
Work planned for the next quarter include a heritage survey over potential extension to the pisolitic 
iron-stone in the north, east and west, RC drilling of the extensions, core-recovery and metallurgical 
work on the area of the Indicated Resource.
Ashburton Magnetite Prospect
The Ashburton prospect is a 12 km long by 800 m wide area hosting high-order magnetic anomalies 
associated  with  poorly  outcropping,  Proterozoic  schists  that  are  only  partly  exposed  beneath  a 
capping  of  sands  and  conglomerates  from  the  Carnarvon  Basin  on  tenements  E08/1686  and 
E08/1826  (Fig 1).  The  magnetite-mineralised  rocks outcrop intermittently as a suite of north-west, 
trending,  strongly  folded, variably  siliceous,  chloritic  schists  that  dip  steeply  to  the  south-west.  RC 
and  diamond  drilling  show  that  the  magnetite-rich  metasediments  are  siliceous  but  hosted  by 
intermediate and rhyolitic volcanics. The implication is that rather than an outlier of the Hamersley 
Basin, the Ashburton magnetic anomalies appear to be the expression of mineralisation associated 
with a deeper water oceanic basin and volcanism and represent an Algoma-style setting.
The  mineralisation  in  the  Ashburton  also  has  a  suite  of  characteristics  that  may  be  favourable  for 
larger-scale magnetite recovery, including the following.
The transition from weathered to fresh rock appears to be only 20-30m below the surface. 
 No evidence of blue asbestos (crocidolite) in the system.
1. 
2. 
3.  Grainsize that is coarser than material from the adjacent Hamersley Basin iron formations. 
4.  Generally low phosphorous and sulphur contents. 
5.  Mass yields from Davis Tube that were in excess of 30%.
The 2015 work programme on the Ashburton Trough comprised surface mapping and eight, paired, 
inclined RC deep holes to 200m depth and three, inclined, diamond drill-holes each to about 500m. 
The  holes  were  located  at  intervals  along  the  anomaly  system  at  sites  which  did  not  require 
significant  ground  disturbance  (Fig  7).  The  main  purpose  of  the  drilling  was  to  provide  additional 
data on the geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, thickness, Fe-grades and magnetite yield and quality 
from the rocks in the Ashburton Prospect.
The major results which were fully reported on 6th of October 2015 can be summarised as follows.
1.  The  magnetite-bearing  rocks  unconformably  underlie  the  Ashburton  Formation  and  are
steeply dipping to the south-west.
2.  The portion of the magnetic anomaly system to the north of the Northern Discovery section
is covered by up to 50m of detritus attributed to the Yarraloola Conglomerate.
4
3.  Within  the  magnetite-bearing  sequence,  the  volcanics  appear  to  be  basaltic  in  the  east 
which  is  the  interpreted  base,  andesitic  to  dacitic  in  the  mid-part  and  are  capped  by  a 
fragmental rhyolite in the west.
4.  The  thickest  down-hole  intervals  were  recorded  from  the  Trailer  Laydown  (YAR098, 
YAR099), Spinifex Hill (YAR100, YAR101) and Northern Discovery (YAR102 and YAR103) drill-
sections
5.  These intercepts are characterised by magnetic susceptibility in excess of 10,000 SI units and
Fe contents greater than 30%.
Following  the  receipt  of  the  geological  and  geochemical  results,  5m  interval  RC  samples  were 
composited in the magnetite-rich intercepts for a Davis Tube study. This provides indications of mass 
recovery and the quality of a magnetite concentrate. The six drill-holes from the prospect with the 
broadest intercepts which included YAR098 to YAR103 were prioritised for study (Fig 7).
New Results: Davis Tube Study of 2015 RC Drill-holes
The  samples  for Davis  Tube  recovery were  processed  at  Bureau  Veritas  Laboratories  in Perth.  The 
initial  programme  of  grind-size  analysis  indicated  recovery  at  -38  microns  with  a  measured  P80 
particle  size  of  about  22  microns  resulted  in  the  most  consistent  recovery  of  a  concentrate  with 
Fe > 67%.  Following  the  initial  grind-size  study,  the  composite  samples  were  processed.  All  results 
were fully reported to the ASX by CZR on the 28th of May 2016.
The most significant results can be summarised as follows.
1.  A significant proportion of samples with a mass yield of 30 to 40% report Fe > 65% and SiO2
in the range of 2 to 6% (Fig 8).
2.  Mass  yields  increase  significantly  below  70m  down-hole  or  about  35m  vertically  which  is
interpreted as the base of surface oxidation.
3.  All  the  holes  contain  intervals where  the  magnetite  concentrates  report  weighted-average
SiO2 < 5wt% and Fe > 66%.
4.  The magnetite concentrates with SiO2 < 5% produced by Davis Tube are low in phosphorous
(less than 0.05%) and alumina (less than 0.50%).
5.  The highest mass-yields and most consistently low-SiO2 from the magnetite concentrates are 
reported from the Spinifex Hill drill-holes (Fig 3). This is also the prospect with the broadest 
intercepts  and  appears  to  represent  an  interval  of  mineralisation  towards  the  core  of  the 
Ashburton magnetic anomaly system.
6.  Samples  from  the  Trailer  Laydown  (YAR098  and  YAR099)  appear  to  represent  the  upper 
section of the anomaly system, while the Northern Discovery section (YAR102 and YAR103) 
are regarded as a reflection of the basal portions of the system.
7.  Some  samples  appear  to  be  magnetite  dominant,  which  is  reflected  by  a  maximum  Fe  at 
about  72.3%  while  other  samples  appear  to  be  dominated  by  ferri-magnetic  haematite 
which has a maximum Fe at about 70% Fe (Fig 9).
Ashburton Future Work
An RC drilling programme with associated geochemistry and Davis Tube studies is being planned on 
the  Spinifex  Hill  portion of  the  anomaly  system,  with  a  focus  on establishing  a JORC  resource  and 
metallurgical characteristics. The work will commence after heritage approvals has been received.

Shepherds Well Project – West Pilbara
During  the  quarter,  final  results  from  the  2015  mapping,  soil  and  rock-chip  sampling  programmes 
were received and fully reported on the 28th of June 2016. Details are as follows.
Shepherds Well - Background
Shepherds  Well  is  a  192.2km2  multi-commodity  exploration  license  (E08/2361)  located  50km 
southwest  of  Karratha.  The  tenement  is  contiguous  with  Coziron’s  Yarraloola  Iron-ore  Project, 
serviced  by  bitumen  road  access  from  the  Great  Northern  Highway,  located  only  25-50km  from  a 
new proposed public access port at Cape Preston East and crossed in part by an easement for the 
proposed  West  Pilbara  railway.  This  planned  infrastructure  has  the  potential  to  improve  the 
economics of any mineral deposits identified within the project area.
Geologically, Shepherds Well compliments Yarraloola with prospectivity for iron-ore mineralisation 
both  as  high-grade  haematite  and  magnetite  in  either  Archaean-age  metasediments  of  the 
Cleaverville  Terrain,  or  potentially  in  outliers  of  the  Hammersley  Basin  overlying  the  Fortescue 
Basalt. The Cleaverville is the basement terrain in the Pilbara Craton which consists of a sequence of 
ocean-floor basalts and associated sediments that are part of an accretionary domain that pre-dates 
the formation of the Hamersley Basin and is intruded by granite.
Regionally, the Cleaverville Terrain hosts iron-formations up to 500m thick among which the North 
Star  deposit  is  being  developed  into  a  magnetite  mining  operation  by  Fortescue  Metals  Ltd.  The 
Cleaverville  Terrain  also  hosts  a  number  of  base-metal  (Cu-Au-Pb-Zn)  occurrences  attributed  to  a 
sea-floor  volcanogenic  origin.  These  are  typically  short  strike-length  lensoidal  deposits  with  high-
grade cores that occur in clusters. Unconformably overlying the Cleaverville Terrain are flat-lying and 
relatively undisturbed flows of the Archaean-age, Fortescue Flood Basalts. These have the potential 
to preserve outliers of the overlying Hamersley Group.
To date, exploration on Shepherds Well has included the acquisition and processing of a low level 
magnetic-radiometric survey, along with some early stage mapping, rock-chip and soil sampling. The 
focus of this work is to identify areas that have an anomalous geophysical and geochemical response 
and  represent  targets  for  future  drilling.  The  results  include  two  rock-chip  samples  of  muscovite 
schist  adjacent  to  some  shallow  prospecting  pits  which  reported  silver  (Ag)  to 9.8g/t,  lead  (Pb)  to 
4.4% zinc (Zn) to 0.5% and are anomalous in gold (Au) to 23ppb (CZR: ASX 29-July-2014; Fig 10).
Shepherds Well - Data Review
Coziron has compiled and reviewed previous exploration activities and results on the Shepherds Well 
Project. Rock-chips with silver-lead-zinc mineralization are located within a broad zone identified as 
being prospective and anomalous by Arimco in 1989 and CRA Exploration (now RioTinto Ltd) in 1994. 
The  anomalism  is  associated  with  a  suite  of  felsic  rocks  which  are  hosted  by  a  mafic  suite.  Best 
historical  drill-results  were  reported  by  Arimco  to  the  Geological  Survey  of  Western  Australia  in 
DCRC  6  as  7  m  @  3.0  %  Zn  and  1.7%  Pb  and  1m  @  0.2  g.t  Au  (WAMEX  Report  No  A42464:  First 
Annual  Report  for  Shepherds  Well  Prospect  –  E47/619,  E47/627  &  E08/718).  However,  other 
reconnaissance drill-holes report intercepts of iron-rich sulphides (pyrrhotite and pyrite) suggesting 
a wider distribution of a horizon which may have the potential to host mineralisation.
11
Shepherds Well – Soil Sampling and Rock-chip Results
In  the  latter  part  of  the  2015  field  season,  Coziron  completed  prospect-scale  soil  sampling 
programme using 80 m spaced samples on lines that are  400 m apart and oriented East-West and 
then  infilled  three  lines  to  200m  x  20m.  Representative  rock-chip  samples  were  also  collected  at 
some  locations  where  alteration  was  identified.  The  grid  was  developed to cover  an  area of  felsic 
rocks and the adjacent contact with mafic rocks in the Cleaverville Terrain. This setting is a preferred 
location  for  volcanic-hosted  base-metal  mineralization.  Full  details  of  the  methodology  were 
reported by CZR to the ASX on 28th of June 2016 and the soil geochemistry identifies anomalism in 
three commodity suites which are shown on Fig 10.
1.  Lead (Pb), zinc (Zn)and silver (Ag). 
2.  Nickel (Ni). 
3.  Gold (Au).
The anomalism can be summarised as follow.
1.  Ten soil lines across the felsic sequence highlight anomalism in lead (Pb) with a peak value of 
786  ppm  (Fig  11).  The  anomalous  zone  is  associated  with  zinc  (Zn)  to  1150  ppm  and 
detectable  silver  (Ag).  The  lead-zinc-silver  anomalism  is  subdivided  into  two  zones.  An 
eastern  zone  that  is  associated  with  historical  drilling  reported  by  Arimco  and  the  pits 
sampled with rock-chips by CZR in 2014 that reported lead and silver mineralisation (Fig 11; 
Fig 12). A western zone which has evolved from the 2015 sampling and also reports a rock-
chip with epidote alteration with lead (Pb) at 0.9% and silver (Ag) at 6g/t (Fig 12).
2.  Three  soil  lines  across  an  area  with  surficial  carbonate  (calcrete  and  magnesite)  crossing 
from  the  felsics  into  the  mafics  report  nickel  (Ni)  to  1100  ppm.  The  carbonate  and 
anomalous nickel is also associated with chromium (Cr) to 1350 ppm and suggests that the 
area is underlain by more ultramafic rocks (Fig 11).
3.  One line of soil samples across a less magnetic zone with quartz veining cross-cutting basalts
from the Cleaverville Terrain reports a peak gold (Au) value of 61 ppb (Fig 13).
Shepherds Well – Future Work
The  2016  programme  will  focus  on  extending  the  line  coverage  over  the  prospective  terrain  and 
increasing  the  sampling  density  in  the  cores  of  the  anomaly  systems  with  a  focus  on  identifying 
targets for drilling.
