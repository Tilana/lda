</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/3. Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The</i> <i>Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, 
</p>
<p>and taking note of the report presented to the Council by the independent expert on 
</p>
<p>human rights and international solidarity (A/HRC/4/8), 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-
</p>
<p>holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and 
</p>
<p>their annexes,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
</p>
<p>should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the importance, in the view to the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, of the declarations and programmes of action of  international 
</p>
<p>conferences such as the World Conference on Human Rights  held in Vienna in 1993, 
</p>
<p>the International Conference on Financing for Development held in  Monterrey in 
</p>
<p>2002, the United Nations  Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio 
</p>
<p>in 1992 , the World Summit on Sustainable Development  held in Johannesburg in 
</p>
<p>2002, and the World Conference on the Disaster Reduction held in Kobe in 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with appreciation </i>of the initiatives of the International Action 
</p>
<p>against Hunger and Poverty, particularly in the field of innovative financial 
</p>
<p>mechanisms,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that at the World Conference on Human Rights, States pledged to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to </p>

<p>development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
</p>
<p>international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the 
</p>
<p>elimination of obstacles to development,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
</p>
<p>states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of 
</p>
<p>developing countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, 
</p>
<p>effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with 
</p>
<p>appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to 
</p>
<p>take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
</p>
<p>especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a 
</p>
<p>view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the 
</p>
<p>Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative 
</p>
<p>measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful 
</p>
<p>coexistence, friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, 
</p>
<p>economic or political systems,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and 
</p>
<p>developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human 
</p>
<p>rights in the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every 
</p>
<p>nation, according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this 
</p>
<p>gap,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the 
</p>
<p>process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, 
</p>
<p>communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits 
</p>
<p>of several countries, particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, 
</p>
<p>diseases and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have 
</p>
<p>resulted in a massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and </p>

<p>environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in 
</p>
<p>particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for 
</p>
<p>official development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized 
</p>
<p>countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official 
</p>
<p>development assistance, and recognizing the need for new and additional resources to 
</p>
<p>finance the development programmes of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
</p>
<p>community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours 
</p>
<p>by an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of 
</p>
<p>partnership and intra-generational solidarity, and for promoting inter-generational 
</p>
<p>solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity 
</p>
<p>as a vital component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of 
</p>
<p>the right to development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that the present generations are fully aware of their 
</p>
<p>responsibilities towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for the 
</p>
<p>present and future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of 
</p>
<p>the fundamental value of solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first 
</p>
<p>century, in stating that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes 
</p>
<p>costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic principles of equity and social 
</p>
<p>justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve help from those who 
</p>
<p>benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute towards the solution of 
</p>
<p>current world problems through increased international cooperation, to create such </p>

<p>conditions as will ensure that the needs and interests of future generations are not 
</p>
<p>jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to hand on a better world to future 
</p>
<p>generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete 
</p>
<p>measures to promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries 
</p>
<p>in their endeavours for development and for the promotion of conditions that make 
</p>
<p>possible the full realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely 
</p>
<p>interrelated to the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive 
</p>
<p>development within the United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to 
</p>
<p>respond to the increasing challenges of international cooperation in this field;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant 
</p>
<p>international organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the 
</p>
<p>right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity in their activities;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i>, taking into account the urgent need to further develop 
</p>
<p>guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, to request the 
</p>
<p>independent expert on human rights and international solidarity to continue 
</p>
<p>discharging his mandate, subject to the review of this mandate that will be 
</p>
<p>accomplished by the Council in the near future; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the 
</p>
<p>preparation of a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
</p>
<p>international solidarity and to submit a report on the implementation of the present 
</p>
<p>resolution at its ninth session (to be held in September 2008), unless otherwise be 
</p>
<p>decided by the Council; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes 
</p>
<p>of all major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the 
</p>
<p>economic and social fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his/her mandate; </p>

<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its ninth session 
</p>
<p>under the same agenda item.
