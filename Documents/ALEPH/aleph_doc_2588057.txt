1.2.1
Project Ownership and Mineral Tenure
A 75 km² mining lease (the Médinandi Exploitation License) was granted on 13 February 2014 under permit number 0070/PM-RM. The exploitation licence
is current for a 30 year term, expiring February 2044.
The Médinandi Exploitation License is held in the name of Songhoi Resources Sàrl (Songhoi), of which B2Gold currently holds 100% of the shares. Upon
the grant of an exploitation licence, the holder of the exploitation licence must take steps to create an exploitation company incorporated under the laws of
Mail (the new Malian mining company). On creation of the new Malian mining company, B2Gold’s interest in the project will be 90% with a contribution of
10% share of the ownership granted to the Government of Mali. Additionally up to a further 10% may be purchased by the Government of Mail for cash value.
B2Gold is the Project operator.
Legal opinion provided supports that the Médinandi Exploitation License is valid and mineral tenure is sufficient to support declaration of Mineral Resources
and Reserves.
Two exploration permits, Menankoto Sud and Bantako Est, held by Songhoi are within close proximity to the Médinandi tenement. The Menankoto Sud
exploration  permit  is  52  km2  in  area  and  is  located  approximately  13  km  to  the  north  of  the  Médinandi  Exploitation  License.  The  permit  is  valid  until
4 February 2017. The Bantako Est exploration permit is 57 km2 in area and is located less than 5 km from the northeast corner of the Médinandi Exploitation
License. The permit expired on 30 December 2014. The renewal was submitted as required and is currently awaiting Mali government signature.
1.3
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
Access to the Project is by road from either Dakar in Senegal or from the Mali capital of Bamako. The road from Bamako is approximately 480 km, along the
recently completed Millennium Highway to Kéniéba, then a further 45 km on the new mine access road from Kéniéba to the project site. The new mine
access road is currently under construction and will allow all-weather two-way traffic for construction and future mine operations.
Current air access is via charter flights to an airstrip 1 km east of Kéniéba, then by road to site. A new airstrip is currently under construction at the project site.
The new airstrip will be an all-weather gravel runway designed to suit a Beech Craft 1900 or similar type of aircraft.
The Project is in the pre-Guinean climate zone, with an average annual rainfall of greater than 1,000 mm over a wet season lasting six months (May to
October). Temperature variance is 10 – 46°C upon season, with a mean annual temperature of 28°C.
The project is in a remote location with limited existing infrastructure. Proposed project infrastructure includes water, power, communications, and waste and
tailings disposal to allow a self-sufficient plant operating all year round.
The site is relatively flat with a mean elevation above sea level that varies from about 130 to 190 m. The Falémé River occupies a meandering drainage to
the south and west of the project area.

Gold  was  first  discovered  in  the  area  by  a  French  prospector  at  the  Fadougou  Main  Zone  in  1953.  Since  this  discovery  and  up  until  B2Gold  acquired
ownership of the project, various companies have held the exploration rights and conducted reconnaissance activities within the permit area. A summary of
historical activities is provided in Table 1.4.1.

Q1 2014
Resource estimate for Fekola Satellites (Fadougou) updated.
In 2012, Papillon completed a scoping level study on the Médinandi deposit. The study outcomes indicated positive project economics which led to a further
pre-feasibility study being conducted in 2013. Results were initially summarized in a report prepared in June 2013 with an update to this report presented by
Papillon in a news release to the ASX on 26 June 2013 (the Papillon PFS).
The  Papillon  PFS  indicated  positive  project  economics  under  the  assumptions  in  the  study.  As  a  consequence,  Papillon  commenced  more  detailed
engineering and technical studies, and commenced some preliminary site works in support of future project construction, including site clearing activities.
In October 2014 B2Gold Corp. acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Papillion Resources Limited by way of a merger agreement.
1.5
Geology and Mineralisation
The Fekola deposit is located in the eastern portion of the Paleoproterozoic Kédougou–Kéniéba Inlier which covers eastern Senegal and western Mali. The
deposit is considered to be an example of an orogenic style gold deposit. Orogenic gold deposits dominantly form in metamorphic rocks in the mid to shallow
crust,  at  or  above  the  brittle-ductile  transition,  in  compressional  settings  that  facilitate  transfer  of  hot  gold  bearing  fluids  from  deeper  levels.  During  a
geological event, the rapid rise of fluids takes these out of equilibrium with their surroundings, resulting in gold precipitation.
The Fekola deposit is hosted by a moderate to steeply west dipping, folded sequence of marine meta-sediments of the Kofi group, which locally include:
argillite and minor pelitic sediments; fine grained turbidites, comprising laminated to thin-bedded siliciclastic siltstone and mudstone; and a

heterolithic, mass flow breccia, or conglomerate. Fine grained thin marble units are present as a volumetrically minor rock type inter-bedded with the politic
units. Minor mafic volcanic, or volcaniclastic units occur locally in the upper and possibly, lower portions of the hanging wall stratigraphy. Weakly feldspar-
phyric felsic dykes are locally observed. The deposit has been subjected to upper greenschist facies metamorphism.
The Mineralization is broadly continuous and has been traced over a strike extent of approximately 1.5 km, to depths of up to 400 m below surface, with
widths  to  300  m.  The  greatest  continuity  is  observed  within  a  high  grade  shoot  (>2  g/t  Au)  which  plunges  approximately  13°  to  the  north-north  west.
Mineralization is open at depth, down plunge.
The majority of gold mineralisation in the Fekola deposit occurs in unweathered, fresh rock and is preferentially associated with stringers of pyrite parallel to
the foliation and in fine disseminated pyrite. More specifically, the gold mineralisation is associated with fine grained pyrite in tan dolomite-albite altered wall
rocks, which locally contain diffuse, often deformed pale grey quartz-dolomite-pyrite-albite matrix veins and veinlets. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite have also
been observed. The total sulphide content of the deposit is typically less than 5%.
1.6
Exploration
Exploration programs completed to date have been appropriate to the style of the Fekola deposit, leading to the discovery of a significant orebody. The
Fekola deposit remains open at depth and the potential for extending the Fekola main deposit down plunge is good, particularly with the results obtained in
the step out hole.
A  better  understanding  of  the  Fekola  deposit,  its  location  in  a  regional  and  local  context  with  respect  to  lithologies,  alteration  and  structure,  will  aid  in
indicating areas of gold anomalism that has potential to support additional exploration focus.
1.7
Drilling
A total of 806 drillholes (143,372.98 m) were available at the data cutoff date of 24 January, 2015 for the February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate update.
The drillhole dataset within the Fekola Mineral Resource area is illustrated in plan view in Figure 1.7.1.

The quantity and quality of the lithological, collar and down hole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs completed are sufficient to
support Mineral Resource estimation and mine planning.
1.8
Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
Sample  collection,  preparation,  analysis  and  security  for  RC  and  core  drill  programs  are  in  line  with  industry  standard  methods  for  gold  deposits.  Drill
programs include insertion of blank, duplicate and standard reference material samples to monitor laboratory performance.
The  primary  laboratory  used  for  sample  analysis  during  January  2011  to  June  2013  was  SGS  Kayes,  Mali.  From  November  2013  to  date  the  primary
laboratory is SGS Bamako, Mali. The laboratories used are not formally accredited and currently there are no commercial mineral laboratories in the West
African region that are fully accredited under ISO17025.
1.9
Data Verification
A  reasonable  level  of  verification  has  been  completed  during  the  work  conducted  to  date,  and  no  material  issues  have  been  left  unidentified  from  the
verification programs undertaken.
No problems with the database, sampling protocols, flowsheets, check analysis program, or data storage were identified that were sufficient to preclude the
use of the database for estimation purposes. The quality of the gold analytical data is considered sufficiently reliable to support Mineral Resource estimation
without limitations on Mineral Resource confidence categories. The data can be used in mine planning.
1.10
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
A metallurgical testwork programme has been completed to support the OFS of the Project. The majority of the programme was conducted by SGS Canada
Inc. (‘SGS Lakefield’) in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada between 2014 and 2015. The remainder of the program was either completed at SGS Lakefield under
supervision of a consultant or specialist or at another laboratory facility during the same time period.
The programme included testwork to establish:
Comminution characteristics of the ore.
Materials handling properties.
Mineralogy analysis.
Sample head analysis.
Gravity recoverable gold content.
Optimum grind sizes for whole ore cyanidation leach.

Optimum whole ore cyanidation leach conditions.
Cyanide destruction testwork.
Engineering data, including testing of oxygen uptake, slurry rheology, carbon kinetics and thickener settling rate.
Based on analysis of results the following conclusions can be drawn from the metallurgical and comminution testwork programmes:
•
•
The  Fekola  deposit  is  classified  as  hard  to  very  hard  competency  with  above  average  grinding  energy  requirements  and  is  moderate  to  highly
abrasive. The ore is amenable to primary crushing followed by a SAG mill and ball mill with pebble crushing (SABC).
Fekola ore is predominantly ‘free milling’, not ‘preg robbing’ and is amenable to gold extraction by conventional cyanidation.
A gravity separation circuit is not warranted for the Fekola deposit. Instead, a carbon column adsorption circuit will be included to recover dissolved
gold leached in the grinding circuit to facilitate early recovery of gold, particularly during high gold head grade periods.
The  optimum  leaching  conditions  identified  are  24  hour  cyanidation  with  350  ppm  NaCN,  initial  lead  nitrate  addition  of  100  g/t,  pH  10.3  –  10.5,
dissolved oxygen levels of ~15 ppm and a pulp density of 45% solids (w/w). The addition of lead nitrate and dissolved oxygen levels of 15 ppm is
found to be beneficial in leach kinetics and overall recovery. Anticipated lime and cyanide addition rates are moderate.
The ore typically yields good recoveries (87% to 97%). Testwork results show a logarithmic relationship between the measured gold head grade and
resulting gold extraction under optimised leach conditions at a grind size of 75 microns. This relationship is graphically illustrated in Figure 1.10.1.
Based on the absence of any preg robbing characteristics and very good adsorption properties, a CIP circuit has been selected for the Fekola process
flowsheet.
The cyanidation tailings responded well to cyanide destruction treatment using the SO2 / Air process.
The ore has a thickener specific settling rate of 0.3 m2/tpd for both the leach and tailings thickener duties.

Mineral Resource
The February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate forms the basis for the DFS and incorporates drilling results available at January 24, 2015.
The estimate was prepared in accordance with the definitions set out by the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.
Mineral Resources are reported above a selected cutoff grade of 0.6 g/t gold and within a conceptual Lerchs–Grossmann pit shell. Parameters used for the
Mineral Resource pit shell were based on preliminary work completed for the OFS (in March 2015), using a gold price of US$ 1,500/oz. Table 1.11.1 details
the Fekola Mineral Resources, as at 24 January 2015.

Mining
The mining study was completed by Mining Solutions Consultancy (MSC) in close liaison with B2Gold personnel.
The selected mining method for the Project is conventional open pit mining with the operations strategy based on owner operator mining equipment and
labour. The base case mine production schedule involves the movement of 32 Mtpa of materials to sustain processing of 4 Mtpa of high grade ore while
stockpiling up to 14 Mt of low grade ore.
The total mine life is 9.5 years for the development of a 320 m deep ultimate pit in seven stages. Pit shell and stage development is shown in Figure 1.13.1.

Truck numbers increase from 16 during pre-stripping activities, up to a peak of 34 as the haul distances increase with development of deeper cutbacks.
PC2000 shovels will operate on 10 m high benches with the PC1250 backhoes mainly used to mine selectively and difficult areas. Ancillary equipment
numbers peak around the end of Year 2 as the mining dumping fronts advance.
An average powder factor estimate of 0.75 kg/bcm (ANFO equivalent) has been used. This is relatively high considering the strength of the fresh rock.
Although the crusher design allows for direct truck tipping, mining cost estimates assume 50% of the ROM ore will be rehandled due to variation in mine
production.
1.14
Recovery Methods
The process plant design for the Project is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum recovery with minimum operating costs. The
flowsheet is constructed from unit operations that are well proven in industry and consists of:
Single stage primary crushing.
SABC grinding circuit.
Leach feed thickening with thickener overflow treated through a carbon in column (CIC) circuit.
Leaching followed by carbon in pulp (CIP) adsorption.
Elution and gold recovery to doré.
Cyanide destruction, tailings thickening and disposal circuits.

•
•
•
•
Caustic Soda (NaOH) for carbon acid washing neutralisation and desorption.
Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) for carbon acid washing.
Sodium Metabisulphite (SMBS) for cyanide destruction.
Copper Sulphate Pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H2O) for cyanide destruction.
Flocculant for thickening.
Antiscalant to minimise scaling in the process water distribution, reclaim water distribution, fresh water distribution, gland water distribution, and elution
circuit.
Fluxes for smelting.
The process plant will utilise process water, reclaim water, fresh water, treated water, gland water and potable water. Any shortfall of process water will be
made up, preferentially, from water contained within the reclaim water pond, which includes water from the tailings decant. If insufficient water is available
within the reclaim water pond, fresh water will be utilised for filling up the reclaim water pond, as required.
Air services include a compressed air system, low pressure blowers and an oxygen plant. Compressor equipment includes integral dryers so that air can be
used for both plant air and instrument air duties. Low pressure blower air will be used exclusively in the cyanide destruction process and oxygen generation
will be used for leaching duty.
The instrumentation and control system designed will encompass the following objectives:
•
•
•
•
Ease of operation: Operator intervention and remedial action will be easily accomplished.
Interlocking: The control system will provide process interlocking between individual drives and plant areas.
Reliability:  All  field  equipment  will  be  selected  on  its  ability  to  operate  in  an  environment  where  extreme  temperatures  and  dusty  conditions  are
encountered.
Ease of maintenance: Instrumentation and control systems will be designed and installed such that maintenance requirements are minimised.
The plant control system will be designed around a moderate level of automation and monitoring.

Page 1.22
Materials and consumables will be transported to site via a new mine access road. The new access road will link the project site with the existing Millennium
Highway, 20 km from the nearby town of Kéniéba and will be a 6 m wide gravel, all weather, and free draining carriageway.
Internal plant roads will generally be 6 m wide and will be constructed flush with bulk earthworks pads.
1.15.3
Airstrip
A new 1,800 m long (1,600 m active length) x 30 m wide all weather gravel airstrip will be constructed for secure transport of bullion, transportation of
construction personnel and emergency medivac purposes. The airstrip design will suit a Beech Craft 1900 type aircraft or similar.
1.15.4
Tailings Disposal (Tailings Storage Facility)
The Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) is located to the north of the process plant and pit, and adjacent to the eastern waste dump. It is designed to store a total
of 62 Mt of tailings over 12 stages, with a stage lift performed every year in the dry season.
The TSF comprises of valley storage, formed by single downstream multi zoned earthfill embankment, lined with high density polyethylene (HDPE). Total
footprint area is initially 69 ha at Stage 1, increasing to 200 ha for the final TSF layout.
The TSF embankments will be constructed in annual raises to suit storage requirements. Downstream raise construction methods will be utilised throughout
operation. The embankment comprises an upstream low permeability zone and downstream structural fill zone. The embankment upstream face will be lined
with HDPE liner.
The TSF design incorporates a basin underdrainage system to reduce pressure head acting on the geomembrane liner, reduce seepage, increase tailings
densities, and improve the geotechnical stability of the embankments.
Supernatant water will be removed from the TSF via submersible pumps located within decant towers, constructed at startup and raised during operation.
Each decant tower will comprise a concrete base and 1.8 m diameter slotted precast concrete pipe sections. The decant tower will be surrounded by free
draining coarse rockfill. The supernatant pond will be maintained on the northern edge of the TSF basin. Solution recovered from the decant system will be
pumped back to the plant for reuse in the process circuit.

Surface Water Management
The Fekola pit footprint is located in an existing natural drainage course, with an upstream catchment of 9 km2 requiring diversion around the pit. The site
surface water management system is designed to prevent runoff from events up to and inclusive of a 1 in 100 year recurrence interval storm event from
entering the pit. The surface water management system consists of the following design features:
•
•
Diversion Structures: Designed to divert rainfall runoff from upstream catchments, around site infrastructure before discharging off site downstream of
the project.
Collection and Control Structures: Designed for containment of sediment laden runoff from the site infrastructure, via collection channels, retain coarse
to fine sand particles within sediment basins on site and controlled discharge from site or storage and use within the process plant. Collection and
control structures include the following infrastructure:
•
•
•
fresh Water Storage Pond (also referred to as the Clean Water Dam)
contact Water Storage Pond (also referred to as the Contact Water Dam)
various sediment control structures.
1.15.6
Falémé River Flood Assessment
An assessment of the flooding extent of the Falémé River was carried out to determine inundation risk to project infrastructure, particularly the Fekola pit.
Flood modelling was completed by Knight Piésold (KP).
The predicted flood inundation level for the section of the Falémé river adjacent to the project, does not encroach on the current pit outline. However, the
sediment control structure immediately downstream of the waste dump (located to the south west of the Pit) may require erosion protection on its downstream
face.
Once the waste dump is in place, a peak flood level of approximately 130.5 m would be required to result in flooding. Based on the frequency analysis of the
flood levels, a flood resulting in a peak flood level of 130.5 m is estimated to be greater than a 1 in 1,000 year recurrence interval.
1.15.7
Water Supply
Water for the Project will be sourced as follows:
Pit Groundwater: Groundwater investigations estimate the average pit groundwater inflow to be 129 L/s and water quality to be pH neutral, fresh and
good quality. Pit groundwater will be the main source of fresh water for process plant requirements and will be collected from dewatering bores located
around the perimeter of the Fekola pit.
•

•
•
Surface Water: Rainfall runoff from the upstream catchment will be collected and stored in the fresh water storage pond. Assessment of surface water
samples indicates the water to be pH neutral, fresh and of good quality. Surface water collected in the fresh water storage pond will be pumped to the
process plant for use as required and as a secondary water source after the pit dewatering bores.
Falémé River Bores: Three bores have been included at the Falémé River in the event that site water quantity or quality requirements are not met as
anticipated by the pit dewatering bores or surface water run-off storage.
•
Potable Water Bores: Dedicated bores will be provided for potable water use at both the process plant and accommodation camp.
1.15.8
Power Supply and Distribution
Power supply to the site will be from a combination HFO and diesel fuelled power station located adjacent to the process plant. The power station will supply
the main HV switchroom inside the processing plant from which power will be distributed.
The power station has been sized to accommodate a maximum demand power draw of 29.4 MW with a anticipated configuration as follows:
•
•
•
•
7 x 6 MW 13.8 kV medium speed generators (5 duty, 2 standby).
4 x 1.7 MW 13.8 kV high speed generators (emergency standby).
13.8 kV switchroom.
Black start generator.
The electrical system is based on 13.8 kV distribution and 480 V, 60 Hz working voltage.
Four switchrooms are located throughout the process plant, nominally covering:
•
•
•
•
Primary Crushing.
Milling.
Leach / Thickening / Water and Air Services.
CIP / Elution / Goldroom.
Switchrooms will house 480 V motor control centres (MCCs), VVVF drives, plant control system cabinets, lighting transformers, distribution boards and UPS
power distribution.
Power distribution to plant and mine infrastructure will be via kiosk substations fed from the HV distribution board.

Market Studies and Contracts
No formal market studies have been undertaken. Fekola will produce gold doré which is readily marketable on an ‘ex-works’ or ‘delivered’ basis to a number
of refineries in Europe and Africa. There are no indications of the presence of penalty elements that may impact the price or render the product unsalable.
Payment terms are widely available in the public domain and vary little from refinery to refinery. B2Gold has contracts in place for sale of gold from its four
producing mines in Nicaragua, the Philippines and Namibia. It has been assumed that Fekola doré will attract similar terms.

Required Permits and Environmental Considerations
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 1.27
1.17.1
Environmental Consideration
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was originally completed for the Project in 2013 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and
Sanitation on 29 April 2013. An update to the ESIA is currently in progress with submission planned to occur concurrently with completion of the project OFS.
As part of the ESIA a detailed assessment of potential environmental and social impacts from the development of the Project was conducted. The potential
impacts were evaluated for the construction, operations, and decommissioning / post-closure phases of the Project and rated based on their significance.
Potential  risks  associated  with  the  proposed  Project  development  were  also  assessed  and  discussed,  as  part  of  the  impact  assessment  process.  The
assessment and discussion of potential risks associated with the Project development was broadly aligned with internationally accepted risk assessment
methodologies.
An Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP) has been developed as part of the updated ESIA, which documents the proposed
mitigation and control measures to be included in the project design to meet Project regulatory requirements and reduce potential impacts from the Project to
acceptable levels. The ESMMP is supported by a number of individual Management Plans (MP’s) that describe how the site will meet relevant regulations,
standards and guidelines and manage and minimize key environmental and social risks of the Project. The ESMMP and its supporting individual MP’s are
“living documents” which will be amended periodically throughout the life of the Project to reflect changes in procedures, practices and project phase.
1.17.2
Permit Consideration
The environmental permit for the Project was granted to Songhoi Resources SARL by the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation via Decision No. 2013-
0033MEA-SG on 29 April 2013.
The mining permit for the Project was granted to Songhoi Resources SARL by the Secretary General via Decree No. 2014-0070/PM-RM, dated 13 February
2014.
Several additional permits and authorizations are required for the Project. These are in various stages of application, a full summary of which is provided in
Section 20 of the report.

Economic Analysis
The project financial model was compiled using the inputs from this OFS. Key assumptions were the mining and processing production, project capital costs,
and mining, processing, and general costs. The financial model is pre tax and assumes 100% ownership and a gold price of US$ 1,300/oz.
Project gold production averages 276,000 ounces of the life of the project with an average of 350,000 oz over the first seven years. The capital costs include
US$ 395M in pre production capital, plus US$ 180M in sustaining capital including finance payments, tailings facility expansions, and rehabilitation and
closure costs. Mining costs average US$ 2.99 over the life of the mine. Production cost is US$ 18.29/t in design conditions and averages US$ 18.30/t during
the steady state production in years 2018 through 2029. General and administration costs are US$ 14.9M per year during the full mining years, decreasing to
US$ 11.1M when the mining department is no longer operational.
The results of the model show robust results including a life of mine cash flow of US$ 1.66B, IRR of 35%, and an NPV of US$ 1.01B at 5%. The total cash
cost including 7.65% royalties is US$ 652/oz over the life of the mine and US$ 518 over the first seven years of production (2018 to 2024).
The project has low sensitivity to capital, fuel, processing, mining, and labour costs. The project is typically sensitive to gold prices, but maintains an IRR of
33% at a US$ 1,250/ounce gold price and 19% at a US$ 1,000/oz gold price.

Adjacent Properties
There are no properties adjacent to the Fekola deposit that are relevant to the project.

Conclusions
The Project OFS has identified, defined and costed a low technical risk conventional open cut mine and carbon in pulp processing facility.
Sovereign  risk  is  understood  and  mitigated  by  the  relatively  short  payback  of  the  Project.  Residual  environmental  and  social  issues  are  low  and
manageable.
The Project is economically viable at current gold prices. Applying a long term gold price of US$ 1,300/oz on a flat line basis from the commencement of
production, the project has an estimate Net Present Value (NPV) pre tax of US$ 1.01B at a 5% discount rate, generating a pre tax internal rate of return (IRR)
of 35% and a project payback of approximately 2.25 years from first gold production. The initial mine life is estimated at 12.5 years.
Based on the Project’s robust economics, B2Gold have already demonstrated a desire to move forward with project execution through the approval and
commencement of early works. This includes commencement of construction of the new mine access road, preliminary site clearing, construction facility
establishment and Front End Engineering Design.
1.22
Recommendations
It is recommended that B2Gold Corp advance implementation of the Project as soon as possible. Sufficient metallurgical testing and trade off studies have
been completed to confidently establish the recovery process and set the design criteria. Capital and operating costs have been estimated to a level of
accuracy consistent with an OFS level and no significant environmental, social or permitting issues exist, that are known of, that would prevent exploitation of
the Project deposit. B2Gold’s project implementation approach is a proven strategy and based on a June 2015 project approval, first gold pour can be
achieved in December 2017.

Introduction
2.0 INTRODUCTION
Qualified  Persons  (QPs)  from  B2Gold  Corp.  (B2Gold),  Lycopodium  Minerals  Pty  Ltd  (Lycopodium),  and  Knight  Piésold  Pty  Ltd  (KP)  have  prepared  a
technical report (the Report) for B2Gold on the Optimized Feasibility Study (OFS) of the Fekola Gold Project (the Project) in Mali, Africa. The Project location
is shown in Figure 2.1.
Following a successful acquisition of Papillon Resources Limited (Papillon) and as recommended in the previous NI 43-101 Technical Report (Fekola PEA,
August 2014), B2Gold has further developed the project with geological, engineering, and technical studies including the OFS.
B2Gold currently holds 100% of Songhoi Resources Sàrl (Songhoi), the Malian holding company for the Project. A Malian exploitation company is being
formed for construction and operation of the Project. Upon creation of the new Malian mining company, B2Gold’s interest in the project will be 90% with a
contribution of 10% share of the ownership granted to the Government of Mali. The Malian Mining Code also allows the Government of Mail to purchase for a
cash value an additional 10% interest in the Exploitation Company. The Government of Mali has expressed an interest in acquiring an additional 10%
interest and negotiations are ongoing. If the Government of Mali is successful, as anticipated, the final ownership of the Exploitation Company will be 80%
B2Gold and 20% by the Government of Mali. B2Gold is the Project operator.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
4.1
Overview of the Property and Title in Mali
The following summary is based on information in the prior Technical Report (B2Gold, August 2014), the public domain, CIA (2013), Deloitte (2012), Doherty
(2011), the Fraser Institute (2014), and Norton Rose (2012). The QPs have not independently verified the information.
4.1.1
Country Overview
Mali is a land locked country with a total area of 1,240,000 km2 and a total population of 12.5 million (as of July 2012). The CIA’s World Fact Book (CIA,
2013) summarizes the Mali economic background as follows:
“Among  the  25  poorest  countries  in  the  world,  Mali  is  a  landlocked  country  highly  dependent  on  gold  mining  and  agricultural  exports  for  revenue.  The
country’s fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains dependant on foreign aid. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land is desert or semi-desert.
About 10% of the population is nomadic and about 80% of the labour force is engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing
farm commodities.”
“The government in 2011 completed an IMF extended credit facility program that has helped the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali
is developing its cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify foreign exchange away from gold. Mali has invested in tourism but security issues are
hurting the industry.
Mali experienced economic growth of about 5% per year between 1996 and 2010, but the global recession and a military coup caused a decline in output in
2012. The interim government slashed public spending in the context of a declining state of security and declining international aid.”
4.1.2
Mineral Tenure Regime
Based on information from Doherty (2011), mining activities in Mali are governed by the following legal orders and decrees:
•
Order No 99-032/P-RM, of 19 August, 1999, relating to the country’s Mining Code, and as modified by Order No 00-013/P-RM, of 10 February, 2000.
Decree No 99-255/P-RM, of 15 September, 1999, pertaining to the application of the 1999 Mining Code, which was modified by Order No 00-013/P-
RM, of 10 February 2000.
Decree No 99-256/PM-RM, of 15 September, 1999 (MMM, 1999), which pertains to the approval of the model prospecting, exploration, and mining
agreement to be entered into between the mineral title applicants and the State of Mali.
•
•

More recently, the following legal documents and decrees have been issued:
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 4.2
•
•
•
•
Order No 2012-015 of 27 February, 2012, relating to the new Mining Code.
Decree No 2012-311/P-RM of 21 June, 2012, pertaining to the application of the 2012 Mining Code.
Decree No 2012-490/PM-RM of 7 September, 2012, pertaining to the approval of the model prospecting, exploration, and mining agreement to be
entered into between mineral title applicants and the State of Mali.
Decree  No  2012-717/PM-RM  of  20  December,  2012,  pertaining  to  the  operating  and  management  of  a  fund  to  finance  exploration,  training,  and
promotion of mining activities.
The 2012 Mining Code and related 2012 Decrees are in force and have superseded the 1999 Mining Code and related 1999 Decrees. However, some
aspects are still governed by the 1999 mining legislation for existing titles.
All new mineral titles issued after February 2012 are governed by the 2012 Mining Code and related 2012 Decrees.
The State owns all of the mineral rights and the Mines Minister has the final responsibility for the administration of mining activity, although the Minister is
assisted by, and delegates certain powers to, the Direction Nationale de la Geologies et des Mines (DNGM).
The 1999 Mining Code (the Code, MME, 1999a) defines five types of mining titles. These titles were retained with minor modifications in the 2012 Mining
Code, as follows:
Exploration Authorization (autorisation d’exploration), which may be granted for three months. The maximum surface covered by this authorization is
specified in the corresponding authorizing decree, and it covers specified commodities (the same area may be covered by distinct permits concerning
different commodities). Such an authorization cannot be transferred to third parties by any means.
Prospection  Authorization  (autorisation  de  prospection),  which  may  be  granted  for  three  years.  The  tenure  is  renewable  once  with  no  surface
reduction, assuming that the authorization holder has complied with the specifications outlined in the Code. The maximum surface covered by this
authorization is specified in the corresponding authorizing decree, and it covers specified commodities (the same area may be covered by distinct
permits concerning different commodities). Such an authorization can be transferred to third parties by inheritance or cession under certain conditions
established by the Code. The holder should regularly deliver details of the prospection programs and reports to the Department of Mines.

•
Exploration Permit (permis de recherche). Under the 2012 Mining Code an exploration permit is granted by order of the Minister of Mines for a period
not exceeding eight years, with an initial period of two years, renewable twice, and each renewal period not exceeding two years. The 2012 Mining
Code  has  provision  for  extending  the  second  renewal  for  a  year,  if  this  is  needed  in  order  to  complete  a  feasibility  study.  The  maximum  surface
covered by this authorization is specified in the corresponding authorizing decree (although the maximum size of a gold permit has recently been
restricted to 500 km2), and it covers specified commodities (the same area may be covered by different permits granted for different commodities).
Such an authorization can be transferred to third parties by inheritance or cession under certain conditions established by the Code. The holder should
regularly deliver details of the exploration programs and reports to the Department of Mines.
Mining License (permis d’exploitation), or exploitation license, which may be granted to the holder of an exploration permit or an authorization of
prospection for a 30 year period, renewable for successive ten year periods until the mineral reserves within the license area are exhausted. The
holder of the exploitation license under the 2012 Mining Code is required to begin exploitation within three years of the issuance of the license. The
license holder must notify the Administration in charge of Mines of its intention to begin exploitation, and must mention any significant changes in key
parameters of the feasibility study. If the changes impact the completion time and the viability of the proposed operation then the license holder much
submit a new feasibility study. The Malian State will have a 10% carried interest that cannot be diluted by future capital contributions. The  State
reserves the right to increase its participation in the future by an additional 10%. Such a license can be transferred to third parties by inheritance or
cession under certain conditions established by the Code.
Small-scale  Mining  Authorization  (authorisation  d’exploitation  de  petit  mine),  which  may  be  granted  to  the  holder  of  an  exploration  permit  or  an
authorization of prospection for a four year period, renewable for successive four year periods until the mineral reserves within the license area are
exhausted. Such a permit can be transferred to third parties by inheritance or cession under certain conditions established by the Code.
Sample analysis should be conducted in Mali, unless the holder of a mineral title obtains the authorization of the Director of Mines to submit samples to
another country for analysis.
Title holders must pay fixed fees for the grant, assignment, transfer, and renewal of mining titles, as well as annual surface rights. These fees are set out in
the 2012 Mining Regulations.
4.1.3
State Participation
The Malian Government retains a right to a 10% non-dilutable free carried interest in the capital of a company holding an exploitation license, in addition to
an option to acquire another 10% for a fair value. The 2012 Mining Code introduced an option for domestic private investors to acquire for cash at least 5% of
the shares of the exploitation company, under the same conditions as other private shareholders. The conditions for the exercise of such right by Malian
private  investors  and  the  exact  obligations  of  a  mining  operator  have  not  been  specifically  set  out  in  either  the  2012  Mining  Code  or  the  2012  Mining
Regulations.

Surface Rights
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 4.4
Mineral titles do not include any rights over the use of the soil. If the surface owner refuses the authorisation to conduct exploration or other mining activities
to a permit holder then such authorisation can be legally enforced through payment of adequate compensation. If the normal land use becomes impossible
due to exploration or mining activities then the surface owners could force the holder of the mineral permit to acquire the property.
For exploration permits the 2012 Mining Code required that a holder obtains consent to work the ground from local landholders, allow local communities
access to communications lines, and contributes to the improvement of sanitary and scholarly infrastructure, as well as implementing recreational facilities for
community and employee use.
For exploitation licenses the 2012 Mining Code requires that a holder obtains consent to work the ground from local landholders, pays for resettlement and
relocation of communities if needed, contributes to the improvement of sanitary and scholarly infrastructure, as well as implementing recreational facilities for
community and employee use, repair and damages arising to infrastructure from mining activities, and observe restrictions on mining activities within defined
proximity limits of water wells and other infrastructure.
4.1.5
Royalty and Mining Tax Considerations
The 2012 Mining Code introduced an ad valorem tax applicable to all substances, the taxable basis of which is the square-mine value (“valeur carreau
mine”) of extracted substances, exported or not, minus intermediary fees and expenses. The tax rate is based on specified Mining Groups. Gold and other
precious metals would be levied at a 3% royalty rate. There is also an additional 3% tax on gold production, see Section 4.1.8.
Due to the outcome of the Traore ZTS settlement an additional 1.65% royalty is due to ZTS, see Section 4.2.1.
4.1.6
Environmental Considerations
A detailed closure plan has to be filed as part of an exploitation license application. This plan must set out how the various mining components are to be
dismantled, removed, rehabilitated or regenerated. There is an expectation that the plan will contemplate progressive rehabilitation during operations. The
plan may be required to be updated at five yearly intervals.
A number of provisions are included in the 2012 Mining Regulation, including the obligation to:
Develop  and  implement  appropriate  procedures  to  manage  chemicals  and  to  ensure  transportation,  warehousing,  handling  and  secure  means  of
disposal of such substances as well as fuels and lubricants.
Build onsite wastewater treatment facilities.
Establish a program for waste reduction, sorting and recycling.

Ensure oil and lubricants are stored appropriately, including secondary containment.
Implement a management plan for water and mud tanks on the site.
Formulate and implement a site specific program to monitor the quality of water collected from any pits or workings, waste rock facilities, tailings
storage facilities, as well as surface water and groundwater that can be contaminated by mining activity.
Establish regular procedures for inspection, monitoring, verification of the data recording and reporting pertaining to the tailings dams.
Implement technical mechanisms to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas.
The 2012 Mining Code also imposes continued civil liability on the holder of an exploitation license in respect of damages or accidents caused by old
equipment, even after the closure of the mine and issuance of an environmental discharge.
4.1.7
Social Considerations
Exploitation license holders must file a Community Development Plan with the exploitation license application. The plan must have been developed in
consultation with the interested local communities as well as the local and regional authorities, and is required to be updated every two years.
The Mines Administration is required to create a Technical Committee on Local and Community Development. This committee is in charge of approving and
implementing the Community Development Plan.
An archaeological survey is required prior to any exploitation license grant.
4.1.8
Taxation Considerations
Capital gains taxes are 10% on transfer of mining titles to third parties under the 2012 Mining Code.
A  tax  equal  to  2%  of  the  costs  of  works  performed  (for  research  permits  and  prospection  authorizations)  and  1%  of  the  value  of  the  project  as  per  the
feasibility study (for exploitation licenses and exploitation authorizations) is payable upon the assignment of the project to a third party.
Value  added  tax  (VAT)  is  payable  in  Mali;  however,  the  2012  Mining  Code  has  a  provision  that  exploitation  license  holders  have  a  three  year  VAT
exemption period.
Corporate income tax is 30%. For exploitation license holders, there is a 15 year period from the start of production where the corporate income tax is
reduced to 25%.

A new tax has been introduced applying to holders of an exploitation license that would produce, in one year, more than 10% of the expected quantity fixed
in the annual production program approved by their shareholders’ general assembly. This consists of standard taxes and rights applying to operations and
results relating to overproduction.
A special tax on certain products (Impôt Spécial sur Certains Produits or ISCP), calculated on the basis of turnover exclusive of VAT, also applies and is
based on the Mining Group assignment. For a gold project, the applicable ISCP rate in force upon enactment of the 2012 Mining Code was 3%.
4.1.9
Policy Perception Index
B2Gold has used the Policy Perception Index from the 2013 Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining Companies report (the Fraser Institute survey) as a
credible  source  for  the  assessment  of  the  overall  political  risk  facing  an  exploration  or  mining  project  in  Mali.  Each  year,  the  Fraser  Institute  sends  a
questionnaire to selected mining and exploration companies globally. The Fraser Institute survey is an attempt to assess how mineral endowments and
public policy factors such as taxation and regulatory uncertainty affect exploration investment.
In 2013, 4,100 companies were approached and 690 companies responded. The companies participating in the survey reported exploration spending of
US$ 4.6B in 2012 and US$ 3.4B in 2013.
B2Gold  and  the  QPs  have  relied  on  the  Fraser  Institute  survey  because  it  is  globally  regarded  as  an  independent  report  card  style  assessment  to
governments on how attractive their policies are from the point of view of an exploration manager or mining company, and forms a proxy for the assessment
by industry of political risk in Mali from the mining perspective.
In the Fraser Institute survey, the Policy Perception Index is quantified as follows:
“Is a composite index, measuring the overall policy attractiveness of the 112 jurisdictions in the survey. The index is composed of survey responses to policy
factors  that  affect  investment  decisions.  Policy  factors  examined  include  uncertainty  concerning  the  administration  of  current  regulations,  environmental
regulations, regulatory duplication, the legal system and taxation regime, uncertainty concerning protected areas and disputed land claims, infrastructure,
socioeconomic and community development conditions, trade barriers, political stability, labour regulations, quality of the geological database, security, and
labor and skills availability. The Policy Perception Index is normalized to a maximum score of 100”.
Mali has a Policy Perception Index number of 0.24 in the 2013 edition of the Fraser Institute survey, as shown in Table 4.2.1. Mali is overall ranked 84th out
of the 112 jurisdictions in the Fraser Institute survey.

Initially Songhoi’s shareholders were Central African Gold plc (Central African), a company incorporated under the laws of England holding 320 shares, i.e.
80% of the shareholding, and Mani Sàrl (Mani), a company incorporated under the laws of Mali, holding 80 shares, i.e. 20% of the shareholding. Their
corporate  relations  were  governed  by  a  joint  venture  agreement  dated  25  July  2006  which  was  amended  on  15  September  2006  (the  Joint  Venture
Agreement).
On 18 December 2009, Central African and Papillon Resources Limited (Papillon), a company incorporated under the laws of Australia (and previously
known as Colonial Resources Limited) entered into a sale of shares agreement pursuant to which Central African assigned its 320 shares in Songhoi to
Papillon (the First Share Sale Agreement), as further witnessed by a deed of assignment dated 10 March 2010 (the Deed of Assignment).
Papillon and Songhoi subsequently entered into a sale of shares agreement pursuant to which Mani assigned 40 of its shares in Songhoi to Papillon (the
Second  Share  Sale  Agreement).  In  addition,  during  an  extraordinary  general  assembly  held  on  15  August  2012,  Papillon  and  Mani,  being  the  sole
shareholders of Songhoi, decided to amend the articles of association accordingly.
In October 2014 B2Gold and Papillon completed a merger agreement under the laws of Australia and Canada with the resulting company retaining the name
of B2Gold and acting as the Project operator. This merger included all Papillon assets, including 90% of Songhoi.
In January 2015 B2Gold purchased Mani’s 10% interest in Songhoi for a package consisting of cash payments, B2Gold stock payments, a 1.65% operating
royalty, and an agreement to enter into an exclusive fuel supply agreement for the Project with ZTS. In connection with the purchase all existing ZTS legal
claims were terminated.
B2Gold is now the 100% owner of Songhoi and the Project.

4.2.2
Songhoi Legal Standing
Legal opinion was provided that supports that Songhoi is a limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée or Sàrl) that is duly incorporated with the
Trade  and  Property  Credit  Register  (Registre  du  Commerce  et  du  Crédit  Mobilier  or  RCCM)  and  validly  exists  under  the  laws  of  Mali.  The  company’s
purpose is to conduct exploration and mining activities in Mali and overseas. The company is managed by a managing director (gérant).
4.2.3
Establishment Convention
The Médinandi Exploration Permit was initially granted to Zoumana Traore Sàrl (ZTS) by Order No. 041113 dated 27 May 2004 for the exploration of gold
and other mineral substances within Mineral Group II.
The Médinandi Exploration Permit was assigned twice, as follows:
To the benefit of Mani by Order No. 06-1413 dated 3 July 2006 (the First Assignment Decree) authorising the assignment to Mani, as a result of the
permit assignment agreement dated 2 May 2006 (the First Assignment Agreement).
To the benefit of Songhoi by Order No. 06-2761 dated 13 November 2006 (the Second Assignment Decree) authorising the assignment to Songhoi.

NI 43-101 - PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
ZTS and the Government of Mali entered into a corresponding establishment convention on 25 February 2004 pertaining to the Médinandi Exploration
Permit (the Establishment Convention), in accordance with the 1999 Mining Code and the Establishment Convention Model.
None  of  the  1999  Mining  Code,  the  2012  Mining  Code,  or  the  various  agreements,  including  the  joint  venture  agreement,  specifically  provided  for  an
assignment of the rights and obligations of ZTS under the Establishment Convention, firstly to Mani and subsequently to Songhoi. The QP was provided with
legal opinion to the effect that the initial Establishment Convention would automatically be transferred upon transfer of the Médinandi Exploitation License.
Further legal actions have resulted in a settlement with ZTS, refer to Section 4.2.1.
The Establishment Convention provides that the Government must, within 90 days from the date of submission of the application for grant of the exploitation
license, express in writing its intention of acquiring cash participation and the percentage of such participation in the capital of the registered Malian entity
that holds the exploitation license.
The Establishment Convention will expire on 25 February 2034, which is before the expiry date of the Médinandi Exploitation License. A new establishment
convention or an extension of the Establishment Convention will thus need to be negotiated for the remainder term of the Médinandi Exploitation License.
4.2.4
Mali Government Interest
Under the 2012 Mining Code, upon the grant of an exploitation permit the holder of an exploitation license must take steps to create an exploitation company
incorporated under the laws of Mali. This requirement is restated in the Establishment Convention, and in the joint venture agreement. B2Gold is currently in
the process of creating the new Malian exploitation company.
B2Gold has received notice of participation from the government of Mali (refer to Section 4.1.3). This will include the 10% non-dilutable free carried interest,
plus up to an additional 10% for cash value. Following the Government of Mali’s participation the new Malian company shareholding will be distributed, as
follows:
•
•
80 to 90% for B2Gold.
10 to 20% for the Government of Mali.
It is not certain whether the Project will fall under the 2012 Mining Code, or whether the Project would be considered to be grandfathered under the previous
1999  Mining  Code.  This  will  be  determined  when  the  new  Malian  operating  company  is  established  and  the  convention  terms  are  finalized.  However,
B2Gold is operating under the assumption that the 2012 Mining Code will apply.

Option Agreements
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 4.10
Under the First Permit Assignment Agreement, ZTS was granted an option to acquire 2.5% of the shares in the new Malian company. In this respect, the
terms of the joint venture agreement entail that this option is to be exercised over the shares that Papillon would hold in the new Malian company. The joint
venture agreement further provides that the option is to be exercised at a value to be set by an expert approved by the parties.
Under the joint venture agreement entered into between Central African (being Papillon’s predecessor in title) and Mali Mining House SA (Mali Mining) on
9 December 2005, and as amended firstly on 25 July 2006 and subsequently on 12 December 2006 (the MMH Joint Venture Agreement), Central African
granted to Mali Mining and/or Mali Mining’s shareholders an option to acquire up to 3% maximum of the shares in the new Malian company at a price set by
an expert approved by the parties. Pursuant to the MMH Joint Venture Agreement, Central African agreed to pay to MMH 1% of any net (after tax) dividend
that it would receive from the new Malian company whether this dividend results from the exercise of mining activities or the sale of a mining title.
Following resolution of the ZTS proceedings (see Section 4.2.1) there are no current option agreements.
4.2.6
Legal Proceedings
Papillon was involved in legal proceedings with ZTS prior to and during the B2Gold / Papillon merger. Under a judgement from the Commercial Court of
Bamako, ZTS was considered to hold 17% of Songhoi’s share capital, 10% of which is already indirectly held by ZTS through Papillon’s joint venture
partner, Mani Sàrl. Papillon had appealed this judgement.
Papillon had also initiated arbitral proceedings in Paris through the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in order to secure its rights against ZTS and
other respondents. This action had been registered by the ICC Secretariat.
Refer to Section 4.2.1 for the conclusion and closure of the legal proceedings.

Mineral Tenure
4.3.1
Médinandi Exploitation License
A mining lease (the Médinandi Exploitation License) was granted to Songhoi for the Project on 13 February 2014, under permit number 0070/PM-RM. The
requirements to maintain the license include construction of the mine as planned, payment of nominal annual fees and filing of various standard reports.
The exploitation license covers the entire area of the former Médinandi Exploration Permit and is 75 km2 in areal extent. The exploitation license is valid for a
30 year term, expiring February 2044.
The exploitation license boundary outline and boundary apex co-ordinates are given in Figure 4.3.1 and Table 4.3.1 respectively.

Page 4.14
The Menankoto Sud exploration permit is 52 km2 in area and is located approximately 13 km to the north of the Médinandi Exploitation License. The permit
was granted on 4 February 2014, and is valid until 4 February 2017, with two, two year renewals possible. B2Gold has a 95% interest in Menankoto Sud.
Minimum expenditures are required to maintain the permit, and comprise CFAF 65.4M in Year 1, CFAF 210.5M in Year 2, and CFAF 287M in Year 3, for a
total required expenditure commitment of CFAF 562.9M.
The Bantako Est exploration permit is 57 km2 in area and is located less than 5 km from the northeast corner of the Médinandi Exploitation License. B2Gold
has a 90% interest in Bantako Est. The permit was granted on 30 December 2011, and expired on 30 December 2014. The renewal was submitted as
required and is currently awaiting Mali government signatures. Minimum expenditures are required to maintain the permit, and comprise CFAF 150M in Year
1, CFAF 205M in Year 2, and CFAF 335M in Year 3, for a total required expenditure commitment of CFAF 690M.
4.4
Additional Tenure in Mali
B2Gold has additional tenure holdings in Mali which are at a grassroots exploration stage. These tenements are not considered to be part of the Project as
defined due to their distance from the Médinandi Exploitation License; the distances being such that there is no likelihood of shared infrastructure with the
Project.
4.5
Surface Rights
Malian law provides for private individuals and companies to own surface rights under a formal titling and registration system, but in the Project area there
are no private surface owners. The subsistence farmers typically use the land under a customary use and lineage system where no formal title has been
registered but the land is allowed to be used. This recognition is only tacit and the Malian government can appropriate the land as it sees fit.
All of the surface rights in the Project area are under the ownership of the State of Mali and have not been registered to any private entity.
There are a number of small villages in the license area, but there are currently no inhabitants in a “no go” zone, which is the area required for mining
operations,  infrastructure,  and  a  500  m  buffer  zone  around  the  active  blasting  area.  Previous  farmers  and  other  inhabitants  have  been  relocated  and
compensation has been paid.
There are no future payments or liabilities associated with the relocation effort and there are currently no inhabitants remaining in the no go zone. B2Gold is
reviewing a larger scale relocation effort for the nearby village (Fadougou), but this is not a required component of the Project and does not represent a
hindrance to the Project development.
4.6
Water Rights
The primary process water source in the ESIS and the PEA was assumed to be the Falémé River. This would require a permit from the OMVS which is the
regulatory body which manages the transnational boundary. The water study in the ESIS would be the basis for obtaining this permit.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 4.15
Subsequent investigations have determined that water from dewatering holes for the open pit area will provide sufficient process water. This concept will
provide cleaner, higher quality water and will avoid any dry season Falémé River pumping problems. A hydrological program, including pump tests, has
been initiated and will refine the site wide water balance and water extraction quantities.
The Project does not currently have any water permits. All permits required for the extraction and use of water will be obtained once water requirements and
water sources have been better defined.
4.7
Royalties and Encumbrances
As noted in Section 4.1.5, a 3% royalty (mining tax) is payable to the Malian government. There is an additional 3% tax on the sales of gold (ISCP, see
Section 4.1.8). The total Malian royalty payments on production will be 6%. As noted in Section 4.2.1 an additional royalty of 1.65% is payable to ZTS. The
total royalties payable are therefore 7.65%.

Comments on Section 4
In the opinion of the QP:
B2Gold  currently  holds  a  100%  interest  in  the  Project.  On  creation  of  the  new  Malian  mining  company,  B2Gold’s  interest  will  be  90%  with  the
contribution of a 10% share of the ownership to the Government of Mali. The Malian Mining Code also allows the Government of Mail to purchase (at
market terms) an additional 10% interest in the Exploitation Company. The Government of Mali has expressed an interest in acquiring an additional
10% interest and negotiations are ongoing. If the Government of Mali is successful, as anticipated, the final ownership of the Exploitation Company will
be 80% B2Gold and 20% by the Government of Mali
B2Gold is the current Project operator.

5.1
Accessibility
The Project is located within the Kayes Region in south-western Mali, on the border of Mali and Senegal. It is approximately 210 km south of Kayes and
approximately 40 km south of the city of Kéniéba.
Access to the Project is either from Dakar or from Bamako by road. From Bamako it is approximately 480 km along the recently completed Millennium
Highway from Bamako to Kéniéba, then a further 45 km on gravel / dirt roads from Kéniéba to the project site. A new road from site to the Millennium
Highway is currently under construction, and will allow all-weather two-way traffic for construction and operating traffic. The new road will generally consist of
upgraded existing roads and will intersect with the Millennium Highway approximately 2.5 km north of the village of Segondo.
Current air access is via charter flights to an airstrip 1 km east of Kéniéba, then by road to site. A Fekola site airstrip is currently in construction. The airstrip
will be a gravel / dirt surface at least 1,600 min length.
5.2
Climate
The Project area is in the pre-Guinean climate zone, where the average annual rainfall is greater than 1,000 mm and may reach 1,200 mm with a maximum
of 85 days of rain and a rainy season lasting three months (July through September), characterized by torrential rains. Average annual rainfall is highly
variable.
The temperatures vary from a maximum 46ºC and minimum 10°C depending upon season, with a mean annual temperature of 28°C.
Wind speeds are generally calm, normally varying between 1 m/s and 5 m/s. The operating design wind speed is 25 m/s and the maximum wind speed is 45
m/s. The predominant wind direction is from the north-west, but this varies seasonally and day versus night.
Exploration activities are minimal during the period from July to September due to the rains. Construction, mining, and processing activities will be conducted
year-round.
5.3
Local Resources and Infrastructure
Due to the remote location the Project has limited existing infrastructure. Proposed project infrastructure including sources of water, power, communications,
mining areas, processing areas, waste disposal areas, and tailings disposal areas are described in Section 18 of this Report.

Physiography, Topography, Elevation and Vegetation
The site is characterized by various laterite plateaus that rise approximately 30 to 40m above the surrounding landscape. These plateaus are relatively flat
and generally drain in a westerly direction. At the edge of the laterite plateaus the topography is steep in comparison to the general topography of the site.
Elevation ranges from approximately 130 to 190 m above sea level.
A number of drainage lines cross the property and drain from east to west. The Falémé River is adjacent to the Project site and flows in a northerly direction
with meanders to the west and south of the site.
The Project is located in the Guinean bioclimatic zone which corresponds to high humidity and ecosystems of open forests. Vegetation types observed in the
Project area include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Wetlands on laterite hardpans: this is a much localized vegetation association that is confined to depressions in laterite hardpans that hold water
through the wet season. The wetlands are usually not more than 500 m2 in area. Open water is usually limited, and much of the surface area is usually
covered in hydrophytic vegetation.
Grassland on laterite hardpans: this is a widespread vegetation association that occurs on all the laterite hardpans, which are characterized by very
shallow to non-existent soils and many areas of exposed sheetrock. Grasses are usually not higher than 200 mm, while scattered woody shrubs can
be up to 2 m in height. Grass canopy cover varies from 50 to 80%.
Riparian forest: most prominent along the perennial Falémé River, and is most developed on islands in the river.
Thicket on laterite scarps: a complex of five vegetation associations that are all strongly associated with the rocky edges of laterite scarps and the
steep slopes below these scarps.
Woodland on alluvium: a tall semi-deciduous closed woodland or forest community is confined to alluvial soils along valley bottoms.
Woodland on silt: occurs mostly in valley bottoms and foot-slopes.
Woodland on ferrocrete: found across all landform types (from crests to valley bottoms), while occurring mainly on mid-slopes, upper slopes, and
crests.
Woodland on steep sandy slopes: a much localized vegetation association which appears to be confined to a small area of steep, north facing slopes
in the north-eastern quarter of the Project area.
Additional information on the Project flora is included in Section 20.

Comments on Section 5
In the opinion of the QP:
•
•
There is sufficient suitable land available within the exploitation concession and more specifically within the planned project area for the planned
tailings disposal, waste rock dumps, open pit, mining infrastructure, process plant, workshops, offices, power plant, and other planned facilities.
The mining license provides the license holder with exclusive access to and use of the Project area. This does not give the license holder ownership
of the land, but does make the land available for construction, operation, and other infrastructure needs.
No surface rights are currently held. However, the process for obtaining such rights is well understood and such rights will be granted with formation of
the exploitation company.
Construction and mining activities are reasonably expected to be conducted year round.

Ownership History
6.0 HISTORY
6.1.1
Legacy Period (1954 to 2001)
The early ownership history of the Médinandi exploration permit area in its various forms has largely been gleaned from the prospectus filed with the ASX by
Colonial Resources dated 25 January 2010.
The earliest reference to exploration activity in the area relates to work done by an unnamed French prospector who discovered gold in quartz veins at the
Fadougou  Main  Zone  in  1953.  This  activity  is  recorded  in  two  prospecting  reports  prepared  in  1954  and  1955.  These  reports  have  not  been  found  by
B2Gold.
Société Nationale de Recherches et d’Exploitation des Ressources Minières de Mali (Sonarem) commenced reconnaissance activities in 1962, funded by
Russian interests from 1966 to 1970. This continued from 1975 to 1984 with input from the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), the
French Geological Survey. Guefest Company (Guefest), a Russian mining consortium co-operated with Sonarem from 1992 to 1996.
Western  African  Gold  and  Exploration  S.A.  (WAG)  were  assigned  the  Guefest  interest  in  the  Médinandi  area  in  1996  following  an  agreement  between
Guefest, Eagle River International Limited (Eagle River), Azco Mining Inc (Azco) and Lion Mining Finance Limited (Lion Mining).
Randgold Resources Ltd. (Randgold) entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement with WAG / Azco on the project area in 1998. Work completed by the JV is
recorded to 2001.
6.1.2
Recent Period (2006 to Present)
Central African Gold (Central African) acquired an interest in the project in 2006. Central African’s interest was transferred to Colonial Resources Limited
(subsequently Papillon) during 2010. The Mali registered holding company Songhoi Resources SARL (Songhoi) held the exploration permits and eventually
the Médinandi Exploitation License, which contains the Project.
Initially Songhoi’s shareholders were Central African Gold plc (Central African), a company incorporated under the laws of England, holding 320 shares, i.e.
80% of the shareholding, and Mani Sàrl (Mani), a company incorporated under the laws of Mali, holding 80 shares, i.e. 20% of the shareholding. Their
corporate relations were governed by a JV agreement dated 25 July 2006, which was amended on 15 September 2006 (the JV Agreement).
On 18 December 2009, Central African and Papillon Resources Limited (Papillon), a company incorporated under the laws of Australia (and previously
known as Colonial Resources Limited) entered into a sale of shares agreement pursuant to which Central African assigned its 320 shares in Songhoi to
Papillon (the First Share Sale Agreement), as further witnessed by a deed of assignment dated 10 March 2010 (the Deed of Assignment).
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - HISTORY

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 6.2
Papillon and Songhoi subsequently entered into a sale of shares agreement pursuant to which Mani assigned 40 of its shares in Songhoi to Papillon (the
Second  Share  Sale  Agreement).  In  addition,  during  an  extraordinary  general  assembly  held  on  15  August  2012,  Papillon  and  Mani,  being  the  sole
shareholders of Songhoi, decided to amend the articles of association accordingly.
Following this amendment the ownership of Songhoi was Papillon holding 360 shares, representing 90% of Songhoi’s shareholding and Mani holding 40
shares, representing 10% of Songhoi’s shareholding.
On 3 October 2014, B2Gold Corp. acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Papillon Resources Limited, now referred to as Papillon Resources Pty Ltd.
(“Papillon”) by way of an Australian scheme of arrangement. The scheme of arrangement was carried out pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in a
merger implementation agreement (the “Papillon Merger Agreement”) dated 3 June 2014 between B2Gold and Papillon. On completion of the transaction,
Papillon became a wholly-owned subsidiary of B2Gold Corp.
In January 2015, B2Gold purchased the remaining 10% non-controlling interest in the Project from Mani, the minority shareholder of Songhoi. Following this
purchase Songhoi is fully owned by B2Gold Corp.
Negotiation of the Malian convention related to the formation of an Exploitation company (required for operation of a producing mine) is underway and will
include government participation as described in Section 4.1.3 of this report.
6.2
Exploration History
6.2.1
Legacy Period
Quartz veining in the Médinandi general area was first identified in 1953 by a French prospector at a prospect known as the Fadougou Main Zone. A gold
bearing quartz vein with a strike extent of about 280 m and widths varying from 0.2 to 1 m were reported.
Sonarem  commenced  reconnaissance  activities  in  1962  and  following  funding  by  Russian  interests  between  1966  and  1970,  undertook  more  detailed
exploration  in  the  Fadougou  Main  Zone  area.  Additional  work  was  performed  by  Sonarem  in  cooperation  with  BRGM  between  1975  and  1984.  Work
undertaken in collaboration with Guefest between 1992 and 1996 appears to have included geological mapping, reconnaissance trenching and surface
sampling, geophysical surveys, auger and core drilling. There is very limited documentation available, other than through secondary sources of this work,
and none of the drilling is included in the current B2Gold database. BRGM is reported to have undertaken a resource estimate at Fadougou Main Zone
(Colonial Resources, 2010).
During the WAG/Azco period between 1992 and 1996 work included regional mapping, ground induced polarization (IP) geophysical surveys, soil and
termite geochemical sampling, trenching, auger and reverse circulation (RC) drilling, and resource estimates for the Fadougou Main Zone area, which was
subsequently referred to as the Fadougou deposit, and more recently referred to as the Fekola Satellites.

Between 1998 and 2001, the Randgold and WAG/Azco JV undertook interpretation of Landsat and aeromagnetic data, geological and regolith mapping,
regional geochemical soil and rock, compilation of data from previous work, and updated mineral resource estimate for the Fadougou deposit.
This early work from 1955 to 2001, referred to as legacy data in this Report, identified a number of prospects and targets in the permit area, in addition to the
Fadougou Main Zone; these included Fadougou Southeast, Fadougou South Southeast, Fadougou Northeast, Tintiba, Médinandi, and Betakili targets.
6.2.2
Recent Period
From 2006 to 2008, Central African (Papillon) completed mapping, soil geochemical surveys, ground IP and airborne magnetic and electromagnetic (EM)
surveys over the project area, together with RC and core drilling (130 holes) over the Médinandi and Fadougou zones.
Fadougou deposit resource estimates (and the estimate referred to by Papillon as the Fekola Satellites) were prepared in 2009, 2011, and 2014. These
estimates are not considered current by B2Gold.
On acquisition by Papillon, a large package of soil samples that had been collected by Central African were despatched for analysis. The samples outlined
dual gold-in-soil anomalies of about 3.5 km north–south strike extent, and as much as 500 m in width in the south-eastern portion of the permit near the
village of Fekola. Both anomalies were tested by a single line of RC drill holes, with the easternmost anomaly returning a significant intercept of low-grade
gold mineralization within a wide zone of hydrothermal alteration. Papillon subsequently completed further drill testing of the same gold-in-soil anomalies,
which resulted in the discovery hole of the Fekola deposit in December 2010.
Work conducted by Papillon since 2010 has consisted of soil sampling, ground geophysical surveys, rotary air-blast (RAB), air core, RC and core drilling,
environmental  studies  to  support  the  ESIS  application,  geotechnical  and  hydrological  surveys  and  water  sampling,  topographic  surveys,  metallurgical
sampling, upgrading of access roads and the accommodation camp, and preliminary mining studies.
In 2012 a scoping-level study was performed, which indicated sufficiently positive economics under the study assumptions that Papillon proceeded with a
pre-feasibility study in 2013. The study was prepared using assumptions and allowances in the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listing rules and the
2004 Australasian JORC Code. Results were initially summarized in a report prepared by DRA Mineral Projects (Pty) Ltd (DRA, 2013) in June 2013. An
update to DRA (2013) was presented by Papillon in a news release to the ASX on 26 June 2013.
The  study  was  also  required  by  the  Government  of  Mali  in  support  of  conversion  of  the  exploration  permit  to  an  exploitation  license  and  some  of  the
supporting studies in DRA (2013) were prepared in support of the application for the Project environmental permit. The environmental permit was granted to
the Project in May 2013 and the exploitation license in January 2014.

The  Papillion  PFS  indicated  positive  project  economics  under  the  assumptions  in  the  study.  As  a  consequence,  Papillon  commenced  more  detailed
engineering and technical studies, and had undertaken some preliminary site works in support of future project construction, including site-clearing activities.
Table  6.2.1  summarizes  the  available  information  on  the  exploration  and  work  programs  completed  prior  to  B2Gold’s  acquiring  Papillon’s  interests.
Prospects and targets identified from this work are shown on Figure 6.2.1.

Appears to have included geological mapping, reconnaissance trenching and surface
sampling, auger and core drilling, geophysical surveys. BRGM reportedly undertook
a resource estimate. Work is not broken out in the information available as to which companies
performed which activity.
The programs identified a 10 km2 zone which contained five gold anomalies related to a well-
defined structural feature. The two largest zones, noted as II and III, were considered to be
potentially economic. The Médinandi gold deposit was interpreted to host three mineralized zones,
oriented north–south and northeast–southwest, over an area of 1,200 m x 3.3 m.

Resource History
Two relevant historical estimates were prepared by Papillon on the Fekola deposit, prior to B2Gold acquiring Papillon. As part of the Papillon PFS, a mineral
resource estimate was completed on the Fekola deposit by MPR, and was provided to the ASX as part of Papillon’s ongoing disclosure obligations to the
ASX on 24 January 2013.

Post the completion of the Papillon PFS, additional drilling was undertaken at Fekola and surrounding exploration targets. This resulted in an updated
Mineral Resource estimate for Fekola that was completed by MPR in August 2013, and released by Papillon to the ASX on 3 September 2013.
The historical estimates are summarized in Table 6.3.1 (January 2013) and Table 6.3.2 (August 2013). The notes to the tables which follow Table 6.3.1 and
Table  6.3.2  provide  the  context  for  the  historical  estimates.  B2Gold  is  not  treating  the  historical  estimates  as  current  mineral  resources  as  the  Mineral
Resources reported in Section 14 are considered to supersede the Papillon estimates.
The QPs have used the MPR resource models, DRA (2013), the Papillon PFS, internal Papillon studies and, where applicable, interim results of work
undertaken since the completion of the studies as supporting documentation when preparing the financial analysis and the Mineral Resource estimates
presented in this Report.

Mineral Resource estimates were prepared by Mr Nic Johnson, M.AIG, an employee of MPR Geological Consultants Pty Ltd and are
reported on a 100% basis. The January 2013 estimate has an effective date of 15 January, 2013 and was released to the ASX on
24 January 2013; the September 2013 estimate has an effective date of 5 August 2013 and was released to the ASX on 3 September
2013.

Resources are reported using a base case cutoff grade of 1 g/t Au.

Estimates were performed using core and RC drill data. The January estimate is supported by 428 RC, RC pre-collar and diamond core
(RC-DD), and diamond core drill holes for a combined length of 80,968.9 m; 79,723 assay sample intervals predominantly sampled at 1
m intervals downhole; and 1,125 bulk density measurements. The August estimate is supported by 643 RC, RC-DD and core holes for
a combined length of 127,148.40 m; 125,365 assay sample intervals predominantly sampled at 1 m intervals downhole; and 2,003 bulk
density measurements.
Geological and oxidation interpretations were imposed to define domains of similar grade tenor and directional trends. The models
estimate resources into panels with dimensions of 20 mE x 40 mN x 5 mRL. Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) of gold grades used
indicator variography based on 2 m composite grades, with continuity of gold grades characterised by variograms at 14 indicator
thresholds. A panel support adjustment, incorporating an adjustment for information effects, was used in estimation, assuming a
selective mining unit of 5 mE x 10 mN x 5 mRL and a nominal grade control sampling spacing of 8 mE x 15 mN x 1.5 mRL. The shape of
the local panel gold grade distribution was assumed to be lognormal within each panel as estimated by indicator kriging.

The “recoverable resource” estimates within each panel were classified according to the distribution of sampling in the kriging
neighbourhood. The classification scheme was related to the proximity and spatial distribution of the informing sample composites.
Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources assume at least a 40 x 50 m spacing; Inferred Mineral Resources have drill spacings of at
least 80 x 160 m.
The resources are reported using the classifications of the Australasian JORC Code, 2004 edition. While these codes are generally
reconcilable to the CIM Definition Standards, B2Gold is not treating the estimates as meeting CIM standards as they have not been
evaluated for reasonable prospects of economic extraction, such as constraining within a Lerchs–Grossmann pit shell; instead they
are reported only within a marginal cutoff grade.
B2Gold considers these estimates to be relevant to the Project history as the January 2013 estimate is the basis for the Papillon PFS,
and the August 2013 estimate reflects Papillon’s latest public disclosure to the ASX on the Fekola deposit prior to the B2Gold/Papillon
transaction.
B2Gold is not treating the historical estimates as current. A QP has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as
current Mineral Resources. B2Gold is reporting updated resource estimates in Section 14 of the Report that are considered to
supersede the Papillon estimates.

7.1.1
Overview
The  Fekola  deposit  is  located  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  Paleoproterozoic  Kédougou–Kéniéba  Inlier  (“KKI”),  an  erosional  window  through  the
Neoproterozoic sedimentary cover sequence of the Taoudeni Basin into the Lower Proterozoic volcano-sedimentary and igneous basement rocks of the
Birimian Supergroup of the West African Craton (Figure 7.1.1). The inlier is bounded on its western margin by the Hercynian Mauritanide orogenic belt and is
unconformably overlain by flat-lying Neoproterozoic sandstones of the Taoudeni intracratonic basin to the east, north and south (Villeneuve and Cornée,
1994).
7.1.2
Regional Stratigraphy
Bassot  (1987)  proposed  a  subdivision  of  the  KKI  into  the  Mako  Series  (granite-greenstone)  and  the  eastern  Dialé–Daléma  Series  (sedimentary  basin),
separated by the arcuate, north easterly trending Main Transcurrent Zone. The Mako Series comprises tholeiitic basalt and andesite lavas, with intercalated
volcanic  agglomerates  and  banded  tuffs  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008).  Calc-alkaline  volcaniclastic  units  and  volcanic-rich  sedimentary  rocks  crop  out  along  the
eastern side of the Mako Series. The Mako Series has been intruded by a complex sequence of pre- and syntectonic mafic and felsic plutons (Dia et al.,
1997). To the east of the Main Transcurrent Zone, the Dialé–Daléma Series consists of sandstones, and siltstones with intercalated calc-alkaline ashfall and
lapilli tuffs. It is intruded by a quartz monzonite granite body, the Saraya Granite.
In the eastern Dialé–Daléma basin, a calc-alkaline volcanic-plutonic complex, the Falémé Series may constitute a separate, younger assemblage from the
Dialé–Daléma  sedimentary  basin.  The  Falémé  Series  consists  of  carbonate-rich  sedimentary  rocks,  minor  basalts  and  andesites,  rare  rhyolites,  and
syntectonic granitoids (Hirdes and Davis, 2002). The Falémé Series is bounded to the east by the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone, separating it from the Kofi
Series sedimentary basin. The Kofi basin comprises sandstones, argillites and platform carbonates and syntectonic, S-type, peraluminous biotite-bearing
granites (with similar compositions to the Saraya batholith) (Lawrence et al, 2013). The Kofi Series hosts significant gold mineralization on the eastern side
of the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone and is the primary host to mineralization at Fekola.

Within the KKI, two major terrane-bounding structures are recognized: the Main Transcurrent Zone and the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. The Main Transcurrent
Zone is an arcuate, north to north easterly trending, crustal-scale shear zone that separates the Mako Series granite–greenstone belt from the younger
Dialé–Daléma Series (sedimentary basin) to the east. The Main Transcurrent Zone is spatially related to significant gold mineralization in the Mako Series of
Senegal. The northernmost portion of the Main Transcurrent Zone converges and may merge with the north-northwest trending Senegal-Mali Shear Zone.
Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is a crustal scale, terrane bounding shear zone with over 100 km of known strike extent. The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is spatially
associated  with  significant  gold  mineralization  in  western  Mali,  including  the  Loulo  group  of  deposits,  approximately  50  km  north  of  Fekola,  as  well  as
Sadiola and Yatela, located on its northernmost extents.
7.2
Deposit Geology
The Fekola deposit is hosted by a moderate to steeply west dipping, folded sequence of marine meta-sediments of the Kofi group, which locally include:
argillite and minor pelitic sediments; fine grained turbidites, comprising laminated to thin-bedded siliciclastic siltstone and mudstone; and a heterolithic, mass
flow breccia, or conglomerate (Figure 7.2.1). Fine grained thin marble units are present as a volumetrically minor rock type interbedded with the politic units.
Minor mafic volcanic, or volcaniclastic units occur locally in the upper and possibly, lower portions of the hanging wall stratigraphy. Weakly feldspar-phyric
felsic dykes are locally observed. The deposit has been subjected to upper greenschist facies metamorphism.
Gold mineralization is associated with fine grained, disseminated pyrite and local pyrite veinlets. Mineralization is also associated with a pervasive, texturally
destructive, hydrothermal dolomite alteration, which may overprint an earlier albite-quartz-carbonate±sericite alteration. Hydrothermal alteration and gold
mineralization appear to be synchronous with the development of north to north-northwest plunging folds within a corridor of ductile, high strain deformation.
The late-stage, brittle fault zone known as the Fekola Fault, cross cuts all earlier generations of structures and mineralization. The magnitude and sense of
displacement along this late structure are currently unknown.
The Fekola deposit area is covered by a laterally extensive, in-situ and transported lateritic regolith that measures between 15 and 45 m. The regolith profile
is  overlain  by  a  thin  cover  of  soil.  In  areas  of  transported  cover,  the  top  of  the  weathering  profile  typically  consists  of  a  mottled  clay  zone,  comprising
ferruginous, and grey clays. This grades downward into an alluvial polymictic cobble / gravel unit that is set in a clay matrix. Underlying the alluvial unit is a
residual laterite profile that is typical of the downward succession seen in tropical and weathered terrains, which, from surface, transitions from saprolite to
saprock to fresh rock. The mineralisation at the Fekola deposit is extensively covered by the layer of alluvium, with the exception of the southernmost portion
of the deposit, where residual laterite occurs at surface.
The majority of gold mineralization in the Fekola deposit occurs in unweathered, fresh rock.

Deposit Lithology

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 7.5
As  part  of  a  recent  re-modelling  of  geology  by  B2Gold  Corp,  a  simplified  stratigraphy  has  been  devised,  in  order  to  better  facilitate  three-dimensional
rendering of the lithologic units. Examples of the main lithologies of the revised model are shown in Figure 7.2.2. A geological drill core re-logging program is
planned for 2015, in order to provide greater resolution of the deposit stratigraphy.
Argillite
Argillite is project terminology describing a chloritic phyllite (Figure 7.2.2 A and D) that comprises the hanging wall and footwall lithologies to the mineralized
turbidite / debris flow package at Fekola. Footwall argillite, particularly in the immediate footwall of the mineralized zone, tends to exhibit bands of dark green
chlorite alteration (Figure 7.2.2 D). The argillite package may also include intervals of massive, dark green mafic volcanic rock. Total thickness of the argillite
unit is unknown, but it is locally intersected in drill hole to widths of greater than 50 m.
Turbidite (Banded Siltstone and Mudstone)
The  most  abundant  rock  type  by  volume  in  the  Fekola  deposit,  the  main  turbidite  unit  comprises  thinly  bedded  and  locally,  laminated  siltstones  and
mudstones (Figure 7.2.2 B), with local horizons of fine grained, light grey sandstone, or greywacke. Colouration ranges from pale yellow-tan to orangey-pink
with local greyish intervals. Petrography indicates that the turbidites can have a high carbonate content, possibly secondary dolomite ranging up to >80% by
volume, which locally obscures the protolith. Individual beds and laminae exhibit isoclinal folding on the meso- and macroscopic scale and primary bedding
is frequently highly transposed by overprinting fabrics. Boyd, et al. (2013) report local occurrence of graded bedding in the turbidite package. Younging
directions are difficult to discern, due to the high degree of transposition by later deformation. Minor mafic intrusions also occur within the turbidite unit.
Turbidites have been intersected in drillhole over widths of >100 m. The true thickness of this package is currently unknown.
Mass Flow Breccia
The  term  mass  flow  breccia,  mass  debris  flow  and  meta-conglomerate  have  been  variably  used  at  Fekola  to  describe  a  heterolithic,  dominantly  matrix
supported sedimentary breccia and conglomerate comprised of subangular, pebble-sized fragments, or clasts. The fragments themselves are locally highly
deformed. Typically, the mass flow has a diverse mineral assemblage reflecting the variety of fragments. Colouration is varied and reflects the abundance of
clasts of varying composition.
Detailed analysis reported by Boyd et al (2013) documents the presence of fining-upward cycles ranging in thickness from less than a meter to several
meters. Coarser fragmental intervals are generally <25% of the entire interval and are locally capped by an interval of grey, very fine to fine-grained quartz
arenites and subordinate greywackes, with thin beds of graded and laminated silty mudstones. Younging directions determined from graded bedding are
frequently difficult to discern due to overprinting by subsequent deformation.

Petrographic analysis (Ross, 2014) shows that both fragments and the surrounding matrix have a foliation fabric. Rare fragments may be quartz porphyritic
and the matrix locally contains prismatic quartz crystals which may be liberated phenocrysts. Isolated, rhombic carbonate crystals are also locally observed.
Fragments are variably albite, quartz, muscovite, biotite or carbonate altered. Trace amounts of tourmaline and possibly chlorite are also present in the
matrix. Carbonate is the dominant alteration mineral (dolomite) and can strongly overprint clasts and forming a cloudy brownish matrix, possibly mixed with
biotite. In areas of strongest dolomitization, primary textures are almost completely obliterated (Figure 7.2.2 F). True thickness of the mass flow breccia unit is
unknown, though diamond drill intersections of this unit can locally exceed 50 m.

Metapelite
Metapelite  is  the  current  project  term  describing  a  strongly  foliated,  relatively  biotite-rich  rock  (Figure  7.2.2  E).  Historically,  this  rock  has  been  variably
described as metamorphosed arkose, or alternatively, as a mafic intrusive. In hand specimen, the metapelite is dark grey-black with wispy pale folia (Figure
7.2.2 E). It is locally, moderately magnetic, but magnetite is not readily apparent in hand specimen. Sulphide content can range from minor amounts to >5%
by  volume.  When  mineralized  it  typically  exhibits  very  fine-grained  irregularly  distributed,  disseminated  pyrite.  It  can  be  an  excellent  host  rock  to  gold
mineralization. The metapelite is most frequently observed within several tens of metres of the hanging wall of the Fekola Fault, in drillhole intersections
ranging from less than a metre up to approximately 25 m thick. It locally exhibits a lenticular geometry in plan and cross sectional views, which may reflect
local structural thickening or conversely, attenuation of this unit.
Petrographic analysis (Ross, 2014) indicates that the metapelite is comprised of anastomosing biotite folia wrapping around domains of albite-carbonate
altered rock.
The protolith to this rock may have been metasedimentary, or igneous, comprising alternating biotite-feldspar laminae. The feldspar component has been
overprinted by albite-carbonate alteration. Carbonate alteration may be originally synchronous with albite, but outlasts it and partially overprints it. The biotite
is  relatively  unaltered.  The  biotite  folia  are  crenulated,  suggesting  that  the  metapelite  has  undergone  at  least  two  stages  of  ductile  deformation.  Albite-
carbonate alteration appears to post-date ductile deformation.
Marble
The marble is dominantly white to pale grey and finely laminated and is comprised either of calcite, or of interlocking semi-rhombic dolomitic carbonate
(88%). The laminations are tectonic and defined by variations in carbonate grain size (<20 um – 0.2 mm) and a few very fine-grained quartz dominant folia
which wrap around porphyroclasts defining asymmetric mylonitic fabrics. Randomly oriented flakes of muscovite (2%) occur in the carbonate. Locally, there
are trace amounts of nearly microcrystalline pyrite disseminated in the rock. The predominant carbonate is likely dolomite (Ross, 2014) close to mineralized
areas, but calcite more distally.
This rock is variably mineralized, but not a significant host to gold mineralization at Fekola. In drill core, this unit occurs over intervals of several decimetres,
to thicknesses in excess of 20 m. The marble occurs intermittently throughout the stratigraphy, likely as a result of repetition of individual units by F2 folds. As
with the metapelite unit, it is suspected to have undergone local structural thickening and or attenuation during deformation. For the purposes of three-
dimensional modelling, and since it often occurs in a similar stratigraphic position, the marble has been grouped into the larger mass flow breccia unit. Boyd
et al (2013) interpret the calcareous unit as capping the coarse, clastic debris flows.
Felsic dykes or sills
Pink, weakly feldspar ± quartz porphyritic dykes or sills which have a pink, aphanitic to albitized matrix, and which locally exceed 10 m in thickness occur
within the turbidite and mass flow units. This unit has historically been recorded as a hematite altered sandstone, but the sharp contacts and porphyritic
texture  are  inconsistent  with  this  classification.  Further  resolution  of  the  distribution  and  geometry  of  these  dykes  is  expected  via  the  2015  re-logging
program.

A thorough interpretation and discussion of the structural geology of the Fekola deposit is presented in technical paper by Dorling (2013). B2Gold Corp is
currently revising and re-interpreting this earlier work, with a detailed structural analysis to be completed in 2015. The Fekola deposit is hosted within a north
to north-northwest trending zone of intense ductile deformation.
7.3.1
D1 and D2 Structures
D1 is characterized by a well-developed penetrative fabric termed S1. S1 is an intense foliation, defined by alignment of phyllosilicate minerals, including
sericite, chlorite and locally, biotite. In intensely deformed turbiditic rocks, S1 is defined by lenticular domains of strongly transposed S0 laminae that are
wrapped by spaced phyllosilicate folia. S1 frequently transposes bedding into a strong, S0 / S1 composite fabric (Figure 7.3.1). S1 is locally axial planar to
isoclinal, steeply inclined, intrafolial F1 folds (Figure 7.3.2).

An analysis of planar fabrics measured in oriented drill core by Papillion Resources, shows the predominant southerly strike and steep westerly dips that
characterize S1 at Fekola. Figure 7.3.4 shows an equal area stereonet plot of poles to measured planar elements. The combined contour peak for bedding,
contacts and foliation indicates a mean strike and dip of 177/67. Significant scatter of the poles, particularly to foliation, in the centre of the net indicate
relatively flat lying fabrics and may reflect reorientation of S1  by  F2  folding.  The  pole  to  a  plane  fitted  through  this  scattered  foliation  and  bedding  data
approximates the shallowly north-northwest plunging (13°g354) axis of the major F2 folding event that has produced the current orientation of fabrics.
Figure 7.3.4 Equal Area Plot of Poles to Bedding (BED), Contacts (CNT), Fold Surfaces (FOD) and Foliation (FOL)
Contoured poles to FOL suggest south-southwest striking, steeply west dipping (177/67°) foliation predominates, although there is a loose cluster
of poles at the centre of the net that may indicate an earlier S0/S2 composite foliation has been reoriented by F2 folding. The subtle, easterly
trending girdle of poles to bedding surfaces (blue great circle), including CNT and FOD, suggests shallowly north-northwest plunging F2 folding
(13°g354).
On vertical cross-sections through the deposit, folding is characterized by asymmetric, apparently east-verging, antiform-synform pairs. These
smaller scale macroscopic folds may occupy a larger synformal structure in the area of the central, thickest portions of the Fekola deposit, which
is inferred from the geometry of the enveloping surfaces of folded stratigraphic units and the repetition of argillite units in the footwall and hanging
wall of the deposit (Figure 7.3.5). Additional structural work is required to confirm this interpretation.

Brittle-ductile Structures
Although deformation at Fekola is predominantly ductile in nature, examples of more brittle-ductile structures are evident in the form of:
•
•
Cataclastic breccias with hydrothermally altered, pyritic matrices (Figure 7.3.6).
Zones of pale grey, breccia textured dolomite-albite-quartz veining (Figure 7.3.7).
These brittle-ductile structures often are present in high grade domains and are interpreted as being concurrent with ductile deformation at Fekola
and may reflect episodic fluid overpressuring in the hydrothermal system.

Late Brittle Structures – Fekola Fault
The south to south-southeast striking Fekola Fault is the latest significant structure observed in the Fekola deposit. The fault exhibits steep (70 to
80°)  westerly  dips  in  the  north  end  of  the  deposit,  with  more  moderate  dips  (45  to  50°)  prevailing  along  strike  to  the  south.  The  fault  is
characterized by a zone of brittle deformation comprising both lithified and unconsolidated fault breccias, locally chloritic cataclasites, chloritic
fault gouge and zones of highly fractured and broken core. Within the zone, fault strands occur tens of meters apart, but in general fault slip zones
are  <2  m  wide,  with  damage  zones  having  chlorite  fractures  over  a  few  meters.  Fault  breccias  locally  exhibit  pristine,  mosaic-type  textures,
cemented  by  clear  gypsum  and/or  hematite-stained  gypsum  and  calcite  matrices  (Figure  7.3.8).  The  direction  and  magnitude  of  displacement
along the Fekola Fault is currently unknown. It strikes parallel to, and occurs in the lower eastern parts of the deposit.

Mineralization and Alteration
Gold  mineralization  in  the  Fekola  deposit  is  associated  with  fine  grained  pyrite  in  tan  dolomite-albite  altered  wallrocks,  which  locally  contain
diffuse, often deformed pale grey quartz-dolomite-pyrite-albite matrix veins and veinlets (Figure 7.3.7B). Pyrite occurs both as fine disseminations
and within millimetre-scale pyrite veinlets, which have locally been deformed by D1 (Figure 7.4.1). The folding of zones of pyrite mineralization by
F1  and  F2  folds  indicates  that  that  the  main  mineralization  event  at  Fekola  was  early  in  the  deformation  history  of  the  deposit.  This  early
mineralization event is reflected in the current geometry of the ore zone, which plunges shallowly to the north-north west, in an orientation similar
to  that  of  folds  and  lineations.  This  plunging  zone  of  mineralization  is  broadly  continuous  and  has  been  traced  over  a  strike  extent  of
approximately 1.5 km, to depths of up to 400 m below surface, with widths to 300 m. The greatest continuity is observed within a high grade shoot
(>2 g/t Au) which plunges approximately 13° to the north-northwest. Mineralization is open at depth, down plunge. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite
have also been observed. The total sulphide content of the deposit is typically less than 5%.
Gold mineralization is proximally associated with intense, texturally destructive, carbonate (dolomite), albite, quartz, and sericite alteration. Dull-
grey  to  tan  coloured  dolomite  is  the  most  abundant  alteration  mineral  at  Fekola.  Dolomite  occurs  in  the  main  phase  of  mineralization  within
veinlets and the matrix of breccias, but also appears to be part of a longer-lived, pervasive carbonate alteration that locally overprints foliation,
earlier alteration and mineralization (Ross, 2015). The extensive carbonate alteration overprints an earlier, pervasive, orangey-pink albite alteration.
An early stage of muscovite is associated with the development of the foliation fabrics, but it is mostly overprinted, first by albite-carbonate, then
carbonate-pyrite alteration. There is evidence of a minor late stage biotite alteration event, occurring with quartz-carbonate veinlets. Magnetite
occurs intermittently throughout the host stratigraphy, but the spatial relationship to gold mineralization is not yet fully understood.
Moderately pervasive, dark green (Fe-rich) chlorite and calcite veinlets that have been strongly transposed by foliation characterize the outermost
suite of alteration minerals at Fekola. Trace amounts of tourmaline are locally observed in strongly altered siltstone.
Multi-element  analyses  via  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ICP-MS)  and  portable  x-ray  fluorescence  (p-XRF)  show  weak,  but
positive correlations between Au and Mo, Cu, As, Co, Ni, Sr, Mg, Mn, Fe and S. Corresponding peaks in Sr, Mn and Au in an east-west profile
across the zone suggest that elements may be tracking Au-related dolomite-ankerite alteration (Figure 7.4.2).

The  Fekola  deposit  is  considered  to  be  an  example  of  an  orogenic-style  gold  deposit.  Global  examples  of  this  deposit  type  are  located  at
Kalgoorlie (Australia), Val d’Or (Quebec) and Ashanti (Ghana).
Orogenic gold deposits occur in variably deformed metamorphic terranes formed during compressive or transpressional deformation events at
convergent plate margins in collisional or accretionary orogens (Groves, et al, 2000) (Figure 8.1.1). Deposits are known from the Middle Achaean
to  younger  Precambrian  age,  and  throughout  the  Phanerozoic.  These  host  geological  environments  are  typically  volcano-plutonic  or  clastic
sedimentary terranes, but gold deposits can be hosted by any rock type. There is a consistent spatial and temporal association with granitoids of
a variety of compositions. Host rocks are typically metamorphosed to greenschist facies, but locally can achieve amphibolite or granulite facies
conditions.
Figure 8.1.1 Orogenic Deposits
Modified from Groves et al, 2000
Gold deposition occurs adjacent to first-order, major deformation zones, typically on the order of several hundreds of kilometres in strike, with a
width of up to several hundreds of metres. First order deformation zones commonly display multiple, complex deformation events. Economic
mineralization  is  typically  hosted  by  second  or  third  order  structures,  with  jogs,  changes  in  strike,  or  bifurcations  of  the  first-order  systems
providing favourable locations for fluid focusing (Weinberg et al., 2004). Fault intersections, fold hinge zones and other areas of low mean stress
may serve as areas favourable for mineralization.
Deposit-scale hydrothermal alteration typically displays a strong lateral zonation, the scale, intensity, and mineralogy of which are functions of
wall rock composition and level of crustal

emplacement  of  the  deposit.  The  main  alteration  minerals  include  carbonates  (calcite,  dolomite,  and  ankerite),  sulphides  (pyrite,  pyrrhotite  or
arsenopyrite),  alkali-rich  silicate  minerals  (sericite,  fuchsite,  albite,  and  less  commonly,  K-feldspar,  biotite,  paragonite),  chlorite,  and  quartz
(Groves, et al, 1993).
Mineralization can be disseminated, or vein hosted, and displays a timing that is kinematically late with respect to the deformation of the host
stratigraphy. Mineralization is also typically syn- to post-peak regional metamorphic conditions. Quartz is the primary constituent of veins, with
lesser  carbonate  and  sulphide  minerals.  Minor  accessory  minerals  including  albite,  chlorite,  white  mica  (fuchsite  in  ultramafic  host  rocks),
tourmaline, and scheelite can accompany the veins. Carbonates include calcite, dolomite, and ankerite.
Gold  in  orogenic  deposits  is  typically  associated  with  sulphide  minerals,  including  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  chalcopyrite,  galena,  sphalerite,  and
arsenopyrite, but can locally occur as free gold. In volcano-plutonic settings, pyrite and pyrrhotite are the most common sulphide minerals in
greenschist and amphibolite grade host rocks, respectively. Arsenopyrite can be the predominant sulphide mineral in mineralization hosted by
sedimentary rocks. Gold to silver ratios typically range from 10:1 to less commonly, as little as 1:1. Most orogenic gold deposits contain <2% to 5%
sulphide minerals and historically exhibit gold grades in the range of 5 to 30 g/t Au, although West African examples tend towards a lower 1 to 1.5
g/t Au mean grade, with local examples as high as approximately 10 g/t Au.
The mineralization/alteration footprints of some of the larger examples of orogenic deposits are in the order of 2 km, to much as 10 km long by
approximately 1 km wide, and can persist to depths of over 1 to 2 km vertical extents.
8.2
Comparison of Fekola to Loulo Gold Deposits
The Fekola deposit is south of a major mineral camp, known as the Loulo mining camp, which has been interpreted to contain two distinct deposit
types, termed Gara-style and Yalea-style. Based on Laurence et al. (2013) the key features of the two deposit styles are:
Gara-style:
•
•
the deposits typically occupy a narrow zone (<2 km wide) along the border with the Senegal-Mali shear zone and include ankerite-rich shear
vein stockworks and sulphide disseminations hosted in folded tourmalinized quartz wackes or as disseminated lodes along more discrete shear
structures (e.g. Gounkoto and Yalea North)
these deposits are typified by intensely metasomatized wall rock consisting of albite and multistage tourmaline alteration. Mineralized zones are
distinguished by Fe-rich sulphide assemblages (pyrite dominant), and polymetallic minor and trace phases including elevated concentrations of
P, LREE, Ni, Cu, and Co

•
Yalea-style:
•
•
the deposits are typically quartz ± carbonate vein lodes or sulphide stringer zones hosted in altered (tourmaline-absent) brittle-ductile shears that
developed approximately 8 km to the east of the Senegal-Mali shear zone
the mineralization is associated with high As values, with the As mainly occurring in the form of arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite. Deposits
typically  contain  extremely  low  base  and  rare  earth  metal  concentrations.  Wall-rock  alteration  is  characterized  by  carbonate-silica-chlorite-
sericite ± albite assemblages.
In comparison to these styles, Dorling (2013) notes the following for the Fekola mineralization:
•
•
•
At Fekola, gold mineralization is predominantly disseminated in nature, associated with an envelope of intensely metasomatized wall rock consisting
of dolomite and albite with only traces of tourmaline.
Gold at Fekola is associated with pyrite and lacks the Yalea-style association between gold mineralisation and arsenian pyrite, arsenopyrite and other
base metals.
Fekola alteration is dominated by dolomite, whereas the Loulo deposits are characterised by ankerite.
The similarities between the three deposit types include:
The strong sodic alteration observed at each deposit.
Prevailing greenschist-facies metamorphism at each deposit.
Metasedimentary host rocks at each deposit.
Located on the eastern side of the main controlling structure, the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone.

9.0 EXPLORATION
A light detection and ranging (LiDAR) survey was undertaken in 2012. The projection utilised for the whole project was UTM 29N, WGS84. The
EGM2008 Geoid Model was used to transform from ellipsoid heights to orthometric heights (metres above sea level). The survey has a contour
accuracy of ±0.5 m.
All drill hole locations are surveyed with a Leica 1230 DGPS.
9.2
Geological Mapping
Geological mapping is of limited use in the Project area, due to the minimal amount of outcrop, and the deep regolith cover. Regolith mapping was
undertaken to identify which portions of the tenure are covered by a lateritized in situ profile, as opposed to transported materials and alluvium,
which would allow reliable soil sampling. A recent compilation using a combination of drilling and geophysics is presented in Figure 9.2.1.

Geochemical Sampling
Soil geochemistry has proven to be an effective exploration tool in the search for gold mineralisation in some areas where there are residual soils.
This has broadly outlined anomalous areas that have been followed up. In areas of more complex regolith, particularly where there are transported
laterite,  alluvial  gravels  and  silt,  the  interpretation  of  soil  geochemistry  results  can  be  ambiguous  due  to  masking  or  suppressing  potentially
anomalous areas. For example, the Fekola deposit is largely blind to soil geochemistry due to a substantial portion of the deposit being covered
by transported palaeo-channel gravels and laterite.

In the early Papillon programs, soil samples were analysed for gold only. Recent geochemical work suggests that gold mineralisation may be
associated with elevated tungsten, copper and possibly arsenic values; however, the use of these pathfinder elements requires further evaluation.
Soil geochemical surveys have been completed in a number of phases with the initial focus around the Médinandi prospect and then extending
out across the area of the Médinandi Exploitation License. The soil sampling surveys consisted of the collection of material from small pits that
were typically excavated to 60 cm below surface on 80 m by 160 m spaced grid lines. Due to the regolith issues discussed above, B2Gold believe
that a more effective method is to sample the top of saprolite and plan to use auger drilling for the upcoming exploration programs in order to
obtain consistent and unambiguous samples.
Termite mound and rock chip and grab sampling has also been performed within the Médinandi Exploitation License, delivering inconclusive
results. The larger mounds with deeper extents are the preferred ones to sample.
The information in the B2Gold database for the Médinandi Exploitation License is summarized in Table 9.3.1. A compilation geochemical anomaly
plan for gold for the exploitation license is included as Figure 9.3.1.

A number of phases of geophysical surveys have been completed over the deposit and the exploitation license area, including in 2007, 2008,
2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 (Table 9.4.1).
The data have been used to develop the broad lithological and structural framework for the project area; however, no direct and distinct signature
for the Fekola deposit is currently recognised within any of the geophysical datasets. The most useful dataset acquired is the gradient array IP
data (Figure 9.4.1), which provides a good lithological contrast between units, as well as resolving project-scale structure.
The general lack of magnetite and low contrast between lithologies within the system reduces the efficacy of the airborne magnetic data (Figure
9.4.2). In addition, a lack of conductors within the lithological package hosting Fekola mineralisation has limited the effectiveness of the broad
bandwidth EM system used.

Schandl (2012)
In 2012, prior to much of the infill drilling on the Fekola deposit, Dr. Eva Schandl described a suite of 40 thin sections from the deposit to provide
information on the lithologies, mineralogy, and hydrothermal alteration. Results of the work included:
The  evaluation  identified  four  main  sedimentary  units:  schists,  sandstone  /  siltstone,  conglomerates  and  breccias,  and  arkose.  One  sample  was
tentatively identified as having a mafic protolith.
The sediment samples showed brecciation, fracturing and hydrothermal alteration. Secondary minerals such as quartz, carbonate, sericite, biotite, and
anhydrite were noted to replace the earlier minerals by fracture-filling and cross-cutting veins, as well as via dissolution and precipitation.
The mineralogy of the sediments was considered to be relatively simple, consisting predominantly of carbonate and quartz (hydrothermal and detrital).
Other minerals observed included biotite, muscovite, sericite and chlorite. Secondary minerals, in lesser quantities, consisted of anhydrite, tourmaline,
serpentine, and scapolite.
Early silicification is represented by the replacement of sedimentary carbonates by chalcedony, and late silicification, by the partial replacement of late
carbonate veins by aggregates by fine-grained chalcedony.
The average carbonate content of the Fekola sediments is 60% and some rocks contain 80 to 90% carbonates. Secondary carbonates occur mostly as
veins and as fracture-filling aggregates.
Very fine-grained biotite and sericite are abundant in the schists, where they define the rock fabric. Both frequently occur as anastomosing veins that
boudinage the quartz and carbonates. In some rocks, where biotite-rich laminae were part of the original sediments, the laminae are now fragmented
and the fractures are filled by fine-grained carbonate.

Pyrite is the dominant sulfide in the rocks, with a concentration that ranges from 0 to 6%. The relatively small grains are most abundant in the
siliceous calcareous rocks and breccias, where they appear to have been part of the original sediments. Although some mobilization was noted,
several of the pyrite are fragmented and have embayed, sutured grain boundaries, suggesting partial dissolution during hydrothermal alteration.
9.6.2
Pathfinder (2012 to 2013)
Pathfinder  Exploration  undertook  a  number  of  detailed  petrographic  analyses  on  thin  section  materials,  corroborated  with  PIMA  analyses  on
selected samples. Descriptions were provided of the major constituents of each sample, and a suggested protolith described.
9.6.3
Panterra Geoservices (2014)
Panterra examined 11 mineralised samples from Metallurgical drill holes drilled at Fekola.
Six of the samples were from a possible mudstone-siltstone protolith. The rest included a fine grained turbidite, a mylonite, one of a possible
volcanic protolith, a possible conglomerate and a meta-pelite.
The rocks are overprinted with 62 to 86% carbonate and between 5 to 20% quartz content and dolomite alteration is carbonate of dolomitic or Mg-
Fe composition.
A precursor albite + carbonate alteration is overprinted by more intense carbonate.
Pyrite is closely associated with intense carbonate alteration.

Exploration Potential
9.7.1
Fekola Deposit
The Fekola deposit remains open at depth. Additional areas which will warrant future exploration effort include:
•
•
•
Down plunge of the main high grade zone where a step out hole (FKD_148, drilled by B2Gold), intersected significant mineralization where expected.
Mineralised structures in the footwall and hanging wall of the main mineralization.
Potential for new plunging high grade zones along strike of the main high grade zone where narrower intersections have been intersected at shallow
depths.
9.7.2
Exploration Targets
Figure 9.3.1 shows the gold anomalism identified through geochemical sampling. Figure 9.7.1 shows the results of exploration drilling, presented
as grade–thickness contours. Both plots indicate areas of gold anomalism that may be able to support additional exploration focus.

A further analysis of the data generated by previous work highlighted new and existing areas for further exploration. This exploration will include a
200 m x 200 m auger program to test the top of saprolite.
Fadougou NE prospect is along strike from the Fekola deposit and potentially represents an analog target to Fekola. Wide spaced and relatively
shallow RC drilling in this area has confirmed anomalous gold intersections beneath laterite cover.
The Tintiba anomaly was identified as a structural target based on geophysical data. Two trenches, excavated 120 m apart, returned significantly
elevated gold values. The trench anomalism is supported by elevated gold values returned from soil and pit sampling. An auger drilling program
is scheduled this year to refine the target before follow up drilling is undertaken, if warranted.
The Médinandi prospect was initially delineated as a large gold-in-soil anomaly. However, follow-up work undertaken by Papillon suggests the
anomaly may be an artifact of artisanal mining activity and not be related to a cohesive mineralized structure.
Betakili is a structural target derived from geophysical data interpretation.

The exploration completed to date has been appropriate, leading to the discovery of the Fekola deposit. The soil sampling was representative of some
of the areas sampled, however in the future, auger drilling through the laterite and alluvial cover would aid in covering all the areas with geochemical
sampling.
The potential for extending the Fekola main deposit down plunge is good.
A better understanding of the Fekola deposit, its location in a regional and local context with respect to lithologies, alteration, structure and regolith, will
generate additional targets and enable their ranking for follow up.

Introduction
10.0 DRILLING
Some drilling was done on the Médinandi Exploitation License before 2007, previous to Papillon’s ownership (refer to Section 6). The historic
drilling and drill sampling are not considered part of the current active database, and are not used in support of the Mineral Resource estimates.
The working drill database, current as of 24 January 2015, focuses on drilling undertaken by B2Gold, Papillon and its predecessor companies
from January 2007 to January 2015. Within the database are a total of 1,261 RC drillholes (145,287 m), 62 holes that commenced with an RC collar
but were completed with a core tail (RC–DD) drillholes (18,727.8 m), and 190 core drillholes (50,832.8 m).
In addition are included 25 Water Boreholes (2,115.1 m) which were drilled using RC methods plus 29 core holes (2,437.25 m) and 25 RC holes
(2,001 m) that have been classified as Geotechnical holes.
Also RAB drilling (1,166 holes; 24,115 m), aircore drilling (300 holes, 11,257 m), and trenching (seven trenches, 273 m) were completed as part of
early exploration efforts and are not used in support of Mineral Resource estimates.
The drill programs are summarized by prospect area in Table 10.2.1 and by year in Table 10.2.2; drill collar locations coloured by drill type are
shown in Figure 10.2.1.
Drilling as of 24 January 2015 within the Fekola deposit area totals 76,228.9 m of RC (554 drillholes), 18,727.8 m of RC-DD (62 drillholes), and
47,820.6 m of core (170 drillholes). This drilling is shown in Figure 10.2.2.
10.2
Legacy Drilling
Very limited information is available on the logging and surveying practices used prior to 2010. Colonial Resources (2010) notes that drillhole
collars were surveyed using a hand held global positioning instrument (GPS).

Note: RC = reverse circulation; RC-DD is RC pre-collar and diamond core tail; RAB = rotary air blast, AC = aircore.
Hydrology holes and some Geotechnical holes are included in RC drilling and the remaining Geotechnical holes are included in DDH drilling
Since the last August 2013 update there has been a re organisation of geographical limits of drilling area which has caused some discrepancy in
the amounts per prospect area.

Drill Data for January 2013 PEA Mineral Resource Estimate (as at 15 January 2013)
A total of 428 drillholes (80,969 m) was available at the database cut-off date of 15 January 2013 that was used for the January 2013 PEA mineral
resource  estimate.  Only  RC,  core  and  core  with  RC  pre-collars  were  used  in  support  of  the  January  2013  PEA  Mineral  Resource  estimate.  A

Drill Data for August 2013 Mineral Resource Estimate Update (as at 5 August 2013)
A total of 643 drillholes (127,148 m) was available at the data cut-off date of 5 August 2013 for the August 2013 Mineral Resource estimate update.
As in the previous estimate, RC, core, and core with RC pre-collars were used in the estimate. A summary of the number of holes and meterage by
drilling type used in the August 2013 update is shown in Table 10.4.1 and displayed on Figure 10.3.1.
An additional 215 drillholes were available at the time of the August 2013 Mineral Resource estimate update as compared to the January 2013
Mineral Resource estimate; however, only 56 of these holes (approximately 17,020 m) are within the immediate Fekola mineral resource estimate
limits. The holes drilled close to the limits of the January 2013 resource supported the interpretations in the January 2013 PEA Mineral Resource
estimate as to grade and geological continuity, and extended the mineralization down plunge.

Drill Data for February 2015 Mineral Resource Estimate Update (as at January 24, 2015)
A total of 806 drillholes (143,372.98 m) were available at the data cut-off date of January 24, 2015 for the February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate
update. As in the previous  estimate,  RC,  core,  and  core  with  RC  pre-collars  were  used  in  the  estimate.  Water  boreholes  and  holes  drilled  for
geotechnical purposes were also included. A summary of the number of holes and meterage by drilling type used in the February 2015 update is
shown in Table 10.5.1 and displayed on Figure 10.3.1.
An additional 11 drillholes were available (after the 24 January cut-off date) at the time of the February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate update and
all of these holes (322.1 m) are within the immediate Fekola mineral resource estimate limits. All holes recently drilled are infill on existing sections
at 40 m x 40 m spacing for resource estimation purposes and drilled to confirm grade and geological continuity.

Drill contractors
Colonial Resources (2010) indicated that the Randgold drilling was performed by West African Drilling Services (WADS), based out of Bamako.
The majority of the drilling was on the Fadougou Main Zone and Fadougou NE.
Boart Longyear, Forage FTE drilling and African Mining Services (AMS) have provided drill rigs during the Papillon / Songhoi drill campaigns, with
AMS currently the preferred contractor.
10.7
Papillon / B2Gold Drill Methods
10.7.1
Auger, Rotary Air Blast and Aircore
Exploration drilling has employed Auger, RAB and aircore methods as a first pass evaluation of gold-in-soil anomalies.
10.7.2
Reverse Circulation
RC  drilling  used  face  sampling  hammer  techniques  rather  than  conventional  RC  methods  where  possible.  Bit  sizes  during  the  2012  to  2014
programs  included  130  mm,  133  mm,  and  137  mm  with  a  127  mm  bit  being  used  occasionally.  The  bit  size  used  depended  on  the  ground
conditions and the progress of the hole. The sample weights at Fekola using these bit sizes are between 35 kg and 50 kg for a metre sample. A
drill collar casing is typically used in the first 6 m of the drillhole to stop cave in and maintain good workable access to the drillhole.
Drill chips are collected at 1 m intervals during drilling and placed in chip trays. Trays are labelled with the prospect area, drillhole number and
metre from–to interval.
During some programs at Fekola, significant water was encountered during drilling at approximately 40 to 60 m depth.
RC chips are stored in lidded, plastic core trays, most of which are kept in a shipping container / shed at site.

10.7.3
Core Drilling
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 10.12
Some of the core drilling for recent programs is performed using a RC collar with a core tail. Typically the change over occurs at depths of around
180m, but has been anywhere from between 40 m and 250 m, depending on depth to mineralisation.
Drilling difficulties can be encountered when penetrating the transported alluvial gravel that sits above the in situ weathered rock; this is normally
countered by casing the hole with removable steel casing to just beyond this layer. Drillholes may also “lift” due to rock conditions at depth. There
are also issues with “drifting” of holes which is mitigated by decreasing rotation speed. Downhole surveys are conducted every 30 m to monitor
the dip and drift using a reflex (EZ-track) instrument.
Drill sizes include PQ (85 mm diameter), HQ (63.5 mm diameter) and NQ core (47.6 mm diameter). PQ core is typically used from the surface down
to a few metres into hard rock in areas known to be clay rich, with paleochannel, and for geotechnical purposes. HQ3 core (triple tube method) is
usually used in areas of broken ground for good recovery of core for structural orientations. HQ2 is used in areas of more competent ground.
Transportation of the core from the site to the sample yard is the geologist’s responsibility. Lids are used on core boxes if travelling a large
distance or over rough ground.
10.8
Papillon/B2Gold Geological Logging
Papillon developed a set geological legend for the Project area, and used this for trench, core, drill chip and surface mapping. The lithological rock
types covered in the geological code include surface, sedimentary, igneous, and altered rock, metamorphic and tectonic lithologies. Logging
definitions and standards were regularly reviewed for appropriateness for Fekola. The sampling by Papillon, previously was standardized at 1 m
intervals.  Recent  sampling  is  also  generally  to  1  m  intervals,  but  bounded  by  geological  considerations  with  a  minimum  sampling  width  of
samples >0.2 m by B2Gold.
Following an extensive review of the core and existing logging codes, B2Gold is in the process of enhancing the logging systems to incorporate
the inclusion of all relevant geological data that will further improve the geological understanding of the deposit. This effort is ongoing and draws
significantly on an assessment of the key parameters noted by Papillon geologists that have contributed to the geological model that informs the
current Mineral Resource estimate.
Table 10.8.1 summarizes the types of lithological information collected.

RC
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 10.14
RC drilling is rapid, with typically a minimum of 150 m achievable per shift, compared to 30 m to 40 m with Diamond Core.
At 180 m depth, typically a booster compressor is needed to go deeper for obtaining clean sample. In many cases, it is more cost effective and a
better sample is obtained by continuing with Core from this depth.
Logging of RC chips at the drill rig is done at the chip tray and not from the chip boxes. The basic geological log includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Primary lithology.
Alteration.
Mineralisation.
Oxidation boundaries.
Sample quality.
Depth of water inflow (estimation of rates).
Wet samples.
Veining.
Texture.
Fabric.
Presence of key minerals.
Grain size (from grain size chart).
Areas of slow or hard drilling are marked onto the drill logs for geotechnical purposes.
Samples are placed onto the ‘sample table’ at the rig and photographed to provide a record of the general samples encountered. The table is
photographed wet and dry (Figure 10.8.1) with the drillhole number and interval in metres displayed at the top of the chip sample table.

At Fekola the core is marked up with orientation lines and structurally logged at the rig by a geologist, then brought back to the yard and labelled
with sample numbers and cut lines drawn. Photography is done at the core yard under controlled ‘indoor’ conditions so that photographs are
consistent in quality.
Core is typically photographed both wet and dry (Figure 10.8.2), prior to the core being sawed in half, sampled and bagged. For geotechnical
cored holes the re-assembled runs are also photographed at the rig prior to transport.

10.8.4
Exploration-stage Geotechnical Logging
Standard geotechnical logging on exploration and infill drill core collects information on fracture frequency and rock quality designation (RQD).
Core is oriented for structural data collection, and both a goniometer and “rocket launcher” (spear) can be used. The structural geology logging
sheet is used to record linear and planar structural features observed within the hole as either point or broad structural zones. The following
features are recorded:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Veining.
Layering.
Foliation.
Faulting.
Lithological contacts.
Joints.
Lineations.
10.8.5
Magnetic Susceptibility
The measuring of magnetic susceptibility (magsus) is one of the final stages of the logging process and takes place once the geological structural
logging and sometimes even the core has been cut and sampled. The readings are taken every meter from start of hole to end of hole.
10.9
Recovery
The average core recovery is 97.2% for all drilling and is also 97.2% for holes completed within the Fekola deposit area. There does not appear to
be a direct relationship between core recovery and gold grade for Fekola.
10.10
Collar Surveys
Drill collars for exploration drillholes are normally surveyed using a handheld GPS instrument.
In the deposit area, drillhole collars are picked up using a differential GPS, which has an accuracy of ± 10 cm.
There is a base station on the Médinandi camp that is used as a reference for all surveys done on the Project. Throughout the Project area there
are survey reference points that are used as a known reference for the collar surveys. These are included into the round of surveying when
surveying new drill collars.

Downhole Surveys
10.11.1
RC
Depending on ground conditions, and the purpose of the drillhole, RC holes are typically surveyed at 30 to 50 m intervals down hole, using a
Reflex down hole surveying rod. If the hole begins to lift / dip the hole can be surveyed at the end of each rod.
10.11.2
Core
Surveys are performed using a Reflex downhole survey (EZ-Track) instrument, with measurements taken at 30 to 50 m intervals down hole. As
with the RC drilling, if the hole begins to lift / dip the hole can be surveyed at the end of each rod. Deviation is constantly monitored, and, for
example  if  at  the  start  of  a  300  m  hole  and  in  the  first  50  to  100  m  there  is  significant  deviation,  the  hole  may  be  abandoned  and  a  re-drill
undertaken nearby. As an additional check holes are now surveyed every 6 m on exit, after finishing the hole.
10.12
Condemnation, Geotechnical and Hydrogeological Drilling
Geotechnical  boreholes  were  completed  using  traditional  wire  line  triple  tube  drilling,  typically  starting  at  the  ground  surface  using  PQ  sized
tooling and telescoping down to HQ size core around 230 m depth.
Borehole locations and orientations targeted primarily the interpreted structural features and the final pit slopes, to complement the information
previously collected within the mineralized zones.
The following parameters were routinely recorded as part of the geotechnical logging:
Rock type and geotechnical description.
Total core recovery (TCR).
RQD.
Fracture frequency.
Weathering / alteration.
Discontinuity type.
Discontinuity orientation.
Discontinuity properties.
Joint condition rating (Jcon).

Geotechnical logging was carried out for each drill run or for separate geotechnical intervals within a drill run. Bieniawski’s rock mass rating (RMR
6) was used to assess the overall quality of the rock to be exposed in the proposed open pit.
Four geotechnical rock units were defined:
•
•
•
•
SQR: pink quartzitic schists.
SST: sandstone.
ARG: argillite.
JSP: jasper.
All geotechnical rock unit types were tested using uniaxial (unconfined) compressive strength (UCS) and tri-axial methods.
Minor water bore drilling has been undertaken. Some condemnation drilling in the areas planned for infrastructure has also been completed.
Figure 10.12.1 shows the locations of the geotechnical holes and test pits, and also presents the locations of water bore drilling and other drilling
types (e.g. condemnation holes).

Sample Length / True Thickness
Most of the drillholes at Fekola are drilled at -50 to -55° to the east (N90 E) which intersects the main mineralized zone at a high angle. The higher
grade mineralisation strikes approximately north–south, is steeply dipping 70 to 80° to the west, and plunges shallowly to the north. In general,
true thicknesses are 70 to 80% of the sampled length.
Table  10.14.1  provides  a  selection  of  drill  intercepts  that  have  been  returned  from  the  Fekola  deposit.  The  table  illustrates  the  various  grade
ranges that have been encountered in the deposit and provides examples of the estimated true thickness of intercepts in relation to the drilled
thickness.

Drilling Since Completion of Resource Estimates
Drilling has continued after the February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate update and until 13 March 2015. A total of 155 holes (5,263 m) were
drilled. Of this total, there are 11 core holes (3,770.2 m), 54 Aircore holes (974 m) and 90 Auger holes (792 m).
Of the total number of holes drilled in this period, 11 holes (3,770.2 m) were infill holes drilled for resource estimation within the Fekola area, 54
aircore holes (974 m) were drilled for assessment of the grade variation within the saprolite across the pit and are close spaced (20 m) and the 90
Auger holes (792 m) were for exploration over prospective areas of the Médinandi licence.
The drilling from this period is shown on Figure 10.15.1. All of the core holes are infill and located within the proposed Fekola pit area. Preliminary
results from this drilling support the February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate.

Comments on Section 10
In the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the lithological, collar, and downhole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill
programs completed, are sufficient to support Mineral Resource estimation and mine planning as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Core logging meets industry standards for gold exploration.
Collar surveys have been performed using industry standard instrumentation.
Downhole surveys were performed using industry standard instrumentation.
Recovery data from core drill programs are acceptable.
Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style, and have been drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of
mineralization for the bulk of the deposit area.
Drill orientations are shown in the example cross sections included in Section 7, and can be seen to appropriately test the mineralization.

Sample Preparation and Analysis
11.1.1
RC Drilling Samples
RC sampling is carried out by collection of samples through a cyclone into plastic bags.
Samples collected from the rig are brought back to the Fekola camp sample yard. On arrival they are allocated an area depending on sample type
and quantity. RC sample bags are placed in down-hole order. The RC samples are collected in batches of approximately 10 sample bags per trip,
depending on the speed of the drilling of that particular drillhole.
Sample splitting at the Fekola camp sample yard involves the use of a cone or riffle splitter and a three-tier split. The entire sample must fit in one
tray and the number of riffles are maximised (i.e. splitters with a few wide riffles are less effective). The cutter (riffle) width is at least three times the
maximum particle size (95% passing).
The target sample weight is 1.5 to 2 kg. If the resultant sample material is under the target weight, the technicians collect whatever available sample
there is from the split and that will be dispatched to the laboratory.
Where the cuttings are moist or wet, they are collected into a large calico bag to enable drying before splitting. If a preliminary sample is required, a
sub-sample is collected.
Library samples are collected at the riffle splitter and are the resultant sample that is left after the second split. The library sample is kept as a
permanent record of the original sample for that interval. The library samples are kept for 12 months after splitting as a reference source if any
repeat analytical work is needed.
11.1.2
Diamond Drilling Samples
When a drillhole is selected for sampling a technician goes to the core or sample bags for that drillhole and checks that the depth corresponds to
the recorded drillhole depth before allocating sample identification numbers (IDs) for each interval. The sample allocation sheet moves through
the sample process, from allocating sample numbers for individual intervals when splitting and cutting, through to sample dispatch.
Core trays returning from the rig are placed in order of drillhole ID and box number on the core tray stands for the geologist to begin logging the
core. If the stands are full, the core trays are placed in the designated area in order of drillhole ID and box number until the geologist has finished
logging the previous hole and the trays can be moved for further core processing.
A saw cutting line is drawn on the core as a solid red line, and positioned to give symmetry to the sampling. When the core is cut it is split such
that there are two half-core pieces that have symmetrical structures or mineralisation.

Core is typically sampled on 1 m average intervals with breaks at lithological contacts and alteration boundaries.
11.1.3
Metallurgical Sampling
Samples used in the Nagrom August 2012 metallurgical test-work were sourced from a  1⁄4-split of HQ-sized core. Samples for the Amdel February
2013  metallurgical  test-work  had  several  sources  including   1⁄2-split of HQ-sized drill core with the exception of composites 1 to 3 which were
sourced from sample rejects, and composite 4 which was from the test-work done at Nagrom in 2012. Samples used in the ALS test-work in 2014
and SGS Lakefield test-work in 2015 (run by B2Gold) were sourced from split or dedicated whole HQ-sized core.
11.1.4
Analytical and Test Laboratories
The analytical laboratories used to date are independent commercial laboratories.
From January 2011 to June 2013, the primary laboratory was SGS Kayes, in Mali. Assays from SGS Kayes are the primary support for the January
2013 PEA Mineral Resource estimate, the August 2013 Mineral Resource estimate update, and the current B2Gold Mineral Resource estimate
update.
The SGS Kayes facility was closed in mid 2013, and samples were subsequently sent to SGS Bamako in Mali from November 2013. SGS Bamako
is the current primary laboratory.
SGS Morila in southern Mali has been used as a secondary laboratory. Primary samples are sent there periodically, and SGS Morila has also
occasionally been used for umpire (check) sampling.
Bureau Veritas, Ivory Coast, is currently used as a secondary laboratory and for umpire analyses. Samples selected for multi-element analysis are
also shipped through the Ivory Coast laboratory to Bureau Veritas / Acme Vancouver.
Currently there are no commercial minerals laboratories that are fully accredited under ISO17025 in West Africa.
SGS advised that SGS Bamako is currently being assessed by SANAS under ISO17025. The SGS Kayes and SGS Morila laboratories operated a
quality system that SGS considered to be in line with ISO17025 requirements.
Bureau Veritas advised that the Ivory Coast laboratory is currently operating to the guidelines of ISO9001 and ISO17025 protocols in accordance
with procedures specified within the Bureau Veritas group. The laboratory is currently working on the documentation required to formally have
ISO certification in place.
Table 11.1.1 provides a summary of each laboratory’s Project involvement by analysis type and year performed, where this is known.

Standards
Five standards are currently in circulation at the project, and cover material from low to high grades. A total of 19 different standards have been
employed on the project. Sixteen of these standards, representing ~98% of the population, are Geostats Pty Ltd CRMs. Standards have been
inserted  at  a  rate  of  1  in  20  samples.  The  standard  insertion  frequency  was  modified  in  February  of  2015  to  1  in  38  samples  to  suit  the  SGS
Bamako oven batch size.
11.2.3
Blanks
Coarse  blanks  are  submitted  with  each  batch  of  samples  sent  to  the  laboratory.  The  blank  material  is  either  collected  by  B2Gold  (previously
Papillon) employees from a location known to be devoid of any mineralization or purchased from a reputable supplier. The non-commercial blank
material is collected from barren sandstone material in Kéniéba and is processed on site at Fekola. The blank insertion rate is one in every 20
samples. The blank insertion frequency was modified in February of 2015 to 1 in 38 samples to suit the SGS Bamako oven batch size.

Duplicate Samples
Figure 11.2.1 Sample Preparation Flowsheet
Four types of duplicates are run at Fekola to assess the precision of the sampling method and assay analyses; field duplicates (primary sample
split, FDUP), pulp duplicates (second split of pulp, SDUP), lab repeats (second fire of primary pulp split, RDUP), and external umpires (secondary
lab analysis of pulp reject, UMP). The systematic insertion of preparation duplicates (coarse reject split, PREPDUP) into the core sample stream
was implemented in February 2015. Prior to February 2015, preparation duplicates were only taken from the metallurgical test hole FK_MET05.
Field duplicates at Fekola have been inserted at a frequency of one duplicate every 33 samples. The duplicate is collected from the second split at
the RC chip splitter or from quartered core. Core field duplicate insertion frequency was halved in February 2015 with the implementation of core
preparation duplicates.
Pulp Duplicates and Lab repeats are reported at a minimum frequency of 1 in 76 samples (1 per oven batch). The actual insertion frequency
greatly exceeds the minimum (~2 in 76 and ~5 in 76 respectively).

Umpire  assays  are  available  for  about  1.5%  of  the  assays  contributing  to  the  current  Mineral  Resource  estimate  update.  The  relatively  low
population of umpire assays related to the resource prior to January of 2015 prompted a check umpire submittal in February of 2015. This recent
submittal represents about 4% of all assays contributing to the current Mineral Resource estimate update from holes for which there was no
existing umpire data and for samples where the original assay grade was greater than 0.25 ppm Au. Umpire assaying procedures have been
modified to reflect B2Gold’s standard operating procedure of quarterly submittals of ~8% of significant assays.
11.2.5
Magnetic Susceptibility
Magnetic  susceptibility  is  measured  with  a  Terraplus  /  Georadis  KT-10  Magnetic  Susceptibility  Meter.  A  section  of  core  with  known  magnetic
susceptibility is used at the start of the drillhole and at the end of the drillhole. Two readings are taken from the core with known values on both
sides. A duplicate reading is taken every 1:10 samples. The QAQC data is reviewed periodically. There are 65,264 magnetic susceptibility readings
within the database related to holes contributing to the current Mineral Resource estimate update.
11.2.6
Density
A core piece with known weight is used for reference sample readings that are taken at the start of the process and every 25th reading to ensure
standard operating procedures are being followed, and weighing scales are being managed correctly. Duplicate density readings are taken every
10th sample in the drillhole.
11.3
ICP Analysis
Multi-element analysis was performed by Bureau Veritas and its predecessor company, ACME, using an aqua regia digest, with an inductively-
coupled plasma finish. Approximately 3,537 multi-element analyses, related to the current resource drilling, are available in the database.
11.4
Density Analysis
B2Gold  (following  Papillon)  uses  the  water  immersion  method  on  drill  core  as  a  standard  procedure  for  measuring  density  of  rock  with  low
porosity. Measurements are done on air dried whole core samples, typically 10 to 20 cm long. Sample frequency has increased from one sample
per 20 to 30 m under Papillon to one sample per 5 m under B2Gold. For near-surface oxidised units, or where core was extremely porous, the
volumetric method was occasionally used.
Bulk density is measured by weighing the sample in air and water, and using the formula:
Mair / (Mair-Mwater) = d
Where, Mair = mass of the sample in air in grams;
Mwater = mass of the sample in water in grams.

Density by Depth
The  current  database  contains  a  total  of  2,057  original  density  measurements  related  to  drilling  contributing  to  the  current  Mineral  Resource
estimate.  Four  of  these  points  are  characterized  as  completely  weathered  or  highly  weathered  and  have  been  excluded  from  the  evaluation
population. Density values are summarized by depth from the topographic surface in Table 11.4.1 and on Figure 11.4.1, which support previous
observations that there is little variation in density with depth beyond the weathered zone.

Density by Rock Type
Table 11.4.2 presents average density by lithology for dominant lithologies. The population has been filtered to fresh (un-weathered) samples
only. The density is quite consistent within the clastic sediments. The MIN unit and the highly dolomitized CCR and SIT tend to have a slightly
higher density.

An Olympus Innov-X Delta portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) instrument and workstation is used to determine relative concentrations of various
elements within sample pulp rejects. Historically, samples were scanned through the kraft paper bag in which the pulp was returned from the
assay laboratory. It was subsequently determined that this process results in significant signal attenuation. Results from this earlier process have
been rejected in the database.

The pulps are being re-scanned through a thin plastic film sachet. This process is ongoing. Of the ~28,000 valid raw XRF results in the database,
~12,500 are from samples contributing to the current resource update.
The XRF scanning sequence incorporates blanks, commercially available standards, and duplicates.
The process of preparing matrix matched standards from deposit material is underway. These samples will be used to determine calibration /
correction curves that may be applied to the raw data to more accurately reflect absolute concentrations.
The captured data is stored within the drillhole database in its raw/uncorrected format.
11.6
Sample Security
Sample security measures include moving RC samples and core from the drill site to the Fekola camp yard at the end of each drill shift and
tracking of sample shipments using industry-standard procedures. B2Gold is of the opinion that core storage is secure because the camp is
remote, access is strictly controlled and a B2Gold (previously Papillon) representative has always been in the camp.
11.7
Sample Storage
Pulp rejects are returned from the assay lab to site. Pulps are stored in bar-coded kraft paper pulp bags within cardboard pulp trays/boxes within
shipping containers allocated for that purpose.
Drill core is stacked in open-sided sheds.
RC drill chips are stored in lidded, plastic core trays, most of which are kept in a shipping container / shed. The first tier RC split is referred to as a
library sample, and is stored in the Fekola camp yard for 12 months prior to discard.

Project Drillhole Database
11.8.1
Procedures Prior to January 2015
Prior to January of 2015 the project drillhole database was managed remotely by IoGlobal in Perth, WA. All of the drillhole data contributing to the
current resource update was originally managed in the IoGlobal system which was implemented in August 2010. FKRC_008, the Fekola discovery
hole, was drilled in December 2010, so all data from holes drilled by Papillon in the resource area was managed in the ioGlobal system.
The data flow outlined below is specific to the IoGlobal procedures in place prior to January of 2015. Figure 11.8.1 is a Project data flowsheet.

All field data at Fekola is initially captured on paper. Data entry personnel enter the data into a series of Excel templates with extensive pick-lists
and validation rules. The drill geologist checks the digital file against the paper original and the original hole proposal. The data is imported into
Micromine for a first-stage validation. This stage checks that drillhole collars are plotting in the correct locations and that loaded drillhole data is
complete. The original paper capture forms are filed on site.

The  data  was  uploaded  to  the  Papillon  SharePoint.  IoGlobal  had  access  to  the  folder  location  on  the  Papillon  SharePoint  and  were  able  to
download the prepared data files. IoGlobal imported the data into the Papillon database; during this process the data was validated. If there were
any issues with the data, ioGlobal highlighted the issues to the database manager for correction. Exports from the ioGlobal database were in
Access format. The updated database was loaded on the ioHub; this is the ioGlobal cloud-based data transfer location. The database manager
subsequently downloaded the updated database from the ioHub.
Assay data was received from SGS and sent directly to ioGlobal by the database manager for merging into the Access database. Once merged the
assay data was sent back to Papillon as part of the Access database. At this stage a QAQC report was generated to validate the assays from SGS,
and if there were errors the database manager queried this with the laboratory (see also Section 12).
Once the database manager had addressed all errors and problems highlighted by ioGlobal and the QAQC report, the database was handed over
to the managing geologist for import into Micromine software for further analysis.
11.8.2
Procedures Post-January 2015
The transition to onsite / in-house database management was completed in January of 2015 by B2Gold employees. The database is currently
managed onsite in the B2Gold standard database format. The data flow has not changed substantially except for the elimination of the remote
hosting.
As  with  the  IoGlobal  system,  all  field  data  at  Fekola  is  initially  captured  on  paper.  Data  entry  personnel  enter  the  data  into  a  series  of  Excel
templates with extensive pick-lists and validation rules. The drill geologist checks the digital file against the paper original. The data is imported
into Micromine for a first-stage validation. This stage checks that drillhole collars are plotting in the correct locations and that loaded drillhole data
is complete. This process is overseen by the database manager. The original paper capture forms are filed by drillhole.
The onsite database manager, a geologist, imports the data into a purpose built MS-Access database, and checks the data by inspection and with
validation queries built into the database.
Assay data is imported as text, retaining the original lab codes, and is translated to numeric values within the database. Assay results are not
associated with samples until the results have been QAQC vetted. Assay results for blanks and standards are compared with expected results via
queries in the database. Subsequent to QAQC validation assays are assigned a Passing (1) or Failing (3) priority. Failed assays are excluded from
database exports.
Export subsets, in the same MS-Access format as the IoGlobal exports, are generated by macros within the database. These files are created and
published to an online file transfer portal subsequent to any significant change within the database.
The database includes QAQC reporting utilities to facilitate tracking standard and blank performance, duplicate precision, and analytical bias.
QAQC data is reviewed on a continuous basis as data is imported into the database. Comprehensive QAQC reports are generated and reviewed
by senior staff on a monthly basis.

The entire database is backed up to an online file transfer portal twice weekly. These backups are downloaded and stored on the B2Gold file
server in Vancouver on a regular basis.
Digital photos are stored on the site server and identified by drilling method and drillhole ID. Each drillhole is photographed wet and dry, and the
picture is named with drillhole ID and interval. Digital images are backed up to a separate location to the primary database.

Comments on Section 11
In the opinion of the QP’s:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Sample collection, preparation, analysis and security for RC and core drill programs are in line with industry-standard methods for gold deposits.
Drill programs included insertion of blank, duplicate, and standard reference material samples.
QAQC methods are practiced during magnetic susceptibility and specific gravity measurement programs, which are industry leading practices.
QAQC program results do not indicate any problems with the analytical programs (refer to discussion in Section 12).
Data is subject to validation, which includes checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology data, and assay data. The checks are appropriate, and
consistent with industry standards (refer to discussion in Section 12).
All core and RC chips have been catalogued and stored in designated areas.
The QP is of the opinion that the quality of the gold analytical data is sufficiently reliable to support Mineral Resource estimation without limitations
on Mineral Resource confidence categories.

Papillon / B2Gold Data Checks
Data Entry
All field data at Fekola is initially captured on paper. Data entry personnel enter the data into a series of Excel templates with extensive pick-lists
and data validation rules. The drill geologist checks the digital file against the paper original and the original drillhole proposal.
The data is then imported into Micromine for a first-stage validation. This stage checks that the drillhole collar is plotting in the expected location
with the correct geometry and that the drillhole data is complete.
Prior to the January 2015 database management system change, subsequent to initial validation and correction, the template was placed in the
‘prepared’  templates  folder.  The  database  manager  would  check  the  prepared  templates  and  load  them  to  the  Papillon  SharePoint  folder  for
ioGlobal to download. Once the template was loaded to SharePoint the template was moved from the prepared folder to the ‘sent templates’ folder.
Subsequent to the January 2015 database management system change by B2Gold, the data is imported directly into the onsite drillhole database
for additional validation checks after the initial Micromine validation.
QAQC
QAQC data is reviewed on a continuous basis as data is imported into the database. Comprehensive QAQC reports are generated and reviewed
by senior staff on a monthly basis. Actions prompted by the review are implemented, and again reviewed at the end of the following month.
Papillon employed the following tolerances as the basis for evaluation of the QAQC data:
The laboratory Certified Reference Material (CRM) or standard checks should have a normal distribution since the analyses are done and compared
on the same standard. A 5% tolerance is given either side of the expected mean of the CRM. This provides a visual guide for where the data should be
plotting. Samples falling outside the ±5% are reviewed individually. In theory, approximately 5% of results fall outside the expected limits.
Approximately  62%  of  the  values  should  lie  within  one  standard  deviation  of  the  mean,  with  approximately  95%  of  values  within  two  standard
deviations or 5% and 99% should fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

NI 43-101 - DATA VERIFICATION
Any outliers are investigated. Instances that are significantly outside the tolerance lines are investigated in the following order of assumption:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Was the sample number incorrectly assigned?
Sample handling errors – laboratory mix up of samples or sample numbers.
Grades of neighbouring samples and CRMs reviewed to determine if values fall within the expected CRM range.
The laboratory is requested to review its internal QAQC.
Consideration is given to re-analysing surrounding samples.
If there are three or more CRMs that are considered outliers, the batch is considered for re-analysing.
QAQC data reviews include:
•
•
•
•
•
Standard plots: assay standard values are compared against expected values for each standard; assay values are compared against the expected null
value for blanks.
Correlation plots: original assay data are compared to repeat assay data.
Scatter plots: compare field duplicates and laboratory duplicates against the original sample.
Target plots: used to measure accuracy and precision of CRMs.
Check laboratory comparison plots: umpire samples are plotted against assay results from the primary laboratory.
B2Gold’s QAQC Procedures
With the transition to onsite / in-house database management B2Gold QAQC validation rules have been implemented:
•
A standard analysis more than three standard deviations (SD) from the expected value constitutes a failure (3SDHIGH or 3SDLOW).
A standard analysis more than three standard deviations (SD) from the expected value constitutes a failure (3SDHIGH or 3SDLOW).
A standard analysis between two and three standard deviations from the expected value generates a warning (WARNHIGH or WARNLOW).
Two sequential standards more than 2SD from the expected value on the same side of the expected value constitute a bias failure. (BIASHIGH,
BIASLOW).
•
•

•
•
The published standard deviation of artificial standards is often very small (as a percentage of the expected value). B2Gold employs limits based on
the published standard deviation or 3.33% of the expected value whichever is greater. This practice is based on the verbal advice of Dr. Barry W.
Smee, Ph.D., P.Geo. (Smee and Associates Consulting Ltd). The published standard deviation has been employed for the majority (17 of 19) of the
standards employed by Papillon. AUSK_1 (35 instances) and Si54 (16 instances) use a calculated SD of 3.33%.
Blank analyses generate warnings at five times the method detection limit and failures when they exceed 10 times the method detection limit.
The treatment of failures is similar to that previously employed by Papillon. The failure is evaluated in context of the surrounding samples and
standards  to  determine  if  the  failure  is  possibly  the  result  of  a  standard  or  blank  misidentification  or  if  the  failure  is  possibly  the  result  of  a
laboratory mix up of samples or sample numbers. Sample weights, assays, and Z-scores (deviation of the analysis from the expected value in
terms of number of standard deviations) are all used to aid this type of evaluation.
If it is not possible to determine, with reasonable certainty, that the failure is the result of a standard substitution error or a sample mix-up, either in
the submittal or at the lab, re-analyses of all or part of the batch may be requested.
In cases where the failure is within a sequence of low grade/insignificant results the project manager may elect to accept the original certificate,
regardless of the failure, on the basis that it will not significantly affect any resource data.
QAQC data is reviewed on a continuous basis as data is imported into the database. Comprehensive QAQC reports are generated by the site
database manager and reviewed by senior staff on a monthly basis.
Monthly QAQC reports include:
•
•
•
•
•
A summary of the samples shipped and analyses received during the period with a statement of turnaround time.
Standard and Blank performance summaries by month, year, and standard type.
Standard analysis bias summaries by grade bin.
Individual  standard  performance  tracking  plots.  Standard  assays  are  tracked  over  time  for  each  standard.  Separate  plots  are  generated  for  initial
values, including failures, and final accepted values. These plots permit evaluation of precision, accuracy, and bias trends for individual standards.
Blank performance tracking plots: blank assays are tracked over  time.  Separate  plots  are  generated  for  initial  values,  including  failures,  and  final
accepted values. These plots permit identification and evaluation of anomalous trends in blank assay performance.

ioGlobal Data Checks
ioGlobal (during Papillon’s tenure) produced a monthly QAQC report that was generated and sent to the database manager. A list of missing
sample and assay data was also prepared at the end of every month.
Sample  information  sheets  were  uploaded  to  ioGlobal  to  download.  Within  the  sample  sheet,  samples  that  had  not  been  sent  for  assay  were
indicated with -3333 in the Au result column; this allowed ioGlobal to distinguish which samples were not erroneous but were actually awaiting
processing, or had been intentionally missed.

Results
Examination of the QAQC sample data indicates satisfactory performance of field sampling protocols and assay laboratories providing acceptable
levels of precision and accuracy.

QAQC Analysis
12.2.1
MPR Reviews, Mineral Resource Estimate Update Data Support
MPR completed a QAQC review as part of their February 2013 and August 2013 resource estimation work; the following summarizes the review
completed at that time.
First Duplicates
The drillhole assay database contains first duplicate analyses for 8,360 samples, equating to approximately one duplicate assay for every 15
original assays. Scatter plot evaluation of the original gold assays with assays of the pulp duplicates data indicated the means of the original and
duplicate assay pairs are the same at 1.16 g/t Au, suggesting that sample extraction and analytical errors is low.
Blanks
Insertion  of  blank  material  is  part  of  the  routine  QAQC  protocol  and  the  5,052  available  blank  assays  equate  to  a  frequency  of  1:25  blank  to
unknown samples. The assaying of blank material has returned near 0.00 g/t Au for all but seven samples. These higher than expected grades
range from 0.17 to 3.68 g/t Au and are suspected to be mislabelled standards.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - DATA VERIFICATION
Standards (CRMs)
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 12.5
Nineteen  certified  reference  materials,  sourced  mostly  from  Geostats  Pty.  Ltd.  (Geostats),  have  been  routinely  inserted  within  the  assaying
batches at Fekola.
There is a generally good agreement between average assayed grades and recommended grades for all standards. All standards have assayed
average grades within 5% of the recommended grade with the exception of two lower grade standards (G310-3 and G303-8) and these are within
0.01 ppm (equivalent to the assay quantisation) of their expected grades. More importantly there is no trend in the small variances towards high or
low bias.
Core and RC Duplicates
There are 2,990 pairs of diamond core duplicates. The global means of the two data are comparable and show no grade bias towards either pair. A
QQ plot indicated no conditional bias. The result is considered acceptable by MPR given the type of comparison.
There are 2,651 pairs of RC field duplicates. The means of the two data are identical at 0.36 g/t Au. The QQ plot shows that there is no bias towards
either sample pair. The result is considered excellent by MPR.
Twin Hole Drilling
Papillon completed a program of diamond core holes twinning previously drilled RC holes. This was initiated in 2011 to 2012 after concerns were
raised on the possible poor representivity of wet RC sampling.
Visual inspection of all sections shows that there is good correlation between the intersection of gold mineralisation seen in the RC drillholes and
their neighbouring diamond core twins. Another encouraging observation is that in the broader intersections where there are internal zones of
lower-grade mineralisation the contacts to these zones (and grade tenor) are reflected similarly in the two sampling methods.
To  confirm  the  visual  comparison  MPR  initially  calculated  gold  intersections  (down-hole  length  and  grade)  for  each  drillhole  twin.  The
intersections were based on a nominal 0.2 g/t Au cut-off and sample grades were not cut prior to calculating the average grades.
In most cases the mineralised widths intersected in the twins are similar. The average grades of the mineralisation do show some variance, but
this to be expected, particularly in higher-grade gold mineralisation, and is also partly due to the hole paths deviating in some instances.
The total accumulated length of mineralisation selected from the RC drilling is 792 m, averaging 2.56 g/t Au. The equivalent selected diamond core
hole intersections sum to 796.5 m with an average grade of 2.52 g/t Au and compares very well with the cumulative RC average grade.
As an additional check to complement the visual and intercept comparisons of the RC and diamond core twins, a file of nearest-neighbours was
generated and the resultant data pairs analysed. Within a search ellipse of 10 m (east) x 10 m (north) x 5 m (elevation), centred on an RC sample,
pairs of RC and diamond core samples were selected. The complete dataset contains 914 pairs with pairs having an average separation distance
of 7.5 m.

Page 12.6
The pairs of RC and core sample grades were plotted, based on an upper grade cutoff of 12 g/t Au, and excluding 15 pairs. The scatter on the
resultant  figure  is  broad  and  the  data  have  a  poor  correlation  coefficient  (linear  =  0.43).  These  are  expected  given  the  extreme  short  scale
discontinuity  generally  seen  in  gold.  Importantly  the  mean  grade  of  both  data  pairs  is  very  similar;  0.82  versus  0.83  g/t  Au,  RC  and  core,
respectively. The QQ plot shows no significant conditional bias towards either sample type, although there is a suggestion that at lower grades the
RC samples tend to be higher in grade than their core sample counterpart. The reverse is true for grade above 4.0 g/t Au. In both cases, the bias is
less than 10% and not considered to be a significant area of concern.
Review Results
MPR was the resource geologist for prior work, including the PEA filed by B2Gold in August 2014. MPR noted, following the reviews, that:
•
•
•
The QAQC data available that support the drill information at Fekola do provide assurance to Papillon that the assays informing the resource model
and do not display sampling or assaying biases.
The assaying of routine laboratory duplicates, blanks and the results of field duplicates (RC and diamond) are all conforming to or exceeding accepted
industry standards. The results of assaying the certified standards within batches of the originals and QAQC samples suggest there is no bias in the
assaying.
The most conclusive data are the results from the diamond core twinning of the RC intercepts.
The most conclusive data are the results from the diamond core twinning of the RC intercepts.

B2Gold QAQC Review
The cutoff date for the drillhole database used for the mineral resource estimate was 24 January 2015. This was the same dataset used in the
QAQC analysis described in the following sections.
Pulp Duplicates (SDUP)
There  are  2,535  pulp  duplicate  analyses  (second  split  of  pulp),  which  is  about  2.5%  (or  ~1  in  40  samples)  of  the  original  sample  population
contributing to the current resource update. Scatterplot (Figure 12.2.1) evaluation of the pulp duplicate pairs shows a good correlation between
the original assays and the duplicates with very few outliers (eight pairs with RSD >100%).

The positive correlation and high precision of the pulp duplicate and lab duplicate pairs suggests that analytical and sampling errors at the pulp
level are very low.
Blanks
There are 3,734 blank (coarse preparation blank) analyses, which is about 3.7% (~1 in 26 samples) of the original sample population contributing
to the current resource update. The assaying of blank material has returned near 0.00 g/t Au for all but two samples (note that four insertion
substitution errors involving standards originally identified as blanks were corrected in January of 2015.). Blank SORES_E0005080 in SGS_Kayes
certificate KY098619 generates a warning message (“WARNHIGH”) with a value of 0.08 ppm Au. Blank SORES_D012460 in SGS_Kayes certificate
KY098796 generates a failure message (“FAILHIGH”) with a value of 0.11 ppm Au. The cause of these two anomalies has not been identified. It is
possible that these represent sample mix-ups. The low grades involved preclude any significant effect on the resource update.
The very low frequency of blank failures suggests that the laboratories are working cleanly with few sample mix-ups.
Figure 12.2.5 Fekola Blank Performance
Standards (CRMs)
There are 3,355 standard (Certified Reference Material, STD) analyses, which is about 3.4% (~1 in 30 samples) of the original assay population
contributing to the current resource update. The majority, 2,933, of these standard analyses are related to SGS_Kayes analyses.

A  total  of  19  different  standards  have  been  employed  on  the  project.  Sixteen  of  these  standards,  representing  ~98%  of  the  population,  are
Geostats Pty Ltd CRMs. It should be noted that 16 standard misidentification errors were corrected in January of 2015.
There are six standard failures, by B2Gold validation criteria, related to analyses that remain in the population of assays contributing to the current
resource  update.  Two  of  these  failures  are  related  to  a  very  low  grade,  0.07  ppm,  standard;  G310-3.  A  single  3SDHIGH  failure  on  a  0.51  ppm
standard is associated with insignificant results. Three very consistent analyses of a 2.88 ppm standard (2.50, 2.51, and 2.53 ppm) resulting in
3SDLOW failures may represent a standard misidentification.
In  all  cases  the  net  effect  of  accepting  the  analyses  with  the  included  failures  would  be  to  understate  the  grade  or  have  little  effect  on  any
significant assays.
Table 12.2.1 presents average Z-Scores for various standard grade range bins for each of the laboratories contributing to the assay database.
Note that the failed population of six standards has been removed from this population.
The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the analytical result deviates from the expected value. The weighted average standard deviation
of the standards employed by Papillon is 8%. An average Z-Score of -0.1 implies a low bias of ~0.8%.
The figures in Table 12.2.1 suggest that there is little significant bias in the standard analytical results. The limited populations of SGS_Lakefield
analyses show a moderate overall positive bias. The limited population of SGS_Morila analyses show a moderate negative bias. Bureau Veritas
and SGS_Bamako bias trends are effectively neutral. The SGS_Kayes standard analyses, associated with assays representing 88% of the total
gold assay population, show a slight negative bias below 2 g/t, a slight positive bias between 2 g/t and 4 g/t, and a moderate positive bias in the
small population of results exceeding 4 g/t.

Core and RC Field Duplicates (FDUP)
There are 2,987 core and 1,830 RC field duplicate pairs (FDUP) related to original samples contributing to the current resource update.
The total grade sum of the original assays (2,635.14 ppm) compares well with the total grade sum of the field duplicate assays (2,608.54 ppm)
(Table 12.2.2). The total grade sum of the original core assays (1,766.91 ppm) compares well with the total grade sum of the core field duplicate
assays  (1,733.93  ppm).  The  total  grade  sum  of  the  original  RC  assays  (868.23  ppm)  compares  well  with  the  total  grade  sum  of  the  RC  field
duplicate assays (874.60 ppm).

A QQ Plot of the field duplicate data shows reasonably neutral behaviour of both core and RC duplicates (Figure 12.2.7). There is a slight (~3.8%)
positive bias to the RC duplicates between 1.0 and 2.5 ppm. It should be noted that the removal of three sample pairs, with relatively high absolute
differences, from the limited sample population within this grade bin would eliminate this bias.

Figure 12.2.7 Fekola Field Dups QQ Plot
There is a 7% negative bias to the core duplicates between 2.5 ppm and 4 ppm. Removal of seven sample pairs, with relatively high absolute
differences, from the limited sample population within this grade bin would minimize this bias.
The field dup population has been evaluated spatially and with respect to time. No distinct pattern is apparent that might suggest that samples
from a specific latitude or depth or particular drill program are more prone to show a bias than another.
The Thompson-Howarth plot of Field Duplicate Precision (Figure12.2.8) shows that the observed bias is well within the limits of the calculated
precision.
The overall field duplicate correlation is good.

There are 1,523 (1,454 excluding standards) Umpire assays, which is about 1.5% (~1 in 66 samples) of the original sample population contributing
to the current resource update.
The Umpire population contains analyses from two umpire labs evaluating four primary labs. Three of the populations are rather small, reflecting
their relative frequency in the population contributing to the current resource update.

The total grade sums show a tendency for the Umpire assay to be higher than the original sample with the exception of the SGS_Bamako originals
versus the Bureau Veritas Umpires (Table 12.2.5).
A  few  isolated  outliers  with  poor  correlation  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  grade  sums  of  the  small  SGS_Kayes  versus  Bureau  Veritas  and
Bureau Veritas versus SGS_Bamako population sets (Figure 12.2.9). The general correlation is good with a few outliers that may represent sample
mix-ups.

Removing the six high RSD assay pairs has decreased the overall Original vs. Umpire ratio from 97.1 to 98% (Table 12.2.6). The Umpires are
biased high by 2% relative to the originals. This same sense of bias is also apparent in the standard analyses for the Bureau Veritas Umpire
results when compared to the SGS_Kayes standard bias results (Table 12.2.7).

Evaluation of the standard bias of the umpire set versus the overall standard performance of the original assays suggests that the umpires are
biased high relative to the originals.
The umpire assays provide good support for the original assays.

Comments on Section 12
The  data  verification  completed  by  B2Gold  was  performed  under  the  supervision  of  the  QP.  The  QP  considers  that  a  reasonable  level  of
verification  has  been  completed  during  the  work  conducted  to  date,  and  that  no  material  issues  would  have  been  left  unidentified  from  the
verification programs undertaken. The QP is of the opinion that the data verification programs undertaken on the data collected from the Project
adequately  reflect  deposit  dimensions,  true  widths  of  mineralization,  and  the  style  of  the  deposits,  and  adequately  support  the  geological
interpretations, the analytical and database quality.

No problems with the database, sampling protocols, flowsheets, check analysis program, or data storage were identified that were sufficient to
preclude the use of the database for estimation purposes. The quality of the gold analytical data is considered sufficiently reliable to support
Mineral Resource estimation without limitations on Mineral Resource confidence categories. The data can be used in mine planning.

Introduction
13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
A metallurgical testwork programme has been completed to support the OFS of the Project. The majority of the programme was conducted by
SGS  Canada  Inc.  (‘SGS  Lakefield’)  in  Lakefield,  Ontario,  Canada  between  2014  and  2015.  SGS  Lakefield  is  accredited  to  the  requirements  of
ISO/IEC 17025 for relevant mineralogical, geochemical and trade mineral tests conducted for the study. The remainder of the program was either
completed at SGS Lakefield under supervision of a consultant or specialist or at another laboratory facility during the same time period. The
testwork programme and laboratory details are listed in Table 13.3.1.
The programme included testwork to establish:
•
•
•
Comminution characteristics of the ore, three comminution domain composites and eighteen comminution variability samples.
Materials handling properties for three comminution domain composites.

13.2.1
Geology
The Fekola deposit is considered to be an example of an orogenic-style gold deposit. Orogenic gold deposits dominantly form in metamorphic
rocks in the mid to shallow crust, at or above the brittle-ductile transition, in compressional settings that facilitate transfer of hot gold-bearing
fluids from deeper levels. During a geological event, the rapid rise of fluids takes these out of equilibrium with their surroundings, resulting in gold
precipitation. The geological setting for the formation of the orogenic-style gold deposits at Fekola is described in more detail in Section 8 of this
report.
The Fekola deposit is hosted by a moderate to steeply west dipping, folded sequence of marine meta-sediments of the Kofi group, which locally
include: argillite and minor pelitic sediments; fine grained turbidites, comprising laminated to thin-bedded siliciclastic siltstone and mudstone; and
a heterolithic, mass flow breccia, or conglomerate, as shown in Figure 13.2.1 and described in Section 7 of this report. Fine grained thin marble
units are present as a volumetrically minor rock type interbedded with the politic units. Minor mafic volcanic, or volcaniclastic units occur locally in
the upper and possibly, lower portions of the hanging wall stratigraphy. Weakly feldspar-phyric felsic dykes are locally observed. The deposit has
been subjected to upper greenschist facies metamorphism.

As shown in Figure 13.2.1., deposit area is underlain by west dipping politic rocks. Late-stage Fekola Fault Zone (shown in brown) is parallel in
strike to mineralization. Proposed pit outline shown in red. Dashed lines indicate inferred trace of D2 structures as detailed in Section 7 of this
report. Scale as indicated by UTM grid lines.
•
Mineralisation is broadly continuous and has been traced over a strike extent of approximately 1.5 km, to depths of up to 400 m below surface, with
widths to 300 m. The greatest continuity is observed within a high grade shoot (>2 g/t Au) which plunges approximately 13° to the north-north west.
Mineralisation is open at depth, down plunge.
The majority of gold mineralisation in the Fekola deposit occurs in unweathered, fresh rock and is preferentially associated with stringers of pyrite
parallel  to  the  foliation  and  in  fine  disseminated  pyrite.  More  specifically,  the  gold  mineralisation  is  associated  with  fine  grained  pyrite  in  tan
dolomite-albite altered wall rocks, which locally contain diffuse, often deformed pale grey quartz-dolomite-pyrite-albite matrix veins and veinlets.
Trace amounts of chalcopyrite have also been observed. The total sulphide content of the deposit is typically less than 5%.
13.2.2
Metallurgical Domains
Due to the orogenic-style of the deposit, the gold mineralisation is not limited to a particular lithology, but is proximally associated with alterations
throughout the deposit. The domains for the metallurgical testwork programme have been classified according to the gold head grades along with
a spatial component and consideration for the alteration intensity in the selection process. The three domains identified for the Fekola deposit are
High Grade Domain, Hanging Wall Domain, which is of medium gold grade, and Low Grade Domain.

For the metallurgical testwork programme, five drillholes were identified and drilled in July 2014. A total of 1,271 metres of HQ-diameter diamond
drill core was retrieved from the five metallurgical drillholes, FK_MET01 to FK_MET05. The locations of the five metallurgical drillholes are shown
in Figure 13.2.1 and Figure 13.2.2.

The three metallurgical domains have since been correlated with the latest mineral resource model released in early 2015. The distribution of the
metallurgical domains have been based on a mineral resource with a cut-off grade of 0.6 g/t inside the Stage 7 pit with ore inside and outside the
high grade shoot. The estimated distribution by tonnage of these domains for the metallurgical testwork program is shown in Table 13.2.3. The
average grade for each metallurgical domain is shown in Table 13.2.3.

Metallurgical Samples
The  metallurgical  testwork  programme  is  based  on  three  metallurgical  domain  samples  and  eighteen  metallurgical  variability  samples.  The
samples for the comminution part of the testwork programme were compiled separately and are described in Section 13.2.4.
The three metallurgical domain samples, High Grade (HG), Low Grade (LG) and Hanging Wall (HW), have been compiled with HQ-diameter half core
from  all  five  metallurgical  drillholes,  FK_MET01  to  FK_MET05  inclusive.  The  sample  selection  for  these  domain  composites  was  based  on
achieving desired gold grade, spatial representation and alteration intensity. The final metallurgical domain sample weights were 250 kg of HG and
about 120 kg each of LG and HW.
The eighteen metallurgical variability samples were sourced from the HQ-diameter half core from the five metallurgical drillholes, FK_MET01 to
FK_MET05. Each variability sample is a contiguous length with seven representing HG, seven for LG and four for HW. Each variability sample was
selected based on geologic variability, such as deep or shallow spatial location, or as a strong albite-carbonate-sericite-pyrite alteration or a high
pyrite mineralisation zone. The final metallurgical variability sample weights were in the range of 30 to 50 kg each.
Ten of the metallurgical variability and comminution variability samples are common and cover the same length of a drillhole. The drillholes extend
across the pit along the pit centre-line and the origin of each metallurgical domain and variability sample is detailed in Figure 13.2.4.

Comminution Samples
The comminution testwork programme is based on three comminution domain samples and eighteen comminution variability samples. The three
comminution domain samples, Shallow High Grade (Shallow HG), Deep High Grade (Deep HG) and Low Grade (LG), have been compiled with HQ-
diameter whole core from the five metallurgical drillholes, FK_MET01 to FK_MET05 inclusive. The sample selection for these domain composites
was based on spatial representation and alteration intensity. As these samples are whole drill core, the gold grade wasn’t able to be measured.
The three comminution domain samples weighed approximately 220 kg each.
The eighteen comminution variability samples were sourced from the HQ-diameter half core from the five metallurgical drillholes, FK_MET01 to
FK_MET05.  Each  variability  sample  is  a  contiguous  length  with  ten  representing  Deep  HG  and  eight  representing  Shallow  HG  and  LG.  Each
variability sample was selected based on geologic variability, such as deep or shallow spatial location and extent of mineralisation and alteration
intensities. The final comminution variability sample weights were in the range of 40 to 50 kg each.
Ten of the comminution variability and metallurgical variability samples are common and cover the same length of a drillhole. The drillholes extend
across the pit along the pit centre-line and the origin of each comminution domain and variability sample is detailed in Figure 13.2.5.

Mineralogy
Each  metallurgical  domain  composite  sample  was  submitted  for  a  mineralogical  study  which  included  QEMSCAN  analysis  and  visible  gold
deportment. Whole ore samples were ground to the target grind size P80 (75 µm) and submitted for the testwork.
Bulk Mineralogy
The  bulk  mineralogy  was  carried  out  by  QEMSCAN  using  Particle  Map  Analysis.  XRD  analysis  including  clay  mineral  speciation  was  also
performed.  The  results  are  listed  in  Table  13.3.6.  The  three  metallurgical  domain  composite  samples,  HG,  LG  and  HW,  had  a  similar  mineral
assemblage that was comprised of major amounts of plagioclase (~31%), moderate amounts of quartz (12 to 14%) and dolomite (14 to 16%), minor
amounts (2 to 10%) of calcite, amphibole / pyroxene, clays, micas, chlorite, pyrite, and trace amounts (<2%) of other minerals. The main sulphide
mineral was pyrite (2 to 4%), with trace amounts (<0.1%) of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and other sulphides. The main clay minerals were illite-
montmorillonite mixture, chlorite, and illite for all three samples.

analysis  methods  were  used  for  gold  mineral  scanning,  identification,  grain  size  measurement,  and  association  characteristics.  Chemical
analyses  were  also  used  to  determine  the  distribution  of  gold  by  grade  and  gold  minerals  by  association  category  in  the  pre-concentration
fractions, and weighted to the overall sample. A summary of the results are listed in Table 13.3.7.

In summary, the main gold mineral identified in all three composite samples was native gold (Au >75%, Ag <25%). Trace amounts of calaverite
(AuTe2), and unknown alloys of Au-Te-Bi were also identified. The grain size of the gold minerals was similar for all three domain composites. The
average gold grain size for the HG, LG and HW domain composite samples was 5.9 µm, 4.4 µm, and 3.3 µm, respectively.

Comminution Testwork
A  suite  of  comminution  testwork  was  conducted  to  determine  the  variability  of  comminution  parameters  throughout  the  orebody  and  allow
parameters for design of the comminution circuit to be derived.
Comminution tests conducted included the following:
Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) determination.
Bond Low-Energy Impact Crushing Work Index (CWi) determination.
Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWi) determination.
Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi) determination.
Bond Abrasion Index (Ai) determination.
JK Drop Weight testwork.
SMC testwork.

Design Axb value derived from the 85th percentile ranking of specific energies determined for each individual ore type.
Bond Ball Mill Work Index for Design includes a 10.0% correction factor to the 85th percentile value for different results of
comparable samples at different laboratories.
Abrasion Index Average value of 0.525 used for operating cost estimation and Design value of 0.703 used for wear type material
selection.
Salient outcomes from the comminution testwork programme can be summarised as follows:
Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) ranged from 38.1 MPa to 106.95 MPa. The UCS values indicate the ore is competent and can be primary
crushed using a gyratory crusher.
Crushing work indices (CWi) ranged from 14.0 to 15.8 kWh/t, with a median CWi of 14.0 kWh/t. The samples can be characterised as moderately hard
to hard.
Bond  rod  mill  work  indices  (RWi)  ranged  from  18.0  to  21.5  kWh/t,  with  an  85th  percentile  RWi  of  21.0  kWh/t.  The  comparative  laboratory  testing
measured similar values for the domain composite samples.
Bond ball mill work indices (BWi) ranged from 14.1 to 19.7 kWh/t, with an 85th percentile BWi of 18.4 kWh/t. The comparative laboratory testing results
were  higher  for  the  domain  composite  samples.  Therefore,  the  design  value  is  20.3  kWh/t,  which  includes  a  +10.0%  correction  factor  to  the  85th
percentile value. The Bond rod and ball mill work indices are classified as hard to very hard indicating a high grinding energy requirement.

The abrasion indices measured range from 0.213 to 0.879, with an average abrasion index of 0.525. The samples can be classified as medium to very
abrasive. A review of the variability samples with very high abrasion index show that some Diorite is present in these particular samples. Diorite has
an abrasion index range of 0.5 to 0.8 and could be the cause of some very high abrasion index results. An abrasion index average value of 0.525 is
used for operating cost estimation and a design value of 0.703 is used for wear type material selection.
The drop weight Index of the three domain composites tested showed similar results to the SMC Axb values measured and gives confidence in the
results obtained. The Axb values measured range from 26.0 to 33.6 and ta values range from 0.32 to 0.24. The design Axb value of 28.1 was derived
from the 85th percentile ranking of specific energies determined for each individual ore type. Overall, all of the samples are characterised as hard to
very hard.
In  general,  the  samples  tested  are  classified  as  hard  to  very  hard  with  medium  to  very  abrasive  properties.  The  ore  is  amenable  to  primary
crushing followed by a SAG mill and ball mill with pebble crushing (SABC).

Gravity Concentration
Gravity concentration testwork was conducted on the domain composite sample to evaluate the recovery of gold. This work was completed by
SGS Lakefield. The domain composites samples were also submitted for an Extended Gravity Recoverable Gold (E-GRG) testwork program, which
was conducted by FLSmidth at Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories in Utah.

Further gravity testwork completed by Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories show the E-GRG recovery values after three stages on concentration
ranged from 31.4% (HG) to 40.9% (HW). The results also showed that the concentrate gold grain sizes are within the very fine to fine classification.
The E-GRG test results were subsequently modelled. With about half of the gravity recoverable gold in the minus 25 micron size class, this gold
size fraction will readily exit the grinding circuit in the cyclone overflow stream and will be challenging to recover at full scale. Modelling showed
that a gravity circuit will have a marginal contribution at best. Based on these results, a gravity separation circuit is not warranted for the Fekola
process flowsheet. All subsequent testwork has been completed without gravity separation.
13.3.6
Grind / Recovery Testwork
Grind and leach recovery tests were performed on the three metallurgical domain composites at grind sizes of 80% passing (P80) ranging from 149
to 53 microns to determine the effect of grind size on gold recovery.
The cyanidation testwork was conducted in bottle rolls under the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
Leach pulp density of 45% (w/w) solids in tap water.
pH 10.5 to 11.0 adjusted with reagent grade hydrated lime.
Initial cyanide dosage of 0.5 kg/t NaCN with residual sodium cyanide levels maintained at or above 500 ppm.
Dissolved oxygen levels of 4 ppm or greater.
24 hour leach duration.
The grind / recovery leach results are summarised in Table 13.3.11.

Lower residue grades and higher gold recoveries with increasing fineness of grind.
The calculated gold head grades compared well to the direct head grade.
Very little variation in the gold residue grades which indicated that the samples did not contain free gold or “nugget gold”.
The leach kinetic results indicated that all of the samples continued to leach between 8 and 24 hours, however the conditions had not been optimised.
The leach retention time will be tested during the leach conditions optimisation testwork program.
A grind optimisation study was updated with the results listed in Table 13.3.11 to evaluate the effect of grind size on project economics. The evaluation
compared gold revenue against operating and capital expenditure for the grind sizes considered. A grind size (P80) of 75 microns is considered to be
the economic optimum for the Project.

Preg Robbing Assessment
An evaluation of the preg robbing potential of the three metallurgical domain composites was conducted under the following conditions:
P80 grind of 75 microns.
Leach pulp density of 45% (w/w) solids in tap water.
pH 10.5 to 11.0 adjusted with reagent grade hydrated lime.

No preg robbing characteristics.
The testwork results show the samples did not illustrate any preg-robbing characteristics even though the feed grind size (P80) did vary slightly for
the comparative tests. Additional tests were conducted for the High Grade domain composite because the initial feed size varied by 9 microns. A
repeat test confirmed that preg-robbing was not occurring for this sample and the residue grades were essentially identical.

Whole Ore Leach Cyanidation Optimisation Testwork
The  main  cyanide  consumer  in  the  Fekola  deposit  is  pyrite.  Pyrite  is  an  iron  sulphide  mineral  that  has  a  varying  detrimental  effect  on  the
cyanidation of gold. The detrimental effect is related to the mineralogical form of pyrite and the dissolution of iron and sulphide that precipitate on
gold grains; decreasing gold leaching kinetics. This detrimental effect can be alleviated by the addition of lead nitrate and oxygen.

Residence Time Determination
Testwork to identify when gold dissolution reaches steady state was completed with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
P80 grind of 75 microns.
Leach pulp density of 45% (w/w) solids in distilled water.
Leach pulp temperature of 30°C.
pH 10.3 to 10.5 adjusted with reagent grade hydrated lime.
Initial cyanide dosage of 0.35 kg/t NaCN with residual sodium cyanide levels maintained at or above 350 ppm.
Dissolved oxygen levels of 14 to 17 ppm.
24, 36, and 48 hour leach duration.
Figure 13.3.2 Effect of Residence Time
Leaching profiles in Figure 13.3.2 show very fast gold dissolution with a steady state almost reached in 24 hours. The overall extraction was 90.5%
(leach residue at 0.43 g/t Au). This extraction is 0.7% lower than the overall extraction obtained in 48 hours. It was considered that a maximum
extraction of gold would be reached in 24 hr with further improvement of leaching conditions.

It was not possible to determine the effect of retention time on cyanide addition because most of the adjustments of cyanide concentration were
performed in the first 6 hours. It is interesting to point out that the tests with 350 ppm NaCN and DO of ~15 ppm showed leaching kinetics almost
identical to leaching kinetics obtained with 500 ppm NaCN and DO of 8 ppm (green plot in Figure 13.3.2).
Lead Nitrate Addition
Testwork to identify optimum lead nitrate addition was completed with the following conditions:
P80 grind of 75 microns.

Leach pulp temperature of 30°C.
pH 10.3 – 10.5 adjusted with reagent grade hydrated lime.
Initial cyanide dosage of 0.35 kg/t NaCN with residual sodium cyanide levels maintained at or above 350 ppm.
Dissolved oxygen levels of 14 to 17 ppm.

Figure 13.3.3 Effect of Lead Nitrate Addition
Figure 13.3.3 illustrates the effect of lead nitrate added at the beginning of cyanidation. The concentration of cyanide was 350 ppm NaCN and the
DO was 14 to 17 ppm. Test 6 from this series, with elevated DO and 100 g/t lead nitrate addition, produced the highest gold extraction. There was
basically no effect of lead nitrate addition on gold extraction at 50 g/t and lead nitrate became detrimental to the gold leaching rate when added at
250 g/t. Lead nitrate addition is considered beneficial when processing ore zones with varying and higher sulphide content. Consequently, the
testwork program was continued with the addition of 100 g/t lead nitrate.
Cyanide Concentration Determination

Figure  13.3.4  shows  the  effect  of  cyanide  concentration  ranging  from  150  ppm  to  550  ppm  NaCN.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the
leaching kinetics in the range of concentrations tested. The gold content of the leach residues increased when the cyanide concentration was
reduced to 250 ppm and lower. This corresponds to a decrease of gold extraction from 91.1% to 90.0%. The cyanide addition decreased from 0.89
kg/t NaCN to 0.65 kg/t when the cyanide concentration decreased from 550 ppm NaCN to 350 ppm NaCN respectively.

According to Figure 13.3.6, the variation of pulp density from 40 to 50% showed no significant difference in terms of leaching kinetics; however,
the overall gold extractions were slightly lower compared to 45% solids. Therefore, 45% solids were selected as the optimum leach pulp density.

Figure 13.3.7 Reproducibility of Optimum Gold Leaching Conditions
Figure 13.3.7 shows reproducibility of optimum gold leaching conditions. The optimised conditions are 24 hour leach retention time, 14 to 17 ppm
DO concentration, 350 ppm NaCN concentration, 100 g/t lead nitrate addition and 45% solids. The leaching profiles and gold content of leach
residues indicates that the optimum conditions are highly reproducible.
Summary of Optimum Gold Leaching Conditions
The  Fekola  high  grade  domain  composite  sample  used  for  the  gold  leaching  optimisation  testwork  programme  contained  4.23  g/t  Au.  The
mineralogical composition of the sample was mostly gangue minerals with 3.45% pyrite. Leaching profiles showed that most of the gold dissolved
within 12 hour and unleached gold is about 9 to 10%. The optimum leaching conditions identified are 24 hour cyanidation with 350 ppm NaCN, 100
g/t lead nitrate, pH 10.3 to 10.5, DO ~15 ppm and a pulp density of 45% solids (w/w). The gold extraction was 91% (leach residue of 0.42 g/t) and
cyanide addition was 0.65 kg/t NaCN. Gold extraction is influenced by the oxygen content of

the slurry. Gold extraction was 2% lower when the DO was reduced from 15 ppm to 8 ppm. At a cyanide concentration of 250 ppm NaCN, gold
extraction  was  reduced  by  1.0%.  Increased  addition  of  lead  nitrate  to  250  g/t  significantly  reduced  the  leaching  kinetics.  The  optimum  gold
leaching conditions were found to be highly reproducible.

Whole Ore Cyanidation of Variability Samples at Optimised Leach Conditions
Testwork on the metallurgical variability samples was completed with the optimum gold leaching conditions identified in the testwork programme
described in Section 13.3.8. The optimum gold leaching conditions are:
P80 grind of 75 microns.
Leach pulp density of 45% (w/w) solids.
Leach pulp temperature of 30°C.
pH 10.3 to 10.5 adjusted with reagent grade hydrated lime.
24 hr leach duration.
Initial addition of lead nitrate at 100 g/t of Pb(NO3)2.
Initial cyanide dosage of 0.35 kg/t NaCN with residual sodium cyanide levels maintained at or above 350 ppm.
Dissolved oxygen levels of 14 to 17 ppm.
Table  13.3.13  lists  a  summary  of  these  results.  The  testwork  included  seven  HG,  seven  LG  and  four  HW  metallurgical  variability  samples.  The
samples with a gold content >5.0 g/t were repeated with an initial cyanide dosage of 0.50 kg/t NaCN with residual sodium cyanide levels maintained at
or above 500 ppm.

The gold extractions for High Grade domain variability samples ranged from 87.3 to 96.9%, with an average extraction of 94.2% (seven samples).
The FEK-MET-008 variability sample was the only sample which had a gold extraction <90%. The other six variability samples had gold extractions
that ranged from 94.3 to 96.9%. The High Grade domain composite sample gold extraction was 90.2%, lower than the majority of the variability
results. The three repeat cyanidation tests (HG variability samples with heads grades >5 g/t) which maintained a higher cyanide concentration (0.5
g/L NaCN) had slightly higher gold extractions when compared to the tests completed at the optimum conditions. The gold extractions were 0.2 to
0.8% higher.
The Low Grade domain variability gold extractions ranged from 90.5 to 94.9%, with an average of 92.1% (seven samples). The Low Grade domain
composite sample gold extraction was 90.4%, slightly below the variability sample average.
The  Hanging  Wall  domain  variability  gold  extractions  ranged  from  92.4  to  93.9%,  with  an  average  of  93.1%  (four  samples).  The  Hanging  Wall
domain composite sample gold extraction was 92.7%. The average cyanide and lime consumptions for the HW domain composite tests were the
lowest of the three domains.
In general, the calculated gold head grades compared well to the direct heads. The largest variations were in the high grade variability sample test
results. The relationship between gold extraction and head grade for the variability samples is illustrated in Figure 13.5.1.
13.3.10
Diagnostic Leaching Testwork
Two diagnostic leach tests were conducted on High Grade cyanidation leach residue samples to determine the gold association and determine if
the remaining gold was cyanide leachable. The residues selected for diagnostic leach testing were from test CN-39, a HG variability sample, FEK-
MET-008, and from test CN-53, the High Grade domain composite sample. The residues were selected due to their higher gold content (0.45 g/t Au
for CN-39 and 0.43 g/t Au for CN-53) and lower gold leach extractions (87.3% for test CN-39 and 90.2% for test CN-53).
The diagnostic leach results show:
The overall gold extraction only increased slightly (1.4% for FEK-MET-008 and 0.6% for HG domain composite) after intensive cyanidation for 24 hrs.
Regrinding the residues followed by additional intensive cyanidation leaching for another 24 hr improved the overall gold extraction significantly for
both samples (6.7% for FEK-MET-008 and 6.8% for the HG Domain Composite). The increase in gold extractions with fine grinding indicated improved
liberation and accessibility of exposed gold to the cyanide leach solution.
Finally, the leach residues were subjected to hot aqua regia digestion to extract the gold associated with sulphide minerals. Gold extractions of 3.5%
(FEK-MET-008) and 2.2% (HG domain composite) were achieved.
The remaining gold, 1.1% in FEK-MET-008 and 0.2% in the HG domain composite, is considered to be as gold locked in silicates or gold associated
with fine sulphides locked in silicates. It should be noted that the final aqua regia residues had sulphide sulphur grades of 0.07% and <0.05%, which
indicated that essentially all of the sulphides present in the samples were dissolved.

Review of the origin of these samples does not reveal any apparent reason for the lower gold extraction rates or the diagnostic leach results
observed. The fact that the leach residues samples needed regrinding before intensive cyanidation improved gold extraction could be considered
to be related to the presence of trace amounts of Calaverite (AuTe2), which is a slow leaching mineral that benefits from fine grinding. However the
tellurium content of the high grade domain composite was below the detection limit and only the low grade domain composite had measurable
tellurium in the head analysis. The variability samples were not analysed for tellurium. In summary, the most plausible explanation for the lower
gold extractions is the incomplete liberation and exposure of finely disseminated gold particles based on the diagnostic leach results.
13.3.11
Bulk Cyanidation Tests
Three bulk cyanidation tests were completed to create samples for downstream testwork, which included cyanide destruction (CND), thickener
testing, rheology and environmental testwork. The bulk tests were completed using the High Grade domain composite and the optimised leach
conditions were applied. Upon completion of the cyanidation tests, the leached pulp was contacted with carbon for six hours to simulate a CIP
circuit, prior to CND testing. Table 13.3.14 summarises the bulk testwork results.

The bulk cyanidation gold extractions were slightly lower than the 1 kg bottle roll test results (90.2%). The gold extractions ranged from ~86 to
90%. The optimum gold leaching conditions were found to be moderately reproducible with the bulk leach of the HG domain composite.
13.3.12
Cyanide Destruction Testwork
Three cyanide destruction tests were conducted on bulk High Grade domain composite leached pulp. The objective of the testwork was to obtain
optimised  conditions  for  the  cyanide  destruction  circuit  and  produce  treated  pulp  containing  <10  mg/L  residual  CNWAD  using  the  SO2  /  air
destruction process.

The main parameters adjusted in the testwork were the stoichiometric addition of sodium metabisulphite and the addition of copper. The tests
were completed in batch and continuous mode. The Fekola pulp responded well to cyanide destruction treatment using the SO2/air process. All of
the tests were conducted at 30°C, 45% solids (w/w), pH 8.5, and a retention time of 60 minutes.
Upon completion of the CND program, the following operating conditions were recommended for the Fekola tailings pulp:
•
•
•
•
Addition ratio of ~4 g of SO2 per gram of gram of CNWAD.
Copper addition of 10 mg/L.
pH = 8.5.
90 minutes residence time.
Testwork completed indicates the SO2 / air process can be successfully employed to treat the CIP tailings stream to reduce CNWAD levels.
13.3.13
Oxygen Uptake Testwork
Oxygen uptake tests were completed on the three domain composites, HG, LG and HW, at optimised leach conditions. The rate at which oxygen
was consumed was determined over a 24 hour period. The oxygen uptake rate (mg/L/min) was calculated at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. The initial tests
completed only sparged oxygen into the pulp for 45 minutes prior to a 15 minute reading when the oxygen decay was measured. After the initial
tests, duplicate tests (R1 and R2) were completed where the oxygen concentration was maintained at the design value (13 to 15 ppm) during the
tests. For the triplicate and average test results, the relationship between oxygen uptake and time is illustrated in Figures 13.3.8 to 13.3.10.

The results indicate the following:
•
All three domain composite samples exhibit high oxygen demand for the duration of the test period.
The addition of oxygen, instead of air, is required to achieve the required dissolved oxygen levels of 13 to 17 ppm in the leach circuit.

Carbon Modelling
A high grade domain composite sample was leached in bulk at the optimised leach conditions for subsequent carbon adsorption and equilibrium
testwork described below.
Carbon Adsorption Kinetics
The bulk leached pulp was then contacted with regenerated plant carbon in a batch test in a rolling bottle for 72 hours. Solution samples were
removed for gold analysis at specific time intervals (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs) to establish the adsorption kinetic profile.

Figure 13.3.11 Carbon Adsorption of Bulk Leached HG Composite Sample
The kinetic (k) and equilibrium (K) adsorption constants generated from the sample tested were 0.015 h-1 and 17,731 g/t, respectively. The kinetic
constant k is a first order rate constant that describes the rate of film diffusion of gold cyanide onto carbon in the initial stages of the adsorption
process, while the equilibrium constant K represents the predicted equilibrium loading of gold  cyanide  on  the  carbon  (in  g/t)  from  a  solution
containing 1 mg/L Au. The product of the two constants (kK) provides a useful guide as to whether or not CIP/CIL will perform efficiently when
processing the particular pulp. In this regard, experience has shown that when the kK value is <50 h-1 the carbon adsorption process will be slow
and  inefficient  (requiring  many  adsorption  stages  and  high  carbon  inventories).  When  the  kK  value  is  >100  h-1,  however,  good  CIP  /  CIL
performance can be expected. Against this background, it can be seen that the Fekola HG Domain Comp gold adsorption properties are very
good, with a value 260 h-1. The adsorption kinetics (k = 0.015) are relatively slow but the equilibrium loading (K = 17,731) is favourable for this
sample.

Carbon Adsorption Equilibrium Isotherms
Equilibrium  isotherms  for  gold  cyanide  loading  on  activated  carbon  can  generally  be  fitted  well  to  a  Freundlich  isotherm  via  a  non-linear
regression. To generate the equilibrium data, predetermined amounts of pulp from the bulk leach test were contacted with predetermined amounts
of activated carbon to achieve target solution/carbon ratios (or targeted carbon loadings). The slurries were agitated, in rolling bottles with carbon,
for 72 hrs to “equilibrate” the activated carbon with the gold in solution, after which time the carbon was recovered by screening and samples of
the slurry were filtered to generate carbon, solution and washed residue samples for gold and silver analysis. The results from the isotherm tests
are plotted in Figure 13.3.12.
Figure 13.3.12 Equilibrium Loading of Gold onto Carbon from Bulk Leached HG Composite Sample
The isotherm shown in Figure 13.3.12 does not represent true equilibrium between gold in solution and on the carbon, but is rather considered to
be a pseudo-isotherm that is representative of a practical loading limit in an operating plant. In practice, gold cyanide loading on activated carbon
is so slow when it is close to equilibrium that the attainment of true equilibrium takes weeks or even months to be reached. But these much higher
loading values are of little relevance as far as plant operations are concerned.
Carbon Adsorption Testing
The results of the carbon adsorption testwork are displayed in Figure 13.3.11 and Figure 13.3.12. The carbon adsorption constants have been
calculated to be:

For the Fekola HG domain composite sample, the adsorption kinetics (k = 0.015 h-1) are relatively slow but the equilibrium loading (K = 17,731) is
favourable for this sample. Overall, the product of these two constants is 260 h-1 and shows very good adsorption properties. Based on the
absence of any preg robbing characteristics and very good adsorption properties, CIP has been selected for the Fekola processing plant. The
SGS Lakefield modelling study indicated excellent performance of CIP for Fekola soluble gold recovery.

The results indicate the following:
•
•
The samples exhibited low apparent viscosity at low pulp densities, indicating that ‘sanding’ of the leach and CIP tanks may pose a problem if the
circuit is operated at low pulp densities. The inclusion of a leach thickener ahead of the leach and CIP circuits will allow the slurry tanks to be operated
at densities of 45% w/w solids or up to 50% solids for good slurry mixing characteristics.
Pumping of solids at densities up to 70% w/w solids using centrifugal pumps should not be problematical.

The optimum thickener feed density ranges from 8% to 14% as listed in Table 13.3.17. The thickener feedwell includes auto-dilution ports to achieve
the desired thickener feed density.
The results from the testwork indicate a thickener unit area at 0.03 m2/tpd is required. For the maximum throughput of 5 Mtpa, this equates to a 24 m
diameter thickener without any design margin. Allowance for additional mud residence time and increased operational flexibility of the equipment
results in a design margin of 10% being added to the thickener sizing. Therefore, a high rate thickener with a diameter of 25 m will be selected for each
duty based on these testwork results.
The testwork results show that thickener underflow densities of 45% solids and 60 to 65% solids (w/w) can be readily achieved for the leach and
tailings thickener duties respectively.

Materials Handling Testwork
Materials handling testwork has been conducted by Jenike & Johanson Limited (JJL), who were commissioned to perform flow property tests on
three comminution domain composite samples, Deep HG, Shallow HG and LG. Based on the results obtained, Jenike and Johanson provided
functional design recommendations for the crushed ore stockpile and reclaim system.
The testwork programme included the following tests:
•
•
•
Particle density: completed using a 100 mls graduated cylinder.
Compressibility: determines the bulk density vs. consolidating pressure relationship.
Loose and Compacted Bulk Density: done using a 20-litre pail.
Flow Function: for calculating the critical outlet dimensions.
Flow Function: for calculating the critical outlet dimensions.
Wall Friction: for calculating mass-flow hopper angles.
Critical Chute Angle: for calculating critical chute angle.
The flow property testwork results are expressed in terms of bin dimensions required to ensure dependable flow, maximum hopper angles for mass
flow, minimum chute angles and, critical discharge rates through bin outlets. Based on the results of the Fekola ore and experience from the design
and operation of the Otjikoto processing plant, which also had a similar testwork programme conducted by JJL, the Fekola crushed ore stockpile and
reclaim system will be similar to the Otjikoto design with some enhancements to further improve the live capacity and ore flow consistency.

Comminution Circuit Selection
The following section presents details on:
•
•
The comminution circuit design basis.
The comminution circuit modelling by Orway Mineral Consultants.
13.4.1
Comminution Circuit Design Basis
The comminution characteristics of the deposit are summarised in Table 13.3.13. The ore from the Fekola deposit is classified as hard to very hard
competency with above average grinding energy requirements and is moderate to highly abrasive.
The crushing and grinding circuit design is based on treating 4 Mtpa of ore expandable to a maximum throughput of 5 Mtpa without any further
design margin. The opportunity to incorporate an unused SAG mill into the comminution circuit has also been assessed during the comminution
circuit modelling.
13.4.2
Comminution Circuit Modelling
Orway  Mineral  Consultants  (OMC)  were  commissioned  to  model  the  physical  data  for  the  Fekola  deposit  and  recommend  the  most  suitable
comminution circuit configuration and SAG / Ball mill size combination to achieve a P80 grind size of 75 microns. Based on their experience with
similar projects and cross-referencing of their extensive in-house database, OMC have recommended a single stage crushing circuit followed by a
SAG mill and ball mill with pebble crushing (SABC) circuit. The key design criteria used in modelling of the circuit configurations is summarised in
Section 13.5.2.
Grinding  circuit  modelling  was  also  completed  by  SGS  Lakefield,  who  use  a  similar  but  different  modelling  method  compared  to  OMC.  SGS
Lakefield also recommended a similar SABC circuit with mills of the same diameter, but different motor sizing and effective grinding length. OMC
use a power based modelling approach, coupled with data from operating projects with comparable hard ore, the OMC modelling and mill sizing
selection has been adopted. SGS Lakefield use the JKSimMet modelling approach.
The grinding circuit has been modelled using the ore specific physical parameters summarised in Section 13.5.2.
13.4.3
Comminution Circuit Selection
A gyratory crusher followed by a SAG and ball milling circuit with a pebble crusher has been adopted for the OFS as this approach provides
significant capital and operating cost savings over the other comminution circuit options considered in previous feasibility studies.
OMC have also predicted the grinding media consumption rate, mills and pebble crusher wear liner consumption rates based on the average
abrasion index as well as the average power consumption based on the average ore properties.

After OMC completed the mill size selection, an unused SAG mill of a larger diameter was found to be available and reviewed by the OMC model. A
detailed  assessment  has  shown  that  this  unused  SAG  mill  will  operate  with  a  lower  ball  charge  and  result  in  a  reduced  grinding  media
consumption rate. This lower operating cost will offset the increased capital installation expenditure required for this mill. Further details of the
recommended grinding circuit configuration are detailed in Section 17 and Section 24.

Metallurgical Testwork Summary
13.5.1
Selected Treatment Route
The metallurgical treatment route selected has been based on the results of the current testwork programme and can be summarised as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Single stage primary crushing.
SAG milling, ball milling and pebble crushing (SABC).
Leach thickening, which offers the following benefits:
•
•
•
the  ability  to  operate  at  low  cyclone  overflow  densities  in  the  grinding  circuit  thereby  improving  classification  efficiencies  which  potentially
improves overall gold recoveries and ball mill grinding efficiency
consistent and sufficiently high leach and CIP feed density to ensure adequate solids and carbon suspension
to separate gold bearing solution that has been dissolved in the grinding circuit for carbon adsorption recovery in the Carbon-in-Columns (CIC)
circuit.
Leach and Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP).
Pressure Zadra stripping circuit.
Cyanide destruction using SO2 / Air.
Tailings thickening, which offers the benefit of being able to recover water before the tailings slurry is discharged to the TSF. This will halve the fresh
water requirement for the processing plant.

Gold Extraction Model
The  metallurgical  results  of  leach  tests  conducted  on  the  master  composite  and  variability  samples  at  the  optimum  grind  and  cyanidation
conditions are summarised in Table 13.3.13. Overall gold extractions range from 87 to 97%. The variability sample results show a logarithmic
relationship with a strong correlation coefficient (r = 0.86) for the measured gold head grade and resulting gold extraction under optimised leach
conditions at a grind size of 75 microns. The relationship is graphically illustrated in Figure 13.5.1. It should be noted that the test result from test
CN-39 (FEK-MET-008, 87.3% gold extraction) has been omitted from the data set as it has been identified as an outlier. However, when this outlier
result is included in the data set, the predicted gold extraction is reduced by 0.4 to 0.5%, which is not significant and within the plant recovery
discount of 1.0%. It is recommended that further variability samples from future drilling are leached with optimised leaching conditions at a grind
size of 75 microns to further confirm the gold extraction model.

Figure 13.5.1 Gold Extraction Model
The overall relationship between gold head grade and gold extraction is shown by the following relationship:
At a gold head grade of 2.50 g Au/t, the predicted gold extraction is 93.7%.
Gold Extraction (%) = 1.6705 ln (Gold Head Grade (g Au/t)) + 92.218    [A]
The metallurgical gold extraction is a statement of the anticipated metallurgical extraction for the Fekola deposit but is not a statement of the
anticipated plant performance. Consideration must be given to soluble gold and fine carbon losses, potential for short circuiting in the leach
circuit and other associated plant problems that may impact on the overall plant gold recovery.

The  gold  extraction  model  represents  laboratory  conditions.  As  laboratory  testwork  is  conducted  under  ideal  conditions,  the  overall  plant
recovery prediction incorporates an allowance for the loss of recovery that will occur due to plant and operating inefficiencies and to account for
soluble gold and fine carbon losses to tailings. The overall deficiency in the gold extraction model is estimated to be 1.0%.
The anticipated plant gold recovery is estimated as follows:
Plant Gold Recovery (%) = Gold Extraction (%) – 1.0%    [B]
Where gold extraction is estimated by equation [A].

At a gold head grade of 2.50 g Au/t the estimated plant gold recovery is 92.7%.
Neither the gold extraction model nor the anticipated plant recovery model includes any benefit from the addition of a carbon column adsorption
circuit  that  was  included  in  the  process  flowsheet  when  the  gravity  circuit  could  no  longer  be  justified  based  on  the  results  of  the  gravity
recoverable  gold  modelling.  Since,  the  leach  optimisation  testwork  shows  pre-aeration  of  the  leach  feed  slurry  is  not  required,  some  sodium
cyanide solution will be added to the SAG mill feed chute to start the leaching of gold in the grinding circuit. This means that after grinding, the
leach thickener overflow solution will contain dissolved gold and the carbon column adsorption circuit will recover dissolved gold before entering
the leach and CIP circuits. This means that gold can be recovered at the beginning of the overall flowsheet and facilitate early recovery of gold,
particularly during high gold head grade periods.

Reagent Consumption
The  metallurgical  results  of  leach  tests  conducted  on  the  master  composite  and  variability  samples  at  the  optimum  grind  and  cyanidation
conditions are summarised in Table 13.3.13. The results indicate that the lime and sodium cyanide addition do not vary significantly.
The lime and sodium cyanide addition rates from the testwork have been proportioned according to the distribution of tonnes from each domain
as per the mineral resource issued early 2015. The reagent addition values are presented in Table 13.5.2.

Testwork Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn from the metallurgical and comminution testwork programmes:
•
The  Fekola  deposit  is  classified  as  hard  to  very  hard  competency  with  above  average  grinding  energy  requirements  and  is  moderate  to  highly
abrasive. The ore is amenable to primary crushing followed by a SAG mill and ball mill with pebble crushing (SABC).
Fekola ore is predominantly ‘free-milling’, not ‘preg robbing’ and is amenable to gold extraction by conventional cyanidation.

A gravity separation circuit is not warranted for the Fekola deposit. Instead, a carbon column adsorption circuit will be included to recover dissolved
gold leached in the grinding circuit to facilitate early recovery of gold, particularly during high gold head grade periods.
The  optimum  leaching  conditions  identified  are  24  hour  cyanidation  with  350  ppm  NaCN,  initial  lead  nitrate  addition  of  100  g/t,  pH  10.3  to  10.5,
dissolved oxygen levels of ~15 ppm and a pulp density of 45% solids (w/w). The addition of lead nitrate and dissolved oxygen levels of 15 ppm is
found to be beneficial in leach kinetics and overall recovery. Anticipated lime and cyanide addition rates are moderate.
The ore typically yields good recoveries (87 to 97%). Testwork results show a logarithmic relationship between the measured gold head grade and
resulting gold extraction under optimised leach conditions at a grind size of 75 microns.
Based on the absence of any preg robbing characteristics and very good adsorption properties, a CIP circuit has been selected for the Fekola process
flowsheet.
The cyanidation tailings responded well to cyanide destruction treatment using the SO2 / Air process.
The ore has a thickener specific settling rate of 0.3 m2/tpd for both the leach and tailings thickener duties. The leach thickener requires 32 g/t of
flocculant to produce an underflow with a density of 45% solids (w/w). The tailings thickener requires 30 g/t of flocculant to produce an underflow with a
density of 60 to 65% solids (w/w).

Mineral resources for the Fekola deposit are reported from B2Gold’s mineral resource model which has an effective date of 24 January 2015. This
updated mineral resource estimate was completed in February 2015 and replaces the previous two mineral resource estimates completed by MPR
Geological Consultants Pty. Ltd. in January 2013 (MPR, January 2013) and August 2013 (MPR, August 2013). These previous estimates were
reported by B2Gold in “Fekola Project, Mali, NI43-101 Technical Report on Preliminary Economic Assessment” dated August 2014 (B2Gold, 2014).
The  B2Gold  February  2015  model  update  incorporates  drilling  results  available  at  24  January  2015,  revised  geological  logging  and  a  new
geological  understanding  on  mineralization  controls  which  is  reflected  in  the  interpretations  and  wireframes  serving  as  the  basis  for  grade
estimation. The estimation methodology and drill spacing requirements for resource categories were also revised.
Mineralization domains at nominal grade thresholds of 0.1 g/t (domain 101), 0.5 g/t (105), 1.0 g/t (110), and 2.5 g/t (125) were implicitly modelled as
3D solids using Leapfrog software. The overall interpretation and dimensions of the mineralization domains were controlled by zones of high
pyrite which were superimposed on the lithology model which considered regional folding and faulting. Assays were capped by mineralization
domain and by fresh or saprolite prior to compositing to 2 m downhole intervals. Capping levels for fresh rock are 1.5, 2.8, 9.0, and 30 g/t for
domain 101, 105, 110, and 125, respectively. In saprolite, the capping levels are 1.0, 2.1, 5.0 and 10 g/t for the same domains. The lower capping
levels in saprolite are a function of the higher grade variability observed in saprolite assays.
Mineralization domain wireframes were coded to the blocks using sub-cells (minimum sub-cell 2.5 x 5 x 2.5 m) and the coded blocks were used as
grade  estimation  domains.  Gold  grades  were  estimated  into  parent  blocks  (5  x  20  x  10  m)  using  Ordinary  Kriging  (OK)  from  2  m  capped
composites for each domain. The sub-cell model was re-blocked to 5 x 10 x 5 m whole blocks to account for the gradational change in gold grades
seen at the domain contacts. Variography confirmed observations seen on plots and in 3D that the main direction of grade continuity for domains
105 and 110 is azimuth 347° to 351°, with a shallow dip ranging from -10° to -14°. Block grade estimates were validated by visual comparison to
composite grades, comparison of global block statistics to the nearest neighbour (NN) model, swath plots to check for local bias, and comparison
to the previously reported mineral resource.
Mineral  Resource  classification  was  assigned  to  parent  blocks.  Indicated  resources  required  an  approximate  drill  spacing  of  40  x  40  m  and
Inferred  resources  are  drilled  at  80  x  80  m.  Average  density  by  mineralization  domain,  which  ranges  from  2.76  to  2.83  gm/cm3,  was  used  for
tonnage calculations. Saprolite and overburden densities were set at 1.8 gm/cm3.
Reasonable prospects of economic extraction have been applied by reporting Mineral Resources from the re-blocked model above a gold cut-off
grade of 0.6 g/t, within a conceptual pit shell run at a gold price of US$ 1,500/oz and preliminary operating costs as of March 2015.

Recommendations with respect to the Mineral Resource estimate include additional drilling to confirm mineralization controls and continuity of
high grade in the hanging wall zone, drilling at grade control spacing to assess the short range variability anticipated during mining and using
other non-linear estimation techniques, such as conditional simulation to confirm the grade tonnage curve.

Software Used
The  project  drillhole  database  is  compiled  in  MS-Access  and  imported  to  mining  software  packages  via  CSV  (comma  delimited  ASCII)  files.
Wireframe models (solids models and surfaces) for mineralized domains, topography, overburden and saprolite were built using Leapfrog V2.1.2,
Gems V6.6 and Surpac V6.6.2 software. Snowden Supervisor V8.3.1.2 was used for most statistical analyses and variography. B2Gold proprietary
software, GSLIB and MS-Excel were also used for statistical analyses. Block model creation, grade estimation, block regularization and aspects of
tabulations were done in Datamine V3.24.25.0. Pit optimization was run using Whittle V4.5.5 software.
14.3
Available Data
The database used as the basis for the mineral resource block model was compiled by B2Gold’s Exploration staff at the project site from the
previous owner’s database (see Section 12, Data Verification), with review by B2Gold’s Vancouver-based technical staff. The assay and geological
database  cutoff  date  was  January  24,  2015  (filename  “B2PapExport  Med  DH  only  Jan  24  2015  MJG”).  All  drillhole  collar  surveys  are  in  UTM
coordinates. All RC, DDH and RC / DDH holes within the block model limits were used in the estimate. Table 14.3.1(A) shows the number and
meterage of holes used to define the mineralization domains and Table 14.3.1 (B) shows the number of holes and meterage used directly in block
grade estimation.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory  data  analysis  (EDA)  was  done  on  the  complete  assay  and  logged  database  to  better  understand  which  logged  geological
characteristics have the strongest control on gold mineralization and to provide input to the re-logging process.
The logged percent pyrite data was binned and statistics (Table 14.4.1) were run on gold grades by the binned groups. The table shows with an
increase in logged pyrite there is an increase in gold grade.
There is also a slight positive relationship between gold grade and increased silica and a similar but lesser correlation between gold grade and
sericite alteration.

Other logged parameters including lithology, vein types, structure, alteration, texture, grain size and sulphides do not show a strong relationship
to gold mineralization. Gold grade statistics by logged lithology are shown on the boxplot on Figure 14.4.1. There isn’t a strong control on gold
grade  by  lithology  although  five  lithologies  (BSM,  SIT,  MBX,  MCG  and  MIN)  contain  about  90%  of  the  gold  mineralization.  Argillite  (ARG)  is
commonly found in the project area; it is typically low grade and occurs at the periphery of higher grade mineralization.

Geological Interpretation and Modelling
Structural,  lithological  and  pyrite  interpretations  /  solid  models  were  built  iteratively.  A  preliminary  structural  model  was  built  followed  by  a
lithological model and pyrite model. Certain marker lithologies and pyrite supported modifying the structural model. This method allowed each
model to inform the other models. The mineralization domain model was informed by the structural, lithological and pyrite models which ensured
their basis was supported by observed geological features.

Structural Model
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 14.5
The main features of the structural model are the shallowly north-northwest plunging (13 to 354°) axis of the major F2 folding event and the late-
stage, brittle Fekola Fault zone which cross cuts earlier generations of structures and mineralization. The Fekola Fault exhibits steep (70 to 80°)
westerly dips in the north end of the deposit, with more moderate dips (45 to 50°) along strike to the south. The Fekola fault is a late structural
feature with no significant influence on the geometry of mineralization. (Refer to Figure 7.3.5 in this report for an example cross section showing
structural and lithology interpretations).
Folding and faults, as modelled, are based on foliation measurements in the geotechnical structural log and “FTZ” codes from the structure field
in the DHgeology table.
14.5.2
Lithological and Pyrite Models
Based on field observations, supported by statistical and spatial reviews, logged lithologies were grouped for modelling as follows:
•
•
•
•
Argillite.
Turbidite (includes logged quartzite, quartz vein and schist).
Mass flow breccia (which includes MBX, MGC, SIT, pink rock, mafic, felsic, dyke).
Overburden and saprolite were also modelled.
At the deposit scale, grouped lithological units exhibit asymmetric, east-verging folds with local structural thickening of individual units at fold
hinges and corresponding attenuation along fold limbs. The three lithological groups were modelled in 3D using Leapfrog software. The fold and
fault orientations from the structural model were used to inform the lithology model.
Logged percent pyrite (py_pct) (where logging was available) was the basis for the pyrite interpretations and solids model. The structural and
lithology models were iteratively used to inform the construction of the pyrite model.

“Quotations” indicated visually identifiable lithologies with regional mine nomenclature.
Material Types
The overburden model represents various transported materials that overlie in-situ weathered rock and fresh rock. In some cases this material is
locally derived and may contain anomalous Au values, although typically it does not. At this time, different overburden units (gravels, laterite,
alluvium, etc.) have not been modelled separately. The average thickness of overburden is 10 m.
The  saprolite  model  represents  in-situ  weathered  rock.  Saprolite  proximal  to  mineralized  fresh  rock  may  be  mineralized.  Saprolite  includes
residual soils, gossans, clays and less intensely weathered rock termed “saprock”. The average thickness of saprolite is 5 m.
The fresh rock model includes all unweathered rock, both mineralized and un-mineralized. Most of the mineralization of interest is in fresh rock.
Procedure for Building Weathering Domain Models
For the purposes of the weathering models only, drillhole collars were pressed to the LiDAR topographic surface to alleviate localized conflicts
between surveyed collars and surveyed topography. The overburden / saprolite and saprolite / fresh surfaces were built using logged geology. In
areas beyond drilling, the surfaces were projected using the trend from drillhole data.
Occasionally, if very close spaced drilling had conflicting logging, one of the conflicting drillholes was not used in surface creation in order to
make a valid / useable surface. This process has no material effect on the final model.
The  weathering  domain  model  covers  an  area  well  beyond  the  limits  of  the  resource  block  model  to  assist  with  other  project  planning
requirements. Local variability is not represented in the model beyond drilling; this is not considered an issue as there is limited variability in the
area supported by drilling.

Mineralization Domains
Review of statistics by logged geological parameters identified the need for additional domaining for grade estimation. Mineralization domains at
nominal  grade  thresholds  of  0.1  g/t,  0.5  g/t,  1.0  g/t  and  2.5  g/t  were  implicitly  modelled  as  3D  solids  using  Leapfrog  software.  The  overall
interpretation and dimensions of the mineralization domains were controlled by zones of high pyrite which were superimposed on the lithology
model which considered regional folding and faulting. An example mineralization domain cross section is shown on Figure 14.5.1. Figure 14.5.2
shows a long section and Figure 14.5.3 shows a level. The 3D solids were coded to the block model as listed in Table 14.5.3. The minimum sub-cell
size used for coding blocks was 2.5 x 5 x 2.5 m.

EDA (described above) completed on gold assays by logged geological parameters showed increased gold grades with increased percent pyrite.
By association the higher grade mineralization domains as modelled should have higher percent pyrite which is shown on Figure 14.5.4. The
statistics for logged percent pyrite by modelled mineralization domains show higher averages and overall distributions of (logged) percent pyrite
with the higher grade mineralization domains as modelled.

Gold grade statistics by mineralization domain are shown on Figure 14.5.5, Table 14.5.4 (fresh rock), and Table 14.5.5 (saprolite). Mineralization
domains reasonably partition the grade distribution such that average gold grades are higher for the higher grade domains and the variability for
each domain is relatively low.

Contact Analysis
Average gold grades by distance from the mineralization domain contact were plotted on ‘contact plots’ for the contact between domain 101 and
105 (Figure 14.5.6), domain 105 and 110 (Figure 14.5.7) and domain 110 and 125 (Figure 14.5.8). All plots show a 2 to 3 m transitional increase (or
decrease, depending on direction) in grades when moving away from the contact, and not a sharp, distinct change in grade.

High Grade Shoot
A  solid  model  was  built  of  the  ‘high  grade  shoot’  which  generally  outlines  the  continuously  mineralized  area  (Au  >1.5  g/t)  that  strikes
approximately N-S with a shallow plunge (-10° to -15°). The smaller high grade areas in the hanging wall are outside the high grade shoot. This
solid was built to potentially allow application of different dilution scenarios, not for grade estimation. For this phase of work, this solid was not
used.

Evaluation of Outliers, Compositing and Variography
14.6.1
Evaluation of Outliers
Capping  levels  were  determined  using  decile  analysis  and  lognormal  probability  plots.  Assays  above  the  capping  thresholds  were  viewed
spatially;  they  are  distributed  throughout  the  higher  grade  portions  of  the  deposit  and  no  discreet  high  grade  pods  (above  the  capping
thresholds) were observed.
Uncapped and capped assay gold grade statistics for fresh rock (refer to Table 14.5.4) and saprolite (Table 14.5.5) show that all domains, even
before capping, have low variability (suggested by the low CVs) except for the 110 and 125 domains for saprolite.

A down-hole composite length of 2 m was chosen based on the proposed mining method, having a multiple of the average sample length, grade
variability  across  the  domains  and  mineralized  domain  thicknesses.  New  composites  were  started  at  tagged  mineralization  domain  changes.
Composite  lengths  vary  a  small  amount  to  avoid  small  “residual”  composites  at  the  end  of  intervals.  Assay  grades  were  capped  prior  to
compositing.  The  Fekola  resource  estimate  is  informed  by  a  total  of  24,101  composites.  Statistics  on  capped  2  m  gold  grade  composites  by
mineralization domain are shown on Table 14.6.2.

Variograms  (correlograms)  were  run  (on  2  m  capped  composites)  and  modelled  for  each  mineralization  domain  separately  and  all  domains
combined to evaluate gold grade spatial continuity and trends. The variogram models are listed on Tables 14.6.3 through 14.6.7. For all domains
combined, domain 105 (0.5 to 1.0 g/t), and domain 110 (1.0 to 2.5 g/t) the direction of greatest continuity is at azimuth 347 to 351°, with a shallow
dip ranging from -10° to -14°. The variogram ranges are 101 m, 181 m, and 205 m for all domains, domain 105 and domain 110, respectively.
Domain 101 (0.1 to 0.5 g/t) and domain 125 (>2.5 g/t) do not show a strong down plunge anisotropy. Domain 101 typically occurs as a narrow low
grade halo surrounding the higher grade domains. Domain 125 is more podlike than domains 110 and 105; additionally splitting the down-plunge
shoot from the hanging wall areas may give better variograms.

Resource Block Model
14.7.1
Block Model Dimensions
A Datamine sub-celled block model was used as the basis for resource estimation. This model was re-blocked to a whole block of 5 x 10 x 5 m for
resource reporting. The model was re-blocked to 5 x 20 x 10 m and converted to a percent model for mine planning work. Both the 5 x 10 x 5 m
model used for resource reporting and the 5 x 20 x 10 m used for mine planning are regularized to the whole block size.
Block model specifications are listed in Table 14.7.1 and block model fields are on Table 14.7.2.

Gold Grade Estimation
Mineralization domain wireframes were coded to the blocks using sub-cells (minimum 2.5 x 5 x 2.5 m); the coded blocks were used as grade
estimation domains. Gold grades were estimated into parent blocks (5 x 20 x 10 m) with Ordinary Kriging (OK) from 2 m capped composites for
each domain. Dynamic anisotropic searching was used. This method of searching changes the orientation of the search ellipse during estimation
to match the orientation of the triangulations of the solid model. Simplified overall orientation zones were used for this. The sub-cell model was re-
blocked to 5 x 10 x 5 m whole blocks to account for the gradational change in gold grades seen at the domain contacts. Composites were shared
across the saprolite / fresh boundary for estimation. In areas where saprolite is mineralized the mineralized portion looks similar in the saprolite
relative to fresh. Grades were not estimated in overburden.
OK and Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimations were run, with mineral resources reported from the OK estimate. The estimation plan is presented in
Table 14.7.3. Blocks that did not receive an estimated OK grade were assigned a gold grade of 0 g/t and a density value based on the weathering
domain.

Discussion of Re-blocking
Mineral Resources are reported from the re-blocked 5 x 10 x 5 m block model. The minimum sub-cell size of 2.5 m in the X and Z directions were re-
blocked to 5m. The re-blocking accounts for the gradational change in grade observed over 2 to 3 m from the domain contacts as shown on
contact plots (refer to Section 14.5.5) and on drillhole cross sections.
Mine planning was carried out on the re-blocked 5 x 20 x 10 m block model. The impact of re-blocking depends on cutoff grade. At 0.8 g/t Au cut-
off, there is a 14% reduction in grade and 2% reduction in ounces when comparing the sub-celled model to the 5 x 20 x 10 m regularized block
model, within an optimized resource pit. At 1.1 g/t Au cutoff there is a 5% reduction in grade and 8% reduction in ounces.

Model Validation
Block grade estimates categorized as Indicated and Inferred were validated using the following four methods:
•
•
•
•
Visual comparison of block grades to composites on cross sections and levels.
Comparison of global block statistics for the NN and OK Models.
Swath plots to review potential local biases in the estimates.
Comparison to previous models.
14.8.1
Visual Comparison of Composites to Block Grade Estimates
Block grade estimates were visually inspected relative to drillhole composite grades on sections and levels using paper plots and on screen. An
example cross section through the block model is shown on Figure 14.8.1 and a level is shown on Figure 14.8.2.
The following observations are made:
Mineralization domains coincide with the current structural and lithological understanding of the deposit as well as help control over projection of
higher grade into areas with lower grade drilling.

Local grade variability is sometimes high; however, block grade estimates reasonably represent composite grades.
The “hanging wall” area has more grade variability than the main high grade shoot. It is possible that mining these areas will return higher tonnes and
lower grade than estimated. More selective mining may be warranted in this area.

Swath Plots
A check on local bias was done using swath plots showing (above 0 g/t cut-off) ‘raw’ 2 m composite grades, de-clustered composites using cell
de-clustering and NN estimation, and OK grades from both the sub-celled and re-blocked resource-reporting grades. The ‘swath plots’ show mean
grades by easting, northing and elevation through the Fekola resource model. The model grades for Indicated and Inferred blocks (not within the
conceptual pit) were included in the comparison. A set was run for each mineralization domain and overall all domains. The graphs from the
overall comparison are shown on Figures 14.8.3 to 14.8.5.
Coloured lines on the plots are described below:
•
•
•
•
•
Yellow Line: Native Mean.
Cyan Line: Cell de-clustered.
Green Line: Re-blocked (5 x 10 x 5) OK – Resource Grade.
Dark Blue Line: Sub-cell OK Grade (Prior to re-blocking).
Red Line: NN Estimate – de-clustered.
Generally the OK curves are somewhat smoothed relative to the two declustered (NN and cell) distributions. The re-blocked distribution is slightly
smoother than the sub-celled distribution, as expected. The OK estimates appear somewhat low in the lower grade domains when compared to
cell and NN declustered means. Areas with large differences between the different estimations generally correspond to areas with a small number
of composites, usually occurring at the flanks of the deposit where drill density is lower and blocks are more likely to be in the inferred category.

Comparison to Previous Resource Models
Previous  mineral  resource  estimates  completed  by  MPR  (January  2013  and  August  2013,  as  reported  in  B2Gold,  2014)  are  multiple  indicator
kriged  (MIK)  models  that  are  solely  based  on  distributions  of  grade.  The  approach  used  to  build  B2Gold’s  February  2015  block  model
incorporates  the  current  geological  understanding  of  the  deposit.  Other  important  differences  between  the  two  models  include  no  Measured
Resources and a reduction in the outer limits of Indicated and Inferred resources in the February 2015 relative to the previous block models. Table
14.8.2 shows a summary comparison of salient differences in modelling methodology. Table 14.8.3 shows a comparison of the previous mineral
resource  results  to  the  current  one,  at  selected  cut-off  grades.  At  a  gold  cut-off  grade  of  0.6  g/t,  the  new  model  has  16.4%  fewer  ounces  in
Indicated compared to Measured plus Indicated Resources in the previous model, and a 31.4% increase in Inferred ounces relative to the previous
model. The change in resource classification criteria as applied in the new model highlights areas with limited drill information. Additional drilling
is planned with the goal to convert Inferred Resources in critical areas to Indicated Resources.

Recommendations
The following recommendations are made with respect to the Mineral Resource estimate:
Additional  drilling  is  needed  in  the  hanging  wall  zone  to  confirm  mineralization  controls,  grade  continuity  and  the  extent  of  the  high  grade
Additional  drilling  is  needed  in  the  hanging  wall  zone  to  confirm  mineralization  controls,  grade  continuity  and  the  extent  of  the  high  grade
mineralization domains.
Before production commences, closer spaced drilling (on the order of 20 x 20 m) is needed to assess close spaced variability to allow testing of
appropriate grade control drill spacing.
Other non-linear estimation techniques, such as conditional simulation should be run as a confirmation to the grade tonnage curve.

CIM definitions were used for Mineral Reserves.
The Qualified Person for Mineral Reserves is Peter Montano, P.E.
All Mineral Reserves were classified as Probable, based on the Indicated Mineral Resources.
The Mineral Reserve cutoff grade is 0.8 g/t Au based on a US$1,300/oz gold price.
The average metallurgical recovery is 92.8%, and the waste to ore ratio is 4.5:1 for Mineral Reserves.
The block model was internally diluted at the SMU size of 5 m E x 20 m N x 10 m RL. In addition, a waste dilution factor of 5%
was applied in conversion to the Mineral Reserves to account for mining factors.

Basis of Estimate
At the request of B2Gold, the mine design and mine planning for the OFS undertaken by Mining Solutions Consultancy Pty Ltd. The mining study
and the resultant Mineral Reserve estimate relied on the information from the following sources:
Mr. Montano visited the site twice, 4 to 8 August 2014 and 7 to 11 December 2014. During these visits Mr. Montano visited the pit area, viewed a
variety of ore and waste core, and toured the site in general. Mr. Montano also met with the geology team at the Fadougou camp and with office
personnel in Bamako.
Geotechnical appraisal and pit slope recommendations were provided by George, Orr and Associates (GOA) for feasibility study purposes in June
2014.
Hydrogeological investigation results including ground water modelling and pit dewatering estimates were provided by Knight Piesold Consulting (KP)
in September 2014.

Environmental and social impact assessment for the project was provided by Epoch Resources Pty Ltd (Epoch) as part of the PFS in April 2013. The
assessment is currently under revision to incorporate the current OFS results.
The February 2015 resource model update was provided by B2Gold in early March 2015, and compared to the previous (MPR, August 2013) resource
estimate.
General administration, processing costs and process recovery estimates were provided by B2Gold in consultation with the Lycopodium Minerals Pty
Ltd (Lycopodium) in March 2015, and revised in May 2015.
The  mining  productivity  and  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  information  received  from  major  equipment  suppliers  in  March  2015,  which  is
complemented with the data available from similar projects and operations.
Mining parameters and mining costs were collated and estimated by Mining Solution Consultancy Pty Ltd (MSC) in consultation with B2Gold based on
the experience, site visit findings, and the information received from the sources above.
The major tasks completed in the mining study for reserve estimation include the definition and review of study parameters, pit limit optimisations,
cut-off grade analysis, and mine design.
As reported in Section 16, the production scheduling, mining equipment selection, and estimation of mining costs in the OFS further confirmed
the basis of the mine design and the resultant Mineral Reserve estimate.
15.3
Pit Optimisation Key Assumptions
15.3.1
Resource Model
The pit optimisations and reserve estimates are based on the February 2015 resource model, as discussed in Section 14. The resources in the
model were classified into Indicated and Inferred categories in compliance and accordance with the disclosure requirements of NI 43-101 and the
CIM Definition Standards. Also in accordance with the requirements, only the Indicated category resources were used in the mining study and
resultant  reserve  estimates.  The  sensitivity  of  the  open  pits  for  the  inclusion  of  the  Inferred  resources  was  investigated  separately  in  pit
optimisations.
The updated surfaces for the topography, weathering zones and block densities were provided by B2Gold. The surfaces were compared to the
earlier data before using in pit optimisations and volume / tonnage calculations.
The  February  2015  block  model  used  in  the  study  contained  the  average  gold  grade  estimate,  resource  classification,  weathering  zone
classification, and density values for a regular block size of 5mE x 20mN x 10mRL. The grade estimate for the whole blocks was expected to
incorporate sufficient internal dilution in representing the selective mining unit (SMU) for open pit mining.

As part of the block model review process, the grade-tonnage data reported within the pit limits was compared to the previous (MPR August 2013)
resource estimate. The variation of the resource estimates generated by B2Gold at different block (SMU) sizes were compared to the continuity,
extent, dip, and plunge of the ore zones for an assessment of the dilution and ore loss assumptions.
After the reviews, a waste dilution factor of 5% and ore recovery factor of 100% was applied globally to the block model used in the mining study.
The mining cost estimates include the grade control drilling and sampling costs to achieve sufficient data resolution for the delineation of the ore
outlines.
15.3.3
Geotechnical Considerations
The geotechnical appraisal and pit slope recommendations for the study were provided by George, Orr and Associates (GOA).
Ground conditions in the proposed Fekola staged pits have been interpreted from evaluations made on geotechnical borehole cores (including
use  of  an  optical  and  acoustic  imaging  televiewer  device),  unconfined  compressive  strength  (UCS)  tests  carried  out  on  representative  core
samples, and local structural geological conditions.
Future wall stability is expected to be governed principally by the presence, attitude, and shear strength parameters of the geological structures
occurring within the walls. Limited analyses have been performed to assess the stability against large scale wall collapses (rotational wall failures).
Zones of highly fractured rock (termed “broken core zones”) occur in the hanging- and foot-walls of the Fekola Fault. North-easterly striking faults
are also inferred to occur at the deposit. Bedrock is covered by an approximately 10 to 15 m thick layer of transported (pebbly) alluvium.
The two dimensional stability analysis results imply that the future wall stability against potential rotational collapses affecting the integrity of the
whole slope will remain adequate for mining purposes. This is provided that slopes are not mined at steeper overall angles than recommended
and the effective wall depressurisation (i.e. dewatering, particularly in the east wall of the Stage 5 Pit) is carried out.
The pit wall slope design domains around the pit perimeter and the associated overall slope angles (OS) are shown in Figure 15.3.1. The overall
slope angles vary from 40 to 45° around the pit rim, depending on mainly the extent and location of the broken core zones. The effect of access
ramps on the pit walls were allowed in the definition of the overall slope angles.

Base Mining Cost Estimate
The preliminary owner mining cost estimates were derived from the initial mining equipment productivity and cost estimates. The estimates were
compared  to  the  previous  contract  mining  costs  and  the  cost  data  for  similar  projects.  The  equipment  ownership  costs  were  included  in  the
estimates for pit optimisation purposes, considering the relatively long mine life compared to the life cycle of the equipment.
The  cost  of  mining  the  first  bench  at  the  surface  is  estimated  at  US$  2.50/t  mined.  After  adjusting  the  costs  for  blasting  requirements,  an
incremental haulage cost of US$ 0.026/t per 10 m bench was applied to account for additional haulage costs as the pits deepen. The average
mining cost reported for the optimal pit shell is US$ 3.15/t mined, which includes the equipment ownership cost of US$ 0.35/t.

The  OFS  mining  equipment  and  cost  models  were  finalised  after  the  preparation  of  the  production  schedule.  The  initial  average  mining  cost
estimate was revised from US$ 2.80/t to US$ 2.58/t in the final estimate. The capital cost for the mining equipment was reported separately in the
final cost schedules.
15.3.5
Throughput Costs
The mining study was initially based on 5 Mtpa processing rate, which was revised to 4 Mtpa in May 2015 after the completion of the pit designs.
The  processing  and  general  &  administration  costs  for  the  4  Mtpa  base  case  in  Table  15.3.1  were  provided  by  B2Gold  in  consultation  with
Lycopodium.
The mining component of the throughput cost was revised from US$ 1.99/t ore in pit optimisation to US$ 2.24/t ore (+ 10%) in the final operating
cost estimates.

Gold Price, Royalty and Discounting
A gold price of US$ 1,300/oz was used in the pit optimisations and the calculation of the break-even cut-off grade for reserves reporting. The pit
optimisation sensitivities included the variation of ±15% (US$ 1,100/oz and US$ 1,500/oz) around the base case gold price.
The 7.65% royalty was deducted from the revenue by using the net gold price after royalty in pit optimisations. The operating cash flows were
discounted at 5% per annum to calculate the indicative NPV values for the comparison of optimal pit shells and production schedule options.
15.3.7
Process Recovery and Cutoff Grades
The grade dependent equation used for the estimation of the process recoveries was derived from the test work results plotted in Figure 15.3.2.
The 1% reduction is to scale the laboratory test results to the processing plant conditions in the recovery equation:
•
Expected Gold Recovery (%) = 1.6705 ln(x) + 92.218 - 1.0
Figure 15.3.2 Gold Extraction v Head Grade (B2Gold, May 15)
Table 15.3.2 below outlines the calculated gold recoveries for the life of mine average grade, the scheduled high and low grade mill feeds, and the
reserve cut-off grade.
The block model cut-off grade of 0.80 g/t used in the reserve estimate is based on the 92.8% process recovery and the throughput cost, gold price,
royalty, and dilution parameters reported in the sub-sections above.

Pit optimisations were carried out using Whittle Four-X pit optimisation software. For the given block model, cost, recovery and slope data, Whittle
Four-X software determines a series of incremental pit shells, in which each shell is an optimum for a slightly higher price factor.
In the analysis of the incremental pit shells, indicative net present values (NPV) are calculated by discounting the preliminary cash flows over time.
The reported NPVs in pit optimisation results are indicative operating values for relative comparison purposes only.
As well as the indicative NPVs, the incremental operating cost per ounce for the pit shells is also reported to guide the pit shell selection and
design process.
In addition to the base case pit optimisation to determine the ultimate pit limits, further optimisations were carried out to determine the sensitivities
around the base case results.

The mining costs in pit optimisation reports include the ownership cost for mining equipment approximately.
The mining cost estimate for pit design is adjusted to include the equipment ownership cost on the same basis approximately.
The final (base + throughput) mining cost estimate is 7% lower than the preliminary cost in pit optimisation on the same $ /t basis.
As seen in 15.4.1, the pit design is significantly (18%) larger than the optimal pit shell 33 due to the revision of the throughput from 5 Mtpa to 4
Mtpa in May 2015 after the completion of the mine design. However, the comparison of the values in Table 15.4.1 confirms the economic basis of
the pit design as follows:
•
•
•
•
The ore tonnage, total tonnage and the recovered ounces reported for the pit design are within 1% of the pit shell 39 quantities.
The indicative NPVs do not change significantly for the expansion from pit shell 33 to pit shell 39.
The operating NPV for the pit design is slightly higher (+3%) than the both pit shells 33 and 39.
Based on the above points, pit shell 39 can be accepted as the optimal for the pit design rather than the initially selected pit shell 33.
For the base case pit shell sequence, the incremental and cumulative unit operating costs (US$/oz) are plotted against the optimal pit resource
tonnage in Figure 15.4.2. The cost curves are relatively flat and the average cost is below US$ 500/oz up to 30 million tonnes of resource reported
within the pit shell 15. This relatively high grade and low stripping ratio resource generates 88% of the operating NPV of the project. Hence, the
staged pit development strategy improves the cash flow in the earlier years of the schedule and reduces the capital payback period significantly.

As expected, the optimal pit size and operating value is most sensitive to a change in the gold price. A variation of ±15% in gold price causes a
change of approximately ±30% in the operating cash flow, ±10% in the recovered ounces, and -25% and +15% in the total tonnes mined.
The optimal pit size is moderately sensitive to 15% increase in the throughput or mining costs, resulting in a reduction of approximately -20% in
the optimal pit size and -5 to -10% in recovered ounces. The -5% decrease in the operating NPV is less significant.
Although the inclusion of the Inferred resources add approximately 18% to the optimal pit resource tonnes and 25% to the total tonnes mined, the
additional resources (8 Mt) are relatively low grade (2.0 g/t) and high stripping ratio (6.6:1 t:t). The Inferred resources can potentially add 7% to the
operating NPV of the Project.
Ramping up the throughput rate from 4 Mtpa to 5 Mtpa can potentially increase the pit size by 5%, mined resource tonnage by 15% and indicative
operating NPV by 8% (US$ 130 million).
A ±3° change in the overall slope angles affects the operating NPV of the project within a ±4% range.

The plan view of series of optimal pit shells in Figure 15.4.2 shows the extents of the ultimate pit limits as the gold price varies. The lowest cost pit
development starts at the southern end of the deposit where the high grade core mineralisation is closest to the surface, then expands deeper to
the north following the plunge of the high grade core.
The most sensitive areas for the variation of the study parameters are to the north where the stripping ratio is higher and at the southwest where
the mineralisation outside the main orebody is patchy and low grade. In general, the pit limits to the west and east do not change significantly as
the relatively well defined high grade mineralisation drives the pit floor in the optimisation process.

The staged pit development strategy was the key in the production schedules to  defer  the  waste  mining  requirements  and  bring  forward  the
mining of high grade ore. The 320 m deep ultimate pit is planned for development in a sequence of seven 150 to 250 m wide and 500 to 750 m long
stages (cutbacks).
The staged pit development will also mitigate the geological, geotechnical and economic risks for the project considering the 1.9 km length of the
proposed Fekola open pit. The design of the future pit stages during the operations, especially the last two stages with higher production cost per
ounce,  can  be  adjusted  progressively  depending  on  the  operational  experience,  exposed  ground  conditions  and  changes  in  economic
conditions.
The cutbacks need to be accessed through temporary ramps in the initial stage of development from the surface. The majority of these temporary
ramps will be mined after acting as catch (safety) berms between the successive cutbacks mined at different levels. The remaining ramps on the
final pit walls will act as geotechnical berms (i.e. wider berms to limit the inter-ramp slope angle) to form a “stacked” slope design.
15.5.2
Pit Design Criteria
The definition of the pit slope domains and the recommended slope design parameters used in the pit optimisations and designs are detailed in
Table 15.5.1. The slope design may vary slightly at the lower levels of the pit design to maximise the ore recovery where the access ramps can act
as berms.

An average cutback width of 200 m was maintained in the design of the six consecutive cutbacks expanding the pit from south to the north. The
size of the last cutback Stage 7 at the southwest is relatively small, but this will not be an issue operationally towards the end of the mine life as the
processing of the low grade stockpiles will start.

A minimum mining width of 25 m (dual lane ramp width) was adopted for the floor of the ultimate pit design. The temporary floors of the pit stages
were designed wider (~40 m) not to constrain the mining equipment unnecessarily as these floors would be mined in the subsequent pit stage.
15.5.3
Road and Ramp Design Criteria
A nominal ramp and road width of 25 m, including drainage and safety windrow, was used for dual lane truck operation in the mine design. Ramp
widths were reduced to 15 m in mining the lower levels of the Stage 6 and 7 cutbacks developing the final pit walls. Passing bays were provided at
approximately 200 m intervals for the single lane section of the ramps. A ramp gradient of up to 1 in 9 (11%) was used in the mine design for both
single and dual lane ramps.
15.5.4
Waste Storage Facility Design Criteria
An overall slope angle of 18° was used in the design of the waste dump faces with the 5 m berms located at 10 m vertical intervals.
The temporary ramp exits from the pit stages were designed to distribute the waste across the waste storage areas and the TSF embankment. The
size and height of the two waste dumps at the southwest and northeast were adjusted to minimise the haulage costs and leave the mineralisation
corridor open to the south for potential development of shallow pits (or sterilisation) in the future.
15.6
Pit Stage Designs
The Fekola ultimate pit design shown in Figure 15.6.1 is maximum 1.9 km long, 750 m wide and 320 m deep. The plan view of the seven cutbacks
designed to for the development of the ultimate pit limits is shown in Figure 15.6.2. The perspective and section views of the pit stages can be
seen in Figure 15.6.3.
The Stage 1 pit design shown in Figure 15.6.4 is 400 m wide, 800 m long and 160 m deep, relatively large compared to the subsequent cutbacks to
sustain the required 4 Mtpa high grade ore production rate at the start of the operations. The starter pit targets the relatively higher grade and
shallower mineralisation at the south end of the deposit.
The two ramps developed in Stage 1 pit from the east for accessing the ROM pad and from the west for accessing the waste storage facility will
join at approximately 50 m depth. The established ramp system will continue further north to serve the deeper levels of the subsequent cutbacks
as the pit expands in this direction.

The Stage 2 cutback (Figure 15.6.4) will initially be accessed via two temporary ramps developed at the north wall again for ore haulage to the east
and  waste  haulage  to  the  west.  The  temporary  ramps  will  cut-off  at  approximately  at  100  m  depth  as  the  lower  levels  of  Stage  2  pit  will  be
accessible via the main ramp developed in Stage 1.
The above pattern for Stage 2 ramp system will be repeated in the development of further cutbacks to the north as seen in Figure 15.6.4.
Both the temporary and main ramp systems will be developed deeper to access the mining of the lower levels. The access to the lower levels of
the earlier cutbacks will be maintained while the new cutbacks developed.

15.7.1
Cut-off Grades for Ore Classification
The 1.1 g/t mill feed cut-off grade was determined as optimal for the early production years based on NPV analyses in pit optimisations. The higher
cut-off grade improved the operating NPV of the project significantly (~8%) compared to processing at the break-even cut-off grade.
The cut-off grades used to classify the ore types in the open pit mining inventory and production schedules are as follows:
•
•
•
•
The break-even cut-off grade is 0.8 g/t gold as used to classify the Mineral Reserves.
The ore between 0.8 g/t and 1.1 g/t gold is classified as low grade (LG) for stockpiling and processing at the end of the mine life.
The ore between 1.1 - 1.5 g/t cut-off is classified as medium grade (MG) for processing as necessary to meet processing feed tonnage requirements,
along with the high grade ROM ore.
The ore above 1.5 g/t grade is classified as high grade (HG) for ROM processing over the mine life.
The ore above 1.5 g/t grade is classified as high grade (HG) for ROM processing over the mine life.
The mill feed cut-off grade will vary through mine life depending on the availability of the ore stocks and grades mined in the cutbacks.
15.7.2
Mining Inventory by Cut-off Grade and Pit Stages
Table 15.7.1 below summarises pit stage mining inventory for the ore types used in the production schedules. The estimated production cost per
recovered  ounce  increases  from  US$  450/oz  in  the  first  pit  stage  to  US$  810/oz  in  the  Stage  6  cutback  as  the  stripping  ratio  increases.  The
estimated production cost is highest at US$ 1,000/oz for the Stage 7 cutback, due to the significantly lower (1.44 g/t) grade of the mined ore.
The review of continuity of the high grade core and the resource grade-tonnage distribution showed that the cut-off grades up to 1.5 g/t can be
sustained for selective mining on the mining benches. The exception to this will be the low grade mineralisation mined in Stage 7, which will not be
an issue as the mill feed cut-off grade will be lower and the lower grade stockpiles will be blended towards the end of mine life.

Waste classification includes the sub-grade material reported between 0.5 to 0.8 g/t gold grade.
LG Ore – Low Grade Ore classification is between 0.8 to 1.1 g/t gold grade.
MG Ore – Medium Grade Ore classification is between 1.1 to 1.5 g/t gold grade.
HG Ore – High Grade Ore classification is above 1.5 g/t gold grade.
An average recovery of 92.8% was used to calculate the recovered ounces.
The reported production cost per ounce is based on average unit costs applied to pit design and optimization for comparison purposes.
Note that this is similar to but not the same as the final operating and production costs (see Sections 21 and 22).
The operating cost is reported, including preproduction prestrip and excluding royalty and capital costs.
15.8
Waste Storage Facility Designs and Site Layout
The proposed site plan in Figure 15.8.1 includes the extents of the ultimate pit design, waste storage facility designs, mine roads, stockpile areas,
ROM pad, and mining service area. The site plan and infrastructure requirements will be detailed in the finalisation of the OFS.
The  TSF  embankment  design,  mining  structures,  roads,  and  drainage  layout  were  integrated  at  the  east  of  the  proposed  site  plan  for  better
utilisation of the available area, reducing the site establishment and maintenance requirements.
The water drainage from the waste storage facilities, stockpiles and spill from the open pits will be controlled through two settlement ponds before
discharging  to  the  river  at  the  west.  The  settlement  ponds  will  be  located  on  the  proposed  drainage  channel  at  the  south  and  in  the  small
catchment to the northwest of the southwest waste facility.
All the waste mined from the earlier cutbacks will be hauled to the southwest facility except the waste required for the construction of the early
stages of the TSF embankment. The smaller east waste storage facility and the TSF embankment will be reserved mostly for the waste mined from
the upper levels of the later pit stages at the north. All the waste mined from the lower levels of the cutbacks will be hauled to the southwest waste
facility through the main ramp.

None of the high risks identified are considered as fatal flaws for the Project with “minor” to “moderate” impacts, due to the relatively favourable
characteristics of the Fekola deposit. The pit optimisation sensitivity analysis results in Section 15.4.3 provide a quantitative assessment of the
potential impacts of changing conditions on the project.
The pit limits are not sensitive to change in the study parameters except the last two pit stages containing 11% (5.5 Mt) of Mineral Reserves. These
stages will be committed in the fifth year of operations, well after the capital payback period of approximately 2.25 years.
The strip ratio is relatively low for the first four pit stages, containing 80% (39 Mt) of the Mineral Reserve tonnage and 80% (3 Moz) of the Mineral
Reserve ounces, and is generally low (4.5:1 t/t) overall. The comparative unit costs (US$/oz) reported for the pit stages show that the first four pit
stages would be viable economically to mine for gold prices down to US$ 700/oz.
To mitigate the potential impacts, the high risks identified for the OFS will require monitoring and preparation in the operations stage, especially
during the early years of the operations.

It can be concluded that there are no impacts currently identified that would prevent the project going ahead. Provided that the monitoring of the
conditions and accordingly planning of the operations are carried out, there are no impacts currently identified that would affect the mining plans
and the Mineral Reserve estimates materially.

16.0 MINING
16.1.1
General Definition
The selected mining method for the Project is conventional open pit mining with all operations carried out by B2Gold. All values and results
reported are on a 100% B2Gold ownership basis.
The open pit mine life is 9.5 years for the development of 320 m deep ultimate pit in a sequence of seven stages (cutbacks). The base case mine
production schedule involves the movement of 32 Mtpa material to sustain processing of 4 Mtpa of high grade (~3 g/t gold) ore. The processing of
the 14 Mt of stockpiled low grade (~1 g/t gold) ore is scheduled for processing towards the end of the mine life.
As upside potential B2Gold considers that part of the stockpiled low and medium grade ore can potentially be processed in the ROM feed at
marginal cost, as the processing plant was designed for the 4 Mtpa nameplate capacity with a 25% (1 Mtpa) design factor.
In general, three cutbacks will be mined simultaneously to expose sufficient ore stocks to sustain the plant feed through mine life. Mostly ore will
be mined from the most advanced cutback at depth. The second cutback will be catching up to expose more ore at depth as the waste pre-
stripping is completed. Mostly waste will be mined in the third cutback at the upper levels to expose future ore on time. This pattern will repeat as
the mining in the first cutback is completed and replaced with the ore mining in the second cutback and a new cutback is started at the top of the
open pit.
16.1.2
Shifts and Personnel
The mining operations are scheduled to work 330 days in a year. It is assumed that 35 days production in a year will be lost due to unscheduled
delays, such as those occurring during the high rainfall events. The processing plant is scheduled to operate 24 hours continuously except for
planned maintenance periods. The mill feed will be supplied from the ROM ore stockpiles while the mine is not producing ore feed.
The mining workforce will be accommodated in the surrounding villages and towns, and be bussed to and from the mine on a shift basis. The
senior staff will be accommodated in the village established as part of the mine site.
It is assumed in the manpower estimates in Table 16.1.1 that the mine operations will be based on 3 x 8 hour shifts. Sufficient standby personnel
were allowed for the roster off and other leaves. The number of expatriate staff will be reduced over time as the local staff is developed.
The majority of the mining administration, supervision and technical personnel listed in Table 16.1.1 will work on the day shift on a 2 on 1 off basis.

Mining Equipment
Table  16.1.2  lists  the  start-up  and  peak  mining  equipment  requirements  for  the  Project  during  the  first  eight  years  of  production.  The  truck
numbers will increase from 16 in the pre-stripping period to 34 as the haul distances increase with the deepening of the mined cutbacks. The
excavator numbers will peak in the ramp up period early in the production schedule with addition of six trucks to the initial fleet at the start of
mining in Stage 2.
The three PC2000 (or similar) shovels will work on 10m high waste mining benches. The two PC1250 (or similar) backhoes will be mainly used to
mine ore selectively and to mine difficult areas. The ancillary equipment numbers will peak at the end of second year of the schedule as the mining
in the three cutbacks and waste dumping faces advance.
The proposed equipment fleet will provide relative flexibility in the utilisation as three pit stages will be mined simultaneously to mine waste and
ore at different levels.

Grade Control
In grade control of the mining benches, the sampling will commence with the RC drilling ahead of the mining front to assist the short and medium
term mine planning processes. The holes will be angled at 60 degrees from the hanging wall side of the ore zones to provide a good intersection
with the mineralised structures.
The grade control will be based on drilling of 140 mm diameter 20 m long RC holes and sampling practice at 1.5 m intervals along the holes. The
samples will be tested in the onsite laboratory. A three stage grade control programme was proposed for the project as follows:
•
•
•
20 m x 40 m pattern infill drilling of the entire mining benches.
10 m x 20 m pattern drilling in the zones identified for ore recovery.
5 m x 10 m pattern drilling in the zones with less continuity (usually peripheral zones with higher grade variability).
The proposed grade control programme provides data coverage of approximately three months in advance with some overlap between the drilled
levels.
16.1.5
Ore Handling
The mill feed ore will be transported from open pits to the ROM pad for direct tipping or stockpiling. It is assumed that 50% of the ROM feed needs
to be stockpiled to regulate the mine production and crusher feed rates.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - MINING METHODS
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 16.4
The stockpiled ore will be loaded to the crusher with a Cat 988K loader or equivalent. It is planned to maintain approximately three to four week’s
ore supply on the ROM pad in the form of stockpile fingers to control the head grades.
16.2
Drilling Blasting
The  production  drilling,  blasting,  and  waste  mining  operations  will  be  carried  out  in  general  at  10  m  benches.  It  is  expected,  as  required  by
geological conditions, that 5 m bench blasting will be required in places for mining at two 2.5 m flitches to achieve a higher degree of selectivity.
The  powder  factor  estimates  in  Table  16.2.1  depends  on  the  weathering  degree,  rock  strength  and  associated  rock  densities.  The  weighted
average powder factor is calculated to be 0.75 kg/bcm (ANFO Equivalent) for the total volume mined.

Five large and three small drills will be required for the drill and blast operations, based on the powder factor and drilling productivity estimates. It
is assumed that bulk emulsion will be used throughout the operations under both dry and mostly wet conditions.
For blasting at 10 m benches, the 165 mm diameter blast hole patterns are expected to be varying from 4 m x 5 m in fresh rock to 4.8 m x 6 m in
transitional rock, depending on the variability and strength of the formations.
For blasting at 5 m benches, the 115 m diameter blast hole patterns are expected to be varying from 2.7 m x 3.4 m in fresh rock to 3.2 m x 4 m in
transition rock, depending on the variability and strength of the formations.
Free  digging,  ripping,  and  blasting  operations  in  the  weathered  zone  will  vary  according  to  the  extent  of  the  lateritised  zones  and  potentially
presence of boulders. A small excavator with rock breaker attachment may be required for the fragmentation of the oversize in the pit.
16.3
Pit Dewatering
Results of hydrogeological investigations indicate that the pre-mining groundwater table is located at depths of between 2 m and 5 m around the
proposed pit perimeter. It is currently assumed that mining operations will take place under wet conditions with borehole and in-pit de-watering
programmes in place.
It is expected that the water inflows will be higher in the first 20 to 30 m depth of the open pit development and mining through the broken rock
zones around the pit perimeter.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - MINING METHODS
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 16.5
Based on the results and limitations of the hydrogeological investigations, a groundwater inflow rate of 170 l/s is predicted for the Fekola open pit
at the end of Year 1, gradually increasing to 250 l/s at the end of Year 4. The inflow rates can be up to 410 l/s at the end of Year 4 in the worst case
scenario.
Allowances have been made in the capital and operating costs for the installation of the dewatering bore holes and in-pit dewatering. In addition to
the two existing 150 m and 160 m deep holes, nine boreholes were planned in the de-watering bore schedule with the depths varying from 180 m
to 360 m.
Groundwater level monitoring in the regional bores will continue and will also be undertaken in the dewatering bores. Drawdown in the early phase
of dewatering will be carefully monitored and managed via the recording of abstraction rates.
16.4
Environmental Monitoring and Control
Monitoring the environmental impacts and mitigation, especially the effects on the local population living in the Fadougou village, will be the key
objective of the Environmental and Social Management Plan and its implementation.
The monitoring of the air and water quality and generation of noise and vibrations will be conducted on a regular basis. The monitoring data will
be evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures will be implemented as needed.
Environmentally hazardous artificial materials, such as chemicals and rubbish, will be disposed following the appropriate standard procedures.
Dust from the pits, dumps, stockpile operations, and road surfaces will be controlled by water suppression.
The surface water from the pit and waste dumps will be treated in the settlement ponds as necessary, before releasing to the environment (or
using in the plant). The waste facilities and long-term stockpiles will be built to improve the stability and surface water drainage to minimise the
environmental impacts.
The final faces of the waste facilities will be dozed to the specified slope angles and contoured for rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of the waste
facilities will be carried out progressively as the final faces established around the perimeter.
16.5
Mine Production Schedule
The mine production schedules for the OFS were prepared on a monthly basis for the first two years of the operation and quarterly for the rest of
the mine life.
An overall summary of the base case production schedule is presented in Table 16.5.1, followed by the annual summary in Table 16.5.2.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - MINING METHODS
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 16.6
The major constraints applied in the production schedule can be summarised as follows:
•
•
•
•
Maintaining relatively constant working strip ratios and smoother mining rates for better utilisation of the mining equipment though mine life.
15% lower mine production rate during the rainy season (five months from mid June to mid November).
Maintaining approximately four week’s of mill feed stockpile on the ROM pad at reasonable grade depending on the availability of ore in the pit.
Keeping the average vertical mining advance (sink) rates generally below 60 m/year.
The sink rates will be relatively low below 40 m/year during the mining of the earlier pit stages in the first five years of the operations. The sink rates
later in mine life will increase up to 75 m/year in mining waste during the development of the deeper pit Stages 5 and 6.
The graphs in Figure 16.5.1 show that the total tonnes mined annually are constant at 32 Mtpa in the first seven years of the production schedule.
The mine production tails off in the last 2.5 years as the pre-stripping of the last pit stages completed. The scheduled feed grade is on average 0.7
g/t higher than the mined grade in the first seven years, due to the low grade stockpiling strategy. The scheduled ore types show that the mill feed
cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t in the first two years gradually drops to 1.1 g/t in the later years, and 0.8 g/t at the end of the mine life.
Evaluation  of  the  production  schedule  options  showed  that  the  ramping  up  the  throughput  rate  from  4  Mtpa  nameplate  capacity,  to  5  Mtpa,
improves the operating NPV of the Project by approximately US$ 100 M (~6.5%).

Mining Risk Assessment
The risk assessment for the operations stage of the Project has been provided in Table 16.6.1. The monitoring and analysis of the production
environment and the historical data will be critical for the continuous improvement of the operations as the mining progresses. The safety of the
personnel, achieving the production targets and management of social and environmental impacts take precedence in the operations stage.

None of the high risks identified are considered as fatal flaws for the Project with “minor” to “moderate” impacts, since the Fekola pit will be
developed progressively deeper along strike in six stages (seven stages with shallower cutback at southwest). The cutback areas are relatively
large for the operation of the equipment to sustain the scheduled production rates. The vertical advance (sink) rates are below 40 m per year in the
early years of mining.
There will be opportunity in the early years of the open pit life to monitor, evaluate, and adjust the mining plans and operations before committing
on the final pit limits. The pit optimisation sensitivity analysis results in Section 15.4.2 and the mining study limitations and recommendations in
Section 16.7 below provide further information for the impact and mitigation of the identified risks for the project.
Provided that the required monitoring of the conditions and planning of the operations are carried out especially in the early years of the mine life,
there are no impacts currently identified that would affect the mining plans and open pit operations materially.
16.7
Limitations and Recommendations
The OFS is based on long term plans to highlight any critical operational issues and provide cost estimates for the life of mine cash flow models.
Detailed planning of the roads and other site layout will be required before the implementation stage.

Monitoring the environmental impacts and mitigation, especially the effects on the local population living in the Fadougou village, will be the key
objective of the Environmental and Social Management Plan and its implementation. The drilling and blasting operations at the upper levels of the
later pit stages closer to the Fadougou village will require advanced planning and closer control based on the experience gained in the earlier pit
stages.
It will be critical for planning the in-pit dewatering that the borehole and in-pit dewatering abstraction rates are monitored especially in the early
stages  of  dewatering.  Groundwater  level  monitoring  in  the  regional  bores  should  continue  and  should  also  be  undertaken  in  the  dewatering
bores.
Additional geotechnical work will be required prior to and during mining. Geological wall mapping (including structural geological measurements),
and ongoing assessments of wall stability will be required over the operational life of the pits. Periodic reviews of wall stability will need to be
conducted. Results of this work will allow any future amendments to local wall designs required to maintain stability to be put into effect in a timely
manner.
Grade  control  will  be  required  in  advance  and  regular  reconciliation  of  the  estimated  tonnages  and  grades  in  the  mining  plans  to  actual  mill
production will be required for the adjustment of the short and medium term mining plans.
Short to medium term planning of the mining operations will ensure that there is sufficient in-pit and external stockpiles available before the rainy
seasons. The utilisation of the mining equipment in the cutbacks can also be scheduled at higher elevations during the rainy seasons.
Considering the relatively good continuity of the ore zones at Fekola, a standard ~250 t excavator (backhoe) fleet can be a viable alternative to
currently  selected  excavator  fleet.  This  option  can  improve  the  productivity  per  loading  and  hauling  capacity,  reduce  the  required  equipment
numbers slightly, and facilitate the scheduling of the standard equipment in the multiple cutbacks. However, mining at maximum 5 m benches and
potentially better rock fragmentation requirements (beneficial to lower the overall cost in any case) for this option will require closer control and
planning of the open pit operations.

Process Design
The process plant design for the Project is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum recovery with minimum operating
costs. The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.
The key criteria for equipment selection are suitability for duty, reliability and ease of maintenance. The plant layout provides ease of access to all
equipment  for  operating  and  maintenance  requirements  whilst  maintaining  a  layout  that  will  facilitate  construction  progress  in  multiple  areas
concurrently.
The key project and ore specific criteria that the plant design must meet are:
•
•
•
•
4 Mtpa of ore.
All major unit operations and equipment will be sized with a 25% design margin so the plant is expandable to a maximum throughput of 5 Mtpa without
any further design margin.
Process plant availability of 94% supported by crushed ore storage, standby equipment in critical areas and on-site HFO and diesel generator power
supply.
Sufficient automated plant control to minimise the need for continuous operator interface and allow manual override and control if and when required.
Study design documents have been prepared incorporating engineering design criteria and key metallurgical design criteria derived from the
results of the metallurgical testwork.
17.1.1
Selected Process Flowsheet
The treatment plant design incorporates the following unit process operations:
Single stage primary crushing with a gyratory crusher to produce a crushed product size of 80% passing (P80) of 150 mm.
Crushed ore stockpile with a nominal 10,000 tonne live capacity to provide 20 hours of operation at design plant throughput. During extended periods
of up to three days for primary crusher equipment maintenance, ore from the dead part of the stockpile is reclaimed by an excavator or dozer to feed the
grinding circuit.
Crushed ore from the stockpile is normally reclaimed by apron feeders positioned under the stockpile to feed the grinding circuit.

The grinding circuit is a SABC type, which consists of an open circuit SAG mill, pebble crusher for SAG mill discharge oversize and a closed circuit
ball mill to produce a P80 grind size of 75 µm.
A gravity gold recovery circuit is not included as the metallurgical testwork results do not warrant it.
Quicklime from a silo is added onto the SAG mill feed conveyor along with the crushed pebbles. Sodium cyanide solution is added to the SAG mill
feed chute to start the gold leaching process.
Hydrocyclones  are  operated  to  achieve  a  cyclone  overflow  slurry  density  of  25%  solids  to  promote  better  particle  size  separation  efficiency.
Subsequently, a leach thickener is included to increase slurry density to the leach circuit, minimise leach tank volume requirements, reduce overall
reagent consumption, and separate gold dissolved by cyanide addition to the grinding circuit.
Carbon columns (CIC) are included to recover gold already dissolved in the grinding circuit. The leach thickener overflow stream is pumped to this
carbon adsorption circuit.
•
•
•
•
•
Leach circuit with five tanks to achieve the required 24 hours of residence time at design plant throughput. Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit consisting of six
stages is a carbon adsorption circuit for recovery of remaining gold dissolved in the leaching circuit.
Zadra  elution  circuit  with  gold  recovery  to  doré.  The  circuit  includes  an  acid  wash  column  to  remove  inorganic  foulants  from  the  carbon  with
hydrochloric acid. The single elution circuit is common for both carbon adsorption circuits.
Carbon regeneration kiln to remove organic foulants from the carbon with heat. This piece of equipment is common for both carbon adsorption circuits.
Cyanide destruction circuit using SO2 and air to reduce the WAD Cyanide level in the tailings discharge stream to an environmentally acceptable
level.
Tailings thickener to increase slurry density for water recovery prior to tailings discharge to the tailings storage facility.
An overall process flow diagram depicting the unit operations incorporated in the selected process flowsheet is presented in Figure 17.1.1.
The key issues considered in process and equipment selection are outlined in the following section.

Process and Plant Description
The overall process flowsheet includes a single stage gyratory crusher and a SABC grinding circuit with a ball mill in closed circuit with cyclones
to achieve the final product size. The cyclone overflow stream will flow by gravity to two linear trash screens operating in parallel ahead of a leach
thickener. Sodium cyanide is added to the SAG mill feed to start the gold leaching process. The leach thickener overflow solution is pumped to
carbon columns to recover gold already dissolved in the grinding circuit. The thickened slurry is pumped to a leach circuit and then additional
sodium cyanide along with lead nitrate and oxygen are added for further gold leaching. A carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit will adsorb dissolved gold
onto activated carbon. A Zadra elution circuit will be used to recover gold from loaded carbon to produce doré. A cyanide destruction circuit
using SO2 and air will reduce the WAD cyanide level in the tailings stream to an environmentally acceptable level. The tailings stream is thickened
to recover water before being pumped to the tailings storage facility.
17.2.1
Ore Receiving and Crushing
Run-of-mine (ROM) ore from the open pit, at maximum lump size of 900 mm, will be transported to the plant by 100 t capacity rear dump trucks. The
trucks will tip directly into either side of the ROM pocket. However, if the trucks are not permitted to directly tip into the ROM pocket, then the truck
load will be dumped onto the ROM pad. The ROM pad will be primarily utilised for emergency storage and ore blending if required. ROM ore will be
reclaimed to the ROM pocket by a front-end loader.
A rock breaker will be installed to assist in breaking down, oversize material retained above the gyratory crusher in the ROM pocket. Ore will be
crushed by the gyratory crusher and then withdrawn from the ROM discharge pocket by a variable speed apron feeder. A gyratory crusher has
been selected on the basis that trucks can tip directly into it.
The crushed ore will be conveyed, via the stockpile feed conveyor, to the crushed ore stockpile. The stockpile feed conveyor will be fitted with a
weightometer, to monitor the primary crusher throughput, and for controlling the apron feeder variable speed drive.
The crushing circuit will be serviced by a single dust collection system, consisting of multiple extraction hoods, ducting and a baghouse. Dust
collected from this system will be discharged onto the stockpile feed conveyor and then finely sprayed with water for dust suppression.
Auxiliary equipment for the crushing circuit will include:
Crushing area control room.
Primary crusher grease pump.
Primary crusher lubrication and hydroset pump systems.
Primary crusher area cameras.

Crushed Ore Stockpile
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 17.6
The  crushed  ore  stockpile  will  have  a  live  capacity  of  approximately  10,000  t  (equivalent  to  20  hrs  of  mill  feed  at  4  Mtpa)  and  a  total  storage
capacity of 71 hours.
Crushed ore will be reclaimed from the stockpile, by two of three variable speed apron feeders. The feeders will discharge onto the SAG mill feed
conveyor which will convey the crushed ore to the SAG mill feed chute. The SAG mill feed conveyor will be fitted with a weightometer, used for
controlling the speed of the reclaim feeders and for mass accounting of feed presented to the grinding circuit.
Quicklime will be added to the SAG mill feed conveyor in order to achieve the desired pH of 10.5 in the leaching circuit. This pH modification will
maintain the protective alkalinity of the grinding and leaching circuits and minimise HCN gas evolution.
A ventilation fan will force air into the concrete stockpile reclaim chamber to ensure fresh air ventilates the upper part of the chamber which would
otherwise have limited natural ventilation.
Auxiliary equipment for the reclaim area will include:
•
•
Reclaim feeder lubrication unit.
Stockpile and reclaim area cameras.
17.2.3
Grinding and Classification
The Fekola grinding circuit will be a traditional SABC circuit, comprised of a single, variable speed, semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill and a
single fixed speed ball mill. The SAG mill will operate in closed circuit with a pebble crusher, whilst the ball mill will operate in closed circuit with
hydro-cyclones. The product particle size exiting the grinding circuit (cyclone overflow) will contain 80% passing 75 µm material.
To meet the design throughput, and achieve the required leach product size, a 10.97 m x 5.33 m SAG mill (36 ft x 17.5 ft; 12 MW) and a 7.3 m x 10.8
m (24ft x 35.4ft; 10.3 MW) ball mill will be required.
Crushed ore, reclaimed from the stockpile, will be conveyed to the SAG mill feed chute via the SAG mill feed conveyor. Quicklime will also be
added to the SAG mill feed conveyor before being conveyed to the SAG mill feed chute. Process water will be added to the SAG mill feed chute, to
control the in-mill pulp density. Sodium cyanide will also be added to the SAG mill feed chute, to start gold leaching of the ore. The SAG mill will be
fitted with discharge grates which will allow slurry to pass through the mill and will also relieve the mill of pebble build-up. The SAG mill product
will discharge to a single deck vibrating screen, for pebble dewatering.
Grinding media (125 mm balls) will be added to the SAG mill via the SAG mill feed chute, utilising a dedicated media hoist, kibble and feed chute.

Page 17.7
Sodium cyanide solution will be added to the SAG mill via the SAG mill feed chute, utilising a dedicated metering pump. The addition of sodium
cyanide will start the gold leaching process.
SAG mill discharge screen oversize will be conveyed to a pebble crushing circuit. Undersize from the discharge screen will flow by gravity to the
cyclone feed pump box, where it will combine with the discharge slurry from the ball mill. The slurry will then be pumped to the cyclone cluster by
one of two (duty/standby) variable-speed cyclone feed pumps. Process water will be added to the cyclone feed pump box for cyclone feed density
control.
The cyclone cluster overflow will flow by gravity through a metallurgical sampler then onto two linear trash screens in a parallel configuration. Two
linear trash screens have been selected to provide sufficient area for a square aperture screen. The trash screen undersize will be directed to the
leach thickener feed whilst trash screen oversize will be discharged to trash dewatering screens so the trash can be collected in a trash bin and
the water can flow to the nearest mill area sump pump. Slurry from the cyclone underflow launder, will be returned to the ball mill feed chute with
optional underflow slurry recycle to the SAG mill. Ball mill discharge will pass through the ball mill trommel prior to discharging to the cyclone feed
pump box. Reject oversize material, from the ball mill trommel screen, will be collected within the ball mill scats bunker.
Grinding media (50 mm balls) will be added to the ball mill via the ball mill feed chute, utilising a dedicated media hoist, kibble and feed chute.
Spillage within the grinding circuit will be managed, utilising a dedicated drive-in sump and sump pump. Any spillage generated in the grinding
area will be returned to the cyclone feed pump box.
Auxiliary equipment within the grinding area will include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
SAG mill lubrication system.
SAG mill liner handler, bolt removal tool and a relining monorail.
SAG mill feed chute transporter for feed chute removal.

17.2.4
Pebble Crushing
Oversize from the SAG mill discharge screen will be conveyed to the pebble crusher feed bin, via a series of belt conveyors. A self cleaning belt
magnet will be positioned at the head chute of the first conveyor to remove any scrap metal and steel media which could potentially damage the
pebble crusher.
Downstream of the cross-belt magnet, the pebbles will pass under a metal detector, prior to discharging into the pebble crusher feed bin. The feed
bin will provide surge capacity ahead of the pebble crusher and allow a controlled feed to be presented to the crusher. Should the pebble crusher
not be operational, a diverter gate ahead of the pebble crusher feed bin will allow pebbles to bypass the pebble bin and crushers and feed directly
to the pebble crusher discharge conveyor. Similarly, should the metal detector detect tramp metal (not removed by the cross-belt magnet), the
diverter gate ahead of the pebble crusher feed bin will automatically allow pebbles to bypass the pebble bin and crushers and feed directly to the
pebble crusher discharge conveyor.
Pebbles will be withdrawn from the pebble crusher feed bin, by a vibrating feeder, which will be variable speed. Initially, only a single pebble
crusher will be installed, with provision made in the building design for future installation of a second pebble crusher. The abrasion index of the
ore will require frequent replacement of the pebble crusher liner and will reduce grinding circuit throughput when the pebble liner change occurs.
The pebble crusher will discharge crushed pebbles directly onto the pebble crusher discharge conveyor which in turn will return the crushed
pebbles to the SAG mill feed conveyor.
The pebble crusher discharge conveyor will be fitted with a weightometer, used for mass accounting of feed presented to the grinding circuit.
Auxiliary equipment within the pebble crushing area will include:
•
•
Pebble crusher lubrication unit and hydraulic power pack.
Pebble crusher area cameras.
17.2.5
Leach Thickening
Trash screen undersize will flow by gravity directly to the leach thickener feed box, where flocculant will be added to aid with particle settling.
Overflow solution from the leach thickener will flow by gravity to the leach thickener overflow tank and then be pumped to the carbon in columns
circuit. Underflow from the leach thickener, at 45% solids, will be pumped by dedicated thickener underflow pumps, to the leach feed distribution
box. A thickener recycle pump is included to improve thickener operational flexibility when running, or ensure compaction of the thickener bed
does not occur if the thickener is off-line for a plant shutdown.

A cyanide analyser for on-line monitoring of the free cyanide concentration in the supernatant part of the leach thickener will allow for control of
the sodium cyanide addition to the SAG mill.
The leach thickener area will be serviced by a dedicated floor sump pump. Spillage and wash down collected by the sump pump will be returned
to the thickener feed box.
Auxiliary equipment within the leach thickener area will include:
•
•
Leach thickener electric rake drive.
Cyanide analyser.
17.2.6
Carbon in Columns Circuit
Leach thickener overflow will be pumped to the carbon in columns (CIC) circuit. This carbon adsorption circuit will recover gold in solution from
the grinding circuit. The CIC circuit includes static feed and discharge screens that will prevent trash or particles from entering the circuit and
carbon from leaving the circuit, respectively. The CIC circuit discharge, which is cyanide bearing solution, will be pumped to the process water
tank for reuse in the grinding circuit.
A common carbon transfer pump will transfer carbon forward throughout the columns counter-current to the flow of solution as well as recover
carbon to the loaded carbon recovery screen for carbon desorption. Approximately twice per week, loaded carbon from the first carbon column
(or second carbon column if the first is off-line) will be pumped, by the carbon transfer pump, to the common loaded carbon recovery screen. The
screen solution underflow will flow by gravity to the carbon column of origin whilst the loaded carbon will flow by gravity to the acid wash column.
Regenerated carbon (or fresh carbon) will be added to the CIC circuit, from the carbon regeneration circuit. The regenerated carbon (or fresh
carbon) will be pumped, to the CIC circuit, via the CIC carbon sizing screen. The sizing screen will remove excess water and carbon fines. The
dewatered carbon will discharge into the last, online, CIC tank with excess water and carbon fines directed to the carbon fines collection hopper
for further removal from the circuit.
Process solution samplers will be fitted to the CIC feed and CIC discharge lines for gold metallurgical accounting purposes.
The CIC area will be serviced by a dedicated floor sump pump. Spillage and wash down collected by the sump pump will be returned to the carbon
column feed box.
Auxiliary equipment within the CIC circuit area will include:
Process solution samplers.
Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) gas monitor.

Leach Circuit
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 17.10
Leach thickener underflow will be pumped to the leach feed distribution box. The slurry from the leach feed distribution box will flow by gravity to
the first leach tank. If the first leach tank is offline, the slurry will be diverted to the second leach tank, via a launder gate system.
The leach circuit will consist of five, mechanically agitated, leach tanks operating in series. This equates to a residence time of 24 hrs at a design
feed rate of 4 Mtpa. Space allowance will be made for the inclusion of one additional leach tank for expansion of the plant throughput to 5 Mtpa
and the 24 hr leach residence time is maintained. Each leach tank will have a live volume of 3,900 m³.
Oxygen generated on-site will be added, via oxygen addition devices, to the leach thickener underflow stream to ensure that all of the new feed
slurry is mixed with oxygen before further sodium cyanide is added. Slurry pumps to recycle slurry and facilitate further oxygen addition have
been included. The dissolved oxygen level target is 13 to 17 ppm for the leach circuit.
Lead nitrate will be added to the leach feed distribution box. Metallurgical testwork has shown improved gold leaching with the addition of this
reagent.
Further sodium cyanide solution will be added to the first leach tank with a dedicated metering pump. Sodium cyanide can also be added to the
third leach tank, if required, with its own dedicated metering pump. A cyanide analyser for on-line monitoring of the free cyanide concentration in
the first and third leach tanks will allow for controlled addition of the sodium cyanide to the respective tank.
Process slurry samplers will be fitted to the leach tail stream for monitoring of leach circuit performance.
Should a leach tank be off-line for maintenance, it will be possible to bypass any of the leach tanks. The ability to bypass tanks will be made
possible by the installation of pneumatic gates located within the leach inter-stage launders. One gate will divert slurry to the following leach tank
while the second gate will allow slurry diversion to the subsequent leach tank.
The leach circuit will be serviced by three floor sump pumps. Sump pumps will return spillage to a nearby leach tank.
Auxiliary equipment within the leach circuit area will include:
Process slurry sampler.
Cyanide analyser.
Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) gas monitor.

The CIP circuit will consist of six, mechanically agitated, CIP tanks operating in series. This exceeds the required residence time of 6 hrs at design
plant throughput of 4 Mtpa and meets the required residence time for a maximum plant throughput of 5 Mtpa. Each CIP tank will have a live volume
of 1,100 m³.
The leaching circuit will dissolve the remaining gold in solid and the CIP circuit will recover this dissolved gold by carbon adsorption. Activated
carbon  will  be  retained  in  each  of  the  CIP  tanks  by  an  inter-tank  screen.  The  inter-tank  screen  will  be  a  stainless  steel  wedge  wire  cylinder
equipped with an internal agitator and external rotating wiper blade mechanism to prevent screen blinding and effectively pump the slurry to the
next tank.
As the slurry flows by gravity through the CIP tanks, the carbon will be advanced counter-current to the slurry flow. This will be managed by
balancing the carbon inventory in each CIP tank, by conducting regular measurements of the carbon concentration. Carbon advancement will be
achieved by the CIP carbon transfer pumps (6 hrs per day), of which there is one transfer pump per CIP tank.
Approximately five times per week (3 hrs per batch), loaded carbon from the first CIP tank (or second CIP tank if the first is off-line) will be pumped,
by the loaded carbon recovery pump, to the loaded carbon recovery screen, where it will be washed with spray water to remove excess slurry. The
excess slurry (screen underflow) will flow by gravity to the CIP tank of origin whilst the loaded carbon will flow by gravity to the acid wash column.
Regenerated carbon (or fresh carbon) will be added to the CIP circuit, from the carbon regeneration circuit. The regenerated carbon (or fresh
carbon) will be pumped, to the CIP circuit, via the CIP carbon sizing screen. The sizing screen will remove excess water and carbon fines. The
dewatered carbon will discharge into the last, online, CIP tank with excess water and carbon fines directed to the carbon fines collection hopper
for further removal from the circuit.
Slurry discharging the last CIP tank will flow by gravity to the CIP carbon safety screen via the carbon safety screen feed box. The carbon safety
screen  will  capture  and  recover  any  carbon  exiting  the  CIP  circuit.  The  safety  screen  oversize  will  report  to  a  fine  carbon  skip  bin  while  the
undersize will be pumped to the cyanide destruction feed box.
A cross stream metallurgical sampler, positioned prior to the cyanide destruction feed box will periodically collect a sample of the CIP tails stream.
This sample will be used for circuit monitoring and for metal accounting.
Should a CIP tank be off-line for maintenance, it will be possible to bypass any of the CIP tanks. The ability to bypass tanks will be made possible
by the installation of pneumatic gates located within the CIP inter-stage launders. One gate will divert slurry to the following CIP tank while the
second gate will allow slurry diversion to the subsequent CIP tank.
The CIP circuit will be serviced by two floor sump pumps. Sump pumps will return spillage to either a nearby CIP tank or the CIP feed distribution
box.

Acid Wash, Elution, Electrowinning and Gold Room
The Fekola desorption circuit will consist of separate acid wash and elution columns. A cold acid wash will be utilised for removal of inorganic
foulants. Following acid wash, gold will be eluted from the carbon, utilising a Pressure Zadra elution process sized on the basis of completing a
single strip cycle per 24 hr period. At a total carbon (gold) loading range of 2,100 to 6,500 g/t, the daily carbon movement of 12 tonnes will satisfy
the required carbon movements for both the CIC and CIP circuits.
Acid Wash
The  cold  acid  wash  sequence  will  be  required  to  remove  accumulated,  calcified  scale,  from  the  carbon  surface.  The  acid  wash  column  fill
sequence will be initiated by pumping carbon, from the first CIP tank or first carbon column, into the acid wash column via the loaded carbon
recovery screen. Carbon will flow by gravity from the loaded carbon recovery screen directly into the acid wash column. Once the Acid Wash
Column is filled to the required level, the carbon fill sequence will be stopped.
The acid wash sequence will utilise a 3% w/v hydrochloric acid solution. This dilute acid will be prepared, by the addition of fresh water and neat
(32%) hydrochloric acid, into the dilute acid tank. The acid wash sequence will involve the injection of the dilute acid solution into the column, by
the acid wash circulation pump, via the feed manifold located beneath the column. The pump will continuously run and allow the acid to circulate
through the column, back to the dilute acid tank. Acid circulation will occur for one hour or two bed volumes (2 BV).
Upon completion of acid circulation, the acid neutralisation sequence will commence by the addition of sodium hydroxide (caustic) sprayed into
the top of the acid wash column. The acid wash circulation pump will continue to run and circulate the neutralised solution through the column
and back to the dilute acid tank for one hour or two bed volumes (2 BV). Following completion of acid neutralisation, the rinse sequence will be
initiated by pumping water through the column, to displace the neutralised acid solution to the tailings pump box. During the rinse step, two bed
volumes (2 BV) of water, at 2 BV/hour, will be sourced from the treated water tank and pumped through the column.

NI 43-101 - RECOVERY METHODS
This sequence will conclude with carbon being pumped to the elution column. Additional water to assist the carbon transfer between the acid
wash and elution column will be sourced from the treated water tank.
Elution and Electrowinning
The elution sequence will commence with the addition of treated water into the barren strip solution tank along with the simultaneous injection of
cyanide and caustic solution. A set amount of cyanide and sodium hydroxide (caustic) will be added to achieve a 2% w/w NaOH and 0.2% w/w
NaCN solution. Both reagent additions will be automatically stopped once the prescribed volume has been added. The pre–heat period will then
commence. During this period, the pre-heat solution will be circulated through the column and be pre–heated to 95°C via a diesel-fired hot water
elution heater. Upon completion of the pre–heat period, the elution sequence will commence and gold will be stripped from the carbon in closed
circuit with the electrowinning cells. The recovery heat exchangers will transfer residual heat from the pregnant strip solution exiting to the barren
solution entering the elution column.
The pre-heated, incoming barren solution, will then pass through the primary heat exchanger to elevate the solution temperature to 145°C prior to
entering the bottom of the column. A diesel-fired hot water elution heater will provide the heat to the primary heat exchanger. A temperature probe
will monitor the temperature of barren solution entering the column and will be used to control the heater output. Hot solution will flow up and out
of  the  top  of  the  column,  passing  through  the  pregnant  strip  solution  filters  before  the  recovery  heat  exchangers,  followed  by  the  trim  heat
exchanger. The trim heat exchanger will use treated water to ensure the pregnant strip solution is reduced to the optimum temperature of 75°C for
electrowinning. The electrowinning discharge will flow by gravity to the barren strip solution tank before being circulated through the elution and
electrowinning circuits again. The elution and electrowinning sequence will occur for six hours or twelve bed volumes (12 BV), at 2 BV/hour.
Soluble gold, and any silver, will be recovered from the pregnant strip solution by electrowinning onto woven, stainless steel wire mesh cathodes.
The electrowinning circuit will consist of three of four (duty/duty/duty/standby) electrowinning cells in a parallel configuration. Each electrowinning
cell contains 33 cathodes and 36 anodes and has a dedicated rectifier to supply the necessary current, to electroplate the gold and silver onto the
cathode.
During the elution sequence, the electrowinning cells will be in closed circuit with the elution column. The flow of pregnant solution to the cell will
be evenly split across an electrowinning feed distributor and manual control valves will assist the desired linear velocity to be achieved. During
this elution sequence, the electrowinning cell discharge will flow by gravity to the barren strip solution tank.
At the end of the elution sequence, the elution heater will be switched off, with 2 BV of treated water being utilised to cool down the elution column
and its contents, to less than 100°C. Upon completion of the cool down sequence, the carbon will be pumped to the carbon regeneration kiln feed
de-watering screen.
The acid wash area and elution area will be serviced by the acid wash area and elution area floor sump pumps respectively. Acid wash area
spillage will be typically pumped to the tailings pump box, with the option to be pumped to the carbon safety screen if there is carbon present in
the area. The elution area spillage will be pumped to the CIP feed distribution box.

The gold bearing filter cake will be thermally dried in an electric drying oven. The drying oven will be heated to approximately 400°C. Dried filter
cake will be mixed with a prescribed flux mixture (silica, nitre, soda ash and borax), prior to being charged into the electric induction furnace. The
fluxes added react with base metal oxides to form a slag, whilst the gold and silver remains as a molten metal. The molten metal will be poured into
moulds, to form doré ingots, which will be cleaned, assayed, stamped and stored in a secure vault ready for dispatch. The slag produced will
periodically be returned to the grinding circuit, via the SAG mill feed chute.

Carbon Regeneration
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 17.15
After elution, the carbon will be pumped from the elution column to the carbon regeneration circuit. The carbon and transfer water will be directed
to the kiln feed screen, allowing excess water to be removed prior to the carbon discharging into the kiln feed hopper. The kiln feed dewatering
screen undersize will flow by gravity to the carbon fines collection hopper.
Carbon will be withdrawn from the kiln feed hopper, via the kiln screw feeder, and discharged directly into the carbon regeneration kiln, at a rate of
600 kg/h. Within the diesel-fired horizontal rotary kiln, the carbon will be heated to 700°C, to remove volatile organic foulants from the carbon
surface, thereby restoring the carbon activity.
Re-activated carbon exiting the kiln will discharge directly to the carbon quench hopper, where it will be rapidly cooled. From the quench tank,
carbon will be pumped, by the regenerated carbon transfer pump to either a carbon sizing screen located within the CIP circuit or a carbon sizing
screen located within the CIC circuit. The carbon sizing screens undersize will flow by gravity to the carbon fines collection hopper.
Fresh new carbon, along with fresh water, will be added to the carbon conditioning hopper, which is mechanically agitated. After the carbon is
conditioned for a period of 30 minutes, the conditioned carbon will be pumped, by the carbon addition transfer pump to either a carbon sizing
screen located within the CIP circuit or a carbon sizing screen located within the CIC circuit. The new carbon sizing screens undersize will flow by
gravity to the tailings pump box, via the carbon fines collection hopper.
The contents of the barren carbon fines collection hopper will be pumped by the carbon fines filter feed pump through the carbon fines filter to
collect the carbon fines, which are subsequently removed from the circuit. The carbon fines filter requires a constant feed stream to ensure the
filter  cake  doesn’t  slump  within  the  press  and  ultimately  cause  a  pressure  differential  across  the  plates  that  could  result  in  filter  press  plate
cracking. The filter will be operated until the filter is full of filtered cake. The filter press will be manually emptied and cleaned by the operator and
subsequently restarted.
The carbon regeneration area will be serviced by dedicated floor sump pump. Any spillage generated within this area will be typically pumped to
the carbon sizing screen or tailings pump box with an option to be pumped to the CIP tails pump box.

Cyanide Destruction
CIP tailings will be pumped to the cyanide destruction tank where cyanide destruction will be achieved utilising the SO2  /  Air  process.  In  the
SO2/Air process, sodium metabisulphite, air, copper sulphate (catalyst) and sodium hydroxide (caustic) will be added to oxidise the residual free
and WAD (weak acid dissociable) cyanide to cyanate. The destruction circuit will reduce the residual cyanide contained within the tailings stream
to below 10 mg/L WAD cyanide. The cyanide destruction circuit will consist of two mechanically agitated tanks, operating in parallel, to provide a
total residence time of 90 minutes.

Water Consumption
A water balance for the process plant has been completed. Water from the leach thickener and tailings thickener overflow streams are recycled
within the process plant to reduce the external water requirement. Approximately 200 m3/h of decant return water is recycled from the TSF to the
process plant. Another approximately 200 m3/h of fresh water is required to make-up the water consumption for the process plant. The fresh water
will primarily be sourced from nearby pit dewatering bores. Additional water will be stored in the Fresh Water Storage Pond and is available for use
in the plant.
At the process plant, the fresh water tank will provide a combined fresh water and fire water reserve. The required fire water capacity will be stored
below the level of the suction piping for the fresh water pumps to ensure it is always available.
17.3.3
Reagent and Consumable Consumption
Reagent storage, mixing and pumping facilities will be provided for all reagents for the process plant. Table 17.3.2 provides a summary of reagents
and consumables that will be used at the process plant at the design consumption rate for a plant throughput of 4 Mtpa.

Plant Control System
The instrumentation and control system will be designed with the following objectives in mind:
•
•
•
•
Ease of operation - operator intervention and remedial action will be easily accomplished.
Interlocking - the control system will provide process interlocking between individual drives and plant areas.
Reliability  -  all  field  equipment  will  be  selected  on  its  ability  to  operate  in  an  environment  where  extreme  temperatures  and  dusty  conditions  are
encountered.
Ease of maintenance - instrumentation and control systems will be designed and installed such that maintenance requirements are minimised.
The plant control system will be designed around a moderate level of automation and monitoring.
The starting and stopping of most electrical drives and actuated valves will be performed from the Distributed Control System (DCS) Operator
Interface Terminals (OITs). There will be no Remote / Local selector switches in the field. However, field operators may start equipment local to the
drive

if the control room has selected Local at the OIT. Local mushroom head style Lock-Off-Stop stations will be installed which will be hard-wired to
the drive starter circuit to enable local stop / emergency stop regardless of drive mode selection.
In general, the use of actuated isolation or control valves will be implemented around the plant for automatic control loops or sequencing as part
of the plant control or the elution sequence. All actuated valves and control valves will be operated from the OITs with remote position indication
available. Automatic control valves will be controlled by PID loops within the DCS.
Equipment in the plant will be interfaced to the DCS via the Input / Output (I/O) modules, which are positioned in the field and remote to the main
DCS hardware. The hardware will be housed in an office next to the main mill control room. Vendor equipment packages throughout the plant will
utilise the process plant DCS for control and monitoring of their respective equipment.
All fixed speed drives are controlled using Profibus connected motor protection relays. The current draw of the majority of fixed speed drives will
be displayed on a number of summary mimic pages on the DCS and adjacent to the drive mimic where appropriate. Similarly, the current draw of
all variable speed drives will be displayed on a number of summary mimic pages on the DCS and adjacent to the drive mimic where appropriate.
The DCS will perform all digital and analogue control functions, including PID control. Faceplates on the DCS displays will facilitate the entry of
setpoints, readout of process variables (PV’s) and controlled variables (CV’s) and entry of the three PID parameters (Proportional, Integral and
Derivative).
The majority of equipment interlocks will be software configurable. However, selected drives will be hard wired to provide the required level of
personal safety protection e.g. the emergency stop buttons associated with each and every motor and the pull wire switches associated with
conveyors.
All alarm and trip circuits from field or local panel mounted contacts will be based on fail-safe activation. Alarm and trip contacts will open on
abnormal or fault condition. If equipment shutdown occurs due to loss of mains power supply, the equipment will return to a de-energised state
and will not automatically restart upon restoration of power.
Sequential group starts and sequential group stops will not be incorporated with non-packaged plant equipment. However, in any sequential
process, critical safety and equipment protection interlocks will cause a cascade stop in the event of interlocked downstream equipment stopping
(e.g. trip of mill feed conveyor will result in stop of stockpile reclaim apron feeder).
The process plant will be provided with a one main control room.
Operator Interface Terminals (OIT) will be provided in the following areas:
DCS hardware office (1 engineering OIT).
Main plant control room (2 OITs).

Overall Site Development
The overall site development plan is shown in Figure 18.1.1. The drawing shows the major features of the Project and its infrastructure including
the process plant, tailings storage facility, accommodation camp, roads, airstrip, mine services area, mine open pit and mine waste dumps.
The process plant and tailings storage facility are located on the eastern side of the Fekola open pit, with all work areas outside of the 500 m blast
zone. The accommodation camp is located close to the southern perimeter of the process plant for ease of personnel access.
The main access road approaches the site from the north and runs adjacent to the airstrip and tailings storage facility before turning west to
access the process plant.
The site as a whole will be fenced to clearly delineate the mine area, prevent animal access and deter access by unauthorised persons. Road
access  into  the  fenced  area  will  be  through  a  manned  checkpoint.  Security  fencing  will  surround  the  accommodation  camp  and  general  site
infrastructure. High security fencing will surround the process plant.

18.2.1
Access to Site
Materials and consumables will be transported to site via a new mine access road. The new access road will link the project site with the existing
Millennium Highway approximately 20 km from the nearby town of Kéniéba and will be a six metre wide gravel, all weather, and free draining
carriageway. Culverts will be installed as appropriate on creek crossings. Fill material for the road will be obtained from excavation alongside the
road where possible.
The new road has been routed to avoid the villages of Brema, Gonu, Kéniéba, Mantakoto, Médinandi, Pandola, Sanougou and Satadougou Tintiba
and cultural points identified at these villages. The main access road will be designed for a 60 km/h speed limit.
Construction of the access road commenced as part of project early works and is expected to be fully completed prior to the 2015 wet season to
enable continued all weather access to site for construction.
18.2.2
Project Site Roads
Plant internal roads will provide access between the administration area, process plant facilities, fuel storage, power plant, mine services area, and
accommodation camp. These roads will generally be 6 m wide and will be constructed flush with bulk earthworks pads to ensure that storm water
sheet flow is achieved across the site, thereby avoiding the need for deep surface drains and culvert crossings within the plant area.
The airstrip is located adjacent to the mine access road to the north of the tailings storage facility. A suitable road will connect the airstrip to the
mine access road to provide access for the transport of personnel from the airstrip to the camp.
18.2.3
Access Tracks
A number of new tracks will be constructed to access infrastructure such as the tailings storage facility, sediment control structures and water
bore pumps remote from the plant site. The access tracks will be cleared and graded natural earth tracks. Exact routes will be determined during
construction of the Project to best fit local terrain and vegetation density.
18.3
Airstrip
A 1,800 m long (1,600 m active length) x 30 m wide all weather gravel airstrip will be provided for secure transport of bullion, transportation of
construction personnel, and emergency medivac purposes. The airstrip has been designed to suit a Beech Craft 1900 type aircraft or similar.
The airstrip will have an orientation bearing 114 deg to suit prevailing wind conditions and include clearance zones of 100 m at the ends and 25 m
on the sides. An area of 2,600 m² will be reserved for aircraft parking and include concrete anchorages to secure steel cables to the aircraft in case
of strong winds.

Design Summary
The TSF will comprise a valley storage formed by a single downstream multi-zoned earthfill embankment, lined with high density polyethylene
(HDPE), comprising a total footprint area (including the basin area) of approximately 69 ha for the Stage 1 TSF, increasing to 200 ha for the final
TSF. The TSF is designed to store a total of 62 Mt of tailings. The Stage 1 TSF was designed to provide 16 months of storage capacity, in order to
allow  some  flexibility  for  Stage  2  construction  to  be  carried  out  during  the  subsequent  dry  season,  when  conditions  are  more  suitable  for
construction.  The  TSF  general  arrangement  for  Stage  1,  Final  Stage  12  and  typical  embankment  sections  are  shown  in  the  following  Figures

Includes a minimum freeboard and stormwater capacity for the greater of: (i) 1 in 100 year recurrence interval, 72 hour storm event occurring
on an average conditions pond, or (ii) 1 in 100 year wet rainfall sequence pond.
Stage 1 embankment designed for 16 month storage capacity.
The  embankment  comprises  an  upstream  low  permeability  zone  (Zone  A)  and  downstream  structural  fill  zone  (Zone  C).  The  embankment
upstream face will be lined with HDPE liner. Typical specifications for material types are summarised as follows:
•
•
Zone A material shall be won from borrow to form the low permeability zone of the embankment.
Zone C material shall be won from borrow or delivered by the mining operations to form the structural fill zone of the embankment.
The embankment will have an operating upstream and downstream slope of 3H:1V and a minimum crest width of 8 m. The final downstream
embankment profile will consist of an overall slope of approximately 3.5H:1V.
The TSF basin area will be cleared, grubbed and topsoil stripped. The upper slopes within the basin will be reshaped with imported materials,
where required, to a maximum allowable slope of 3H:1V in order to achieve suitable slopes for HDPE liner installation.
A 200 mm depth compacted soil liner, will be constructed over the entire TSF basin area, comprising either reworked in-situ material or imported
Zone A material, to form a subgrade for HDPE liner. A 1.5 mm HDPE geomembrane liner will be installed over the entire TSF basin and upstream
embankment faces.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 18.10
A cut-off trench will be excavated into foundation soils to competent foundation material, backfilled with low permeability (Zone A) fill to reduce
seepage  losses  through  the  embankment  foundations.  The  cut-off  trench  (estimated  average  3.5  m  depth)  will  be  cut  to  extend  through  to
competent low permeability foundation material.
The TSF design incorporates a basin underdrainage system to reduce pressure head acting on the geomembrane liner, reduce seepage, increase
tailings densities, and improve the geotechnical stability of the embankments. The underdrainage system comprises a network of branch drains
reporting to collector drains situated in natural drainage courses. Underdrains will comprise perforated plastic pipes, covered in sand / gravel
drainage material and wrapped in geotextile. The underdrainage system drains by gravity to a collection sump located at the lowest point in the
TSF basin. Solution recovered from the underdrainage system will be released to the top of the tailings mass via submersible pump, reporting to
the supernatant pond.
Supernatant water will be removed from the TSF via submersible pumps located within decant towers, constructed at start-up and raised during
operation. Each decant tower will be situated in a sump within the inlet trench to ensure sufficient depth of water prior to pump operation within
the tower. Each decant tower will comprise a 25 MPa concrete base and 1.8 m diameter slotted precast concrete pipe sections. The decant tower
will be surrounded by free-draining coarse rockfill (Zone G). A pump bipod stand will be installed over the decant tower to facilitate pump removal.
The supernatant pond will be maintained on the northern edge of the TSF basin. Solution recovered from the decant system will be pumped back
to the plant for re-use in the process circuit.
The TSF has sufficient capacity to completely contain all design criteria storm events and rainfall sequences (average recurrence interval of 1 in
100  years).  Under  normal  operating  conditions,  with  the  TSF  managed  in  accordance  with  standard  operating  procedures,  the  available
stormwater storage capacity will be in excess of the design storm event volumes and no discharge from the TSF is expected. An operational
emergency spillway will be available at all times during TSF operation, constructed in the embankment abutment in order to protect the integrity of
the constructed embankments in the event of emergency overflow.
The closure spillway will be located at the final supernatant pond location, and will be excavated through the northern ridge line to ensure all
rainfall runoff from the TSF will safely discharge after operation ceases.
Tailings will be discharged into the TSF by sub-aerial deposition methods, using a combination of spigots at regularly spaced intervals from the
embankments and the eastern and western perimeter of the TSF.
A pipeline containment trench will be constructed during Stage 1 to contain both the tailings delivery pipeline and decant return pipeline between
the TSF and Plant Site, as the flow in both pipelines is contaminated and cannot be discharged to the environment if the pipeline bursts. The
pipeline trench will be situated adjacent to the main access road and will drain to designated catch ponds or the TSF.

Monitoring
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 18.11
A monitoring programme for the TSF will be developed to monitor for any potential problems which may arise during operations. The monitoring
will include:
•
•
•
Monitoring bores and surface water sampling stations downstream of the TSF.
Standpipe piezometers in the embankment to monitor the phreatic surface.
Settlement pins to check embankment movement.
18.4.5
Rehabilitation
At the end of the TSF operation, the downstream faces of the embankment (external to the Eastern Waste Dump) will have a slope of 3H:1V, with 5
m wide benches located at 10 m height intervals, for an overall slope profile of 3.5H:1V. The designed profile will be stable under seismic loading
conditions, will provide a stable drainage system, and will allow for revegetation.
The TSF closure spillway will be excavated after the remaining supernatant water is proven to be suitable for release and during rehabilitation of
the tailings surface subsequent to decommissioning. The closure spillway will be excavated from the final supernatant pond location, running
north through the ridge-line and discharging into the adjacent (northern) catchment. Rehabilitation of the tailings surface will commence upon
termination of deposition into the TSF. The final profile of the tailings surface will slope towards the closure spillway and the low spot on the
tailings surface will be adjacent to the TSF northern perimeter, so that no re-shaping of the tailings surface will be required for full water shedding.
The final soil cover for the tailings surface subsequent to decommissioning will be confirmed during operation based on ongoing operational
tailings geochemistry test results. The following covering for the tailings beach has been allowed for:
•
•
•
Low permeability fill layer (300 mm).
Topsoil growth medium layer (200 mm).
The finished surface will be shallow ripped and seeded with shrubs and grasses.
18.4.6
Tailings Geochemistry
Geochemical testing was completed on tailings solids and supernatant liquor.
The results of the testing are summarised below:
•
The tailings sample was classified as Acid Consuming due to a strongly negative net acid producing potential (NAPP) and net acid generating (NAG)
pH of 8.3. Therefore there would be no specific controls required in relation to the acid formation potential of the tailings.

The  sulphide  concentration  of  the  tailings  sample  was  calculated  at  1.28%  which  is  considered  to  be  high.  The  maximum  potential  acidity  was
calculated from the sulphide concentration at 39 kg H2SO4 / tonne of tailings, which is also high.
The acid neutralising capacity calculated as being available from carbonate minerals was extremely high.
The net acid producing potential of the sample is strongly negative with a high ANC / MPA ratio, indicating that the sample has significant excess
neutralising capacity.
The results of the net acid generation test indicate that under extreme oxidising conditions, the tailings did not produce any measurable acid, and that
weakly alkaline pH conditions are likely to prevail within the tailings pore waters. The acid base accounting results recorded a negative net acid
producing potential of -207 kg H2SO4/t, with a final NAG pH of 8.3.
The results of the multi-element analysis on the tailings solids were compared to various soil intervention guidelines. The tailings solids recorded a
moderate number of element enrichments, with boron, molybdenum and sulphur all found to be highly enriched and arsenic, antimony and selenium
found to be significantly enriched. Further, chromium, manganese, nickel, sulphur, sulphate and vanadium exceed the soil guideline values.
The supernatant was found to exceed the guidelines for release / livestock water for the following parameters: arsenic, copper, cyanide (total, WAD
and free), iron, molybdenum and nickel. Of these determinants, cyanide (total, WAD and free) and copper were found to exceed the guideline values
by the greatest margin.
Based on the data reviewed to date, it is considered that the proposed liner system is appropriate for the Fekola TSF.
Cyanide  concentration  reduces  as  it  moves  through  the  leaching  circuit.  The  cyanide  concentrations  recorded  during  testwork  (in  the
supernatant water) were 59 mg/L (CNtotal) and 30 mg/L (CNwad).
When the tailings reach the tailings storage facility, the tailings will be deposited at the perimeter of the TSF and the supernatant will run down the
tailings  beach  to  the  supernatant  pond.  Significant  decomposition  of  cyanide  will  occur  through  volatilisation  and  other  processes  as  the
supernatant runs down the beach. On reaching the supernatant pond, decay of the cyanide in the pond will continue to occur mainly as a result of
the decrease in the pH of the water and the ultraviolet light falling on the pond. Without cyanide destruction measures in place, KP experience in
West  Africa  is  that  supernatant  ponds  are  typically  in  the  range  on  1  to  10  mg/L  CNwad.  With  cyanide  destruction  measures  in  place,  the
supernatant pond may be less than 0.5 mg/L CNwad. These CNwad concentrations are significantly less than the guideline value for protecting bird
life (50 mg/L). Further tailings characterization is ongoing and results will be incorporated into the project as appropriate

Spillway discharge from the TSF may only occur if a storm event or rainfall sequence greater than the design criteria occurs. Therefore, allowing
for cyanide decay processes and dilution by such an extreme event, the CNtotal concentrations in any spillway flows would likely be below 0.1
mg/L.
18.4.7
Geotechnical
The geotechnical site investigation for the TSF conducted by KP included three boreholes along the TSF embankment alignment and 26 test pits
in the TSF basin area.
The boreholes and test pits identified variable ground conditions, which typically comprised:
•
•
•
•
•
A shallow thickness of topsoil and colluvium to a typical depth of 0.3 m and comprising very loose or loose sandy and silty gravel. Alluvium is present
close to stream courses and is typically cohesive.
A zone of lateritic residual soil comprising sandy silty gravel extending to up to 6 m depth and averaging 3 to 3.5 m, with highly varied levels of
cementation. In some of the pits the material was sufficiently indurated such that it was a low and very low strength rock (Ferricrete) whilst in others the
material had little cementation and retained soil-like properties.
The ferricrete is most prominent along the line of the main embankment. It was often highly permeable and the TSF cut-off trench will need to extend
through this material.
A zone of residual soil comprising medium to high plasticity sandy silt with gravel extending from the base of the laterite material down to bedrock at
typically 15 to 20 m depth.
Bedrock was encountered in all three boreholes at a depth of between 10 m and 26 m. The encountered rock is metamorphic and either sericite or
chlorite schist. The first few metres of the rock that were penetrated were typically identified to be extremely to highly weathered and very low to low
strength.
Both Zone A and Zone C material are considered to be available within the TSF basin. It is considered that the cohesive colluvium, laterite gravel
and residual silt material, when remoulded, should provide sufficiently low permeability to be used as Zone A material. These material types, as
well as the granular colluvial material and ferricrete, are considered suitable for use as Zone C.
18.4.8
Seepage Assessment
Seepage modelling was undertaken to evaluate the phreatic conditions in the TSF embankment.
Based on the assessment, the following conclusions are made:
The upper bound seepage through the sub-grade for the Stage 1 TSF configuration will be approximately 0.1 to 0.4 L/s.
The upper bound seepage through the sub-grade for the final TSF configuration will be approximately 0.2 to 2.5 L/s.

Stability Analysis
The stability of the proposed Stage 1 and Final TSF embankment sections were assessed under static and seismic loading conditions using limit
equilibrium methods. The stability of the TSF embankment was assessed in order to confirm the factors of safety against shear failure considering
long-term drained conditions, short-term undrained conditions and post seismic conditions. The effect of pore water pressures on embankment
stability was modelled during the stability assessment.
ANCOLD guidelines were adopted as the acceptable factors of safety for the TSF. Table 18.4.2 lists the recommended factors of safety under
loading conditions. The results of stability analysis are presented in Table 18.4.3.

Decant from Tailings Storage Facility
Supernatant water will be removed from the TSF via submersible pumps located within decant towers, constructed at start-up and raised during
operation.
Decants will operate automatically, reclaiming water from the TSF and pumping it via a HDPE pipeline to the process plant. The decant pumps will
be raised on a regular basis to ensure that tailings do not enter the pump intake and that the good quality, recycle water is returned to the process
plant.
TSF recycle rates for each year of operation are provided in Table 18.4.4. The maximum and minimum rates show the range of monthly values
throughout each year. The recycle rates are expressed as a percentage of water in slurry reporting to the TSF.

Surface Water Management
18.5.1
Design Objectives
The Fekola pit footprint is located in an existing natural drainage course, with an upstream catchment of 9 km2 requiring diversion around the pit.
The site surface water management system is designed to prevent runoff from events up to and inclusive of a 1 in 100 year recurrence interval
storm event from entering the pit.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 18.16
The design objectives for the surface water management system are as follows:
•
•
Diversion of rainfall runoff from upstream catchments, around site infrastructure to discharge off site downstream of the project.
Containment of sediment-laden runoff from the site infrastructure, via collection channels, retain coarse to fine sand particles within sediment basins on
site and controlled discharge from site.
18.5.2
Diversion Structures
The proposed site surface water management system will be constructed over two phases, as follows:
•
•
•
Phase 1A (pre-mining): the main drainage course running through the site (between the Plant Site and TSF) will be diverted initially to the north,
around the starter pit.
Phase  1B  (first  0  to  3  months  after  commencement  of  pit  dewatering):  the  diversion  channel  running  from  the  fresh  water  storage  pond  spillway,
running between the plant site and the waste dump and to the south of the pit, will be required to divert WSP spillway overflow off-site.
Phase 2 (during operation): as the pit expands to the north, the Phase 1A diversion channel will require decommissioning. Flows reporting to this
diversion will be diverted to the south by raising the existing diversion bund and excavating a channel running due south to tie into the existing Phase
1B channel.
18.5.3
Collection and Control Structures
Fresh Water Storage Pond
The fresh water storage pond is the main collection and storage pond for fresh water on site, and is able to store up to 116,700 m3 of water at the
maximum  operating  level.  The  fresh  water  storage  pond  will  collect  rainfall  runoff  from  the  upstream  catchment  and  surplus  pit  groundwater
dewatering.
The fresh water storage pond embankment will be shared with the contact water storage pond, and be constructed primarily of low permeability fill
material.
Water stored in the fresh water storage pond will be pumped back to the plant to supply plant fresh water requirements and process make-up
water requirements, if required.
The fresh water storage pond general arrangement is shown in Figure 18.5.1 and typical embankment sections are shown in Figure 18.5.2.

18.5.4
Contact Water Storage Pond
The contact water storage pond is the main collection and storage pond for potentially contaminated water on site, and is able to store up to
2,024,000 m3 of water at the maximum operating level.
The contact water storage pond embankment will be constructed primarily of low permeability fill material, and the contact water storage pond
reservoir will be fully enclosed on all four sides.
The  contact  water  storage  pond  general  arrangement  is  shown  in  Figure  18.5.1  and  typical  embankment  sections  are  shown  in  Figure  18.5.2
above.
18.5.5
Sediment Control Structures
Sediment control structures (SCSs) will be constructed in the downstream reaches of catchments impacted by site infrastructure. Discharge from
the SCSs will be to the environment downstream of the project site. Water quality in the SCS reservoirs should be monitored, and the water may
be pumped back to the plant for treatment (if required) or may be used for process make-up water requirements and dust suppression (if suitable).
SCSs will reduce flow velocities facilitating sediment settling. The SCSs were designed to capture particles of fine sand and coarser.
The SCS locations were selected based on the natural topography, to reduce embankment fill volumes and increase the storage capacity of each
structure.
The SCSs were designed to limit maximum water depth to 1.5 m for safety reasons.
18.5.6
Falémé River Flood Assessment
In order to assess flooding of the Falémé River, particularly with concern to the potential for flooding of the proposed Fekola pit, flood modelling
was completed by KP.
The flood modelling incorporated the following information:
•
•
A hydrologic rainfall / runoff model to determine the additional flows contributing to the peak flow of the Falémé River downstream of the Fadougou
river level gauge.
A hydraulic water surface profile model to generate an estimated rating curve, and determine the depth and areal extent of inundation resulting from
the 1% Average Exceedance Probability (AEP) river flow plus the 1% AEP storm.
Results  from  the  inundation  model  were  used  to  determine  whether  any  specific  infrastructure,  such  as  a  flood  protection  bund,  would  be
required to protect the pit.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
The following input data were used in the modelling:
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 18.20
•
•
•
KP was provided with daily average flow levels for the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) operated Fadougou river gauge for the time period
of 1952 through to 2011 (total 60 years). However due to missing data, only 41 years of data were considered valid for use in the flood frequency
analysis. KP was unable to obtain a rating curve for the station.
Historical precipitation data were sourced from the Kéniéba climate station (refer Section 2 for further information).
The synthetic topographic model used for the flood modelling was a combination of the following:
•
•
LIDAR survey data for the Project area
publicly available Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) where the LIDAR data were not available (significant portions of the river
bed)
a single cross section of the river at the Fadougou gauge location
•
•
•
a single cross section of the river at the Fadougou gauge location
a long section of the river bed in proximity to the Fadougou gauge
additional survey information for the river banks for the Fadougou gauge.
In order to estimate the 1 in 100 year ARI flood extents for the Falémé River, both hydrologic and hydraulic models were utilised:
•
•
The hydrological conditions of the Falémé River comprise the flow rate estimated at the Fadougou gauge station, and the additional flows from the
small catchments downstream of the gauge.
In order to estimate the hydraulic behaviour of the Falémé River adjacent to the Fekola site, a hydraulic water surface profile model was constructed.
As a rating curve for the Fadougou river gauge station was not available, the Falémé River cross-section survey was used to generate a rating
curve, to allow depth measurements to be converted into flow rates.
The predicted flood inundation level for the section of the Falémé river adjacent to the project (in particular at the Pit), does not encroach on the
current pit outline. However, the sediment control structure immediately downstream of the waste dump (located to the south west of the Pit) may
require erosion protection on its downstream face.
Once the waste dump is in place, a peak flood level of approximately 130.5 m would be required to result in flooding. Based on the frequency
analysis of the flood levels, a flood resulting in a peak flood level of 130.5 m is estimated to be greater than a 1 in 1,000 year recurrence interval.

Water Supply
Water supply for the Project is grouped into the following sources:
•
•
•
•
Pit Groundwater.
Surface Water.
Falémé River Bores.
Potable Water Bores (Covered in Section 18.9).
18.6.1
Pit Groundwater
Knight  Piésold  (KP)  undertook  a  groundwater  investigation  of  the  proposed  open  pit  at  Fekola.  The  field  investigation  results  together  with
monitoring data and field investigation data previously collected by Papillon were used to develop a numerical groundwater flow model used to
predict groundwater inflows to the various stages of the Fekola pit.
The predicted pit inflows are summarised as follows:
•
Average climatic conditions (base case) – the average groundwater inflow rate over the 11 year period is predicted to be 129 L/s.
•
Groundwater inflows are predicted to reach 127 L/s by the end of Year 1 and increase to 151 L/s by Year 4 and then peak to 170L/s by the end of Year
9.
An assessment of baseline groundwater quality data for the Project was completed by KP.
The sample locations include groundwater samples from village wells. In April 2013, groundwater samples were also taken from regional test
bores installed by Papillon some of which are in the mine area.
The baseline water quality collected to date indicates that the groundwater is for the most part pH neutral, fresh and of good quality. The main
exceptions are as follows:
•
•
Arsenic occurs at low concentration levels but above the WHO (2011) drinking-water guideline value of 0.01 mg/L drinking-water guideline.
Nitrate concentrations are consistently above WHO (2011) drinking water guidelines in the Tintiba village well (probably due to poor sanitation).
Pit ground water will be extracted by pit dewatering bores located around the perimeter of the open pit extent. Water will be pumped either direct to
the process plant fresh water tank or to the fresh water storage pond for storage.

18.6.2
Surface Water
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 18.22
Rainfall runoff from the upstream catchment will be collected and stored in the fresh water storage pond, which is sized to store up to 116,700 m3
of water at the maximum operating level.
Water stored in the fresh water storage pond will be pumped to the process plant fresh water tank to supply plant raw water requirements and
process make-up water requirements, if required.
An assessment of baseline surface water quality data for the Project was completed by KP.
The baseline water quality collected to date indicates that the surface water is for the most part pH neutral, fresh and of good quality. The main
exceptions are as follows:
•
•
Arsenic occurs at low concentration levels but above the WHO (2011) drinking-water guideline value of 0.01 mg/L drinking-water guideline.
Iron, cadmium and lead also occur at low concentrations but above their respective WHO (2011) drinking-water guideline values in several surface
water samples.
18.6.3
Falémé River Bores
Three  additional  bores  have  been  included  at  the  Falémé  River  in  the  event  that  site  water  quantity  or  quality  requirements  are  not  met  as
anticipated by the Pit Dewatering Bores. Location of these bores and extraction rates will be determined if they are required in the future.
18.6.4
Water Balance
Based on the water balance modelling, a number of conclusions can be drawn as follows:
•
•
The TSF has sufficient capacity to store all design rainfall events.
Make-up water is required from the fresh water storage pond during each year of operation for average and design dry rainfall sequences. In these
instances, the model supplies all required make-up water from the fresh water storage pond (supplemented by pit dewatering). The magnitude and
duration of shortfall increases with drier conditions.
Modelling results indicate that no plant water shortfalls occur during operation for all average and design dry conditions due to the availability of the
predicted pit dewatering. As such, no additional water supply is required. This is primarily due to the volumes of water pumped to the fresh water
storage pond from the pit dewatering. Should this source of water become unavailable, or is significantly lower than anticipated, the rainfall runoff from
the surrounding catchments of the fresh water storage pond would not be sufficient to supply the process plant water requirements during average or
drier conditions. Alternative water sources (e.g. alluvial borefield at the Falémé River) would need to be located if pit dewatering was not available, (or
not be of suitable quality).
The maximum annual spillway discharge rate for the contact water storage pond, and therefore the maximum potential treatment volume is 454,000
m3/year for average conditions and 1,149,000 m3/year for wet conditions. The maximum monthly spillway discharge rate for the contact water storage
pond, and therefore the maximum potential treatment volume is 316,000 m3/month for average conditions and 521,000 m3/month for wet conditions.

Power
Due to the remote location of the Fekola site and questionable guarantee of supply, connection to the Malian grid is not a feasible option. Power
will therefore be generated by a dedicated power station purpose built for the project.
18.7.1
Power Generation
Power supply to the site will be from a combination HFO and diesel fuelled power station located adjacent to the process plant. The power station
will supply the main HV switchroom inside the processing plant from which power will be distributed.
The power station has been sized to accommodate a maximum demand power draw of 29.4MW with a configuration as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
7 x 6 MW 13.8kV medium speed generators (5 duty, 2 standby).
5 x 1.6 MW 13.8kV high speed generators (emergency standby).
13.8 kV switchroom.
Black start generator.
The SAG and Ball mills at the process plant are by far the largest loads on the power station. The SAG Mill has been specified with a VVVF (variable
speed) drive and the Ball Mill an LRS to provide a ‘soft start’ capability to reduce the load surge during start-up and minimise the need for ‘spinning
reserve’ in the power station.
18.7.2
Electrical Distribution
The electrical system is based on 13.8 kV distribution and 480 V, 60 Hz working voltage.
The 13.8 kV feeder from the power station will feed the site distribution 13.8 kV switchboard.
For the process plant the 13.8 kV supply will be stepped down from 13.8 kV to 480 V at each switchroom using separate 13.8 kV / 480 V distribution
transformers fed from the HV distribution board.
Four switchrooms are located throughout the process plant, nominally covering:
Primary Crushing.

Switchrooms will house 480 V motor control centres (MCCs), area VVVF drives, plant control system cabinets, plant lighting transformers, various
distribution boards and UPS power distribution.
Power distribution to plant and mine infrastructure will be via kiosk substations fed from the HV distribution board. Kiosk substations will be
provided for:
•
•
•
•
Laboratory.
Process Plant Workshop / Warehouse.
Process Plant and Admin Offices / Training Buildings.
Mine Services Area.
13.8 kV overhead power lines will provide power to various remote facilities (TSF pumps, bore pumps, water storage pond pumps, etc.). Pole
mounted transformers will step down the voltage at each location and supply an outdoor 480 V switchboard local to each equipment area.
Accommodation camp power will be supplied from a local pad mounted transformer fed from the 13.8 kV overhead line.
18.7.3
Electrical Buildings
Electrical buildings will pre-fabricated ‘flat pack’ panel buildings to minimise installation time on site. Buildings will be installed on a structural
framework over 2 m above ground level to allow for bottom entry of cables into electrical cabinets.
The electrical buildings will be installed with air-conditioners and suitably sealed to prevent ingress of dust.
18.7.4
Transformers and Compounds
All the 13.8 kV / 480 V distribution transformers will be of ONAN cooling configuration and vector group Dyn11.
Fire rated concrete walls will be constructed around the pad mounted transformers.

Fuel Supply
The powerstation includes tankage for fuel storage capacity of 1,100 kL of diesel and 4,000 kL of HFO. This equates to 30 days of fuel storage for
the powerplant operating under full load conditions.
An additional two 1,200 m3 diesel storage tanks are provided for fuel usage for the mobile fleet. At an estimated operating fuel consumption of
1,200 kL/month, this equates to 30 days of site diesel storage at full production.

Market Studies
No formal market studies have been undertaken.
A gold price of US$ 1,300/oz based on analyst consensus has been used for the Mineral Reserve estimate and the economic analysis.
Fekola will produce gold doré which is readily marketable on an ‘ex-works’ or ‘delivered’ basis to a number of refineries in Europe and Africa.
There are no indications of the presence of penalty elements that may impact the price or render the product unsalable.
Payment terms are widely available in the public domain and vary little from refinery to refinery. B2Gold has contracts in place for sale of gold from
its four producing mines in Nicaragua, the Philippines and Namibia. It has been assumed that Fekola doré will attract similar terms.
19.2
Contracts
There are no material contracts or agreements in place as of the effective date of this report.
Refining contracts are typically put in place with well recognized international refineries and sales are made based on spot gold prices. These
contracts typically include fees for transportation of the product from the site, insurance, assaying, refining and an allowance for metal losses
during refining. The ability to get a contract in place for the sale of doré prior to start of production is not seen as a risk to the Project.

COMMUNITY IMPACT
20.1
Environmental Studies
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was originally completed for the Project in 2013 (2013 Environmental and Social Impact
Statement (2013 ESIS)). This 2013 ESIS was approved by the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation on 29 April 2013. B2Gold has commissioned
an update of the ESIA (ESIA Update) to fill gaps identified in the 2013 ESIS, reflect optimization improvement and modifications to the Project
design, assess these improvements and modifications for their potential impacts against baseline conditions in the Project area, and align the
assessment with international standards including the IFC environmental and social performance standards. The ESIA Update is scheduled to be
completed on 30 June 2015.
The ESIA Update contains the policy, legal and administrative framework under which the study was carried out and the Project will be regulated
and  managed.  It  includes  a  description  of  the  Project  in  its  geographic,  ecological,  social  and  temporal  context.  The  ESIA  Update  includes
baseline  data  describing  relevant  physical,  biological  and  social  conditions  associated  with  the  Project  area  and  identifies  the  likely  types  of
environmental  and  social  impacts  associated  with  the  construction,  operation  and  closure  of  the  Project.  The  ESIA  Update  assesses  the
magnitude and likelihood of these impacts based on currently available Project information and presents proposed mitigation measures needed
to minimize potential impacts to acceptable levels. Stand-alone management plans to address residual impacts are also provided as part of the
ESIA documentation.
20.2
Permitting
Various permits and authorizations are required for the Project. The following sub-sections provide a brief summary of the status of key permits.
20.2.1
Environmental Permit
The environmental permit for the Project was granted to Songhoi Resources SARL by the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation via Decision
No. 2013-0033MEA-SG on 29 April 2013. The permit requires that Songhoi begin construction of the Project within 3 years of the issue of the
permit  and  also  allows  the  government  to  perform  an  environmental  audit  of  the  Project  every  five  years.  In  addition,  the  permit  includes  six
clauses with conditions/requirements relating to the following:
Air quality.
Soil conservation.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  environmental  permit  was  granted  based  on  the  previous  ESIS  dated  29  April  2013.  This  ESIA  Update  report
incorporates the content of the 2013 ESIS while also including assessment of modifications and improvements made to the Project design since
the issue of the 2013 ESIS.
20.2.2
Environmental Permit for Access Road
A second environmental permit, for the access road from the Millennial Highway near Segondo village to the mine site, was granted to Songhoi by
the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation via Decision No. 2015-0002MEADD-SG on 16 March 2015. Similar to the environmental permit approval
for  the  Project,  the  access  road  approval  requires  that  the  road  be  constructed  within  three  years  of  the  issue  of  the  permit  and  allows  the
government to perform and environmental of the access road every five years. In addition, the access road permit requires that the requirements
of the Project main environmental permit be met, as well as five clauses specific to this authorization relating to:
•
•
•
•
•
Air quality.
Soil conservation.
Surface water and groundwater.
Health, safety, employment and quality of life.
Cultural heritage.
20.2.3
Mining Permit
The mining permit for the Project was granted to Songhoi Resources SARL by the Secretary General via Decree No. 2014-0070/PM-RM, dated
13 February 2014, and signed by the Minister of Mines and the Prime Minister of Mali. The permit requires that Songhoi begin construction of the
Project within three years of the issue of the permit, is valid for up to 30 years and requires renewal every ten years.
20.2.4
Approval of Community Development Plan
As part of the ESIA process, the Project is required to submit for approval a Community Development Plan. A Community Development Plan,
dated 24 June 2013, was submitted to the Ministry of Land Administration, Decentralization and Regional Planning and approved by the Kéniéba
Prefect authorities via Decision No. 13-041/PCK, dated 04 July 2013.
20.2.5
Approval of Mine Closure Plan
As part of the process for the granting of an exploitation permit under the 2012 Mining Code, the Project is required to submit a mine closure plan.
A mine Conceptual Closure Plan, dated April 2013, was submitted to the Ministry of Mines as part of the exploitation permit application. By

Environmental Impact Assessment Process
The 2013 ESIS process was conducted to comply with Malian legislation while also taking into consideration international guidelines such as the
Equator Principles and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards. The ESIA Update was completed to fill gaps identified
in the 2013 ESIS, reflect optimization improvement and modifications to the Project design, assess these improvements and modifications for their
potential  impacts  against  baseline  conditions  in  the  Project  area,  and  align  the  assessment  with  international  standards  including  the  IFC
environmental and social performance standards.
The 2013 ESIS and the ESIA Update were developed by B2Gold (2013 ESIS was completed by Papillon Resources, since merged with B2Gold)
with the support of environmental and social specialists that were selected on the basis of their expertise in the development of environmental
and social impact assessments of mining projects and of the Project area.
The  initial  baseline  specialist  studies  were  conducted  in  approximately  2011  and  2012.  These  studies  were  incorporated  into  the  2013  ESIS
submitted to the Government of Mali and approved on 29 April 2013.
Specialist studies conducted for the 2013 ESIS are listed in Table 20.3.1.

To ensure that all parties are provided with an opportunity to obtain information on the Project as well as comment and raise issues relating to the
proposed development, a participatory and inclusive public consultation process was developed and undertaken for the Project as part of the
development of the 2013 ESIS. The emphasis of the consultation was on the effective involvement of the natural or legal persons likely to be
affected by the proposed development. The consultation process focused on the communities and settlements in the license area and along the
road from the town of Kéniéba to the site.

Summary of Environmental and Social Setting
20.4.1
Physical Setting
The Project is located in the South-Western part of Mali, close to the border with Senegal to the West and Guinea to the South. It is approximately
400  km  (525  km  by  road)  west  of  the  capital  city  of  Bamako,  within  the  Kéniéba  gold  belt  region.  The  landscape  is  characterized  as  tropical
savannah, with plateaus interspersed approximately 30 to 40 m above low-lying floodplains of the Falémé River. Elevation of the Project area
ranges from approximately 130 to 190 m above sea level.
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Page 20.6
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
July 2015
The Project region has a sub-tropical climate, with relatively high and uniform temperatures and distinct seasons; wet season (July to Sept) and
the dry season (October to June). The mean total annual rainfall measured at Kéniéba Station, located 38 km north of the Project, was 1,086.2 mm
over 44 years. A meteorological station within the Fekola Camp has shown a close correlation to the data from Kéniéba.
The  geology  of  the  Project  area  is  comprised  of  metasedimentary  rock  and  granitoids  of  the  Falémé  Series  (Paleoproterozoic  Birimian  age
geologic  parent  material).  The  Falémé  Series,  which  occurs  within  the  Dialé–Daléma  sedimentary  basin,  is  comprised  of  carbonate  rich
sedimentary rocks, minor basalts and andesites, rare rhyolites, and syntectonic granitoids (Hirdes and Davis, 2003).
Geochemical characterisation testwork indicates that the mine materials (waste rock, tailings, low grade ore and construction materials) are likely
to be non-acid forming and not likely to leach significant quantities of metals/metalloids to the receiving environment (Knight Piésold, 2015).
The Project is located adjacent to the Falémé River, a major tributary to the Senegal River. The river width is variable from 10 m to 45 m in the
vicinity of the Project. There is significant variation in seasonal flows of the Falémé River with approximately 90% of annual flow occurring during
the wet season months. Flows at Fadougou gradually decrease over the dry season from November (median flow 35.5 m³/s) to very little flow at
the end of the dry season in the months of March (median flow of 5.6 m³/s) and April (median flow 3.9 m³/s). Annual flow is also highly variable year
to year.
There are a number of ephemeral creeks that drain the Project area, all of which drain to the Falémé River (Figure 20.4.1). Key ephemeral creeks in
the Tenement include:
•
•
•
•
Drainage 1 - located in the northern extent of the Médinandi Tenement.
Drainage 2 - located to the west of Fadougou Village.
Drainage 3 - which passes through the proposed location of the mine pit, waste rock dump, low grade ore stockpile, TSF, and water supply dams.
Drainage 4 - located to the south of the No-Go Zone.
Groundwater  storage  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Project  Area  is  highly  dependent  upon  rainfall  and  evaporation  balances.  Recharge  of  aquifers  is
expected to occur during the wet season when rainfall exceeds the evaporation rate, while discharge is expected to occur via evapotranspiration
and the river bed. Groundwater bores around the proposed pit on the Project site showed groundwater is reached at 2 to 5 m below ground level,
with  observed  seasonal  variation  of  approximately  4  to  5  m.  There  is  no  significant  abstraction  of  groundwater  in  the  Project  area;  however
villages in the vicinity rely on bore holes for domestic water use, drinking water and artisanal mining.
Water quality of the Falémé River was found to be good; with near neutral pH, low conductivity and low total metal concentrations. The only
exception found was high total suspended solids (TSS) found locally at the monitoring site adjacent to Fadougou Village. Groundwater was also
found to
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS

be  of  good  quality  with  only  one  exception;  nitrate  concentration  exceeding  applicable  drinking  water  quality  standards  at  Tintiba.  Elevated
nutrient concentrations in the Tintiba groundwater sample are likely to be associated with aquifer contamination from disposal of village and
sewage wastes close to the village borehole.
Baseline air quality and noise in the vicinity of the Project area are typical of rural areas in the region, and no major industrial sites are located
nearby. Air quality is most likely affected by sources such as: dust from unpaved roads and Harmattan winds, burning, open cooking, livestock
farming, and mining. Noise emissions in the vicinity of the Project area largely originate from human activity, primarily vehicle and motorcycle use
on  roads  and  pathways  and  artisanal  mining,  both  domestic  and  wild  animals  and  insect  activity.  Baseline  noise  monitoring  was  undertaken
during the wet season. The ambient (LAeq) daytime noise levels in Fadougou Village were recorded to slightly exceed the IFC ambient daytime
noise criterion of 55 dB(A), while night-time ambient noise levels were slightly below IFC criteria.

Biological Setting
A  Biodiversity  Baseline  Study  and  Impact  Assessment  was  conducted  by  Epoch  Resources  in  January  2013  for  the  Project’s  2013  ESIS.  To
supplement  this  information,  aquatic  ecology  surveys  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Project  were  recently  undertaken  by  INGRID  S/C  Groupe  Sapiens
International, and a Priority Habitats and Species Study was conducted by Earth Systems as part of the ESIA Update to provide supplementary
ecological information and mapping from recent satellite imagery, current and past studies, literature, and published documents.
There  are  no  protected  areas  within  or  near  to  the  Project  Area.  The  Project  is  located  in  the  western  part  of  the  West  Sudanian  Savannah
ecoregion (1,638,426 km2). This broad ecoregion is covered by Sahelo-Sudanian / Sudanian vegetation consisting of savannah types, gallery
forests, woodland and an understorey of shrubs, grasses and herbs. Vegetation is highly influenced by the two distinct seasons of the ecoregion;
the hot / dry season and the wet season. The habitats in this ecoregion have been greatly reduced and fragmented by agricultural activities, fire,
and timber harvesting, while populations of most of the larger mammal species have been decimated by over-hunting.
Figure 20.4.2 West Sudanian Savannah Ecoregion (Yellow)
Red star indicated approximate Project location (adapted from WWF, 2015)
The aquatic environments of the Project are within the ‘Senegal-Gambia freshwater ecoregion’. This freshwater ecoregion consists of tropical and
subtropical floodplains, rivers and wetland complexes. The Senegal-Gambia freshwater habitats are considered nationally important, and are also
considered ‘vulnerable’ due to existing threats.
One of the most important and influential ecological features in the vicinity of the Project is the Falémé River and its associated tributaries. The
reach of the Falémé River directly downstream of the Project is not within any protected areas and is not protected itself. Seasonally inundated
wetlands are located in the Project Development Area and surrounds, as well as along the Falémé River.
The main terrestrial habitat types within the Project Development Area are tree savannah, shrub savannah, woody savannah, gallery forest, and
bowal. All habitat types have moderate levels of

disturbance. Signs of disturbance include land use changes (e.g. cultivation and grazing), timber harvesting, uncontrolled burning and artisanal
mining. Some areas of gallery forest in the north of the Project Development Area have been highly disturbed or cleared, while patches of gallery
forest along the Falémé River are relatively intact.
In  addition  to  several  regionally  important  species,  the  baseline  field  studies  confirmed  the  presence  of  globally  threatened  Hooded  vulture
(Necrosyrtes monachus – Endangered) and Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious – Vulnerable). Three globally vulnerable plants were also
identified in the Project Development Area during field surveys: Afzelia africana, Khaya senegalensis, and Vitellaria paradoxa.
In addition, two globally threatened large mammals were reported by local villagers as being occasionally present in the vicinity of the Project
area, although their presence has not been confirmed:
•
•
Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes – Endangered) / West African chimpanzee sub-species P. t. verus – Endangered).
African lion (Panthera leo – Vulnerable, West African subpopulation classed as Endangered).
No globally threatened aquatic flora or fauna was identified within the Falémé River in the initial dry season surveys conducted; however there
was high fish diversity recorded indicating that the river is in relatively good ecological condition. Along with many phytoplankton, zooplankton
and macro invertebrates, the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), and two endemic fish occur in the Falémé River near the Project Development
Area: the freshwater rat-tail (Gymnarchus niloticus) and the African electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus).
20.4.3
Social Setting
The rural landscape surrounding the Project area is sparsely populated and mostly undeveloped. Kéniéba, the nearest sizeable town and the
administrative headquarters of the prefecture, is located approximately 40 km north of the Project. The Project is situated within the Kéniéba gold
belt, which contains a dense concentration of mineral exploration licences and several operational gold mines including Randgold’s Gounkoto
and Loulo Projects and Endeavour Mining’s Tabakoto and Segala Projects.
There are 22 settlements identified within an approximately 10 km of the Project area, including along the mine access road. Notably one large
village (Fadougou) with a total of 1,355 people, and 255 households (per 2012 census), is located within 1 km of the Project infrastructure. It has
been observed that recent in-migration to this village is currently resulting in population increases. Consistent with other parts of the region, the
Malinke  are  the  dominant  ethnic  group  in  Fadougou  Village,  comprising  more  than  85%  of  the  population.  The  Malinke  language  is  the  most
common language in Fadougou, spoken by 47% of households, followed by Bambara (28% of households).
The  major  economic/livelihood  activities  in  the  communities  surrounding  the  Project  are  subsistence  agriculture  (farming  and  livestock)  and
artisanal mining (including some semi-industrial scale operations). Currently thirteen artisanal mining sites have been identified in the permit area,
ten of which are active. Internal migration is common in Mali, particularly in the gold mining areas of south-western Mali.

Approximately 44% of the population in Fadougou Village are below the age of 20 years old and 49% of the population were between 21 to 46
years  old,  representing  93.3%  of  the  population  (2012).  The  primary  schooling  rate  for  Kéniéba  is  61%,  whereby  the  schooling  rate  of  the
Fadougou Village and surrounding villages is reported at 75% for the 2012 to 2013 year. There are primary schools in Fadougou and Médinandi
however there are no secondary schools close to the Project.
Health infrastructure in the vicinity of the Project is limited. The nearest hospital to the Project is located in Kéniéba approximately 40 km away.
Fadougou has one Community Health Centre, one private clinic / infirmary and one pharmacy, while among the closest villages and hamlets, only
Médinandi also has a private clinic. Malaria is common in the Kéniéba District. There are also other water and sanitation related illnesses due to
poor sanitation and waste management standards. Nutritional issues contribute to health problems due to a shortage in some food supplies in the
local area.
Authorities stated that the current water supplies to the local villages surrounding the Project are insufficient for the population, with three manual
pump bores in Fadougou, and one in each of the other three closest villages. No electricity-related generation or distribution infrastructure is
located in the local villages apart from privately owned diesel generators used only for mining operations. Firewood is the most common form of
energy used in the area for cooking and lighting.
Accessibility in the area is generally poor, particularly in the wet season. Unformed dirt tracks connect villages and hamlets in the local area, and
provide access to Kéniéba. These are important transport routes for residents for employment, education and livelihood purposes; including the
closest  markets  in  Kéniéba  or  Kolomba.  Two  mobile  telephone  networks  are  available  in  most  surrounding  villages  however  internet  is  not
accessible in the local villages.
There  are  no  known  sites  of  international  or  national  archaeological  or  cultural  heritage  significance  within  the  Project  Area  or  surrounds.
However, surveys identified 34 archaeological and cultural sites within the broad exploration permit area (Médinandi Tenement), including ancient
habitats, scree mounds, iron reduction sites, worship sites, memorial sites, and a place of refuge. Several of these are located in the direct vicinity
of the Project footprint.

Summary of Key Environmental and Social Potential Impacts
A  detailed  assessment  of  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  from  the  development  of  the  Project  was  conducted.  The  methodology
employed  utilises  a  systematic  and  repeatable  process  of  identifying  the  potential  impacts  arising  from  the  development  and  rating  their
significance. The potential impacts from the development of the Project were evaluated for the construction, operations, and decommissioning /
post-closure phases. The methodology for assessing the impact significance for each aspect includes the assessment of the receiving resource /
receptor sensitivity and/or value, as well as evaluation of the impact magnitude associated with the proposed Project development under normal
operating conditions, in order to determine an overall impact significance rating.
Potential risks associated with the proposed Project development were also assessed and discussed, as part of the impact assessment process.
The assessment and discussion of potential risks associated with the Project development was broadly aligned with internationally accepted risk
assessment methodologies, such as ISO31000 Risk management — Principles and Guidelines (2009) and ISO31010 Risk Management – Risk
Assessment Techniques (2009).
The approach in the ESIA Update has been to build on the existing assessment work conducted for the 2013 ESIS and to update the impact
assessment to reflect modifications to the updated Project design and to align the assessment with relevant international standards.
Wherever possible, environmental and social impacts have been iteratively avoided or reduced throughout the ESIA Update process by making
changes to the Project design (e.g. movement of a road to avoid a key environmental feature). A key principle for the implementation of mitigation
measures to reduce potential impacts is the mitigation hierarchy. As per IFC Performance Standard 1, adopting the mitigation hierarchy is to “to
anticipate and avoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize, and, where residual impacts remain, compensate / offset for risks and impacts
to workers, affected communities, and the environment.” The application of the mitigation hierarchy is to implement a set of prioritised steps to
avoid and minimise the potential impacts of the Project to the extent practical, and compensate for residual impacts. The highest priority action is
avoidance, while the lowest priority is providing offsets.
Potential  impacts  were  assessed  for  the  various  aspects  characterized  in  the  environmental  and  social  baseline  investigations  discussed  in
Sections  20.4  and  20.5.  Following  the  implementation  of  proposed  mitigation  measures  and  under  normal  operating  conditions,  identified
potential impacts are not estimated to cause significant long-term, adverse impacts on receptors / the receiving environment. Key findings from
the impact assessment included the following areas:
Air quality.
Water.
Biodiversity.
Access to land resources.
Livelihood and employment.
Social services / infrastructure.

Key findings related to these aspects are summarized briefly in the following sub-sections.
20.5.1
Air quality
The proposed Project operations will result in fugitive particulate (i.e., dust) emissions (Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), PM10 and PM2.5) and
gaseous emissions from generators and vehicle exhaust pipes (diesel particulate matter, NO2 and SO2), with the key potential impact to receptors
being fugitive particulate emissions.
The main source of particulate emissions at the Project is expected to be vehicle entrainment, with crushing, drilling and blasting, and generator
exhaust emissions contributing to a lesser extent. Impacts are expected to varying degrees to the surrounding flora and fauna and in the five
communities  in  the  immediate  Project  area;  however,  the  greatest  impacts  will  occur  at  the  village  of  Fadougou  due  to  its  proximity.  Without
mitigation, adverse impacts from fugitive particulates at the village of Fadougou could be significant with particulate concentrations at receptors
expected to exceed relevant guidelines.
Mitigation Measures and Residual Impacts
B2Gold  will  implement  a  number  of  mitigation  measures  to  reduce  fugitive  particulate  concentrations  at  sensitive  receptors  (e.g.,  village  of
Fadougou). Typical mitigation measures to be implemented include:
•
•
•
•
•
Location of facilities / equipment that produce emissions away from sensitive receptors.
Installation of filters, baghouses, screens, etc. where practical.
Water sprays on haul roads.
Chemical suppression on haul roads.
Water sprays at crushers.
•
•
Water sprays at materials handling points.
Water sprays on drill rigs.
In addition, air quality monitoring of fugitive particulate and gaseous emissions will be conducted throughout the life of the Project, and additional
mitigation  will  be  implemented  if  necessary  to  ensure  compliance  with  relevant  guidelines.  With  the  implementation  of  proposed  mitigation
measures, it is expected that impacts at the village of Fadougou may still be moderated but should be reduced to acceptable levels. Post-closure,
following the cessation of the majority of fugitive dust source activities and rehabilitation and revegetation of the Project site, the residual long-
term impacts from fugitive particulate emissions are expected to not be significant.

20.5.2
Hydrology, Hydrogeology and Water Quality
Potential hydrology, hydrogeology and water quality impacts of the Project were initially considered in the 2013 ESIS. Since the preparation of the
2013 ESIS, design modifications such as locating the majority of Project infrastructure in a single catchment and removing the requirement for
abstraction of water from the Falémé River have resulted in a significant reduction in the potential hydrology, hydrogeology, and water quality
impacts of the Project.
Hydrology
Impacts to the local surface water hydrology during construction are expected to be minor to moderate. The morphology of Drainage 3 (Figure
20.4.1), an ephemeral creek which flows seasonally through the main Project development area, will be altered with diversion of surface water
around the northern extent of the pit footprint to the catchment of another creek to the north (Drainage 2). Subsequently, the flow in Drainage 3
downstream of the Project Footprint will significantly decrease with impoundment and diversion of the upper reach of this ephemeral creek.
During operations, impacts to the local surface water hydrology are expected to be minor to moderate. Three ephemeral creeks in the vicinity of
the Project (Drainages 2, 3, and 4) will be impacted during the rainy season. As with the construction phase, a significant decrease in flows for
Drainage 3 is expected downstream of the Project footprint with the diversion of water around the lower reaches of this catchment (to Drainage 2
in early operations and the lower reaches of Drainage 4 for the remainder of the operations phase), and capture of surface water run-off within the
TSF, Contact Water Storage Pond, and Fresh Water Storage Pond. The Fresh Water Storage Pond is expected to release water throughout the
year, while dewatering of the open pit is conducted, and the Contact Water Storage Pond is expected to discharge, water quality permitting, during
the wet season. This is expected to result in flows in the Project diversion channel, the lower reaches of Drainage 4 and the release of water to the
Falémé River during mining.
Impacts to regional hydrology (e.g. the Falémé River) are expected to be negligible during both construction and operations as water abstraction
from the Falémé River is not expected to be required and Drainage 3 represents less than 0.1% of the total catchment for the Falémé River at its
point of intersection (i.e. at Fadougou). Additional flows, to be released to the Falémé River from either of the Storage Water Ponds, are expected
to be negligible compared with the median seasonal flow of the Falémé River (i.e. mostly less than 1% of the Falémé River flow). In the event that
water  abstraction  from  the  Falémé  River  is  required  to  supplement  Project  water  supply,  a  minimum  environmental  flow  will  need  to  be
established, below which the Project will not abstract water, in order to protect downstream water use and base aquatic ecology.
Post-closure impacts to local surface water hydrology in the Project Area are considered minor, with primarily only the lower reaches of one creek
(Drainage 3) affected.
Water Quality
The  primary  impact  to  surface  water  quality  during  construction  will  be  suspended  sediments  generated  from  land  clearing  /  earthworks,
extraction from quarries/borrow areas, and road construction / unsealed road surfaces. The majority of input will result from water erosion of
disturbed areas during the wet season. Water courses most affected by suspended sediments are likely to be Drainage 3 and, to lesser extent,
Drainages 2, 4 and the Falémé River. Overall, water quality impacts during construction are expected to be moderate.

FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Progressive rehabilitation and established erosion and sediment control measures are expected to reduce suspended sediment water quality
impacts during the operations phase. Static geochemical testwork indicates that the geochemical risk associated with the waste rock, tailings and
pit wall rock is low, with no net generation of acidic drainage expected and leachate expected to contain only low dissolved metals concentrations.
Kinetic geochemical testwork is being conducted to further characterise potential geochemical impacts. Process water will not be discharged
from  site  during  operations  and  will  be  recycled  from  the  TSF  supernatant  pond  to  the  Process  Plant.  Cyanide  concentrations  in  the  TSF
supernatant pond will be maintained below 50 mg/L weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide via cyanide destruction (INCO Process) in the tailings
liquor, throughout the operational life of the Project in order to protect wildlife (e.g. birdlife attracted to a water body) and livestock that may access
the TSF. Surface water run-off from the pit, waste rock dumps (if water quality requires), low grade ore stockpile and process plant will be managed
through the Contact Water Storage Pond. The Fresh Water Storage Pond will capture upstream surface water run-off and pit dewatering from the
dewatering bores. The Contact and Fresh Water Storage Ponds are expected to routinely discharge water to the receiving environment during the
wet season. Water quality will be routinely monitored and water will only be discharged once the applicable discharge standards are met.
Rehabilitation and established erosion and sediment control measures are expected to reduce suspended sediment water quality impacts post-
closure. However, there may be increased suspended sediment concentrations in downstream water quality at decommissioning, associated with
rehabilitation earthworks. One-off treatment of water bodies (e.g. TSF supernatant pond, Contact Water Storage Pond and Fresh Water Storage
Pond), if required, prior to discharge to the environment at decommissioning is expected to minimise potential water quality impacts associated
with the release of these waters.
Groundwater
A groundwater cone of depression, surrounding the open pit, is expected to develop during operations, associated with the dewatering of the pit
to allow for mining operations below the groundwater table. The extent of the groundwater cone of depression is expected to be greater than 2.5
km, from the edge of the pit, in a north-south direction. The village wells for Fadougou and Médinandi are within the zone of groundwater level
drawdown,  and  groundwater  levels  in  the  vicinity  of  these  two  villages  are  expected  to  decrease  by  greater  than  10  m.  Groundwater  level
drawdown will be monitored during operations and alternative water supplies identified and provided for Fadougou and Médinandi villages in the
event that water supply from the village wells is interrupted.
Rehabilitation of the TSF at decommissioning, including treatment of the TSF supernatant pond at decommissioning, is expected to minimise the
potential for residual impacts. The pit is expected to act as a sink for any seepage from the TSF. Estimates of post-closure pit lake water quality
indicate  that  water  will  meet  relevant  water  quality  standards.  Monitoring  of  surface  and  groundwater  post-closure  will  be  implemented  to
determine whether additional measures are required to avoid post-closure impacts to water quality.

Post-closure,  groundwater  levels  are  expected  to  rebound  after  the  cessation  of  pit  dewatering.  Groundwater  levels  are  expected  to  take
approximately  55  years  after  closure  to  reach  equilibrium  as  the  pit  lake  reaches  its  capacity.  Groundwater  level  impacts  post-closure  are
expected  to  be  far  lower  than  during  operations.  However,  residual  groundwater  level  impacts  post-closure  will  need  to  be  quantified  during
operations.
With the implementation of the detailed water management and monitoring program proposed for the Project (refer ESIA Update Volume II) the
potential  water  quality  and  hydrology  impacts  and  risks  from  the  Project  and  subsequent  impacts  on  water  use  will  be  greatly  reduced.  The
Project will also implement a number of significant measures to ensure any unavoidable impacts of the Project on water use are compensated for.
These  could  include  a  household  latrine  building  programme,  developing  an  institutional  support  programme  to  establish  or  strengthen
community hygiene committees in Project affected villages, and construction of potable water infrastructure in key villages.
20.5.3
Biodiversity
A number of priority biodiversity features (including threatened and protected species) that will be impacted by the development of the Project
have been identified in the Project area. There are no identified Protected Areas in the vicinity of the Project. Key potential adverse impacts to
biodiversity are presented in the following sub-sections.
Terrestrial Flora
The most significant adverse potential impacts on terrestrial habitat and flora as a result of the Project are expected to be:
•
•
•
Habitat loss and associated degradation.
Potential loss of individual stems of priority flora.
Over exploitation of natural resources and poaching due to in-migration.
Terrestrial Fauna
The principal potential impacts on terrestrial fauna as a result of the Project are expected to be:
Habitat loss and associated degradation – natural habitats will be removed for Project components and roads.
Barriers to movement from the clearance of habitat and construction of the Project components.
Noise and vibration.
Vehicle collisions.
Drinking contaminated water (e.g. from the TSF).
Light spills.

Aquatic Habitats and Fauna
The principal potential impact to aquatic biodiversity for the Project will relate to potential physical impacts on hydrology and water quality. Other
potentially significant impacts will include direct habitat loss and degradation associated with the siting of the Project Footprint, and increased
pressure on aquatic resources from Project-related population increases.
Mitigation Measures and Residual Impacts
Throughout the Project, B2Gold will implement numerous mitigation measures including commitments identified in the 2013 ESIS, requirements of
the existing Environmental and Biodiversity Performance Standards (2014) relevant to all B2Gold operational mines, and others. A summary of
key mitigation measures is presented as follows:
•
•
•
A Biodiversity Management Plan will be implemented, communicated, adhered to and maintained.
Additional, targeted ecological studies of terrestrial flora and fauna and aquatic habitats and fauna will be conducted to increase knowledge about
species presence in the area.
Environmental awareness raising and training will be conducted aimed at minimising the impacts on flora and fauna.
Noise  generating  activities  will  be  mitigated  to  be  within  legal  noise  limits  and  disturbance  levels  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum  and  restricted  to
Noise  generating  activities  will  be  mitigated  to  be  within  legal  noise  limits  and  disturbance  levels  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum  and  restricted  to
operational areas.
The design, construction and operation of facilities will be focused on the lowest level of intrusion, through the use of silencers, non-reflective non-toxic
paints, low wattage / coloured lighting pointing towards infrastructure and away from the natural surroundings, and the use of vegetation as buffers
around infrastructure.
Water storage facilities, diversion structures and containment facilities will be designed to limit and reduce fauna access and to provide easy egress for
any trapped fauna.
Eradication programs will be considered with regards to pest flora and fauna species.
Where the operation of mobile machinery can impact wildlife, control measures shall be developed, implemented and monitored to reduce injury or
mortality. Control measures could include fencing of impacted areas or lease boundaries, reducing speed limits, installation of wildlife corridors and/or
training and awareness of employees and contractors.
Site procedures will be developed, implemented and communicated to prohibit:
•
•
unauthorised hunting, trapping or fishing or the unauthorized harvesting of forest products
minimising and/or restricting access to designated areas.
•
•

Prior to vegetation clearance, ‘animal scaring’ activities will be conducted to reduce and minimize loss of fauna individuals during the removal of
vegetation. This will include rescue of vulnerable individuals, such as females with cubs or nests with chicks, and their transfer to suitable sites for
further release.
Biodiversity monitoring programs will be developed, implemented and periodically reviewed. These monitoring programs will include the monitoring of
any potential or actual adverse biodiversity impacts (e.g. sensitive or protected areas) and the effectiveness of implemented control measures.
The measures included in the Rehabilitation and Preliminary Mine Closure Plan will be implemented at the Project site. The site will be rehabilitated
and revegetated concurrently during operations to the extent practical and fully at closure to restore impacted flora and habitats and provide self-
sustaining natural ecosystems within the Project Development Area.
In addition to the measures described above, given the potential impacts of the Project on a number of priority biodiversity features, B2Gold will
consider providing biodiversity offsets for the Project. The requirement for biodiversity offsets will be assessed based on the outcomes of the
additional  ecological  surveys  to  be  conducted  for  the  Project.  The  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  provides  a  framework  for  the  development  of  a
detailed Biodiversity Offset Strategy that would need to be developed if biodiversity offsets were to be implemented for the Project.
Potential impacts to biodiversity during construction and operations area expected to be moderate, however, with the implementation of proposed
mitigation  measures  including  the  rehabilitation  and  revegetation  of  the  Project  site  following  mine  closure  the  expected  residual  long-term
impacts are expected to not be significant.
20.5.4
Access to Land Resources
The communities in the Project area rely on land resources to make a subsistence living, primarily via small scale farming and/or artisanal mining
activities. The community most significantly impacted is the village of Fadougou. The Project’s No-go Zone has isolated the village and reduced
livelihood options for the community. In particular, the No-go Zone which:
Leaves the village wedged between the No-go Zone to the north-east and the Falémé River to the west, blocking expansion to the east, north-east and
south-east.
Passes within 50 m of some village structures in the school sector (east) and community health sector (south-east).
Will block access to agricultural properties located east of the mine.
Has required the relocation of some properties to new locations northwest of Fadougou. Good land is now a scarce resource.

Has resulted in some Fadougou villagers occupying land owned by the Médinandi village to the north with resulting potential for future conflict.
Restricts use of access roads connecting Fadougou-Moussala, Fadougou-Fadougou Niafa, and Fadougou-Guémedjè.
As a result of these impacts, the village of Fadougou, at its present location, will face significant impacts relating to land resource access that will
worsen if the population increases from the influx of people expected in the advent of an operating mine.
B2Gold will implement various mitigation measures to reduce the impacts to land resources. These measures are described in the Community
Development  Plan  (CDP)  developed  for  the  Project  (see  CDP  Section  20.7.10).  The  overall  objective  of  the  CDP  is  to  create  an  enhanced,
sustainable economy following mine closure. Specifically relating to land resources the CDP outlines the framework by which the Project can
work  with  local  communities  to  improve  land  resource  productivity  (i.e.,  agriculture,  livestock,  and  forest  resources)  and  promote  other
sustainable economic drivers to compensate for potential losses or negative impacts.
The above mentioned potential impacts to land resources can be mitigated and reduced to acceptable levels. However, residual impacts will likely
remain following the implementation of such measures resulting in the potential for complaints by the community and its inhabitants and conflicts
between the community and its inhabitants and the Project. Due to this potential for conflict, B2Gold will evaluate resettlement of the village of
Fadougou (described in the following sub-section).
Potential Resettlement of Village of Fadougou
Although resettlement of the village of Fadougou is not necessary, resettlement can ensure access to adequate land resources now and in the
future. In addition, resettlement would eliminate or minimize other potential social, safety or environmental risks to the community (e.g., eliminate
potential  safety  risks  such  as  fly  rock  and  air  blast,  greatly  reduce  the  risk  of  vehicle  and  equipment  accidents,  and  minimize  potential
environmental impacts (e.g., fugitive dust, noise) to negligible levels.
If it is decided that resettlement of the village of Fadougou is beneficial to eliminate or reduce negative impacts and maximize beneficial impacts to
the community, resettlement would be implemented in compliance with Malian law and in line with international best practice, i.e., International
Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standard 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. When resettlement is not able to be avoided,
IFC Performance Standard 5 objectives include:
•
The minimization of adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition or restrictions on land use by:
•
•
providing compensation for loss of assets at replacement cost
ensuring that resettlement activities are implemented with appropriate disclosure of information, consultation, and the informed participation of
those affected.

•
•
Improving or restoring the livelihoods and standards of living of displaced persons.
Improving living conditions among physically displaced persons through the provision of adequate housing with security of tenure at resettlement sites.
Preliminary construction activities have already commenced at the Project site. If determined necessary, resettlement would occur as soon as is
practical  to  reduce  potential  impacts  and  conflicts  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  In  general,  the  potential  impacts  to  Fadougou  and  its
inhabitants  are  more  significant  closer  to  the  Project  and  become  less  significant  as  one  moves  away  from  the  Project,  particularly  potential
environmental impacts such as fugitive dust or noise. Resettlement, therefore, would begin with those homes and inhabitants potentially most
impacted by the Project, i.e., those homes and inhabitants closest to the Project. The closest homes and inhabitants would be resettled first, and
once resettled, the next closest homes would be resettled and etc. until all of the homes and inhabitants of Fadougou are resettled.
20.5.5
Livelihood and Employment
The development of the Project will have a significant impact on the potential for paid employment and other forms of livelihood in the Project
area, via both direct employment by the Project and jobs created in the communities due to the overall increased economic activity in the area. In
general, these impacts are positive, however, the local residents in the communities surrounding the mine have little formal work experience, a
general low level of relevant skills, and there will not be sufficient available jobs to employ all the locals in search of work. If not managed properly,
it  is  possible  that  the  potential  positive  impacts  of  employment  will  not  be  fully  appreciated  in  the  Project  area.  To  this  extent  B2Gold  will
implement a number of measures to ensure potential positive impacts are maximized throughout the life of the mine, including:
B2Gold will preferentially hire employees based on the following criteria:
•
•
•
Malian nationals, who possess the required skills and abilities
candidates over 18 years old, and
current local residents and returning local residents, in preference over job seekers who have recently arrived in the area.
B2Gold has committed during public consultation with the local communities to hire local residents to fill at least 60% of the unskilled job positions at
the mine site.
B2Gold has committed to establishing a training centre focused on increasing skills of youth in the communities surrounding the Project to prepare
them for potential employment with the mine during operations.

FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT

Page 20.22
In addition to measures aimed at maximizing direct employment positive impacts in the Project area, B2Gold will also implement initiatives in the
surrounding communities to create sustainable small- and medium-scale enterprise and other sustainable economic programs throughout the life
of  the  Project.  A  Community  Development  Plan  (CDP)  has  been  developed  that  presents  the  framework  to  promote  sustainable  community
development opportunities in the Project area (see CDP Section 20.7.10).
Following closure of the Project, economic activity and direct employment will most likely fall compared to operations. There is the potential that
this reduction in activity leads to negative impacts associated with unemployment and loss of business, however, with successful implementation
of sustainable community development initiatives throughout the life of the Project and additional community development initiatives specifically
targeted at the post-closure period it is expected that potential negative long-term impacts can be minimized and that the overall impact of the
Project will be positive.
20.5.6
Social Services / Infrastructure
The population of the five communities in the Project area was estimated in 2012 to be 2,458 people. The population has likely increased since
2012 and will increase further with development of the Project. In general, the communities in the Project area have limited education, health care,
sanitation, and etc. services, as well as poor infrastructure (roads, access to electricity, etc.) and not a high level of available goods and services.
The expected in-migration due to the development of the Project and its subsequent impacts on the communities in the Project area have the
potential to be significant.
In-ward migration can have positive and negative impacts such as:
•
•
•
•
•
Stimulating the local economy and community organization. Wages and salaries will be injected into the local economy creating additional jobs and
economic opportunities.
Developing informal settlements which increase demand / need for basic infrastructure – land, housing, clean water supplies, sanitation, and electricity
and waste management systems.
Increasing pressure on government services such as health and education facilities, their staffing, and capital and operating cost requirements.
Increasing incidence of social ills including alcoholism, drug abuse, prostitution, and criminality.
Increasing incidence of disease such as sexually transmitted diseases including HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis.
The  above  impacts  can  have  severe  negative  consequences  that  can  last  beyond  the  life  of  the  Project.  To  mitigate  these  potential  negative
impacts and ensure that the communities in the Project area have an enhanced, sustainable economy following mine closure, B2Gold will invest
in improving infrastructure, education, health care, and other economic programs to promote sustainability. The Community Development Plan
(see CDP Section 20.7.10) presents the
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Page 20.23
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
July 2015
framework to promote sustainable community development opportunities in the Project area. To be successful these efforts must be carefully co-
ordinated with those of local government and the community through planned engagement and public-private partnerships. B2Gold will engage
with  local  communities  and  other  stakeholders  through  the  measures  outlined  in  the  Stakeholder  Engagement  Plan  (SEP)  (see  SEP
Section 20.7.9), including identifying Project stakeholders, ensuring timely and effective communication between the Project site and affected
stakeholders  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project,  documenting  meaningful  Project  consultation  and  disclosure,  establishing  a  formal  grievance
process, and monitoring and reporting upon the performance of stakeholder engagement processes.
With the successful implementation of the measures outlined in the CDP and SEP, is expected that potential negative long-term impacts on social
services and infrastructure can be minimized and that the overall impact of the Project will be positive.

Summary of Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan
An Environmental and Social Management Plan was developed as part of the 2013 ESIS that documented the proposed mitigation and control
measures designed to meet Project regulatory requirements and reduce potential impacts from the proposed Project to acceptable levels. This
Environmental and Social Management Plan has been updated to account for optimization and modification of the Project and a corresponding
Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP) has been developed as part of the ESIA Update. This ESMMP is supported
by  a  number  of  individual  Management  Plans  (MP’s)  that  describe  how  the  site  will  meet  relevant  regulations,  standards  and  guidelines  and
manage and minimize key environmental and social risks of the Project. The ESMMP and its supporting individual MP’s are “living documents”
which will be amended periodically throughout the life of the Project to reflect changes in procedures, practices, Project phase, etc.
The following Management Plans have been created:
Environmental Monitoring Plan.
Water Management Plan.
Waste Management Plan.
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
Rehabilitation and Preliminary Mine Closure Plan.
Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.
Biodiversity Action Plan.
Stakeholder Engagement Plan.
Community Development Plan.

Additional MP’s will be created as the Project develops and as they become necessary.
20.6.1
Environmental Monitoring Plan
The Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) will continue to build upon the environmental database that was generated to characterize baseline
conditions for the 2013 ESIS and the 2015 ESIA Update. Ongoing environmental monitoring programs will continue to document site conditions,
focusing on the generation of data sets that will allow evaluation of the environmental performance of specific project components. The EMP
covers data collection of the following environmental aspects:
•
Meteorology.
Air quality.
Noise and vibration.
Water.
Biodiversity.
•
•
•
•
20.6.2
Water Management Plan
There are a number of sources in all Project phases that have the potential to adversely impact water resources. The Water Management Plan
(Water MP) outlines the strategies, operational controls and management practices that will be put in place to effectively manage water at the
Project site. The Water MP includes water quality objectives, describes site water balances, and defines process water, stormwater, discharges
and dewatering activities to ensure that human health and the environment are protected.
20.6.3
Waste Management Plan
Waste is generated during all phases of the Project. Waste streams likely to be generated during the life of the Project include the following:
•
•
•
•
Mining / Processing wastes (waste rock and process tailings).
Hazardous wastes (waste oils, solvents, laboratory wastes, and medical wastes).
Domestic wastes (inert wastes such as plastic, glass, and construction materials).
Organic wastes (food and plant material).
The Waste Management Plan (Waste MP) details the handling, storing, and disposing of non-process wastes (i.e., excluding waste rock, ore and
tailings) that are generated by Project activities, including the mining operations, Process Plant, workshop, offices, tailings storage facility (TSF)
and other facilities. The Waste MP also addresses the management of wastes designated for special handling including hazardous, medical, and
emergency response wastes and sewage as well as the minimization of waste through composting and recycling programs.

20.6.4
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
Project  development,  and  in  particular  Project  construction,  will  expose  soils  to  erosive  forces  of  water  through  precipitation  and  stormwater
runoff. The Erosion and Sediment Control Management Plan (ESCMP) documents B2Gold’s approach to avoiding and / or mitigation of erosion
and sediment transport during the life of mine and post-closure for the Project. The ESCMP documents general ESC Best Management Practices
(BMPs) that will be considered for implementation pending site-specific requirements and provides recommendations for site-specific measures
for Project facilities prone to erosion or near sensitive receptors.
20.6.5
Rehabilitation and Preliminary Mine Closure Plan
A Rehabilitation and Preliminary Mine Closure Plan (RMCP) has been developed as the first step in providing a clear methodology for progressive
rehabilitation and planning for decommissioning and closure the Project. Additional details regarding the RMCP are provided in Section 20.7.
20.6.6
Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan
The  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan(EPRP)  outlines  the  processes  to  be  implemented  at  the  Project  for  responding  to  on-site
emergencies, including accidental spills and releases, fires, explosions, medical emergencies and others. It is designed to minimize employee
exposure to risk and injury and limit potential impacts to the environment in emergency situations. The EPRP identifies training programs for
emergency  recognition  and  prevention,  methods  and  procedures  for  alerting  on-site  employees,  resources  for  medical  and  emergency
treatments, and procedures for containment and clean-up of accidental spills.
20.6.7
Biodiversity Action Plan
A number of priority species were identified in the vicinity of the Project that may potentially be impacted by the development of the Project. The
objective of the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) is to avoid and minimise potential residual impacts on Project area biodiversity wherever feasible.
The BAP outlines specific mitigation measures to be implemented at the site and outlines further studies required to reduce current ecological
uncertainties associated with threatened flora and fauna at the Project site. The BAP also provides a framework for the potential development of a
biodiversity offset strategy to compensate for residual impacts of the Project and allow B2Gold to maintain (i.e. no net loss) or increase Project
area biodiversity.
20.6.8
Stakeholder Engagement Plan
Experience has demonstrated that projects that establish early and ongoing stakeholder engagement processes that continue throughout the life
of the project have a greater rate of success, as well as reduced business risk. B2Gold has prepared a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) that
describes how it will collect and disseminate information to people who are affected by and/or interested in the Project. The SEP establishes the
basis for how B2Gold will conduct its business with the community to ensure transparency in Project activities as they may affect
FEKOLA GOLD PROJECT
NI 43-101 - REQUIRED PERMITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
Page 20.26
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
July 2015
stakeholders.  The  SEP  describes  specific  measures  to  identify  Project  stakeholders,  ensure  timely  and  effective  communication  between  the
Project site and affected stakeholders throughout the life of the project, document meaningful Project consultation and disclosure, establish a
formal grievance process, and monitor and report upon the performance of stakeholder engagement processes.
20.6.9
Community Development Plan
B2Gold recognizes that a community development program is essential in ensuring that local communities do not become dependent on the
mining  economy,  but  rather  have  an  enhanced,  sustainable  economy  following  mine  closure.  B2Gold  will  invest  in  improving  infrastructure,
education, health care, and other economic programs to promote sustainability. The Community Development Plan (CDP) presents the framework
to promote sustainable community development opportunities in the Project area. The CDP also describes measures for collecting stakeholder
input through public consultation and for planning, development, implementation, and monitoring of the community development programs.
20.7
Mine Rehabilitation and Closure
B2Gold’s overall objective for mine closure is to prevent or minimise adverse long-term environmental, physical, social and economic impacts for
the greater Project area and to create stable landforms that provide self-sustaining natural ecosystems within the Project Development Area. A
Rehabilitation and Preliminary Mine Closure Plan (RMCP) has been developed as the first step in providing a clear methodology for progressive
rehabilitation  and  planning  for  decommissioning  and  closure  the  Project.  The  aim  of  the  RMCP  is  to  provide  a  rehabilitation  and  closure
framework that will be refined throughout the life of the Project to ultimately achieve mine closure.
Management and mitigation measures specified in the Fekola Gold Project ESIA, Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan
(ESMMP),  and  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  (BAP)  will  be  implemented  to  avoid  or  minimise  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts.  However,
potential residual impacts at the completion of mining and processing operations will require evaluation and subsequent actions with regard to:
safety and hazards risks, potential sources of ongoing pollution, future land use and resource demands, ecological compatibility, community
expectations, aesthetics, and cost.
Ongoing refinement of the RMCP will require community consultation regarding intended end post-mining land use for the Project Development
Area and development of the methodology for clearly defining success or failure of rehabilitation (completion criteria). In subsequent versions of
the RMCP, B2Gold will develop a consistent approach to performance monitoring and identify maintenance and/or remedial measures required for
rehabilitation that promote the achievement of completion criteria to avoid or minimise residual impacts to the satisfaction of Project stakeholders.
A preliminary closure cost estimate has been developed. Costs were provided by B2Gold and its consultants including Lycopodium and Knight
Piésold. Where costs were not provided, supplemental costs were utilitized from other sources including similar mining projects. Closure costs
were estimated at full mine build-out. Concurrent rehabilitation will be conducted during the life of the mine to the extent practical to minimize
impacts and lower the environmental liability at

closure, however, the bulk of the rehabilitation and closure costs are not expected to be incurred until the cease of operations. If the mine were to
close prior to the expected end of mine life the bulk of the closure costs would be incurred at this time. The estimated rehabilitation and closure
costs for the Project are approximately US$ 20.4M over the life of the mine. These are summarized in Table 20.7.1 below.

been included in the deferred capital cost schedule in Section 21.3.
21.2.4
Estimating Methodology
General arrangement drawings and a layout 3D model have been produced with sufficient detail to permit the assessment of the engineering
quantities  for  earthworks,  concrete,  steelwork,  mechanical  and  electrical  for  the  crushing  plant,  processing  plant,  conveying  systems  and
infrastructure.
The  layouts  and  model  have  been  based  on  recently  completed  facility  designs,  modified  construction  and  as-built  drawings  of  past  project
facilities, as well as initial concept drawings and computer modelling.
Unit  rates  that  reflect  the  current  market  conditions  have  been  established  for  bulk  materials,  capital  equipment  and  labour  via  an  extensive
Budget Quotation Request (BQR) process. Labour rates from the market have been benchmarked against in-house labour gang rates and indirect
cost modelling to ensure adherence suitability to the current projects market. The rates used in the estimate have been reviewed and deemed to
reflect  the  current  market  conditions.  Budget  pricing  for  equipment  and  infrastructure  facilities  was  obtained  from  suitable  suppliers  and
contractors.
21.2.5
Quantity Development
The Project works were quantified to represent the defined scope of work and to enable the application of rates to determine costs. Allowances for
earthworks compaction, waste, rolling margin and the like are included in the build-up of unit costs.
Quantity information was derived from a combination of sources and categorised to reflect the maturity of design information as follows:
•
•
Study Engineering: Includes quantities derived from concept or preliminary engineering for the purpose of the study. Includes equipment lists and
redline mark-ups of previous project drawings / data by engineering.
Estimated: Includes quantities derived from sketches or redline mark-ups of previous project drawings / data by estimating or similar project go-bys.
Factored: Quantities derived from percentages applied as a factor derived from previous projects.

Pricing has been categorised by the following cost elements, as applicable, for the development of each estimate item.
Bulk Materials
This component covers all other materials, normally purchased in bulk form, for installation on the project. Costs include the purchase price ex-
works, any off-site fabrication, and transport to site (unless otherwise stated), and over-supply for anticipated wastage.
Plant Equipment
This component represents prefabricated, pre-assembled, off-the-shelf types of mechanical or electrical equipment item. Pricing is inclusive of all
costs  necessary  to  purchase  the  goods  ex-works;  generally  excluding  delivery  to  site  (unless  otherwise  stated)  but  including  operating  and
maintenance manuals. Vendor representation and commissioning spares have been allowed for separately in the estimate.
Installation
This component represents the cost to install the plant equipment and bulk materials on site or to perform site activities. Installation costs are
further divided between direct labour, equipment and construction indirect costs.
The labour component reflects the cost of the direct workforce required to construct the Project scope. The labour cost is the product of the
estimated work hours spent on site multiplied by the cost of labour, inclusive of overtime premiums, statutory overheads, and payroll burden.
The equipment component reflects the cost of the construction equipment and running costs required to construct the Project. The equipment
cost also includes cranes, vehicles, small tools, consumables, and PPE.
Construction  indirect  costs  encompass  the  remaining  cost  of  installation  and  include  items  such  as  offsite  management,  onsite  staff  and
supervision  above  trade  level,  crane  drivers,  equipment  and  labour  mobilisation  and  demobilisation,  Rest  and  Recreation  (R&R),  meals  and
accommodation costs.

PPE, travel and clothing. Earthworks rates are inclusive of fuel, maintenance and running costs of machinery.
Construction equipment and project cranes are included in the capital cost estimate.
21.2.8
Engineering Services
The estimate for engineering design services is based on an assessment of the work content using the drawing and equipment lists prepared for
the study as a guide. Design manhours will be estimated on a deliverable basis and benchmarked against previous Lycopodium experience for
similar sized projects. Duration based costs such as project management, construction and commissioning support will be estimated using the
project implementation schedule and previous project experience as a guide.
21.2.9
Owner’s Costs
B2Gold undertake plant construction on a self perform basis. The Owners project management, construction team and construction equipment is
included as part of the construction indirect costs calculated for the project.
The Owner’s construction team will interact closely with operations management personnel recruited during the construction phase of the Project.
In addition to the above, the following allowances have been made in the estimate:
•
•
•
Pre-production costs.
First fills (grinding media, lubricants, fuel, and reagents).

Contingency
July 2015
Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 21.13
An amount of contingency has been provided in the estimate to cover anticipated variances between the specific items allowed in the estimate
and the final total installed project cost. The contingency does not cover scope changes, design growth, etc., or the listed qualifications and
exclusions.
Contingency has been applied to the estimate on a line-by-line basis as a deterministic allowance by assessing the level of confidence in each of
the  defining  inputs  to  the  item  cost,  these  being  engineering,  estimate  basis  and  vendor  or  contractor  information,  and  then  applying  an
appropriate weighting to each of the three inputs. It should be noted that contingency is not a function of the specified estimate accuracy and
should be measured against the project total that includes contingency. The resultant contingency for the project is 13%.
A summary of contingency percentage for the major horizontal packages is provided in Table 21.2.8.

Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd
Page 21.16
The Project implementation plan has been developed utilising B2Gold’s preferred self construct approach. Engineering consultants will provide
design and procurement assistance services with B2Gold self performing construction according to the Project Schedule.
The mine planning study is based on an owner operator strategy, whereby B2Gold will purchase and operate the mine fleet and drill and blast
services. B2Gold’s mining group will also undertake all bulk earthwork activities for the Project.
The current mine plan anticipates mining commencing three months before first ore to the mill, with a total mine life of nine and a half years and
with the mill operating on material recovered from stockpiles for a further three years after completion of mining.
The implementation strategy is structured into four broad stages:
•
•
•
•
Detailed design of the process plant and infrastructure.
Procurement.
Construction.
Commissioning and handover.
The estimated durations of key project activities are provided in Table 21.4.1.
The durations shown are preliminary and are based on receipt of the relevant authorisations to proceed.

Introduction
An economic analysis of the Project assesses the economic viability and performance of the Project under the assumptions and results of the
OFS.  The  analysis  was  based  on  mine  plans  and  production  schedules  as  presented  in  Sections  15  and  16  (Mineral  Reserves  and  Mining
Methods) of this report, recoveries as presented in Sections 13 (Processing and Metallurgy) and 17 (Recovery Methods), and capital and operating
costs as presented in Section 21 (Capital and Operating Costs). This analysis is project based and therefore assumes 100% ownership on a pre-
tax basis. All site related costs, plus royalties, are included in the total cash costs as presented. For details on state interest refer to Section 4.
The above information was compiled into the Project financial model. The costs portion of the model includes all mining, processing, general and
administration, and distributable (power and laboratory) costs with input from the mining and processing production schedules plus appropriate
labour, consumable, operating, maintenance, and other costs. Revenue is also based on the production schedules plus the process recovery,
gold price, selling costs, and royalty input. The results of the financial model include the cash flow, income, and cash cost tables, as well as
various measures of project value including discounted cash flow and internal rate of return.
A sensitivity analysis was performed using gold price, processing cost, mining cost, fuel cost, capital cost, and labour cost as the variables. The
sensitivity assumed variations of up to 20% for all variables. A summary of the results is included in this section.

Summary
The Project financial model was compiled using the inputs from this OFS as presented in prior sections. Key assumptions were the mining and
processing  production,  project  capital  costs,  and  mining,  processing,  and  general  costs.  The  financial  model  is  pre-tax  and  assumes  100%
ownership.
Project gold production averages 276,000 ounces per year over the life of the project with an average of 350,000 ounces per year over the first
seven  years.  The  capital  costs  include  US$  395M  in  pre-production  capital,  plus  US$  180M  in  sustaining  capital  including  finance  payments,
tailings facility expansions, and rehabilitation and closure costs. Mining costs average US$ 2.99/t over the life of the mine. Production cost is US$
18.29/oz in design conditions, and averages US$ 18.30 during the steady state production in years 2018 through 2029. General and administration
costs are US$ 14.9M per year during the full mining years, decreasing to US$ 11.1M when the mining department is no longer operational.
The results of the model show robust results including a life of mine cash flow of US$ 1.66B, IRR of 35%, and an NPV of US$ 1.01B at 5%. The total
cash cost including 7.65% royalties is US$ 652/oz over the life of the mine and US$ 518 over the first seven years of production (2018 to 2024).

The project has low sensitivity to capital, fuel, processing, mining, and labour costs. The project is typically sensitive to gold prices, but maintains
an IRR of 33% at a US$ 1,250/oz gold price and 19% at a US$ 1,000/oz gold price.

Principal Assumptions
22.3.1
Input Parameters and Project Schedule
The basic financial and economic assumptions are shown in Table 22.3.1 below. Based on the project implementation plan it is assumed that the
procurement and construction phase will start in Q3 2015 and be completed in late Q4 2017. This construction period of 29 months is a reasonable
assumption considering the logistics and infrastructure available.

Doré bars will be transported from the Project site to the yet to be determined refiner by a combination of highly secured transport vehicles and/or
aircraft. The costs associated with transporting, insuring, and refining doré are listing in Table 22.3.2 below, along with the royalties of 7.65%.
These costs are typical of the industry and are based on B2Gold’s experience in its current projects.

22.3.2
Mineral Reserves and Mining
The life of mine (LoM) and annual production schedules are from the mineral reserves and base case mining schedule established in this report in
Sections 15 and 16. This schedule mines 49.2 Mt of ore over a period of 9.5 years, including pre-stripping. Annual mined tonnage reaches a
maximum of 32 Mt/y, totalling 219.3 million waste tonnes and 268.5 million total mined tonnes.
Due to the accelerated mining rate the medium and low grade ore is stockpiled when it is not needed for immediate crusher feed. This results in an
average processed grade of 3.1 g/t over the first seven years of processing and an average LoM grade of 2.35 g/t.
Mining  costs  are  based  on  the  expected  productivity,  operating  costs,  and  labour  rates  for  an  open  pit  gold  mine  in  Mali.  Productivity  and
operating costs are based on data from the equipment manufacturers with appropriate factors applied for local conditions and experience. Labour
rates  are  fully  loaded  and  are  based  on  a  survey  of  local  mines  including  all  relevant  overtime,  holiday,  and  other  costs.  Mine  department
management, technical services, and other general costs are included. See Section 21 for details of the operating mining costs.
22.3.3
Production Schedule and Costs
The operating costs as presented in Section 21 are based on the design throughput, grade, and ore / waste characteristics. These vary slightly
over time and result in varying costs and gold production throughout the mine life. The overall production schedule is shown in Table 22.3.3
below and the resulting production costs (total and per ounce) are shown in the results of the financial model (Section 22.4).
Mining costs vary from a low of approximately US$ 2.40 / mined tonne when the pit is shallow and waste dumps are low to a high of approximately
US$ 3.50 / mined tonne when the pit is fully developed and waste dumps are near the maximum heights. Mining costs are also dependent on
diesel costs. A price of US$ 0.92/l was assumed based on recent costs. The sensitivity analysis (see Section 22.5) indicates that overall project
sensitivity to fuel and mining costs is low and thus is not a project risk.
Mine production is similar to the optimized schedule reported in Section 16 and assumes that pre-stripping activities start late in the third quarter
of 2017. The mining rate will ramp up to the full 32 Mtpa pace by the first quarter of 2018. The reserves will be mined out in 9.5 years, after which
medium and low grade stockpiles will be rehandled to the processing plant.
Processing costs vary much less than mining costs, only due to varying distributed costs (power and laboratory). Under design conditions the
average processing cost is US$ 18.29/rock tonne as described in Section 21. Note that processing costs are dependent on power costs (see
below) which account for over 50% of the processing costs and over 25% of the total site costs (US$ 10.15 of US$ 38.58). As with mining costs, the
sensitivity analysis (Section 22.5) indicates that overall project sensitivity to fuel and processing costs is low and thus is not a project risk.
Processing production assumes commissioning in Q4 2017 with December as the first production month. Process availability ramps up starting at
50% for December 2017, increasing to 70% for January 2018, 85% for February 2018, and 94% for the rest of the life of mine. Recovery ramps up

with a reduction of 3% for December 2017, 2% for January 2018, 1% for February 2018, and to the design recovery equation as presented in
Section 13 (including the 1% scaling factor) for the rest of the life of mine.
The production schedule including mining and processing is shown in Table 22.3.3.
Site General costs include non-production related departments such as administration, accounting, human resources, environmental, security,
safety, transportation, housing, etc. Also included are parasitic power plant losses, international flights for expatriates, busses for local labour,
and other general costs. The costs decrease from US$ 14.9M during the full production years to US$ 11.1M when the mining department closes.
Power generation costs are closely tied to the cost of heavy fuel oil (HFO). For this study a conservative price of US$ 0.825/l for HFO 380 was
assumed. Note that current prices at B2Gold’s other mines are in the range of US$ 0.55 to US$ 0.70/l, depending on transportation costs, local
price controls, and HFO specification. The resulting power cost is US$ 0.20/kWh including all consumables, operating, and maintenance costs.

The  processing,  mining,  fuel,  capital,  and  labour  costs  as  well  as  the  gold  price  were  varied  by  20%  (positive  and  negative)  to  determine  the
sensitivity of the project. See Figure 22.5.1 below. The project is least sensitive to labour and capital costs, with increases in costs of 20% resulting
in decreases in project cash flow being reduced by approximately 5%. Sensitivity to increases in fuel, mining, and processing costs is somewhat
higher with 20% changes resulting in decreased cash flow of up to 11%. None of these would be considered sensitive.

Other Relevant Data
The cyanide destruction testwork report received late in the study phase recommended the cyanide destruction circuit design include two reactor
tanks operating in parallel. Plant capital and operating costs have been updated to reflect the change to two tanks, however the study design
deliverables  (flowsheets,  equipment  lists  and  layout  drawings)  only  represent  a  single  reactor  design.  The  cyanide  destruction  circuit  will  be
updated to correctly reflect testwork recommendations as part of the project detailed design.

Risks and Opportunities
24.2.1
Identified Opportunities
A mill vendor has advised of availability of an unused SAG mill that is larger (36 x 20 ft) than the mill size recommended at part of the original study
comminution modelling (32 x 16 ft). Additional comminution modelling completed with the larger SAG mill in circuit has concluded this option to
be favourable, due to the following opportunities:
•
•
•
•
Minimal increase in capital cost (estimate at US$ 2.8M).
Decrease in mill media consumption and therefore plant operating consumable costs (estimated at US$ 1.5M/year). Due to operation with a lower ball
charge.
Minimal increase in power consumption in the overall grinding circuit (estimate as 0.1 kWh/t milled).
Provides installed capacity within the grinding circuit to allow plant throughput expansion in the future.

The OFS has identified, defined and costed a low technical risk conventional open cut mine and carbon in pulp processing facility.
Commercial  gold  mining  has  been  established  in  West  Africa  for  over  100  years,  and  Mali  and  surrounding  countries  have  varying  levels  of
established mining infrastructure.
Sovereign risk is understood and mitigated by the relatively short payback of the Project. Residual environmental and social issues are low and
manageable.
The  Project  is  economically  viable  at  current  gold  prices.  Applying  a  long  term  gold  price  of  US$  1,300/oz  on  a  flat  line  basis  from  the
commencement of production, the project has an estimate Net Present Value (NPV) pre-tax of US$1.01B at a 5% discount rate, generating a pre-
tax  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  of  35%  and  a  project  payback  of  approximately  2.25  years  from  first  gold  production.  The  initial  mine  life  is
estimated at 12.5 years.
The February 2015 Mineral Resource estimate forms the basis for the OFS and incorporates drilling results available at January 24, 2015. Probable
mineral reserves of 49.17 Mt at an average grade of 2.35 g/t Au containing 3.72 Moz of gold have been established.
The OFS estimates annual gold production averaged over the first seven years to be 350,000 oz of gold per year at an average operating cash
cost of US$ 418/oz. The averaged LOM estimate for annual gold production is 276,000 oz of gold per year at an average operating cash cost of
US$ 552/oz. Total pre-production capital costs are estimated at US$ 395M plus an additional US$ 67M for fleet and generator costs which are
expected to be leased financed.
The processing flowsheet has been selected based on metallurgical test work results and consists of single stage primary crushing, a SABC
grinding circuit (SAG and Ball mill with recycle pebble crushing), leach feed thickening with thickener overflow treated through a carbon in column
(CIC) circuit, leaching followed by carbon in pulp (CIP) adsorption, elution and gold recovery to doré, cyanide destruction, tailings thickening and
disposal circuits.
The  plant  facility  and  support  infrastructure  is  designed  to  process  4  Mtpa  of  ore,  and  incorporates  a  25%  design  margin  to  allow  for  future
increases in circuit operation with minimum additional capital expenditure. Selected mill sizing also incorporates additional grinding capacity and
can support plant throughput expansion beyond 5 Mtpa should exploration potential and future economic evaluation return a positive case for
further expansion.
A project sensitivity analysis was performed on gold price, fuel price, labour costs, processing costs and mining costs. The Project shows low
sensitivities to all inputs except for the gold price. Note that even with a low gold price of US$ 1,000/oz the Project maintains a pre-tax IRR of 19%.

Based  on  the  Project’s  robust  economics,  B2Gold  have  already  demonstrated  a  desire  to  move  forward  with  project  execution  through  the
approval and commencement of project early works. The scope currently underway includes:
Site construction early works, encompassing:
•
•
•
•
construction of the new mine access from the existing Millennium Highway to site. Road construction is well underway with completion expected
prior to the 2015 wet season to enable continued all weather access to site
construction of the airstrip
clearing and grubbing of areas for plant and camp facilities
mobilisation of construction offices/facilities and equipment.
Front End Engineering Design, including:
•
•
identification and tendering of key long lead equipment packages, such that orders can be placed upon final project execution approval. Key
packages include; mills, crushers, thickeners, tanks, power station and the accommodation camp
development  of  project  piping  and  instrumentation  drawings  (P&IDs)  and  establishment  of  engineering  design  basis  and  specification
documents.

Recommendations
Based on the conclusions of Section 25, it is recommended that B2Gold Corporation advance implementation of the Project as soon as possible.
The proposed project implementation approach of engineering consultants providing design services and B2Gold self performing construction
has proven successful with previous B2Gold projects.
Site development will take place year round, utilising a work force of experienced Malian nationals, trained and supervised by African national and
expatriate supervisors. Many of the African national and expatriate supervisors have worked on previous successful projects associated with
B2Gold in Africa and will be familiar with the B2Gold construction approach as well as African working conditions.
Based on this implementation strategy and an end of June 2015 project approval, first gold pour can be achieved in December 2017. Key project
milestones are summarised in Table 26.1.1, below.

Sufficient metallurgical testing and trade-off studies have been completed to confidently establish the recovery process and set the design
criteria. Capital and operating costs have been estimated to a level of accuracy consistent with the OFS level and no significant environmental,
social or permitting issues exist, that are known of, that would prevent exploitation of the Project deposits other than as discussed within this
Report.
