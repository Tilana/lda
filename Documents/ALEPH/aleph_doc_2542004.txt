Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Subscription Agreement,

                                                                                              , or registered assigns (the “Holder”), under the terms as
hereinafter set forth, from and after the issue date hereof (“Initial Issue Date”)                                      (                                  )
fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Warrant Stock”), at a
purchase price of $0.45 per share (the “Warrant Price”), pursuant to this warrant (this “Warrant”).  The number of shares of
Warrant Stock to be so issued and the Warrant Price are subject to adjustment in certain events as hereinafter set forth.  The
term “Common Stock” shall mean, when used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the stock and property at the time
receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant.
This Warrant has been issued pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement between the Company and the Holder dated
the same date as this Warrant (the “Subscription Agreement”).  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Subscription Agreement.
1.                                      Exercise of Warrant.
a.                                      Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time
or times on or after the Initial Issue Date and on or before the Expiration Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or
agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing
on the books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto. Within two
(2) “Trading Days” (a day on which the OTCQB or stock exchange on which the Company’s stock is listed is open for business)
following the date of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Warrant Price for the shares specified in the
applicable Notice of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank unless the cashless exercise
procedure specified in Section 1(b) below is specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary (although the Holder may surrender the Warrant to, and receive a replacement Warrant from, the Company), the Holder
shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Stock
available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the
Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company.
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total amount of Warrant Stock available hereunder
shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding amount of Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the
applicable amount of Warrant Stock purchased.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the amount of
Warrant Stock purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise
Form within one (1) Trading Day of delivery of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant,
acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the
Warrant Stock hereunder, the amount of Warrant Stock available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less
than the amount stated on the face hereof.
Cashless Exercise.  This Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time the Warrant Stock is not registered for
resale pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act, by means of a “cashless exercise” (in lieu of
making a payment upon such exercise) in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of shares of
Warrant Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:
(A) = the closing price of the Warrant Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which Holder elects to
exercise this Warrant by means of a “cashless exercise,” as set forth in the applicable Notice of Exercise;
(B) = the Warrant Price, as adjusted hereunder; and
(X) = the number of shares of Warrant Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms
of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.
2
b.                                      If exercised in part, the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than five (5) Trading
Days after receipt of this Warrant (and the purchase price if applicable) and at its own expense, deliver to the Holder a new
Warrant, identical in form, in the name of the Holder, evidencing the right to purchase the number of shares of Warrant Stock as
to which this Warrant has not been exercised.
c.                                       No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issuable upon any exercise of this Warrant and the Holder
will not be entitled to any cash payment or compensation in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock.
d.                                      Reserved.
e.                                       Mechanics of Exercise.
(i)                                     Delivery of Certificates Upon Exercise.  Not later than five (5) Trading Days after the latest of (A) the
delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (B) surrender of this Warrant (if required) and (C) payment of the aggregate
Purchase Price as set forth above (including by cashless exercise, if permitted) (such date, the “Warrant Stock Delivery Date”),
the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the exercising Holder a certificate or certificates (bearing the restrictive
legend set forth below) representing the number of shares of Warrant Stock being acquired upon the exercise of such Warrant;
provided however, if the Company is then a participant in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission (“DWAC”) system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the
Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares have been resold by the Holder
without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, then Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be
transmitted by the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s prime
broker with DTC through its DWAC system.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such shares as
promptly as practicable but in any event prior to the Warrant Stock Delivery Date.  The Warrant Stock shall be deemed to have
been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of
record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the Company of the
aggregate Purchase Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, prior to
the issuance of such shares, having been paid.  The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the Warrant Stock
after the Warrant Stock Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. As compensation to the Holder for such loss,
the Company agrees to pay (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) to the Holder for late issuance of Warrant Stock upon
exercise of this Warrant the proportionate amount of $100 per “Business Day” (any day except any Saturday, any Sunday, any
day which shall be a federal legal holiday in the United States or any day on which banking institutions in the City of New York
are authorized or required by law or
3
other governmental action to close) (increasing to $200 per Business Day after the tenth Trading Day) commencing after the
second Trading Day following the Warrant Stock Delivery Date for each $10,000 of Exercise Price of Warrant Stock for which
this Warrant is exercised which are not timely delivered.  The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section in
immediately available funds upon demand.  Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Holder,
in the event that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Warrant Stock by the Warrant Stock Delivery Date,
the Holder may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by delivery of a notice to such effect to the Company,
whereupon the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to the exercise of
the relevant portion of this Warrant, except that the liquidated damages described above shall be payable through the date notice
of revocation or rescission is given to the Company.
(ii)                                  Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise.  If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company
shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or
certificates representing Warrant Stock, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the
unpurchased Warrant Stock called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this
Warrant.
(iii)                               Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise.  In addition to any other
rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the
certificates representing the Warrant Stock pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Stock Delivery Date, and if after
such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage
firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Stock which
the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the
amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Warrant Stock that the
Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order
giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the
Warrant and equivalent number of shares of Warrant Stock for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such
exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been
issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder.  For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of
shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the
immediately preceding sentence the
4
Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts
payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.  Nothing
herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver
certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof;
provided however that the Holder shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the same damages and that the Company
shall not be liable for any consequential, or punitive damages.
(iv)                              Closing of Books.  The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents
the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
f.                                        Holder’s Exercise Limitations.  The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder
shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after
exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other
Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any
other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on
conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. 
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 1(g), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged
by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith.   To the extent
that the limitation contained in this Section 1(g) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to
other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in
the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of
whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which
portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have
no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.   In addition, a determination as to any group status as
contemplated above
5
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.  For purposes of this Section 1(g), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual
report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more
recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder
the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the
Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.  The
“Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.  The Holder, upon not less
than 61 days’ prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this
Section 1(g), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 1(g) shall continue to apply.  Any such increase or decrease will
not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be
construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 1(g) to correct this
paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein
contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations
contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation shall not apply if the Holder beneficially owns, as of the Initial Issue Date, in excess of 9.99% of the
number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant held by such Holder.
2.                                      Disposition of Warrant Stock and Warrant.
a.                                      The Holder hereby acknowledges that this Warrant and any Warrant Stock purchased pursuant hereto are,
as of the date hereof, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) or under any
applicable state securities law; and that the Company’s reliance on certain exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws is predicated in part on the representations made by the Holder in Article IV of the Subscription
Agreement.
b.                                      Any certificate representing Common Stock issued upon the exercise of this Warrant will bear a legend
substantially similar to the following:
6
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.  SUCH
SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD,
DELIVERED AFTER SALE, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED BY THE ISSUER WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
COVERING SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. AN OPINION
OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE ISSUER OR THE TRANSFER AGENT.
In addition, so long as the foregoing legend may remain on any stock certificate delivered to the Holder, the Company may
maintain appropriate “stop transfer” orders with respect to such certificates and the shares represented thereby on its books and
records and with those to whom it may delegate registrar and transfer functions.
3.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company hereby agrees that at all times there shall be reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of this Warrant such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall be required for issuance upon exercise
of this Warrant.  The Company further agrees that all shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by
this Warrant will be duly authorized and will, upon issuance and against payment of the exercise price, be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, free from all taxes, liens, charges and preemptive rights with respect to the issuance thereof, other
than taxes, if any, in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issuance and other than transfer restrictions
imposed by federal, state or other applicable securities laws.
4.                                      Exchange, Transfer or Assignment of Warrant.  Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws,
this Warrant is exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the
Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, for other Warrants of different denominations, entitling the Holder or
Holders thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder.  Upon
surrender of this Warrant to the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Assignment Form annexed
hereto duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any transfer tax, the Company shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new
Warrant in the name of the assignee named in such instrument of assignment and this Warrant shall promptly be canceled.
5.                                      Capital Adjustments.  This Warrant is subject to the following further provisions:
a.                                      Subdivision or Combination of Shares.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding
and unexpired shall subdivide or combine its Common Stock, the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise
of this Warrant and the Warrant Price shall be proportionately adjusted.  Any adjustment under this Section 5(a) shall become
effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective or, if earlier, the record date with
respect to the subdivision or combination.
7
b.                                      Stock Dividends and Distributions.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and
unexpired shall issue or pay the holders of its Common Stock, or take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the
purpose of entitling them to receive, a dividend payable in, or other distribution of, Common Stock, then (i) the Warrant Price
shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 5(e) and (ii) the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of
this Warrant shall be adjusted to the number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder would have owned immediately
following such action had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto.
c.                                       Stock and Rights Offering to Stockholders.  If the Company shall at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding distribute to all holders of its Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common
Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions) or rights or warrants to subscribe
for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph), or securities
convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (any of the foregoing, the “Securities”), then in each such case, the Company
shall without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation reserve shares or other units of such Securities for distribution to the
Holder upon exercise of this Warrant so that, in addition to the shares of the Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled,
such Holder will receive upon such exercise the amount and kind of such Securities which such Holder would have received if
the Holder had, immediately prior to the record date for the distribution of the Securities, exercised this Warrant.
d.                                      Organic Change.  Any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or
substantially all of the Company’s assets to another person or entity or other transaction that is effected in such a way that
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with
respect to or in exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as an “Organic Change.”
(i)                                     In connection with any (x) bona fide sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an acquiring
person or entity or (y) other Organic Change involving an arm’s length third party or parties following which the Company is not
the surviving entity and as a result of which the then current stockholders of the Company will not, directly or indirectly own 50%
or more of the surviving entity, the Company shall elect in its sole discretion: (A) to require that the Holder exercise this Warrant
prior to the consummation of such Organic Change, and if not so exercised, that this Warrant shall terminate upon
consummation of such Organic Change, or (B) to secure from the person or entity purchasing such assets or the successor
resulting from such Organic Change (in each case, the “Acquiring Entity”) a written agreement (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder) to deliver to the Holder, in exchange for this Warrant, a warrant of the Acquiring Entity (the
“Replacement Warrant”) evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant and
reasonably satisfactory to the Holder reflecting the adjustments required so as to preserve the value of the Warrant applicable at
the Closing of the transaction, by the terms of the Replacement Warrant.  The Replacement Warrant shall be
8
exercisable for such number of shares of common stock or other securities of the Acquiring Entity as the Holder would have had
the right to receive upon such Organic Change by a holder of the number of shares of Warrant Stock that such Holder would
have been entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the effective
date of such Organic Change without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation.  The Company shall give the Holder written
notice of such Organic Change at least twenty (20) days prior to the closing and consummation of such Organic Change (and
shall give notice of record date pursuant to section 6(a)).
(ii)                                  Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change unless not required as contemplated in subsection
(i) above, the Company shall make appropriate provision (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder) to ensure
that the Holder will thereafter have the right to acquire and receive in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the shares of
Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant, such shares of stock,
securities or assets that would have been issued or payable in such Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant as of the
date of such Organic Change without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
e.                                       Warrant Price Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever the number of shares of
Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the Warrant Price payable upon the
exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted to that price determined by multiplying the Warrant Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of
this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Warrant
Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately thereafter.
f.                                        Par Value.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5, if, as a result of an
adjustment pursuant to Section 5, the par value per share of Common Stock would be greater than the Warrant Price, then the
Warrant Price shall be an amount equal to the par value per share of the Common Stock but the number of shares the holder of
this Warrant shall be entitled to purchase shall be such greater number of shares of Common Stock as would have resulted from
the Warrant Price that, absent such limitation, would have been in effect pursuant to this Section 5.
g.                                       Certain Shares Excluded. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time for
purposes of the adjustments set forth in this Section 5 shall exclude any shares then directly or indirectly held in the treasury of
the Company.
h.                                      Deferral and Cumulation of De Minimis Adjustments.  The Company shall not be required to make any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 5 if the amount of such adjustment would be less than one percent (1%) of the Warrant
Price in effect immediately before the event that would otherwise have given rise to such adjustment.  In
9
such case, however, any adjustment that would otherwise have been required to be made shall be made at the time of and
together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall
amount to not less than one percent (1%) of the Warrant Price in effect immediately before the event giving rise to such next
subsequent adjustment.
i.                                          Duration of Adjustment.  Following each computation or readjustment as provided in this Section 5, the
new adjusted Warrant Price and number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall remain in
effect until a further computation or readjustment thereof is required.
6.                                      Notice to Holders.
a.                                      Notice of Record Date.  In case:
(i)            the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the time receivable
upon the exercise of this Warrant) for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, or any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any
other right;
(ii)                                  of any Organic Change; or
(iii)                               of any voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the Holder hereof at the time outstanding a notice
specifying, as the case may be, (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the date on which such Organic Change,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any, is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of
Common Stock (or such stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution or winding-up.  Such notice shall be mailed at
least ten (10) days prior to the record date therein specified, or if no record date shall have been specified therein, at least ten

10.                               Choice of Law.  This Warrant and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the
State of New York.
11.                               Jurisdiction and Venue.  Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Warrant brought by the other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any New
York State or federal court sitting in The City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate
New York State or federal court), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Warrant and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each of the parties agrees not to commence
any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in New York, other than actions in any court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in New York as described
herein.  Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.  Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts in New York as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,

Warrants may be amended and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to

14.                               Non-waiver and Expenses.  No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the
part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder’s rights, powers or remedies.  Without
limiting any other provision of this Warrant or the Subscription Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply
with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages
12
to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in
collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.
15.                               Limitation of Liability.  No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise
this Warrant to purchase Warrant Stock, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any
liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is
asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.
16.                               Remedies.  The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of
damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant.  The Company agrees that monetary damages
would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and
hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.
17.                               Successors and Assigns.  Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations
evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and
the successors and permitted assigns of Holder.  The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder
from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Stock.
18.                               Severability.  Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law,
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.
19.                               Warrant Register. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company
for that purpose (the “Warrant Register”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time.  The Company may deem
and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION
Pershing Gold Corporation
1658 Cole Boulevard
Building 6, Suite 200
Lakewood, Colorado 80401
Attn:  Stephen Alfers, President & CEO
Ladies and Gentlemen:
1.  Subscription.  The undersigned (the “Purchaser”) will purchase the number of units (collectively, the “Units”) of securities of
Pershing Gold Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), set forth on the signature page to this Subscription
Agreement, at a purchase price of $0.34 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of (a) one (1) share (a “Unit Share”) of the
Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and (b) one (1) thirty month warrant (collectively,
the “Warrants” and together with the Units, the Unit Shares and the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the
“Warrant Shares”), the “Securities”) to purchase 0.40 of a share of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price equal to
$0.45 per share, subject to adjustment thereunder (the “Exercise Price”).  The Units are being offered (the “Offering”) by the
Company pursuant to the offering terms set forth in the Company’s Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated May 16,
2014, as may be amended and/or supplemented, from time to time (collectively, the “Memorandum”).
The Units are being offered on a “reasonable efforts, all or none” basis with respect to the minimum of $3,000,000 purchase price
for the Units (the “Minimum Offering”) and thereafter on a “reasonable efforts” basis up to the maximum of $15,000,000 purchase
price for the Units (the “Maximum Offering”). The Units will be offered for sale until the earlier of (i) the date upon which
subscriptions for the Maximum Offering offered hereunder have been accepted, (ii) June 16, 2014 (subject to the right of the
Company and the Placement Agent to extend the offering until July 14, 2014 without further notice to investors) or (iii) the date
upon which the Company and the Placement Agent elect to terminate the Offering (the “Termination Date”).
The Company may hold an initial closing (“Initial Closing”) at any time after the receipt of accepted subscriptions for the
Minimum Offering.  After the Initial Closing, subsequent closings with respect to additional Securities may take place at any time
prior to the Termination Date as determined by the Company, with respect to subscriptions accepted prior to the Termination
Date (each such closing, together with the Initial Closing, being referred to as a “Closing”).  The last Closing of the Offering,
occurring on or prior to the Termination Date, shall be referred to as the “Final Closing”.  Any subscription documents or funds
received after the Final Closing will be returned, without interest or deduction.  In the event that any Closing does not occur prior
to the
Termination Date, all amounts paid by the Purchaser shall be returned to the Purchaser, without interest or deduction.
Subscriptions for investment below the minimum investment may be accepted at the discretion of the Placement Agent and the
Company.  The Company reserves the right (but is not obligated) to have its employees, agents, officers, directors and affiliates
purchase Units in the Offering and all such purchases will be counted towards the Minimum Offering and the Maximum Offering.
The terms of the Offering are more completely described in the Memorandum and such terms are incorporated herein in their
entirety.  Certain capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, will have the respective meanings provided in the
Memorandum.
2.                                      Payment.  The Purchaser encloses herewith a check payable to, or will immediately make a wire transfer
payment to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the wire instructions as provided herein in the full amount of the purchase price of the
Units being subscribed for.  Together with the check for, or wire transfer of, the full purchase price, the Purchaser is delivering a
completed and executed Signature Page to this Subscription Agreement along with a completed and executed Accredited
Investor Certification, which are annexed hereto.  By executing this Subscription Agreement, you will be deemed to have
executed the Unit Purchase Agreement (Exhibit D to the Memorandum) and the Registration Rights Agreement (Exhibit
C to the Memorandum), and agreed to the terms of the Warrant (Exhibit B to the Memorandum) and all exhibits,
supplements and schedules thereto, as such may be amended from time to time (collectively the “Transaction
Documents”), each of which are attached to the Memorandum, and will be treated for all purposes as if you did review,
approve and execute, if required, each such Transaction Document even though you may not have physically signed the
signature pages to such documents.
3.                                      Deposit of Funds.  All payments made as provided in Section 2 hereof will be deposited by the Purchaser
as soon as practicable with the Escrow Agent in a non-interest bearing escrow account (the “Escrow Account”).  In the event
that the Company does not effect a Closing during the Offering Period, the Escrow Agent will refund all subscription funds,
without deduction and/or interest accrued thereon, and will return the subscription documents to each Purchaser.  If the
Company or the Placement Agent rejects a subscription, either in whole or in part (at the sole discretion of the Company or the
Placement Agent), the rejected subscription funds or the rejected portion thereof will be returned promptly to such Purchaser
without interest, penalty, expense or deduction.
4.                                      Acceptance of Subscription.  The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company or the Placement
Agent, each in its sole discretion, reserves the right to accept this or any other subscription for the Units, in whole or in part,
notwithstanding prior receipt by the Purchaser of notice of acceptance of this or any other subscription.  The Company will have
no obligation hereunder until the Company executes and delivers to the Purchaser an executed copy of the Purchase
Agreement.  If Purchaser’s subscription is rejected in whole (at the sole discretion of the Company or the Placement Agent), the
Offering is terminated or the Minimum Offering is not subscribed for and accepted prior to the Termination Date, all funds
received from the Purchaser will be
returned without interest, penalty, expense or deduction, and this Subscription Agreement will thereafter be of no further force or
effect.  If Purchaser’s subscription is rejected in part (at the sole discretion of the Company or the Placement Agent) and the
Company accepts the portion not so rejected, the funds for the rejected portion of such subscription will be returned without
interest, penalty, expense or deduction, and this Subscription Agreement will continue in full force and effect to the extent such
subscription was accepted. The Purchaser may revoke its subscription and obtain a return of the subscription amount paid to the
Escrow Account at any time before the date of the Initial Closing.  The Purchaser may not revoke this subscription or obtain a
return of the subscription amount paid to the Escrow Agent on or after the date of the Initial Closing.  Any subscription received
after the Initial Closing but prior to the Termination Date shall be irrevocable.
5.                                      Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser.  The Purchaser hereby acknowledges, represents,
warrants, and agrees as follows:

or other regulatory authority.  Any representation to the contrary may be a criminal offense;

all information regarding the Company and the Securities, have been made available for inspection and reviewed by the
Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;
(e)                                  The Purchaser and its Advisors, if any, have had a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive

among other related matters, the Offering, the Securities, the Transaction Documents and the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of the Company and all
such questions have been answered by the Company to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;

(g)                                  The Purchaser is unaware of, is in no way relying on, and did not become aware of the offering of the
Securities through or as a result of, any form of general solicitation or general advertising including, without limitation, any article,
notice, advertisement or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over
television, radio or over the Internet, in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities and is not subscribing for the

was invited by, or any solicitation of a subscription by, a person not previously known to the Purchaser in connection with
investments in securities generally;
(h)                                 The Purchaser has taken no action which would give rise to any claim by any person for brokerage
commissions, finders’ fees or the like relating to this Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than fees to be paid by the Company to the Placement Agent, as described in the Memorandum);
(i)                                     The Purchaser, either alone or together with its Advisors, if any, has such knowledge and experience in
financial, tax, and business matters, and, in particular, investments in securities, so as to enable it to utilize the information
made available to it in connection with the Offering to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and the
Company and to make an informed investment decision with respect thereto;
(j)                                    The Purchaser is not relying on the Company, the Placement Agent or any of their respective employees or
agents with respect to the legal, tax, economic and related considerations of an investment in any of the Securities and the
Purchaser has relied on the advice of, or has consulted with, only its own Advisors;
(k)                                 The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities solely for such Purchaser’s own account for investment and not
with a view to resale or distribution thereof, in whole or in part.  The Purchaser has no agreement or arrangement, formal or
informal, with any person to sell or transfer all or any part of any of the Securities and the Purchaser has no plans to enter into
any such agreement or arrangement;
(l)                                     The Purchaser understands and agrees that purchase of the Securities is a high risk investment and the
Purchaser is able to afford an investment in a speculative venture having the risks and objectives of the Company.  The
Purchaser must bear the substantial economic risks of the investment in the Securities indefinitely because none of the
Securities may be sold, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.  Legends will be placed on the certificates
representing the Unit Shares, the Warrants, and the Warrant Shares to the effect that such
securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and appropriate notations thereof
will be made in the Company’s books;
(m)                             The Purchaser has adequate means of providing for such Purchaser’s current financial needs and foreseeable
contingencies and has no need for liquidity from its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time;
(n)                                 The Purchaser is aware that an investment in the Securities involves a number of very significant risks and
has carefully read and considered the Company’s periodic filings with the Commission, and the matters set forth in the
Memorandum and, in particular, the matters under the caption “Risk Factors” therein and understands any of such risk may
materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and future prospects;
(o)                                 At the time such Purchaser was offered the Securities, it was, and as of the date hereof it is, and on each
date on which it exercises any Warrants, it will be an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a),
promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act and has truthfully and accurately completed the Purchaser
Questionnaire attached to this Subscription Agreement and will submit to the Company such further assurances of such status
as may be reasonably requested by the Company;
(p)                                 The Purchaser: (i) if a natural person, represents that the Purchaser has reached the age of 21 and has full
power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates and to
carry out the provisions hereof and thereof; (ii) if a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, or association, joint
stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity, represents that such entity was not formed for the specific
purpose of acquiring the Securities, such entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its organization, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is authorized by, and will not result in a
violation of state law or its charter or other organizational documents, such entity has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates and to carry out the provisions hereof and
thereof and to purchase and hold the Securities, the execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary action, this Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such entity
and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such entity; or (iii) if executing this Subscription Agreement in a representative or
fiduciary capacity, represents that it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement in such
capacity and on behalf of the subscribing individual, ward, partnership, trust, estate, corporation, or limited liability company or
partnership, or other entity for whom the Purchaser is executing this Subscription Agreement, and such individual, partnership,
ward, trust, estate, corporation, or limited liability company or partnership, or other entity has full right and power to perform
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement and make an investment in the Company, and represents that this Subscription
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such entity.  The execution and delivery of this Subscription
Agreement will not violate or be in conflict with any order, judgment, injunction, agreement or controlling document to which the
Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound;
(q)                                 The Purchaer hereby acknowledges receipt and careful review of this Agreement, the Memorandum, the Unit
Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Warrant and all other exhibits, annexes and appendices thereto
(collectively referred to as the “Offering Materials”), and has had access to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the
exhibits thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the “Form 10-K”) and all subsequent periodic and current reports
filed with the Commission as publicly filed with and available at the website of the Commission which can be accessed at
www.sec.gov, and hereby represents that the Purchaser has been furnished by the Company during the course of the Offering
with all information regarding the Company, the terms and conditions of the Offering and any additional information that the
Purchaser has requested or desired to know, has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
duly authorized officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the Company and has been provided any such
additional information by the Company in writing to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser, if any;
(r)                                    The Purchaser represents to the Company that any information which the undersigned has heretofore
furnished or is furnishing herewith to the Company is complete and accurate and may be relied upon by the Company in
determining the availability of an exemption from registration under Federal and state securities laws in connection with the
offering of securities as described in the Memorandum;
(s)                                   The Purchaser has significant prior investment experience, including investment in non-listed and
unregistered securities.  The Purchaser has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the Company in the
event such a loss should occur.  The Purchaser’s overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is not
excessive in view of the Purchaser’s net worth and financial circumstances and the purchase of the Securities will not cause
such commitment to become excessive.  This investment is a suitable one for the Purchaser;
(t)                                    The Purchaser is satisfied that it has received adequate information with respect to all matters which it or
its Advisors, if any, consider material to its decision to make this investment;
(u)                                 The Purchaser acknowledges that any and all estimates or forward-looking statements or projections
included in the Memorandum were prepared by the Company in good faith, but that the attainment of any such projections,
estimates or forward-looking statements cannot be guaranteed, will not be updated by the Company and should not be relied
upon;
(v)                                 No oral or written representations have been made, or oral or written information furnished, to the Purchaser
or its Advisors, if any, in connection with the offering of the Securities which are in any way inconsistent with the information
contained in the Memorandum;
(w)                               Within five (5) days after receipt of a request from the Company, the Purchaser will provide such information
and deliver such documents as may reasonably be necessary to comply with any and all laws and ordinances to which the
Company is subject;
(x)                                 THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES AND ARE BEING OFFERED AND SOLD IN RELIANCE ON
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT AND SUCH LAWS.  THE SECURITIES ARE
SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD
EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER SAID ACT AND SUCH LAWS PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION
THEREFROM.  THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE COMMISSION, ANY STATE
SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, NOR HAVE ANY OF THE FOREGOING
AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THIS OFFERING OR THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY
OF THE MEMORANDUM.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNLAWFUL;
(y)                                 In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of Company and the terms
of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.  Investors should be aware that they will be required to bear the financial
risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time;
(z)                                  (For ERISA plans only)  The fiduciary of the ERISA plan (the “Plan”) represents that such fiduciary has
been informed of and understands the Company’s investment objectives, policies and strategies, and that the decision to invest
“plan assets” (as such term is defined in ERISA) in the Company is consistent with the provisions of ERISA that require
diversification of plan assets and impose other fiduciary responsibilities.  The Purchaser or Plan fiduciary (a) is responsible for
the decision to invest in the Company; (b) is independent of the Company and any of its affiliates; (c) is qualified to make such
investment decision; and (d) in making such decision, the Purchaser or Plan fiduciary has not relied on any advice or
recommendation of the Company or any of its affiliates; and
(aa)                          The Purchaser has read in its entirety the Memorandum and all exhibits and annexes thereto, including, but not
limited to, all information relating to the Company, and the Securities, and understands fully to its full satisfaction all information
included in the Memorandum including, but not limited to, the Section entitled “Risk Factors”.
(bb)                          The Purchaser represents that (i) the Purchaser was contacted regarding the sale of the Securities by the
Company or the Placement Agent (or another person whom the Purchaser believed to be an authorized agent or representative
thereof) with whom the Purchaser had a prior substantial pre-existing relationship and (ii) it did not learn of the offering of the
Securities by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising, and in connection therewith, the Purchaser did not
(A) receive or review any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in a newspaper or magazine or similar
media or broadcast over television or radio, whether closed circuit, or generally available; or (B) attend any seminar meeting or
industry investor conference whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.
(cc)                            The Purchaser consents to the placement of a legend on any certificate or other document evidencing the
Securities and, when issued, the Warrant Shares, that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any
state securities or “blue sky” laws and setting forth or referring to the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof contained in
this Agreement.  The Purchaser is aware that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to the
restrictions on the transferability of such Securities. The legend to be placed on each certificate shall be in form substantially
similar to the following:
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A MAY 2014 PRIVATE
PLACEMENT ANDHAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “ACT”) OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR “BLUE SKY LAWS,” AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD,
TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED ABSENT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF
UNDER SUCH ACT OR COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER SUCH ACT, OR UNLESS THE COMPANY
HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL,
THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.”
(dd)                          The Purchaser acknowledges that if he or she is a Registered Representative of a Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member firm, he or she must give such firm the notice required by the FINRA’s Rules of Fair
Practice, receipt of which must be acknowledged by such firm prior to an investment in the Securities.
(ee)                            To effectuate the terms and provisions hereof, the Purchaser hereby appoint the Placement Agent as its
attorney-in-fact (and the Placement Agent hereby accepts such appointment) for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement by and between the Company, the Placement Agent and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agreement”)
including, without limitation, taking any action on behalf of, or at the instruction of, the Purchaser and executing any release
notices required under the Escrow Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Placement Agent
may deem necessary or advisable (and lawful) to accomplish the purposes hereof.  All acts done under the foregoing
authorization are hereby ratified and approved and neither the Placement Agent nor any designee nor agent thereof shall be liable
for any acts of commission or omission, for any error of judgment, for any mistake of fact or law except for acts of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  This power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable while the Escrow
Agreement remains in effect.
(ff)                              The Purchaser agrees not to issue any public statement with respect to the Offering, Purchaser’s investment
or proposed investment in the Company or the terms of any agreement or covenant between them and the Company without the
Company’s prior written consent, except such disclosures as may be required under applicable law.
(gg)                            The Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees with the Company that this subscription may be
rejected, in whole or in part, by the Company, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, at any time before any Closing
notwithstanding prior receipt by the Purchaser of notice of acceptance of the Purchaser’s subscription.
(hh)                          The Purchaser acknowledges that the information contained in the Offering Materials or otherwise made
available to the Purchaser is confidential and non-public and agrees that all such information shall be kept in confidence by the
Purchaser and neither used by the Purchaser for the Purchaser’s personal benefit (other than in connection with this
subscription) nor disclosed to any third party for any reason, notwithstanding that a Purchaser’s subscription may not be
accepted by the Company; provided, however, that (a) the Purchaser may disclose such information to its affiliates and advisors
who may have a need for such information in connection with providing advice to the Purchaser with respect to its investment in
the Company so long as such affiliates and advisors have an obligation of confidentiality, and (b) this obligation shall not apply
to any such information that (i) is part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible at the date hereof, (ii) becomes
part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible by publication (except as a result of a breach of this provision) or
(iii) is received from third parties without an obligation of confidentiality (except third parties who disclose such information in
violation of any confidentiality agreements or obligations, including, without limitation, any subscription or other similar
agreement entered into with the Company).
(ii)                                  The Purchaser understands that Rule 144 promulgated under the Act (“Rule 144”) requires, among other
conditions, a minimum holding period of six-months prior to the resale of securities acquired in a non-public offering without
having to satisfy the registration requirements under the Act. The Purchaser understands and hereby acknowledges that the
Company is under no obligation to register the Securities under the Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws or to assist the
Purchaser in obtaining an exemption from various registration requirements, other than as set forth herein.
6.                                      Representations and Warranties of the Company.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS
The USA PATRIOT Act
What is money
laundering?
How big is the problem
and why is it important?
The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to
detect, deter, and punish terrorists in
the United States and abroad. The Act
imposes new anti-money laundering
requirements on brokerage firms and
financial institutions. Since April 24,
2002 all brokerage firms have been
required to have new, comprehensive
anti-money laundering programs.
To help you understand theses efforts,
we want to provide you with some
information about money laundering and
our steps to implement the USA
PATRIOT Act.
Money laundering is the process of
disguising illegally obtained money so
that the funds appear to come from
legitimate sources or activities. Money
laundering occurs in connection with a
wide variety of crimes, including illegal
arms sales, drug trafficking, robbery,
fraud, racketeering, and terrorism.
The use of the U.S. financial system by
criminals to facilitate terrorism or other
crimes could well taint our financial
markets. According to the U.S. State
Department, one recent estimate puts the
amount of worldwide money laundering
activity at $1 trillion a year.
What are we required to do to eliminate money laundering?
Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT Act, our anti-money laundering program must designate a special compliance
officer, set up employee training, conduct independent audits, and establish policies and procedures to detect and report
suspicious transaction and ensure compliance with the new laws.
As part of our required program, we may ask you to provide various identification documents or other information.  Until you
provide the information or documents we need, we may not be able to effect any transactions for you.

existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has full corporate power and authority to own and use
its properties and its assets and conduct its business as currently conducted.  Each of the Company’s subsidiaries identified on
Schedule 3.1 hereto (the “Subsidiaries”) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation with the requisite corporate power and authority to own and use its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as currently conducted. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its respective articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational or charter
2
documents, including, but not limited to the Charter Documents (as defined below). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, as the case may be, would not result in a direct and/or indirect (i) material adverse effect on the legality, validity
or enforceability of any of the Securities and/or this Agreement, (ii) material adverse effect on the results of operations, assets,
business, condition (financial and other) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) material
adverse effect on the Company’s ability to perform in any material respect on a timely basis its obligations under this
Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, the Memorandum, the Warrant and all exhibits, supplements and schedules thereto, as
such may be amended from time to time (collectively the “Transaction Documents”) (any of (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Material Adverse
Effect”).
3.2                               Capitalization and Voting Rights.  The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as
set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto and all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, (i) there are no outstanding securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which contain any preemptive, redemption or similar provisions, nor is any holder of securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary entitled to preemptive or similar rights arising out of any agreement or understanding with the
Company or any Subsidiary by virtue of any of the Transaction Documents, and there are no contracts, commitments,
understandings or arrangements by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become bound to redeem a security
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any stock appreciation rights or
“phantom stock” plans or agreements or any similar plan or agreement except for its equity incentive plans set forth on Schedule

Subsidiaries are owned by the Company, free and clear of any mortgages, pledges, liens, claims, charges, encumbrances or
other restrictions (collectively, “Encumbrances”). All of such outstanding capital stock has been issued in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws.  The issuance and sale of the Securities and, upon issuance, the Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”), as contemplated hereby will not obligate the Company to issue
shares of Common Stock or other securities to any other person (other than the Subscribers and the Placement Agent) and
except as set forth in Schedule 3.2 will not result in the adjustment of the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price of any
outstanding security.  The Company is not a party to any outstanding stockholder purchase rights and does not have a “poison
pill” or
3
any similar arrangement in effect giving any person the right to purchase any equity interest in the Company upon the

debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and to limitations of public

Documents, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
restrictions on transfer provided for in the Transaction Documents.  The Warrant Shares, when issued and paid for in accordance

Company has reserved a sufficient number of Warrant Shares for issuance upon the exercise of the Warrants, free and clear of
all Encumbrances, except for restrictions on transfer set forth in the Transaction Documents or imposed by applicable securities
laws.  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3 hereto, the issuance and sale of the Securities contemplated hereby will not give rise
to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal on behalf of any person other than the Subscribers.

(a)                                 The Company owns or possesses sufficient legal rights to all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade
names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information and other proprietary rights and processes necessary for its business as

as set forth in Schedule 3.15, each of the Company and GAC are in compliance with all material terms of each lease or sublease
of real property to which it is a party or is otherwise bound.  Nothing in this Section 3.15, however, shall be deemed to be a
representation or a warranty that any of the Mining Claims contains a discovery of valuable minerals.  The Company has good

their behalf, has engaged in any form of general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act) in connection with the offer or sale of the Securities.
3.20                        No Integrated Offering.  Assuming the accuracy of the Subscriber representations and warranties set forth in
Article I hereunder, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, any of their affiliates, and any person acting on their behalf has,
directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security, under circumstances
that would require registration of any of the Securities under the Securities Act or that is likely to cause this offering of the
Securities to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act or any applicable stockholder
approval provisions, including without limitation, under the rules and regulations of any exchange or automated quotation system
on which any of the securities of the Company are listed or designated. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports, none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their affiliates and any person acting on their behalf, have taken any action or steps referred to in the
preceding sentence that would require registration of any of the Securities under the Securities Act or cause the offering of the
Securities to be integrated with other offerings.
3.21                        Application of Takeover Protections.  The Company has taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render
inapplicable any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement)
or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Company’s Charter Documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or
could become applicable to the Subscriber as a result of the Subscriber and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising
their rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the Securities and the Subscribers’
ownership of the Securities.
3.22                        Taxes.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns
which are required to be filed by each of them and all such returns
9
are true and correct in all material respects, except for such failures to file which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and each Subsidiary has paid all taxes pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any
assessments received by any of them or by which any of them are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor or third party except where not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and each
Subsidiary has properly accrued all taxes required to be accrued and/or paid, except where the failure to accrue would not have a

statute of limitations with respect to taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any tax assessment or deficiency.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

the SEC is contemplating terminating such registration.  The Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof,
received notice from the OTCQB to the effect that the Company is not in compliance with the rules or regulations of the
OTCQB.  To the Company’s knowledge it is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be,
in compliance with all such rules and regulations of the OTCQB.

Memorandum, the Company confirms that neither it nor, to the Company’s knowledge, any other person acting on its behalf has
provided the Subscriber or its agents or counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute material,
non-public information. The Company understands and confirms that the Subscriber will rely on the foregoing representation in
purchasing the Units. All disclosure in the Transaction Documents is true and correct when considered in the aggregate and
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The press releases
disseminated by the Company during the twelve months preceding the date of this Agreement taken as a whole together with the
SEC Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and when made, not

the U.S. Treasury Department (“OFAC”); and the Company will not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the sale of the Units,

financing the activities of any person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions.

Rule 506 under the Securities Act (“Regulation D Securities”), to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of

a Disqualification Event covered by Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3). The Company has exercised reasonable care to determine whether
any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualification Event. The Company has complied, to the extent applicable, with its
disclosure obligations under Rule 506(e), and has furnished to the Placement Agent and the Subscriber a copy of any
disclosures provided thereunder.
(b)                                 Other Covered Persons. The Company is not aware of any person that (i) has been or will be paid (directly or
indirectly) remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with the sale of the Securities and (ii) who is subject to a

Maximum Offering offered hereunder have been accepted, (ii) June 16, 2014 (subject to the right of the Company and the
Placement Agent to extend the offering until July 14, 2014 without further notice to investors) or (iii) the date upon which the

4.2                               The Company may hold an initial closing (“Initial Closing”) at any time after the receipt of accepted
subscriptions for the Minimum Offering.  After the Initial Closing, subsequent closings with respect to additional Securities may
take place at any time prior to the Termination Date as determined by the Company, with respect to subscriptions accepted prior
to the Termination Date (each such closing, together with the Initial Closing, being referred to as a “Closing”).  The last Closing of
the Offering, occurring on or prior to the Termination Date, shall be referred to as the “Final Closing”.  Any subscription
documents or funds received after the Final Closing will be returned, without interest or deduction.  In the event that an Initial
Closing does not occur prior to the Termination Date, all amounts paid by the Subscriber shall be returned to the Subscriber,
without interest or deduction.  The Subscriber may revoke its subscription and obtain a return of the subscription amount paid to
the Escrow Account at any time before the date of the Initial Closing by providing written notice to the Placement Agent as
identified in the Subscription Agreement, the Company and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 6.1 below. Upon receipt of
a revocation notice from the Subscriber prior to the date of the Initial Closing, all amounts paid by the Subscriber shall be
returned to the Subscriber, without interest or deduction.  The Subscriber may not revoke this subscription or obtain a return of
the subscription amount paid to the Escrow Agent on or after the date of the Initial Closing. Any subscription received after the
Initial Closing but prior to the Termination Date shall be irrevocable.

below the minimum purchase may be accepted at the discretion of the Placement Agent as identified in the Subscription
Agreement and the Company.  The Company and the Placement Agent as identified in the Subscription Agreement reserve the
right to reject any subscription made hereby, in whole or in part, in their sole discretion.  The Company’s agreement with each
Subscriber is a separate agreement and the sale of the Securities to each Subscriber is a separate sale.
4.4                               All funds shall be deposited in the account identified in Section 1.1 hereof.
4.5                               Certificates representing the Securities purchased by the Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement will be
prepared for delivery to the Subscriber as soon as practicable following the Closing (but in no event later than five (5) days after
a Closing) at which such purchase takes place. The Subscriber hereby authorizes and directs the Company to deliver the
certificates representing the Securities purchased by the Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement directly to the Subscriber’s
residential or business or brokerage house address indicated on the signature page hereto.
4.6                               The Company’s agreement with each Subscriber is a separate agreement and the sale of Securities to each
Subscriber is a separate sale.
4.7                               If, on or before the earlier of May 16, 2015 or the date the Company completes the raise of gross proceeds of
$10.0 million in equity or debt financing (including the gross proceeds of the Offering), the Company shall issue (other than in an
Excepted Issuance) any Common Stock for a price per share (the “New Purchase Price”) that is less than the Unit
12
Purchase Price, then, and thereafter successively upon each such issuance, the Company shall promptly issue a number of
additional shares of Common Stock to investors in this Offering (the “Additional Shares”) for no additional consideration equal to
(a) the number of Unit Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement, multiplied by a fraction of which (i) the numerator is the
Unit Purchase Price (adjusted pursuant to the next sentence) and (ii) the denominator is the New Purchase Price in effect on the
date of calculation, minus (b) the number of United Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement.  The Unit Purchase Price
shall then be successively reduced to each lower New Purchase Price.
For purposes of this Agreement, “Excepted Issuances” shall mean any proposed sale, transfer or issuance by the Company of
its Common Stock in connection with (A) full or partial consideration in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or
purchase or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof), (B) full or partial consideration in
connection with a strategic supply, sale, license or joint venture or other partnering arrangements not for the primary purpose of
raising capital, (C), the conversion of the Company’s Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the exercise of existing options,
warrants or rights to purchase Common Stock or common stock equivalents, or the grant of new options or warrants or common
stock to employees, directors, officer or consultants of the Company.

adjustment in the Warrant exercise price as the result of the issuance of Common Stock for a New Purchase Price.

resale of such security under the Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if
such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and
pronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC). The Company shall cause its counsel, at the Company’s expense, to issue a
legal opinion to the Company’s transfer agent promptly (but in no event later then the requisite share delivery date set forth in the
Warrants) if required by the Company’s transfer agent to effect the removal of the legend if one of the preceding events has
occurred and as permitted by law.
6.2                               Listing of Securities.  The Company agrees, (i) if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on
any other trading market, it will include in such application the shares of Common Stock and Warrant Shares, and will take such
other action as is necessary or desirable to cause the shares of Common Stock and Warrant Shares to be listed on such other
trading market as promptly as possible, and (ii) it will take all action reasonably necessary to
15
continue the listing and trading of its Common Stock on a trading market and will comply in all material respects with the
Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the trading market.
6.3                               Reservation of Warrant Shares.  The Company shall at all times while the Warrants are outstanding maintain
a reserve from its duly authorized shares of Common Stock of a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to allow for the
issuance of the Warrant Shares.
6.4                               Replacement of Securities.  If any certificate or instrument evidencing any of the Securities is mutilated, lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation
thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested.  The
applicants for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs
associated with the issuance of such replacement securities.  If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any
securities is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Company may require delivery of such mutilated certificate or instrument
as a condition precedent to any issuance of a replacement.
6.5                               Furnishing of Information.  Until the time that no Subscriber owns Securities, the Company covenants to
maintain the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to timely file (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the
date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act.  As long as Subscriber owns Securities, if the Company is not required to file reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to Subscriber and make publicly available in accordance with
Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the Subscribers to sell the Securities under Rule 144.  The Company further
covenants that it will take such further action as any holder of Securities may reasonably request, to the extent required from
time to time to enable such person to sell such Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the requirements of
the exemption provided by Rule 144.
6.6                               Securities Laws; Publicity.  The Company shall, by 8:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth trading day
immediately following a Closing hereunder, issue a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby and including the Transaction Documents as exhibits thereto to the extent required by law.  The Company
shall not publicly disclose the name of Subscriber, or include the name of any Subscriber in any filing with the SEC or any
regulatory agency or trading market, without the prior written consent of Subscriber, except: (a) as required by federal securities
law in connection with the filing of final Transaction Documents (including signature pages thereto) with the SEC and (b) to the
extent such disclosure is required by law, in which case the Company shall provide the Subscriber with prior notice of such
disclosure permitted under this clause (b).
6.7                               Form D; Blue Sky Filings.  The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with respect to the Securities as
required under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and to provide a copy thereof, promptly upon request of the
Subscriber.  The Company shall take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an
16
exemption for, or to qualify the Securities for, sale to the Subscriber at the Closing under applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws
of the states of the United States, and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Subscriber.
6.8                               Equal Treatment of Subscribers.  No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document)
shall be offered or paid to any person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of any of the Transaction
Documents unless the same consideration is also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents.
6.9                               Indemnification.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Subscriber, its affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and
against , any and all loss, liability, damage or deficiency suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by the Company made in this Agreement or, after any applicable notice and/or cure
periods, nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company under this Agreement or
other Transaction Documents; and will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Parties for all expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel) as incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or
threatened claim related to or arising in any manner out of any of the foregoing, or any action or proceeding arising therefrom
(collectively, “Proceedings”), whether or not such Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such Proceeding (unless such action
is based upon a breach of such Subscriber’s representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents or any
agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such stockholder or any violations by such Subscriber of
state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Subscriber which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct
or malfeasance).  If any action shall be brought against any Subscriber in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
this Agreement, such Subscriber shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber.  Any Subscriber shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Subscriber except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and
to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue
between the position of the Company and the position of such Subscriber, in which case the Company shall be responsible for
the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel.  The Company will not be liable to any
Subscriber under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a Subscriber effected without the Company’s prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or
liability is attributable to any Subscriber’s breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction
Documents or any agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such stockholder or any violations by
such Subscriber of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Subscriber which constitutes fraud, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or malfeasance.  The indemnification required by this Section 6.9 shall be made by periodic payments of the
amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred.  The indemnity
agreements contained
17
herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Subscriber against the Company or others and any
liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.
(a)                                 If for any reason (other than a final non-appealable judgment finding any Indemnified Party liable for losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for its gross negligence or willful misconduct) the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to
an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Advisor on the other, but
also the relative fault by the Company and the Indemnified Party, as well as any relevant equitable considerations.
6.10                        Non-Public Information.  Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other person acting on
its behalf, will provide Subscriber or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material
non-public information.  The Company understands and confirms that Subscriber shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in
effecting transactions in securities of the Company.
6.11                        Use of Proceeds.  Except as set forth on Schedule 6.11 attached hereto, the Company shall use the net
proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder for working capital purposes and shall not use such proceeds for: (a) the
satisfaction of any portion of the Company’s debt (other than payment of trade payables in the ordinary course of the Company’s
business and prior practices), (b) the redemption of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents or (c) the payment for
expenses connected with any investigations or potential ligation or ligation and/or any settlement of any litigation.
6.12                        DTC.  In the event that while any of the Securities are outstanding, (i) the Company does not use a transfer
agent that is a member participant of the Depository Trust Company Automated Securities Transfer Program and/or (ii) the
Company’s Common Stock is not at all times eligible for transfer pursuant to the Depositor Trust Company Automated Transfer
Program (i and ii are referred to as a “DTC Event”) then then, in addition to any other rights the Subscribers may have hereunder
or under applicable law, on each monthly anniversary of each such date (if the applicable DTC Event shall not have been cured
by such date) until the applicable DTC Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each Subscriber an amount in cash, as partial
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the
Subscription Agreement and Purchase Agreement. The parties agree that the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable
to an Investor under this Agreement shall be 10% of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by such Investor pursuant to this
Purchase Agreement.  If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages pursuant to this Section in full within seven
days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount
that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Investor, accruing daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are
due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full.

writing signed by the parties hereto.  No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other
provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any
manner impair the exercise of any such right.
7.3                               This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and to their respective
heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.  The Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of Subscriber (other than by merger).  Subscriber may assign any or all of its rights
under this Agreement to any person to whom Subscriber assigns or transfers any Securities in accordance with applicable law,
provided that such transferee agrees in writing to be bound, with respect to the transferred Securities, by the provisions of the
Transaction Documents.
7.4                               The Transaction Documents, together with the exhibits and schedules thereto, contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
oral or written, with respect to such matters, which the parties acknowledge have been merged into such documents, exhibits
and schedules.
7.5                               Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Subscriber and the Company, this Agreement shall
become a binding obligation of the Subscriber with respect to the purchase of Securities as herein provided, subject, however, to
the right hereby reserved by the Company to enter into the same agreements with other subscribers and to reject any
subscription, in whole or in part, provided the Company returns to Subscriber any funds paid by Subscriber with respect to such
rejected subscription or portion thereof, without interest or deduction.
7.6                               All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction
Documents shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York,
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.  Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the
interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other Transaction
Documents (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or
agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York.  Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, borough of
Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or
discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably
waives, and
20
agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such
court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such proceeding.
7.7                               The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.  If any provision of
this Agreement shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in whole
or in part, such provision shall be interpreted so as to remain enforceable to the maximum extent permissible consistent with
applicable law and the remaining conditions and provisions or portions thereof shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
and enforceable to the extent they are valid, legal and enforceable, and no provisions shall be deemed dependent upon any other
covenant or provision unless so expressed herein.
7.8                               It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or
be construed, as a waiver of any subsequent breach by that same party.
7.9                               The Company and Subscriber agree to execute and deliver all such further documents, agreements and
instruments and take such other and further action as may be necessary or appropriate and as permitted by law to carry out the
purposes and intent of this Agreement.
7.10                        This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf”
signature page were an original thereof.
7.11                        Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any rights in any person or entity not a party to
this Agreement.
7.12                        In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of
damages, the Subscriber and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under this Agreement.  The parties agree that
monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations described in
the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.
7.13                        The Company further understands and acknowledges that (i) Subscriber may engage in hedging activities at
various times during the period that the Securities are outstanding, including, without limitation, during the periods that the value
of the Warrant Shares deliverable with respect to Securities are being determined, and (ii) such hedging activities (if any) could
reduce the value of the existing stockholders’ equity interests in the Company at and after the time that the hedging activities
are being conducted.  The Company acknowledges that such aforementioned hedging activities do not constitute a breach of
any of the Transaction Documents.
21
7.14                        In order to discourage frivolous claims the parties agree that unless a claimant in any proceeding arising out of
this Agreement succeeds in establishing his claim and recovering a judgment against another party (regardless of whether such
claimant succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then the other party shall be entitled to recover from such
claimant all of its/their reasonable legal costs and expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

be declared effective by the Commission as soon as reasonably practicable.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall have the right to delay the filing
of the Registration Statement for a period not in excess of 60 consecutive days and no more than 90 days in any consecutive
12-month period (a “Delay Period”), if the Company is pursuing a public offering of securities and the underwriter recommends a
Delay Period.
(c)                                  In the case of an event that causes the Company to suspend the use of a Registration Statement (a
“Suspension Event”), the Company shall give written notice (a “Suspension Notice”) to the Investors to suspend sales of the
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement and such notice shall continue only for so long as the Suspension
Event or its effect is continuing. No Investor shall effect any sales of the Registrable Securities
4
pursuant to such Registration Statement (or such filings) at any time after it has received a Suspension Notice from the
Company and prior to receipt of an End of Suspension Notice (as defined below) with respect to such Registration Statement. 
The Investors may recommence effecting sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement (or such
filings) following further notice to such effect (an “End of Suspension Notice”) from the Company, which End of Suspension
Notice shall be given by the Company to the Investors in the manner described above promptly following the conclusion of any
Suspension Event and its effect.
(d)                                 If: (i) the Automatic Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to its Filing Date (if the Company files the
Automatic Registration Statement without affording the Holders the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required
by Section 5(a) herein, the Company shall be deemed to have not satisfied this clause (i)), (ii) a Registration Statement
registering for resale all of the Registrable Securities is not declared effective by the Commission by the Effectiveness Date
(unless the reason for such non-registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities is as a result of SEC Guidance
under Rule 415 or similar rule which limits the number of Registrable Securities which may be included in a registration
statement with respect to the Holders), or (iii) after the effective date of a Registration Statement, such Registration Statement
ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective as to all Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement,
or the Investors are otherwise not permitted to utilize the prospectus therein to resell such Registrable Securities, for more than
ten (10) consecutive calendar days or more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days (which need not be consecutive
calendar days) during any 12-month period (any such failure or breach being referred to as an “Event”, and for purposes of
clause (i) and (iv), the date on which such Event occurs, and for purpose of clause (iii) the date on which such ten (10) or fifteen
(15) calendar day period, as applicable, is exceeded being referred to as “Event Date”), then, in addition to any other rights the
Investors may have hereunder or under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of each such
Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date) until the applicable Event is cured, the Company
shall pay to each Investor an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate
purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the Subscription Agreement and Purchase Agreement. The parties agree that the
maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to an Investor under this Agreement shall be 15% of the aggregate Purchase
Price paid by such Investor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages
pursuant to this Section in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18%
per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Investor, accruing daily from
the date such partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The partial
liquidated damages pursuant to the terms hereof shall apply on a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a month prior to the cure
of an Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payments shall be owed (i) to any affiliate of the Company, (ii) with respect to any
period during which all of the holder’s Registrable Shares may be sold by such holder under Rule 144 without volume or manner-
of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public
information requirement under Rule 144, or (iii) in circumstances described in Sections 3(c)

4.                                      Piggyback Registrations.
(a)                                 With respect to any Registrable Securities not otherwise included in the Automatic Registration Statement or
any other Registration Statement as a result of any limitation imposed by the Commission under Rule 415 (the “Excluded
Registrable Securities”), whenever the Company proposes to register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the
Company for other shareholders) any of its securities under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to (i) an Automatic
Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (ii) registration pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any
successor forms thereto), and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Registrable Securities (a
“Piggyback Registration”), the Company will give written notice to the holder of Excluded Securities of its intention to effect
such a registration and will, subject to the provisions of Subsection 4(b) hereof, include in such registration all Excluded
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein within twenty (20)
days after the receipt of the Company’s notice.
(b)                                 If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Company’s
securities, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested
to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering, the Company will include in such registration a pro rata share of Excluded Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Registration Statement as calculated by dividing the number of Excluded Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Registration Statement by the number of the Company’s securities requested to be included in
such Registration Statement by all selling security holders. In such event, the holder of Excluded Registrable Securities shall
continue to have registration rights under this Agreement with respect to any Excluded Registrable Securities not so included in
such Registration Statement.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after giving a notice of Piggyback Registration and prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any
reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each record holder of Excluded Registrable Securities and, following such notice, (i) in the case of a
determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Excluded Registrable Securities in connection with
such registration, and (ii) in the case of determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any Excluded
Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities.
5.                                      Registration Procedures.  If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of any
Registrable Securities under the terms herein, the Company will:
(a)                                 not less than four 4) trading days prior to the filing of each Registration Statement and not less than one
(1) trading day prior to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that
would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), and subject, if appropriate, to the relevant parties’
entry into a customary agreement to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public
6
information provided (a “Confidentiality Agreement”) or the Company may excise any information which would constitute material
non-public information regarding the Company, the Company shall (i) furnish to one counsel on behalf of all sellers of Registrable
Securities copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such sellers, and (ii) cause its officers and directors, counsel and
independent registered public accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the sellers of Registrable Securities, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to provide each seller of Registrable Securities advance copies
of any universal shelf registration statement registering securities in addition to those required hereunder, or any Prospectus
prepared thereto.  The Company shall pay a one time fee of $10,000 to the counsel referenced above in Section 5(a)(i), which
shall be paid by the Company at the time such counsel is to review such Registration Statement and in any event prior to the
four trading days referred in the first sentence of this subsection (a).
(b)                                 prepare and file with the Commission the Registration Statement with respect to such securities and use its
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective in an expeditious manner;
(c)                                  (i) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to a
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep a Registration Statement
continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the
Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable
Securities, (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to
the terms of this Agreement), and, as so supplemented or amended, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424, (iii) respond as promptly as
reasonably possible to any comments received from the Commission with respect to a Registration Statement or any
amendment thereto and provide as promptly as reasonably possible to one counsel for all sellers of Registrable Securities true
and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to a Registration Statement (provided that, the
Company may either obtain a Confidentiality Agreement from Investors or excise any information contained therein which would
constitute material non-public information regarding the Company), and (iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance (subject to the terms of
this Agreement) with the intended methods of disposition by each seller of Registrable Securities thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.
(d)                                 if during the Effectiveness Period, the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100% of the
number of shares of Common Stock then registered in a Registration Statement, then the Company shall file as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any case prior to the applicable Filing Date, an additional Registration Statement covering the
resale by the Investors of not less than the number of such Registrable Securities.
7
(e)                                  furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and to each underwriter such number of copies of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) as such persons reasonably
may request in order to facilitate the intended disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
(f)                                   use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement under the state securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions as the sellers of Registrable Securities
or, in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter, reasonably shall request, (ii) to prepare and file in
those jurisdictions such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements, and take such other actions, as
may be necessary to maintain such registration and qualification in effect at all times for the period of distribution contemplated
thereby and (iii) to take such further action as may be necessary or advisable to enable the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions, provided, that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to
transact business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction;
(g)                                  use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement with any securities exchange on which the common stock of the Company is then listed;
(h)                                 immediately notify each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter under such Registration
Statement, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening
of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of which the Prospectus contained in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing and
promptly amend or supplement such Registration Statement to correct any such untrue statement or omission;
(i)                                     promptly notify each seller of Registrable Securities of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and make every
reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the
earliest possible time;
(j)                                    if the offering is an underwritten offering, enter into a written agreement with the managing underwriter
selected in the manner herein provided in such form and containing such provisions as are usual and customary in the securities
business for such an arrangement between such underwriter and companies of the Company’s size and investment stature,
including, without limitation, customary indemnification and contribution provisions;
(k)                                 if the offering is an underwritten offering, at the request of any Investor, furnish to such Investor on the date
that Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration: (i) a copy of an opinion, dated
such date, of counsel
8
representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, stating that such Registration
Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and that (A) to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order
suspending the effectiveness thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending
or contemplated under the Securities Act, (B) the Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereof comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act (except that such
counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements or other financial or statistical information contained therein)
and (C) to such other effects as reasonably may be requested by counsel for the underwriters; and (ii) a copy of a letter dated
such date from the independent public accountants retained by the Company, addressed to the underwriters, stating that they
are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and that, in the opinion of such
accountants, the financial statements of the Company included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
Securities Act, and such letter shall additionally cover such other financial matters (including information as to the period ending
no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter) with respect to such registration as such underwriters
reasonably may request;
(l)                                     take all actions reasonably necessary to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not
bearing any legend restricting the sale or transfer of such securities) representing the Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant
to the Registration Statement and to enable such certificates to be in such denominations and registered in such names as each
Investor or any underwriters may reasonably request; and
(m)                             take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate the registration of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.
6.                                      Obligations of Investor.  The Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding such
Investor, the number of Registrable Securities owned and proposed to be sold by it, the intended method of disposition of such
securities and any other information as shall be required to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities, and cooperate
with the Company in preparing the Registration Statement and in complying with the requirements of the Securities Act.  Each
Investor agrees to furnish to the Company a completed questionnaire in the form attached to this Agreement as Annex B (a
“Selling Stockholder Questionnaire”) on a date that is not less than three trading days prior to the Filing.
7.                                      Expenses.
(a)                                 All expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Sections 3, 4 and 5 including, without limitation, all
registration and filing fees (including the fees of the Commission and any other regulatory body with which the Company is
required to file), printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the Company,
fees and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying with state securities or “blue sky” laws, and
fees of transfer agents and registrars are called “Registration Expenses.” All underwriting discounts and selling commissions
applicable to the sale of Registrable Securities are called “Selling Expenses.”
9
(b)                                 The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any Registration Statement filed
hereunder, and the Selling Expenses in connection with each such Registration Statement shall be borne by the participating
sellers in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities sold by each or as they may otherwise agree.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at the request of any Investor, the Company shall employ
its counsel at the Company’s expense to prepare any and all legal opinions necessary for the prompt removal of restrictive
legends from certificates representing Registrable Securities as, when and to the extent such legends may be removed in
compliance with the Securities Act and/or Rule 144.
8.                                      Indemnification and Contribution.
(a)                                 In the event of a registration of any of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless and pay and reimburse, each Investor thereunder, each
underwriter of such Registrable Securities thereunder and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which such Investor, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities
were registered under the Securities Act pursuant hereto or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged
violation of the Securities Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws and will reimburse each such Investor, each such
underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, that the Company will not be liable in any
such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon the Company’s
reliance on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by any such seller, any such underwriter or any such controlling person in writing specifically for use in
such Registration Statement or prospectus.
(b)                                 In the event of a registration of any of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant hereto,
each seller of such Registrable Securities thereunder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, each officer of the Company who signs
the Registration Statement, each director of the Company, each underwriter and each person who controls any underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or
such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon reliance on any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement under which such Registrable
Securities were registered
10
under the Securities Act pursuant hereto or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such
officer, director, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection
with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided that such seller will be liable hereunder
in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
pertaining to such seller, as such, furnished in writing to the Company by such seller specifically for use in such Registration
Statement or prospectus; and provided, further, that the liability of each seller hereunder shall be limited to the proceeds
received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the indemnity provided in this Section 8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent of such indemnified party and provided further,
that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in
respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
in such Registration Statement, which untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is
completely corrected in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the undersigned indemnitees thereafter
fail to deliver or cause to be delivered such Registration Statement as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof)
or expense after the Company has furnished the undersigned with the same.
(c)                                  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the
indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to such indemnified party other than under this Section 8 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it
may have to such indemnified party under this Section 8 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by
such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume
and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel
so selected; provided that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded based upon written advice of its counsel that there may be reasonable
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the
indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall
have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such
11
legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel
and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred.
(d)                                 In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in
which either (i) any holder of Registrable Securities exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such
holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final
judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of
appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 8 provides for
indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling holder
or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 8; then, and in each
such case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they
may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented
by the percentage that the public offering price of its Registrable Securities offered by the Registration statement bears to the
public offering price of all securities offered by such Registration statement, and the Company is responsible for the remaining
portion; provided, that, in any such case, (A) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public
offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration statement and (B) no person or entity
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 12(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution
from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
9.                                      Changes in Capital Stock.  If, and as often as, there is any change in the capital stock of the Company by
way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, or through a merger, consolidation, reorganization or
recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and
privileges granted hereby shall continue as so changed.
10.                               Representations and Warranties of the Company.  The Company represents and warrants to the Investor as
follows:
(a)                                 The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action and will not violate any provision of law, any order of any court or other agency of government, the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which it
or any or its properties or assets is bound, conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge
or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.
(b)                                 This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other laws
12
affecting the rights of creditors generally and to general equitable principles and the availability of specific performance.
11.                               Rule 144 Requirements.  The Company agrees to:
(a)                                 make and keep current public information about the Company available, as those terms are understood and
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;
(b)                                 use its best efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required
of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting
requirements); and
(c)                                  furnish to any Investor upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to
such reporting requirements), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and (iii) such other reports
and documents of the Company as such holder may reasonably request to avail itself of any similar rule or regulation of the
Commission allowing it to sell any such securities without registration.
12.                               Termination.  All of the Company’s obligations to register Registrable Shares under Sections 3, 4, and 5
hereof shall terminate upon the date on which the Investor holds no Registrable Securities or all of the Registrable Securities are
eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement for the
Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144, as determined by counsel to the
Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the Company’s transfer agent and the
Investor.
13.                               Miscellaneous.

Form of
Plan of Distribution
Annex A
Each Selling Stockholder (the “Selling Stockholders”) of the securities and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-
interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on the OTCQB or any other stock exchange,
market or trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions.  These sales may be at fixed or negotiated
prices.  A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:
·                  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;
·                  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion
of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;
·                  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;
·                  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;
·                  privately negotiated transactions;
·                  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part;
·                  in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such
securities at a stipulated price per security;
·                  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or
otherwise;
·                  a combination of any such methods of sale; or
·                  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), if available, rather than under this prospectus.
Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales.  Broker-dealers
may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of
securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the
case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in
the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.
17
In connection with the sale of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions
with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of
hedging the positions they assume.  The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close
out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities.  The Selling
Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or
more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by
this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as
supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).
The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be
“underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.  In such event, any commissions received
by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be
underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.  Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it
does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities.
In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent
(8%).
The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the
securities.  The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject
to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder.  In addition, any securities covered
by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than
under this prospectus. The Selling Stockholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in
connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholders.
We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling
Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without
the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act
or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect.  The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or
dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may
not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or
qualification requirement is available and is complied with.
18
Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities
may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted
period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution.  In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be
subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which
may limit the timing of purchases and sales of securities of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other
person.  We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to
deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172
under the Securities Act).

Item 1.01                                           Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Subscription Agreements, Unit Purchase Agreement, Warrants, and Registration Rights Agreement
On July 30, 2014, Pershing Gold Corporation (the “Company”) issued 6,813,645 Units, with each Unit comprised of one share of
Common Stock and a 30 month warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 0.4 of a share of Common Stock (the “Warrant Shares”) at
an exercise price of $0.45, for a total of 6,813,645 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to acquire an additional 2,725,454
shares of Common Stock, all pursuant to subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) and a unit purchase
agreement (the “Unit Purchase Agreement”) entered into with several accredited investors.  The gross proceeds totaled
approximately $2.3 million, and the net proceeds totaled approximately $2.2 million.
The Units were subscribed to pursuant to Subscription Agreements entered into on July 30, 2014 between the Company and
certain accredited investors.  The Subscription Agreements contain customary terms and conditions including, among other
things, terms of the subscription, representations and warranties by the Company and each investor, and indemnification.  The
Units were sold pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement dated July 30, 2014 between the Company and the accredited
investors.  The Unit Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and conditions including, among other things,
representations and warranties by the Company and each investor, closing deliveries, and indemnification.
The Warrants sold as part of the Units are exercisable immediately at an exercise price of $0.45 per share of Common Stock,
subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, recapitalizations or certain other transactions.  The Warrants will expire on
January 30, 2017.
In connection with the private placement, the Company and the investors entered into a registration rights agreement dated
July 30, 2014 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) which requires the Company, at any time after September 12, 2014, to file a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register the resale of the Common Stock issued as part
of the Units and the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants.  The Registration Rights Agreement also
contains piggyback registration rights requiring the Company to include such holders’ shares of Common Stock in future
registration statements that may be filed by the Company.
The foregoing summary of the terms of the Warrant, the Subscription Agreement, the Unit Purchase Agreement, and the
Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the
Warrant, the Subscription Agreement, the Unit Purchase Agreement, and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed as
Exhibits 4.1, 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02                                           Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The information provided in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the private placement, the Company issued 6,813,645 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to acquire an
aggregate of 2,725,454 shares of Common Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.3 million and net proceeds
of approximately $2.2 million after commissions.  Laidlaw & Co (UK) Ltd. acted as placement agent and was paid aggregate
cash commissions of approximately $100,000 and expenses of approximately $18,000 and will be issued 30 month warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 342,855 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.34.
The Company relied on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D
for purposes of the private placement.

OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) TO

SECURITIES ACT OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE OFFER AND SALE OF
SECURITIES, AND, IN THE CASE OF (C) OR (E), ONLY IF THE HOLDER HAS PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER FURNISHED
TO THE COMPANY AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OF RECOGNIZED STANDING IN CUSTOMARY FORM AND SUBSTANCE
AND IN THE CASE OF (D), THE HOLDER HAS PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY CUSTOMARY DOCUMENTATION OF THE
HOLDER AND ITS BROKER.
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), hereby agrees to sell
upon the terms and on the conditions hereinafter set forth, but no later than January [  ], 2017 (the “Expiration Date”) (as defined
in Section 1(a) below) to                                          , whose address is                                   , or registered assigns (the
“Holder”), under the terms as hereinafter set forth, from and after the issue date hereof (“Initial Issue Date”)                              
(              ) fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Warrant
Stock”), at a purchase price of $0.45 per share (the “Warrant Price”), pursuant to this warrant (this “Warrant”).  The number of
shares of Warrant Stock to be so issued and the Warrant Price are subject to adjustment in certain events as hereinafter set
forth.  The term “Common Stock” shall mean, when used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, the stock and property at
the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant.
This Warrant has been issued pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement between the Company and the Holder dated
the same date as this Warrant (the “Subscription Agreement”).  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in the Subscription Agreement.
1.                                      Exercise of Warrant.
a.                                      Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time
or times on or after the Initial Issue Date and on or before the Expiration Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or
agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing
on the books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto. Within two
(2) “Trading Days” (a day on which the OTCQB or stock exchange on which the Company’s stock is listed is open for business)
following the date of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Warrant Price for the shares specified in the
applicable Notice of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank unless the cashless exercise
procedure specified in Section 1(b) below is specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary (although the Holder may surrender the Warrant to, and receive a replacement Warrant from, the Company), the Holder
shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Stock
available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the
Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company.
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total amount of Warrant Stock available hereunder
shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding amount of Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the
applicable amount of Warrant Stock purchased.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the amount of
Warrant Stock purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise
Form within one (1) Trading Day of delivery of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant,
acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the
Warrant Stock hereunder, the amount of Warrant Stock available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less
than the amount stated on the face hereof.
Cashless Exercise.  This Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time the Warrant Stock is not registered for
resale pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act, by means of a “cashless exercise” (in lieu of
making a payment upon such exercise) in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of shares of
Warrant Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:
(A) = the closing price of the Warrant Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which Holder elects to
exercise this Warrant by means of a “cashless exercise,” as set forth in the applicable Notice of Exercise;
(B) = the Warrant Price, as adjusted hereunder; and
(X) = the number of shares of Warrant Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms
of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.
2
b.                                      If exercised in part, the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than five (5) Trading
Days after receipt of this Warrant (and the purchase price if applicable) and at its own expense, deliver to the Holder a new
Warrant, identical in form, in the name of the Holder, evidencing the right to purchase the number of shares of Warrant Stock as
to which this Warrant has not been exercised.
c.                                       No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issuable upon any exercise of this Warrant and the Holder
will not be entitled to any cash payment or compensation in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock.
d.                                      Reserved.
e.                                       Mechanics of Exercise.
(i)                                     Delivery of Certificates Upon Exercise.  Not later than five (5) Trading Days after the latest of (A) the
delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (B) surrender of this Warrant (if required) and (C) payment of the aggregate
Purchase Price as set forth above (including by cashless exercise, if permitted) (such date, the “Warrant Stock Delivery Date”),
the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the exercising Holder a certificate or certificates (bearing the restrictive
legend set forth below) representing the number of shares of Warrant Stock being acquired upon the exercise of such Warrant;
provided however, if the Company is then a participant in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission (“DWAC”) system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the
Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares have been resold by the Holder
without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, then Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be
transmitted by the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s prime
broker with DTC through its DWAC system.  The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such shares as
promptly as practicable but in any event prior to the Warrant Stock Delivery Date.  The Warrant Stock shall be deemed to have
been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of
record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the Company of the
aggregate Purchase Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, prior to
the issuance of such shares, having been paid.  The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the Warrant Stock
after the Warrant Stock Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. As compensation to the Holder for such loss,
the Company agrees to pay (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) to the Holder for late issuance of Warrant Stock upon
exercise of this Warrant the proportionate amount of $100 per “Business Day” (any day except any Saturday, any Sunday, any
day which shall be a federal legal holiday in the United States or any day on which banking institutions in the City of New York
are authorized or required by law or
3
other governmental action to close) (increasing to $200 per Business Day after the tenth Trading Day) commencing after the
second Trading Day following the Warrant Stock Delivery Date for each $10,000 of Exercise Price of Warrant Stock for which
this Warrant is exercised which are not timely delivered.  The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section in
immediately available funds upon demand.  Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Holder,
in the event that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Warrant Stock by the Warrant Stock Delivery Date,
the Holder may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by delivery of a notice to such effect to the Company,
whereupon the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to the exercise of
the relevant portion of this Warrant, except that the liquidated damages described above shall be payable through the date notice
of revocation or rescission is given to the Company.
(ii)                                  Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise.  If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company
shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or
certificates representing Warrant Stock, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the
unpurchased Warrant Stock called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this
Warrant.
(iii)                               Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise.  In addition to any other
rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the
certificates representing the Warrant Stock pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Stock Delivery Date, and if after
such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage
firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Stock which
the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the
amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Warrant Stock that the
Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order
giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the
Warrant and equivalent number of shares of Warrant Stock for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such
exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been
issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder.  For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of
shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the
immediately preceding sentence the
4
Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts
payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.  Nothing
herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver
certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof;
provided however that the Holder shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the same damages and that the Company
shall not be liable for any consequential, or punitive damages.
(iv)                              Closing of Books.  The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents
the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
f.                                        Holder’s Exercise Limitations.  The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder
shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after
exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s Affiliates, and any other
Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below).  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any
other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on
conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. 
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 1(g), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged
by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith.   To the extent
that the limitation contained in this Section 1(g) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to
other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in
the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of
whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which
portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have
no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.   In addition, a determination as to any group status as
contemplated above
5
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.  For purposes of this Section 1(g), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual
report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more
recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. 
Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder
the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the
Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.  The
“Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.  The Holder, upon not less
than 61 days’ prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this
Section 1(g), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this
Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 1(g) shall continue to apply.  Any such increase or decrease will
not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be
construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 1(g) to correct this
paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein
contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations
contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation shall not apply if the Holder beneficially owns, as of the Initial Issue Date, in excess of 9.99% of the
number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant held by such Holder.
2.                                      Disposition of Warrant Stock and Warrant.
a.                                      The Holder hereby acknowledges that this Warrant and any Warrant Stock purchased pursuant hereto are,
as of the date hereof, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) or under any
applicable state securities law; and that the Company’s reliance on certain exemptions under the U.S. Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws is predicated in part on the representations made by the Holder in Article IV of the Subscription
Agreement.
b.                                      Any certificate representing Common Stock issued upon the exercise of this Warrant will bear a legend
substantially similar to the following:
6
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.  SUCH
SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD,
DELIVERED AFTER SALE, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED BY THE ISSUER WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
COVERING SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. AN OPINION
OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE ISSUER OR THE TRANSFER AGENT.
In addition, so long as the foregoing legend may remain on any stock certificate delivered to the Holder, the Company may
maintain appropriate “stop transfer” orders with respect to such certificates and the shares represented thereby on its books and
records and with those to whom it may delegate registrar and transfer functions.
3.                                      Reservation of Shares.  The Company hereby agrees that at all times there shall be reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of this Warrant such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall be required for issuance upon exercise
of this Warrant.  The Company further agrees that all shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by
this Warrant will be duly authorized and will, upon issuance and against payment of the exercise price, be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, free from all taxes, liens, charges and preemptive rights with respect to the issuance thereof, other
than taxes, if any, in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issuance and other than transfer restrictions
imposed by federal, state or other applicable securities laws.
4.                                      Exchange, Transfer or Assignment of Warrant.  Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws,
this Warrant is exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the
Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, for other Warrants of different denominations, entitling the Holder or
Holders thereof to purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder.  Upon
surrender of this Warrant to the Company or at the office of its stock transfer agent, if any, with the Assignment Form annexed
hereto duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any transfer tax, the Company shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new
Warrant in the name of the assignee named in such instrument of assignment and this Warrant shall promptly be canceled.
5.                                      Capital Adjustments.  This Warrant is subject to the following further provisions:
a.                                      Subdivision or Combination of Shares.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant remains outstanding
and unexpired shall subdivide or combine its Common Stock, the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise
of this Warrant and the Warrant Price shall be proportionately adjusted.  Any adjustment under this Section 5(a) shall become
effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective or, if earlier, the record date with
respect to the subdivision or combination.
7
b.                                      Stock Dividends and Distributions.  If the Company at any time while this Warrant is outstanding and
unexpired shall issue or pay the holders of its Common Stock, or take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the
purpose of entitling them to receive, a dividend payable in, or other distribution of, Common Stock, then (i) the Warrant Price
shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 5(e) and (ii) the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of
this Warrant shall be adjusted to the number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder would have owned immediately
following such action had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior thereto.
c.                                       Stock and Rights Offering to Stockholders.  If the Company shall at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding distribute to all holders of its Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common
Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions) or rights or warrants to subscribe
for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph), or securities
convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock (any of the foregoing, the “Securities”), then in each such case, the Company
shall without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation reserve shares or other units of such Securities for distribution to the
Holder upon exercise of this Warrant so that, in addition to the shares of the Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled,
such Holder will receive upon such exercise the amount and kind of such Securities which such Holder would have received if
the Holder had, immediately prior to the record date for the distribution of the Securities, exercised this Warrant.
d.                                      Organic Change.  Any recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or
substantially all of the Company’s assets to another person or entity or other transaction that is effected in such a way that
holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with
respect to or in exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as an “Organic Change.”
(i)                                     In connection with any (x) bona fide sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an acquiring
person or entity or (y) other Organic Change involving an arm’s length third party or parties following which the Company is not
the surviving entity and as a result of which the then current stockholders of the Company will not, directly or indirectly own 50%
or more of the surviving entity, the Company shall elect in its sole discretion: (A) to require that the Holder exercise this Warrant
prior to the consummation of such Organic Change, and if not so exercised, that this Warrant shall terminate upon
consummation of such Organic Change, or (B) to secure from the person or entity purchasing such assets or the successor
resulting from such Organic Change (in each case, the “Acquiring Entity”) a written agreement (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder) to deliver to the Holder, in exchange for this Warrant, a warrant of the Acquiring Entity (the
“Replacement Warrant”) evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant and
reasonably satisfactory to the Holder reflecting the adjustments required so as to preserve the value of the Warrant applicable at
the Closing of the transaction, by the terms of the Replacement Warrant.  The Replacement Warrant shall be
8
exercisable for such number of shares of common stock or other securities of the Acquiring Entity as the Holder would have had
the right to receive upon such Organic Change by a holder of the number of shares of Warrant Stock that such Holder would
have been entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the effective
date of such Organic Change without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation.  The Company shall give the Holder written
notice of such Organic Change at least twenty (20) days prior to the closing and consummation of such Organic Change (and
shall give notice of record date pursuant to section 6(a)).
(ii)                                  Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change unless not required as contemplated in subsection
(i) above, the Company shall make appropriate provision (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder) to ensure
that the Holder will thereafter have the right to acquire and receive in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the shares of
Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant, such shares of stock,
securities or assets that would have been issued or payable in such Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the
number of shares of Common Stock that would have been acquirable and receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant as of the
date of such Organic Change without regard to any Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
e.                                       Warrant Price Adjustment.  Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever the number of shares of
Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant is adjusted, as herein provided, the Warrant Price payable upon the
exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted to that price determined by multiplying the Warrant Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of
this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Warrant
Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant immediately thereafter.
f.                                        Par Value.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5, if, as a result of an
adjustment pursuant to Section 5, the par value per share of Common Stock would be greater than the Warrant Price, then the
Warrant Price shall be an amount equal to the par value per share of the Common Stock but the number of shares the holder of
this Warrant shall be entitled to purchase shall be such greater number of shares of Common Stock as would have resulted from
the Warrant Price that, absent such limitation, would have been in effect pursuant to this Section 5.
g.                                       Certain Shares Excluded. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time for
purposes of the adjustments set forth in this Section 5 shall exclude any shares then directly or indirectly held in the treasury of
the Company.
h.                                      Deferral and Cumulation of De Minimis Adjustments.  The Company shall not be required to make any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 5 if the amount of such adjustment would be less than one percent (1%) of the Warrant
Price in effect immediately before the event that would otherwise have given rise to such adjustment.  In
9
such case, however, any adjustment that would otherwise have been required to be made shall be made at the time of and
together with the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall
amount to not less than one percent (1%) of the Warrant Price in effect immediately before the event giving rise to such next
subsequent adjustment.
i.                                          Duration of Adjustment.  Following each computation or readjustment as provided in this Section 5, the
new adjusted Warrant Price and number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall remain in
effect until a further computation or readjustment thereof is required.
6.                                      Notice to Holders.
a.                                      Notice of Record Date.  In case:
(i)                                     the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the
time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend (other than a cash
dividend) or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities,
or to receive any other right;
(ii)                                  of any Organic Change; or
(iii)                               of any voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the Holder hereof at the time outstanding a notice
specifying, as the case may be, (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the date on which such Organic Change,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any, is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of
Common Stock (or such stock or securities at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) shall be entitled to
exchange their shares of Common Stock (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution or winding-up.  Such notice shall be mailed at
least ten (10) days prior to the record date therein specified, or if no record date shall have been specified therein, at least ten
(10) days prior to such specified date, provided, however, failure to provide any such notice shall not affect the validity of such
transaction.
b.                                      Certificate of Adjustment. Whenever any adjustment shall be made pursuant to Section 5 hereof, the
Company shall promptly make a certificate signed by its Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer or Treasurer, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment,
the method by which such adjustment was calculated and the Warrant Price and number of shares of Warrant Stock purchasable
upon exercise of this Warrant after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall promptly cause copies of such certificates to be
mailed (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to the Holder of this Warrant.
10
7.                                      Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation.  If this Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, upon receipt
by the Company, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnity in customary form or, in the case of mutilation, upon
surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will execute and deliver in lieu thereof, without expense to the Holder, a
new Warrant of like denomination and tenor dated the date hereof.
8.                                      Warrant Holder Not a Stockholder.  The Holder of this Warrant, as such, shall not be entitled by reason of
this Warrant to any voting or other rights whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company.
9.                                      Notices.  All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly

10.                               Choice of Law.  This Warrant and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws principles of the
State of New York.
11.                               Jurisdiction and Venue.  Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Warrant brought by the other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any New
York State or federal court sitting in The City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate
New York State or federal court), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Warrant and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each of the parties agrees not to commence
any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in New York, other than actions in any court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in New York as described
herein.  Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.  Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts in New York as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or (iii) this Warrant, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
12.                               Amendment and Waiver.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Warrant and the other
Warrants may be amended and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to
be performed by it, only if the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holder.
13.                               Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc.  If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration
of any right required or granted herein shall not be a Trading Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised
on the next succeeding Trading Day.
14.                               Non-waiver and Expenses.  No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the
part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder’s rights, powers or remedies.  Without
limiting any other provision of this Warrant or the Subscription Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply
with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages
12
to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in
collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.
15.                               Limitation of Liability.  No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise
this Warrant to purchase Warrant Stock, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any
liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is
asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.
16.                               Remedies.  The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of
damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant.  The Company agrees that monetary damages
would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and
hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.
17.                               Successors and Assigns.  Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations
evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and
the successors and permitted assigns of Holder.  The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder
from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Stock.
18.                               Severability.  Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law,
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.
19.                               Warrant Register. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company
for that purpose (the “Warrant Register”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time.  The Company may deem
and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any
distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION
Pershing Gold Corporation
1658 Cole Boulevard
Building 6, Suite 200
Lakewood, Colorado 80401
Attn:  Stephen Alfers, President & CEO
Ladies and Gentlemen:
1.  Subscription.  The undersigned (the “Purchaser”) will purchase the number of units (collectively, the “Units”) of securities of
Pershing Gold Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), set forth on the signature page to this Subscription
Agreement, at a purchase price of $0.34 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of (a) one (1) share (a “Unit Share”) of the
Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and (b) one (1) thirty month warrant (collectively,
the “Warrants” and together with the Units, the Unit Shares and the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the
“Warrant Shares”), the “Securities”) to purchase 0.40 of a share of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price equal to
$0.45 per share, subject to adjustment thereunder (the “Exercise Price”).  The Units are being offered (the “Offering”) by the
Company pursuant to the offering terms set forth in the Company’s Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated July 18,
2014, as may be amended and/or supplemented, from time to time (collectively, the “Memorandum”).
The Units are being offered on a “reasonable efforts, all or none” basis with respect to the minimum of $1,000,000 purchase price
for the Units (the “Minimum Offering”) and thereafter on a “reasonable efforts” basis up to the maximum of $5,000,000 purchase
price for the Units (the “Maximum Offering”). The Units will be offered for sale until the earlier of (i) the date upon which
subscriptions for the Maximum Offering offered hereunder have been accepted, (ii) August 1, 2014 (subject to the right of the
Company and the Placement Agent to extend the offering until September 15, 2014 without further notice to investors) or (iii) the
date upon which the Company and the Placement Agent elect to terminate the Offering (the “Termination Date”).
The Company may hold an initial closing (“Initial Closing”) at any time after the receipt of accepted subscriptions for the
Minimum Offering.  After the Initial Closing, subsequent closings with respect to additional Securities may take place at any time
prior to the Termination Date as determined by the Company, with respect to subscriptions accepted prior to the Termination
Date (each such closing, together with the Initial Closing, being referred to as a “Closing”).  The last Closing of the Offering,
occurring on or prior to the Termination Date, shall be referred to as the “Final Closing”.  Any subscription documents or funds
received after the Final Closing will be returned, without interest or deduction.  In the event that any Closing does not occur prior
to the
Termination Date, all amounts paid by the Purchaser shall be returned to the Purchaser, without interest or deduction.
Subscriptions for investment below the minimum investment may be accepted at the discretion of the Placement Agent and the
Company.  The Company reserves the right (but is not obligated) to have its employees, agents, officers, directors and affiliates
purchase Units in the Offering and all such purchases will be counted towards the Minimum Offering and the Maximum Offering.
The terms of the Offering are more completely described in the Memorandum and such terms are incorporated herein in their
entirety.  Certain capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, will have the respective meanings provided in the
Memorandum.
2.                                      Payment.  The Purchaser encloses herewith a check payable to, or will immediately make a wire transfer
payment to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the wire instructions as provided herein in the full amount of the purchase price of the
Units being subscribed for.  Together with the check for, or wire transfer of, the full purchase price, the Purchaser is delivering a
completed and executed Signature Page to this Subscription Agreement along with a completed and executed Accredited
Investor Certification, which are annexed hereto.  By executing this Subscription Agreement, you will be deemed to have
executed the Unit Purchase Agreement (Exhibit D to the Memorandum) and the Registration Rights Agreement
(Exhibit C to the Memorandum), and agreed to the terms of the Warrant (Exhibit B to the Memorandum) and all exhibits,
supplements and schedules thereto, as such may be amended from time to time (collectively the “Transaction
Documents”), each of which are attached to the Memorandum, and will be treated for all purposes as if you did review,
approve and execute, if required, each such Transaction Document even though you may not have physically signed the
signature pages to such documents.
3.                                      Deposit of Funds.  All payments made as provided in Section 2 hereof will be deposited by the Purchaser
as soon as practicable with the Escrow Agent in a non-interest bearing escrow account (the “Escrow Account”).  In the event
that the Company does not effect a Closing during the Offering Period, the Escrow Agent will refund all subscription funds,
without deduction and/or interest accrued thereon, and will return the subscription documents to each Purchaser.  If the
Company or the Placement Agent rejects a subscription, either in whole or in part (at the sole discretion of the Company or the
Placement Agent), the rejected subscription funds or the rejected portion thereof will be returned promptly to such Purchaser
without interest, penalty, expense or deduction.
4.                                      Acceptance of Subscription.  The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company or the Placement
Agent, each in its sole discretion, reserves the right to accept this or any other subscription for the Units, in whole or in part,
notwithstanding prior receipt by the Purchaser of notice of acceptance of this or any other subscription.  The Company will have
no obligation hereunder until the Company executes and delivers to the Purchaser an executed copy of the Purchase
Agreement.  If Purchaser’s subscription is rejected in whole (at the sole discretion of the Company or the Placement Agent), the
Offering is terminated or the Minimum Offering is not subscribed for and accepted prior to the Termination Date, all funds
received from the Purchaser will be
returned without interest, penalty, expense or deduction, and this Subscription Agreement will thereafter be of no further force or
effect.  If Purchaser’s subscription is rejected in part (at the sole discretion of the Company or the Placement Agent) and the
Company accepts the portion not so rejected, the funds for the rejected portion of such subscription will be returned without
interest, penalty, expense or deduction, and this Subscription Agreement will continue in full force and effect to the extent such
subscription was accepted. The Purchaser may revoke its subscription and obtain a return of the subscription amount paid to the
Escrow Account at any time before the date of the Initial Closing.  The Purchaser may not revoke this subscription or obtain a
return of the subscription amount paid to the Escrow Agent on or after the date of the Initial Closing.  Any subscription received
after the Initial Closing but prior to the Termination Date shall be irrevocable.
5.                                      Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser.  The Purchaser hereby acknowledges, represents,
warrants, and agrees as follows:
(a)                                 None of the Securities are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or
any state securities laws.  The Purchaser understands that the offering and sale of the Securities is intended to be exempt from
registration under the Securities Act, by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and the provisions of Regulation D promulgated
thereunder, based, in part, upon the representations, warranties and agreements of the Purchaser contained in this Subscription
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement;
(b)                                 The Purchaser and the Purchaser’s attorney, accountant, purchaser representative and/or tax advisor, if any

of the Transaction Documents and all other documents requested by the Purchaser or its Advisors, if any, and understand the
information contained therein, prior to the execution of this Subscription Agreement;
(c)                                  Neither the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) nor any state securities
commission has approved or disapproved of the Securities or passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or confirmed
the accuracy or determined the adequacy of the Memorandum.  The Memorandum has not been reviewed by any Federal, state
or other regulatory authority.  Any representation to the contrary may be a criminal offense;
(d)                                 All documents, records, and books pertaining to the investment in the Securities including, but not limited to,
all information regarding the Company and the Securities, have been made available for inspection and reviewed by the
Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;
(e)                                  The Purchaser and its Advisors, if any, have had a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive
answers from the Company’s officers and any other persons authorized by the Company to answer such questions, concerning,
among other related matters, the Offering, the Securities, the Transaction Documents and the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of the Company and all
such questions have been answered by the Company to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;
(f)                                   In evaluating the suitability of an investment in the Company, the Purchaser has not relied upon any
representation or other information (oral or written) other than as stated in the Memorandum;
(g)                                  The Purchaser is unaware of, is in no way relying on, and did not become aware of the offering of the
Securities through or as a result of, any form of general solicitation or general advertising including, without limitation, any article,
notice, advertisement or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over
television, radio or over the Internet, in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities and is not subscribing for the
Securities and did not become aware of the Offering through or as a result of any seminar or meeting to which the Purchaser
was invited by, or any solicitation of a subscription by, a person not previously known to the Purchaser in connection with
investments in securities generally;
(h)                                 The Purchaser has taken no action which would give rise to any claim by any person for brokerage
commissions, finders’ fees or the like relating to this Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than fees to be paid by the Company to the Placement Agent, as described in the Memorandum);
(i)                                     The Purchaser, either alone or together with its Advisors, if any, has such knowledge and experience in
financial, tax, and business matters, and, in particular, investments in securities, so as to enable it to utilize the information
made available to it in connection with the Offering to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities and the
Company and to make an informed investment decision with respect thereto;
(j)                                    The Purchaser is not relying on the Company, the Placement Agent or any of their respective employees or
agents with respect to the legal, tax, economic and related considerations of an investment in any of the Securities and the
Purchaser has relied on the advice of, or has consulted with, only its own Advisors;
(k)                                 The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities solely for such Purchaser’s own account for investment and not
with a view to resale or distribution thereof, in whole or in part.  The Purchaser has no agreement or arrangement, formal or
informal, with any person to sell or transfer all or any part of any of the Securities and the Purchaser has no plans to enter into
any such agreement or arrangement;
(l)                                     The Purchaser understands and agrees that purchase of the Securities is a high risk investment and the
Purchaser is able to afford an investment in a speculative venture having the risks and objectives of the Company.  The
Purchaser must bear the substantial economic risks of the investment in the Securities indefinitely because none of the
Securities may be sold, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.  Legends will be placed on the certificates
representing the Unit Shares, the Warrants, and the Warrant Shares to the effect that such
securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and appropriate notations thereof
will be made in the Company’s books;
(m)                             The Purchaser has adequate means of providing for such Purchaser’s current financial needs and foreseeable
contingencies and has no need for liquidity from its investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time;
(n)                                 The Purchaser is aware that an investment in the Securities involves a number of very significant risks and
has carefully read and considered the Company’s periodic filings with the Commission, and the matters set forth in the
Memorandum and, in particular, the matters under the caption “Risk Factors” therein and understands any of such risk may
materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and future prospects;
(o)                                 At the time such Purchaser was offered the Securities, it was, and as of the date hereof it is, and on each
date on which it exercises any Warrants, it will be an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a),
promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act and has truthfully and accurately completed the Purchaser
Questionnaire attached to this Subscription Agreement and will submit to the Company such further assurances of such status
as may be reasonably requested by the Company;
(p)                                 The Purchaser: (i) if a natural person, represents that the Purchaser has reached the age of 21 and has full
power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates and to
carry out the provisions hereof and thereof; (ii) if a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, or association, joint
stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity, represents that such entity was not formed for the specific
purpose of acquiring the Securities, such entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its organization, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is authorized by, and will not result in a
violation of state law or its charter or other organizational documents, such entity has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates and to carry out the provisions hereof and
thereof and to purchase and hold the Securities, the execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary action, this Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such entity
and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such entity; or (iii) if executing this Subscription Agreement in a representative or
fiduciary capacity, represents that it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement in such
capacity and on behalf of the subscribing individual, ward, partnership, trust, estate, corporation, or limited liability company or
partnership, or other entity for whom the Purchaser is executing this Subscription Agreement, and such individual, partnership,
ward, trust, estate, corporation, or limited liability company or partnership, or other entity has full right and power to perform
pursuant to this Subscription Agreement and make an investment in the Company, and represents that this Subscription
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such entity.  The execution and delivery of this Subscription
Agreement will not violate or be in conflict with any order, judgment, injunction, agreement or controlling document to which the
Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound;
(q)                                 The Purchaer hereby acknowledges receipt and careful review of this Agreement, the Memorandum, the Unit
Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Warrant and all other exhibits, annexes and appendices thereto
(collectively referred to as the “Offering Materials”), and has had access to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the
exhibits thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the “Form 10-K”) and all subsequent periodic and current reports
filed with the Commission as publicly filed with and available at the website of the Commission which can be accessed at
www.sec.gov, and hereby represents that the Purchaser has been furnished by the Company during the course of the Offering
with all information regarding the Company, the terms and conditions of the Offering and any additional information that the
Purchaser has requested or desired to know, has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
duly authorized officers or other representatives of the Company concerning the Company and has been provided any such
additional information by the Company in writing to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser, if any;
(r)                                    The Purchaser represents to the Company that any information which the undersigned has heretofore
furnished or is furnishing herewith to the Company is complete and accurate and may be relied upon by the Company in
determining the availability of an exemption from registration under Federal and state securities laws in connection with the
offering of securities as described in the Memorandum;
(s)                                   The Purchaser has significant prior investment experience, including investment in non-listed and
unregistered securities.  The Purchaser has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the Company in the
event such a loss should occur.  The Purchaser’s overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is not
excessive in view of the Purchaser’s net worth and financial circumstances and the purchase of the Securities will not cause
such commitment to become excessive.  This investment is a suitable one for the Purchaser;
(t)                                    The Purchaser is satisfied that it has received adequate information with respect to all matters which it or
its Advisors, if any, consider material to its decision to make this investment;
(u)                                 The Purchaser acknowledges that any and all estimates or forward-looking statements or projections
included in the Memorandum were prepared by the Company in good faith, but that the attainment of any such projections,
estimates or forward-looking statements cannot be guaranteed, will not be updated by the Company and should not be relied
upon;
(v)                                 No oral or written representations have been made, or oral or written information furnished, to the Purchaser
or its Advisors, if any, in connection with the offering of the Securities which are in any way inconsistent with the information
contained in the Memorandum;
(w)                               Within five (5) days after receipt of a request from the Company, the Purchaser will provide such information
and deliver such documents as may reasonably be necessary to comply with any and all laws and ordinances to which the
Company is subject;
(x)                                 THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES AND ARE BEING OFFERED AND SOLD IN RELIANCE ON
EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SAID ACT AND SUCH LAWS.  THE SECURITIES ARE
SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD
EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER SAID ACT AND SUCH LAWS PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION
THEREFROM.  THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE COMMISSION, ANY STATE
SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, NOR HAVE ANY OF THE FOREGOING
AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THIS OFFERING OR THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY
OF THE MEMORANDUM.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNLAWFUL;
(y)                                 In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of Company and the terms
of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.  Investors should be aware that they will be required to bear the financial
risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time;
(z)                                  (For ERISA plans only)    The fiduciary of the ERISA plan (the “Plan”) represents that such fiduciary has
been informed of and understands the Company’s investment objectives, policies and strategies, and that the decision to invest
“plan assets” (as such term is defined in ERISA) in the Company is consistent with the provisions of ERISA that require

Agreement by and between the Company, the Placement Agent and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agreement”) including,
without limitation, taking any action on behalf of, or at the instruction of, the Purchaser and executing any release notices
required under the Escrow Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Placement Agent may deem
necessary or advisable (and lawful) to accomplish the purposes hereof.  All acts done under the foregoing authorization are
hereby ratified and approved and neither the Placement Agent nor any designee nor agent thereof shall be liable for any acts of

misconduct.  This power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable while the Escrow Agreement remains in

and neither used by the Purchaser for the Purchaser’s personal benefit (other than in connection with this subscription) nor
disclosed to any third party for any reason, notwithstanding that a Purchaser’s subscription may not be accepted by the
Company; provided, however, that (a) the Purchaser may disclose such information to its affiliates and advisors who may have a
need for such information in connection with providing advice to the Purchaser with respect to its investment in the Company so
long as such affiliates and advisors have an obligation of confidentiality, and (b) this obligation shall not apply to any such
information that (i) is part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible at the date hereof, (ii) becomes part of the
public knowledge or literature and readily accessible by publication (except as a result of a breach of this provision) or (iii) is
received from third parties without an obligation of confidentiality (except third parties who disclose such information in violation
of any confidentiality agreements or obligations, including, without limitation, any subscription or other similar agreement entered
into with the Company).
(ii)           The Purchaser understands that Rule 144 promulgated under the Act (“Rule 144”) requires, among other conditions, a
minimum holding period of six-months prior to the resale of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy
the registration requirements under the Act. The Purchaser understands and hereby acknowledges that the Company is under no
obligation to register the Securities under the Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws or to assist the Purchaser in obtaining
an exemption from various registration requirements, other than as set forth herein.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS
The USA PATRIOT Act
The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to
detect, deter, and punish terrorists in
the United States and abroad. The Act
imposes new anti-money laundering
requirements on brokerage firms and
financial institutions. Since April 24,
2002 all brokerage firms have been
required to have new, comprehensive
anti-money laundering programs.
To help you understand theses efforts,
we want to provide you with some
information about money laundering and
our steps to implement the USA
PATRIOT Act.
What is money
laundering?
How big is the problem 
and why is it important?
Money laundering is the process of
disguising illegally obtained money so
that the funds appear to come from
legitimate sources or activities. Money
laundering occurs in connection with a
wide variety of crimes, including illegal
arms sales, drug trafficking, robbery,
fraud, racketeering, and terrorism.
The use of the U.S. financial system by
criminals to facilitate terrorism or other
crimes could well taint our financial
markets. According to the U.S. State
Department, one recent estimate puts the
amount of worldwide money laundering
activity at $1 trillion a year.
What are we required to do to eliminate money laundering?
Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT Act, our anti-money laundering program must designate a special compliance
officer, set up employee training, conduct independent audits, and establish policies and procedures to detect and report
suspicious transaction and ensure compliance with the new laws.
As part of our required program, we may ask you to provide various identification documents or other information. Until you
provide the information or documents we need, we may not be able to effect any transactions for you.

2
documents, including, but not limited to the Charter Documents (as defined below). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, as the case may be, would not result in a direct and/or indirect (i) material adverse effect on the legality, validity
or enforceability of any of the Securities and/or this Agreement, (ii) material adverse effect on the results of operations, assets,
business, condition (financial and other) or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) material
adverse effect on the Company’s ability to perform in any material respect on a timely basis its obligations under this
Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, the Memorandum, the Warrant and all exhibits, supplements and schedules thereto, as
such may be amended from time to time (collectively the “Transaction Documents”) (any of (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Material Adverse
Effect”).
3.2                               Capitalization and Voting Rights.  The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as
set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto and all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, (i) there are no outstanding securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which contain any preemptive, redemption or similar provisions, nor is any holder of securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary entitled to preemptive or similar rights arising out of any agreement or understanding with the
Company or any Subsidiary by virtue of any of the Transaction Documents, and there are no contracts, commitments,
understandings or arrangements by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become bound to redeem a security
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any stock appreciation rights or
“phantom stock” plans or agreements or any similar plan or agreement except for its equity incentive plans set forth on Schedule
3.2; and (iii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.2 there are no outstanding options, warrants, agreements, convertible securities,
preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase or acquire, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any

otherwise required by law, there are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of any of the shares of capital stock of the
Company pursuant to the Company’s Charter Documents (as defined below) or other governing documents or any agreement or
other instruments to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound.  All of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and the shares of capital stock of the
Subsidiaries are owned by the Company, free and clear of any mortgages, pledges, liens, claims, charges, encumbrances or
other restrictions (collectively, “Encumbrances”). All of such outstanding capital stock has been issued in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws.  The issuance and sale of the Securities and, upon issuance, the Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”), as contemplated hereby will not obligate the Company to issue
shares of Common Stock or other securities to any other person (other than the Subscribers and the Placement Agent) and
except as set forth in Schedule 3.2 will not result in the adjustment of the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price of any
outstanding security.  The Company is not a party to any outstanding stockholder purchase rights and does not have a “poison
pill” or
3
any similar arrangement in effect giving any person the right to purchase any equity interest in the Company upon the
occurrence of certain events.

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to Transaction Documents
and to perform fully its obligations hereunder and thereunder.  All corporate action on the part of the Company, its directors and
stockholders necessary for the (a) authorization execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents by the Company; and (b) authorization, sale, issuance and delivery of the Securities and upon issuance, the Warrant

accordance with its respective terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and to limitations of public
policy.  The Securities are duly authorized and, when issued and paid for in accordance with the applicable Transaction
Documents, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
restrictions on transfer provided for in the Transaction Documents.  The Warrant Shares, when issued and paid for in accordance
with the terms of the Transaction Documents, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all
Encumbrances imposed by the Company other than restrictions on transfer provided for in the Transaction Documents.  The
Company has reserved a sufficient number of Warrant Shares for issuance upon the exercise of the Warrants, free and clear of
all Encumbrances, except for restrictions on transfer set forth in the Transaction Documents or imposed by applicable securities
laws.  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3 hereto, the issuance and sale of the Securities contemplated hereby will not give rise
to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal on behalf of any person other than the Subscribers.
3.4                               No Conflict; Governmental Consents.

the terms or provisions of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default or give to others any rights

security agreement, trust indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by

imposition of any Encumbrances upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary.

material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder,

names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information and other proprietary rights and processes necessary for its business as
now conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, without any known infringement of the rights of others as described

as set forth in Schedule 3.15, each of the Company and GAC are in compliance with all material terms of each lease or sublease
of real property to which it is a party or is otherwise bound.  Nothing in this Section 3.15, however, shall be deemed to be a
representation or a warranty that any of the Mining Claims contains a discovery of valuable minerals.  The Company has good
and marketable title to the personal property owned by it.

their behalf, has engaged in any form of general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Regulation D under the

3.20                        No Integrated Offering.  Assuming the accuracy of the Subscriber representations and warranties set forth in
Article I hereunder, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, any of their affiliates, and any person acting on their behalf has,
directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security, under circumstances
that would require registration of any of the Securities under the Securities Act or that is likely to cause this offering of the
Securities to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act or any applicable stockholder
approval provisions, including without limitation, under the rules and regulations of any exchange or automated quotation system
on which any of the securities of the Company are listed or designated. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports, none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, their affiliates and any person acting on their behalf, have taken any action or steps referred to in the
preceding sentence that would require registration of any of the Securities under the Securities Act or cause the offering of the
Securities to be integrated with other offerings.
3.21                        Application of Takeover Protections.  The Company has taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render
inapplicable any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement)
or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Company’s Charter Documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or
could become applicable to the Subscriber as a result of the Subscriber and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising
their rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the Securities and the Subscribers’
ownership of the Securities.
3.22                        Taxes.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns

Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and each Subsidiary has paid all taxes pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any
assessments received by any of them or by which any of them are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor or third party except where not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and each
Subsidiary has properly accrued all taxes required to be accrued and/or paid, except where the failure to accrue would not have a

statute of limitations with respect to taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any tax assessment or deficiency.

terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act nor has the Company received any notification that
the SEC is contemplating terminating such registration.  The Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof,
received notice from the OTCQB to the effect that the Company is not in compliance with the rules or regulations of the
OTCQB.  To the Company’s knowledge it is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be,
in compliance with all such rules and regulations of the OTCQB.

Memorandum, the Company confirms that neither it nor, to the Company’s knowledge, any other person acting on its behalf has
provided the Subscriber or its agents or counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute material,
non-public information. The Company understands and confirms that the Subscriber will rely on the foregoing representation in
purchasing the Units. All disclosure in the Transaction Documents is true and correct when considered in the aggregate and
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The press releases
disseminated by the Company during the twelve months preceding the date of this Agreement taken as a whole together with the
SEC Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and when made, not
misleading.

or person acting on its behalf, is currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of
the U.S. Treasury Department (“OFAC”); and the Company will not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the sale of the Units,

financing the activities of any person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions.

Rule 506 under the Securities Act (“Regulation D Securities”), to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of

“Bad Actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act (a “Disqualification Event”), except for
a Disqualification Event covered by Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3). The Company has exercised reasonable care to determine whether
any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualification Event. The Company has complied, to the extent applicable, with its
disclosure obligations under Rule 506(e), and has furnished to the Placement Agent and the Subscriber a copy of any
disclosures provided thereunder.
(b)                                 Other Covered Persons. The Company is not aware of any person that (i) has been or will be paid (directly or
indirectly) remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in connection with the sale of the Securities and (ii) who is subject to a
Disqualification Event.
(c)                                  Notice of Disqualification Events. The Company will notify the Placement Agent in writing of (i) any

IV.                               TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION
4.1                               The Securities will be offered for sale until the earlier of (i) the date upon which subscriptions for the
Maximum Offering offered hereunder have been accepted, (ii) August 1, 2014 (subject to the right of the Company and the
Placement Agent to extend the offering until September 15, 2014 without further notice to investors) or (iii) the date upon which
the Company and the Placement Agent elect to terminate the Offering (the “Termination Date”).  The Offering
11
is being conducted on a “reasonable efforts, all or none” basis with respect to the Minimum Offering and thereafter on a
“reasonable efforts” basis for up to the Maximum Offering.
4.2                               The Company may hold an initial closing (“Initial Closing”) at any time after the receipt of accepted
subscriptions for the Minimum Offering.  After the Initial Closing, subsequent closings with respect to additional Securities may
take place at any time prior to the Termination Date as determined by the Company, with respect to subscriptions accepted prior
to the Termination Date (each such closing, together with the Initial Closing, being referred to as a “Closing”).  The last Closing of
the Offering, occurring on or prior to the Termination Date, shall be referred to as the “Final Closing”.  Any subscription
documents or funds received after the Final Closing will be returned, without interest or deduction.  In the event that an Initial
Closing does not occur prior to the Termination Date, all amounts paid by the Subscriber shall be returned to the Subscriber,
without interest or deduction.  The Subscriber may revoke its subscription and obtain a return of the subscription amount paid to
the Escrow Account at any time before the date of the Initial Closing by providing written notice to the Placement Agent as
identified in the Subscription Agreement, the Company and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 6.1 below. Upon receipt of
a revocation notice from the Subscriber prior to the date of the Initial Closing, all amounts paid by the Subscriber shall be
returned to the Subscriber, without interest or deduction.  The Subscriber may not revoke this subscription or obtain a return of
the subscription amount paid to the Escrow Agent on or after the date of the Initial Closing. Any subscription received after the
Initial Closing but prior to the Termination Date shall be irrevocable.
4.3                               The minimum purchase that may be made by any Subscriber shall be $34,000.  Subscriptions for investment
below the minimum purchase may be accepted at the discretion of the Placement Agent as identified in the Subscription
Agreement and the Company.  The Company and the Placement Agent as identified in the Subscription Agreement reserve the
right to reject any subscription made hereby, in whole or in part, in their sole discretion.  The Company’s agreement with each
Subscriber is a separate agreement and the sale of the Securities to each Subscriber is a separate sale.
4.4                               All funds shall be deposited in the account identified in Section 1.1 hereof.
4.5                               Certificates representing the Securities purchased by the Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement will be
prepared for delivery to the Subscriber as soon as practicable following the Closing (but in no event later than five (5) days after
a Closing) at which such purchase takes place. The Subscriber hereby authorizes and directs the Company to deliver the
certificates representing the Securities purchased by the Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement directly to the Subscriber’s
residential or business or brokerage house address indicated on the signature page hereto.
4.6                               The Company’s agreement with each Subscriber is a separate agreement and the sale of Securities to each
Subscriber is a separate sale.
4.7                               If, on or before the earlier of July 18, 2015 or the date the Company completes the raise of gross proceeds of
$10.0 million in equity or debt financing (including the gross proceeds of the Offering), the Company shall issue (other than in an
Excepted Issuance) any Common Stock for a price per share (the “New Purchase Price”) that is less than the Unit Purchase
Price,
12
then, and thereafter successively upon each such issuance, the Company shall promptly issue a number of additional shares of
Common Stock to investors in this Offering (the “Additional Shares”) for no additional consideration equal to (a) the number of
Unit Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement, multiplied by a fraction of which (i) the numerator is the Unit Purchase Price
(adjusted pursuant to the next sentence) and (ii) the denominator is the New Purchase Price in effect on the date of calculation,
minus (b) the number of United Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement.  The Unit Purchase Price shall then be
successively reduced to each lower New Purchase Price.
For purposes of this Agreement, “Excepted Issuances” shall mean any proposed sale, transfer or issuance by the Company of
its Common Stock in connection with (A) full or partial consideration in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or
purchase or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof), (B) full or partial consideration in
connection with a strategic supply, sale, license or joint venture or other partnering arrangements not for the primary purpose of
raising capital, (C), the conversion of the Company’s Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, the exercise of existing options,
warrants or rights to purchase Common Stock or common stock equivalents, or the grant of new options or warrants or common
stock to employees, directors, officer or consultants of the Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, no additional Warrants or Warrant Shares shall be issued, and there shall be no change or
adjustment in the Warrant exercise price as the result of the issuance of Common Stock for a New Purchase Price.

VI.                               COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY
6.1                               Transfer Restrictions.
(a)                                 The Securities may only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws.  In connection
with any transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, to the
14
Company or to an affiliate of a Subscriber or in connection with, the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the
Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance
of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of
such transferred Securities under the Securities Act.  As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement, and shall have the rights of a Subscriber under this Agreement.
(b)                                 The Subscriber agrees to the imprinting of a legend on the Securities substantially in the following form until
the Securities have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act that has been declared
effective or an exemption thereunder:
[NEITHER] THIS SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THIS SECURITY IS [EXERCISABLE] HAS [NOT] BEEN
REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY
STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL
OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE
REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.  THIS SECURITY [AN THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON [EXERCISE]
OF THIS SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN
SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.
(c)                                  Certificates evidencing the Common Stock shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in
Section 6.1(b) hereof):  (i)  following any sale of such Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement covering the
resale of such security under the Securities Act, or (ii) following any sale of such Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if
such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and
pronouncements issued by the staff of the SEC). The Company shall cause its counsel, at the Company’s expense, to issue a
legal opinion to the Company’s transfer agent promptly (but in no event later then the requisite share delivery date set forth in the
Warrants) if required by the Company’s transfer agent to effect the removal of the legend if one of the preceding events has
occurred and as permitted by law.
6.2                               Listing of Securities.  The Company agrees, (i) if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded on
any other trading market, it will include in such application the shares of Common Stock and Warrant Shares, and will take such
other action as is necessary or desirable to cause the shares of Common Stock and Warrant Shares to be listed on such other
trading market as promptly as possible, and (ii) it will take all action reasonably necessary to
15
continue the listing and trading of its Common Stock on a trading market and will comply in all material respects with the
Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the trading market.
6.3                               Reservation of Warrant Shares.  The Company shall at all times while the Warrants are outstanding maintain
a reserve from its duly authorized shares of Common Stock of a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to allow for the
issuance of the Warrant Shares.
6.4                               Replacement of Securities.  If any certificate or instrument evidencing any of the Securities is mutilated, lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation
thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested.  The
applicants for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs
associated with the issuance of such replacement securities.  If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any
securities is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Company may require delivery of such mutilated certificate or instrument
as a condition precedent to any issuance of a replacement.
6.5                               Furnishing of Information.  Until the time that no Subscriber owns Securities, the Company covenants to
maintain the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to timely file (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the
date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act.  As long as Subscriber owns Securities, if the Company is not required to file reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to Subscriber and make publicly available in accordance with
Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the Subscribers to sell the Securities under Rule 144.  The Company further
covenants that it will take such further action as any holder of Securities may reasonably request, to the extent required from
time to time to enable such person to sell such Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the requirements of
the exemption provided by Rule 144.
6.6                               Securities Laws; Publicity.  The Company shall, by 8:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth trading day
immediately following a Closing hereunder, issue a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the material terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby and including the Transaction Documents as exhibits thereto to the extent required by law.  The Company
shall not publicly disclose the name of Subscriber, or include the name of any Subscriber in any filing with the SEC or any
regulatory agency or trading market, without the prior written consent of Subscriber, except: (a) as required by federal securities
law in connection with the filing of final Transaction Documents (including signature pages thereto) with the SEC and (b) to the
extent such disclosure is required by law, in which case the Company shall provide the Subscriber with prior notice of such
disclosure permitted under this clause (b).
6.7                               Form D; Blue Sky Filings.  The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with respect to the Securities as
required under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and to provide a copy thereof, promptly upon request of the
Subscriber.  The Company shall take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an
16
exemption for, or to qualify the Securities for, sale to the Subscriber at the Closing under applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws
of the states of the United States, and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Subscriber.
6.8                               Equal Treatment of Subscribers.  No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document)
shall be offered or paid to any person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of any of the Transaction
Documents unless the same consideration is also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents.
6.9                               Indemnification.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Subscriber, its affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and
against , any and all loss, liability, damage or deficiency suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by the Company made in this Agreement or, after any applicable notice and/or cure
periods, nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company under this Agreement or
other Transaction Documents; and will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Parties for all expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel) as incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or
threatened claim related to or arising in any manner out of any of the foregoing, or any action or proceeding arising therefrom
(collectively, “Proceedings”), whether or not such Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such Proceeding (unless such action
is based upon a breach of such Subscriber’s representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents or any
agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such stockholder or any violations by such  Subscriber of
state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Subscriber which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct
or malfeasance).  If any action shall be brought against any Subscriber in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
this Agreement, such Subscriber shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber.  Any Subscriber shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Subscriber except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and
to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on any material issue
between the position of the Company and the position of such Subscriber, in which case the Company shall be responsible for
the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel.  The Company will not be liable to any
Subscriber under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a Subscriber effected without the Company’s prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or
liability is attributable to any Subscriber’s breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction
Documents or any agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such stockholder or any violations by
such Subscriber of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Subscriber which constitutes fraud, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or malfeasance.  The indemnification required by this Section 6.9 shall be made by periodic payments of the
amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred.  The indemnity
agreements contained
17
herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Subscriber against the Company or others and any
liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.
(a)                                 If for any reason (other than a final non-appealable judgment finding any Indemnified Party liable for losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for its gross negligence or willful misconduct) the foregoing indemnity is unavailable to
an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid
or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Advisor on the other, but
also the relative fault by the Company and the Indemnified Party, as well as any relevant equitable considerations.
6.10                        Non-Public Information.  Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other person acting on
its behalf, will provide Subscriber or its agents or counsel with any information that the Company believes constitutes material
non-public information.  The Company understands and confirms that Subscriber shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in
effecting transactions in securities of the Company.
6.11                        Use of Proceeds.  Except as set forth on Schedule 6.11 attached hereto, the Company shall use the net
proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder for working capital purposes and shall not use such proceeds for: (a) the
satisfaction of any portion of the Company’s debt (other than payment of trade payables in the ordinary course of the Company’s
business and prior practices), (b) the redemption of any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents or (c) the payment for
expenses connected with any investigations or potential ligation or ligation and/or any settlement of any litigation.
6.12                        DTC.  In the event that while any of the Securities are outstanding, (i) the Company does not use a transfer
agent that is a member participant of the Depository Trust Company Automated  Securities Transfer Program  and/or (ii) the
Company’s Common Stock is not at all times eligible for transfer pursuant to the Depositor Trust Company Automated Transfer
Program (i and ii are referred to as a “DTC Event”) then  then, in addition to any other rights the Subscribers may have hereunder
or under applicable law, on each monthly anniversary of each such date (if the applicable DTC Event shall not have been cured
by such date) until the applicable DTC Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each Subscriber an amount in cash, as partial
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the
Subscription Agreement and Purchase Agreement. The parties agree that the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable
to an Investor under this Agreement shall be 10% of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by such Investor pursuant to this
Purchase Agreement.  If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages pursuant to this Section in full within seven
days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount
that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Investor, accruing daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are
due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full.

agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such
court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such proceeding.
7.7                               The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.  If any provision of
this Agreement shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in whole
or in part, such provision shall be interpreted so as to remain enforceable to the maximum extent permissible consistent with
applicable law and the remaining conditions and provisions or portions thereof shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
and enforceable to the extent they are valid, legal and enforceable, and no provisions shall be deemed dependent upon any other
covenant or provision unless so expressed herein.
7.8                               It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate, or
be construed, as a waiver of any subsequent breach by that same party.
7.9                               The Company and Subscriber agree to execute and deliver all such further documents, agreements and
instruments and take such other and further action as may be necessary or appropriate and as permitted by law to carry out the
purposes and intent of this Agreement.
7.10                        This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf”
signature page were an original thereof.
7.11                        Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any rights in any person or entity not a party to
this Agreement.
7.12                        In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of
damages, the Subscriber and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under this Agreement.  The parties agree that
monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations described in
the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.
7.13                        The Company further understands and acknowledges that (i) Subscriber may engage in hedging activities at
various times during the period that the Securities are outstanding, including, without limitation, during the periods that the value
of the Warrant Shares deliverable with respect to Securities are being determined, and (ii) such hedging activities (if any) could
reduce the value of the existing stockholders’ equity interests in the Company at and after the time that the hedging activities
are being conducted.  The Company acknowledges that such aforementioned hedging activities do not constitute a breach of
any of the Transaction Documents.
21
7.14                        In order to discourage frivolous claims the parties agree that unless a claimant in any proceeding arising out of
this Agreement succeeds in establishing his claim and recovering a judgment against another party (regardless of whether such
claimant succeeds against one of the other parties to the action), then the other party shall be entitled to recover from such
claimant all of its/their reasonable legal costs and expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

(a)                                 On or prior to the Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement (the “Automatic Registration Statement”) covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities (and no other
securities other than (i) the 26,578,854 shares of common stock and 10,631,522 shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of warrants as reported in the Current Report on 8-K which was filed by the Company with the Commission on July 9,
2014 and (ii) the 2,461,760 shares of common stock and 984,700 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of
warrants as reported in the Current Report on 8-K which was filed by the Company with the Commission on July 18, 2014) for an
offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. The Automatic Registration Statement required hereunder shall
be on Form S-1 or Form S-3, as applicable, and shall contain substantially the “Plan of Distribution” attached hereto as Annex
A.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Automatic Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event not
later than the Effectiveness Date, and shall use its best efforts to keep the Automatic Registration Statement continuously
effective under the Securities Act until the earlier of (i) the date when all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144  or  (ii) the date when all Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement may be  sold  by non-affiliates of the Company without  volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to
Rule 144 and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under
Rule 144, as determined by counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and
acceptable to the Company’s transfer agent and the Investor (the “Effectiveness Period”). The maximum amount of Registrable
Securities that may be included in the Automatic Registration Statement at any one time shall be limited by Rule 415 as required
by the Commission. In the event that there is a limitation by the Commission on the number of Registrable Securities that may
be included for registration at one time, the Company shall promptly so advise the Investor and use its best efforts to file an
additional Automatic Registration Statement covering such ineligible Registrable Securities, on a pro-rata basis, within 30 days
of the date such securities become eligible and cause such Automatic Registration Statement to be declared effective by the
Commission as soon as reasonably practicable.
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall have the right to delay the filing
of the Registration Statement for a period not in excess of 60 consecutive days and no more than 90 days in any consecutive
12-month period (a “Delay Period”), if the Company is pursuing a public offering of securities and the underwriter recommends a
Delay Period.
4
(c)                                  In the case of an event that causes the Company to suspend the use of a Registration Statement (a
“Suspension Event”), the Company shall give written notice (a “Suspension Notice”) to the Investors to suspend sales of the
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement and such notice shall continue only for so long as the Suspension
Event or its effect is continuing. No Investor shall effect any sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement (or such filings) at any time after it has received a Suspension Notice from the Company and prior to receipt of an
End of Suspension Notice (as defined below) with respect to such Registration Statement.  The Investors may recommence
effecting sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement (or such filings) following further notice to
such effect (an “End of Suspension Notice”) from the Company, which End of Suspension Notice shall be given by the
Company to the Investors in the manner described above promptly following the conclusion of any Suspension Event and its
effect.
(d)                                 If: (i) the Automatic Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to its Filing Date (if the Company files the
Automatic Registration Statement without affording the Holders the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required
by Section 5(a) herein, the Company shall be deemed to have not satisfied this clause (i)), (ii) a Registration Statement
registering for resale all of the Registrable Securities is not declared effective by the Commission by the Effectiveness Date
(unless the reason for such non-registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities is as a result of SEC Guidance
under Rule 415 or similar rule which limits the number of Registrable Securities which may be included in a registration
statement with respect to the Holders), or (iii) after the effective date of a Registration Statement, such Registration Statement
ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective as to all Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement,
or the Investors are otherwise not permitted to utilize the prospectus therein to resell such Registrable Securities, for more than
ten (10) consecutive calendar days or more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days (which need not be consecutive
calendar days) during any 12-month period (any such failure or breach being referred to as an “Event”, and for purposes of
clause (i) and (iv), the date on which such Event occurs, and for purpose of clause (iii) the date on which such ten (10) or fifteen
(15) calendar day period, as applicable, is exceeded being referred to as “Event Date”), then, in addition to any other rights the
Investors may have hereunder or under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of each such
Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date) until the applicable Event is cured, the Company
shall pay to each Investor an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.0% of the aggregate
purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the Subscription Agreement and Purchase Agreement. The parties agree that the
maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to an Investor under this Agreement shall be 15% of the aggregate Purchase
Price paid by such Investor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages
pursuant to this Section in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 18%
per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Investor, accruing daily from
the date such partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The partial
liquidated damages pursuant to the terms hereof shall apply on a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a month prior to the cure
of an Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payments shall be owed (i) to any affiliate of the Company, (ii) with respect to any
period during which all of the holder’s Registrable Shares may be sold by
5
such holder under Rule 144 without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement for
the Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144, or (iii) in circumstances
described in Sections 3(c)
4.                                      Piggyback Registrations.
(a)                                 With respect to any Registrable Securities not otherwise included in the Automatic Registration Statement or
any other Registration Statement as a result of any limitation imposed by the Commission under Rule 415 (the “Excluded
Registrable Securities”), whenever the Company proposes to register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the
Company for other shareholders) any of its securities under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to (i) an Automatic
Registration pursuant to Section 3 hereof or (ii) registration pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any
successor forms thereto), and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Registrable Securities (a
“Piggyback Registration”), the Company will give written notice to the holder of Excluded Securities of its intention to effect
such a registration and will, subject to the provisions of Subsection 4(b) hereof, include in such registration all Excluded
Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein within twenty (20)
days after the receipt of the Company’s notice.
(b)                                 If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Company’s
securities, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested
to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering, the Company will include in such registration a pro rata share of Excluded Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Registration Statement as calculated by dividing the number of Excluded Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Registration Statement by the number of the Company’s securities requested to be included in
such Registration Statement by all selling security holders. In such event, the holder of Excluded Registrable Securities shall
continue to have registration rights under this Agreement with respect to any Excluded Registrable Securities not so included in
such Registration Statement.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after giving a notice of Piggyback Registration and prior to the
effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company shall determine for any
reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each record holder of Excluded Registrable Securities and, following such notice, (i) in the case of a
determination not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Excluded Registrable Securities in connection with
such registration, and (ii) in the case of determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any Excluded
Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in registering such other securities.
5.                                      Registration  Procedures.  If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of any
Registrable Securities under the terms herein, the Company will:

(a)                                 not less than four 4) trading days prior to the filing of each Registration Statement and not less than one
(1) trading day prior to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that
would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), and subject, if appropriate, to the relevant parties’
entry into a customary agreement to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information provided (a “Confidentiality
Agreement”) or the Company may excise any information which would constitute material non-public information regarding the
Company, the Company shall (i) furnish to one counsel on behalf of all sellers of Registrable Securities copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will
be subject to the review of such sellers, and (ii) cause its officers and directors, counsel and independent registered public
accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the sellers of Registrable
Securities, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the above, the
Company shall not be obligated to provide each seller of Registrable Securities advance copies of any universal shelf
registration statement registering securities in addition to those required hereunder, or any Prospectus prepared thereto.  The
Company shall pay a one time fee of $10,000 to the counsel referenced above in Section 5(a)(i), which shall be paid by the
Company at the time such counsel is to review such Registration Statement and in any event prior to the four trading days
referred in the first sentence of this subsection (a).
(b)                                 prepare and file with the Commission the Registration Statement with respect to such securities and use its
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective in an expeditious manner;
(c)                                  (i) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to a
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep a Registration Statement
continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the
Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable
Securities, (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to
the terms of this Agreement), and, as so supplemented or amended, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424, (iii) respond as promptly as
reasonably possible to any comments received from the Commission with respect to a Registration Statement or any
amendment thereto and provide as promptly as reasonably possible to one counsel for all sellers of Registrable Securities true
and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to a Registration Statement (provided that, the
Company may either obtain a Confidentiality Agreement from Investors or excise any information contained therein which would
constitute material non-public information regarding the Company), and (iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance (subject to the terms of
this Agreement) with the intended methods of disposition by each seller of Registrable Securities thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.
7
(d)                                 if during the Effectiveness Period, the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100% of the
number of shares of Common Stock then registered in a Registration Statement, then the Company shall file as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any case prior to the applicable Filing Date, an additional Registration Statement covering the
resale by the Investors of not less than the number of such Registrable Securities.
(e)                                  furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and to each underwriter such number of copies of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus) as such persons reasonably
may request in order to facilitate the intended disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
(f)                                   use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement under the state securities or “blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions as the sellers of Registrable Securities
or, in the case of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter, reasonably shall request, (ii) to prepare and file in
those jurisdictions such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements, and take such other actions, as
may be necessary to maintain such registration and qualification in effect at all times for the period of distribution contemplated
thereby and (iii) to take such further action as may be necessary or advisable to enable the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions, provided, that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to
transact business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of
process in any such jurisdiction;
(g)                                  use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement with any securities exchange on which the common stock of the Company is then listed;
(h)                                 immediately notify each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter under such Registration
Statement, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening
of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of which the Prospectus contained in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing and
promptly amend or supplement such Registration Statement to correct any such untrue statement or omission;
(i)                                     promptly notify each seller of Registrable Securities of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order

reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the
earliest possible time;
(j)                                    if the offering is an underwritten offering, enter into a written agreement with the managing underwriter

business for such an
8
arrangement between such underwriter and companies of the Company’s size and investment stature, including, without
limitation, customary indemnification and contribution provisions;
(k)                                 if the offering is an underwritten offering, at the request of any Investor, furnish to such Investor on the date
that Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such registration: (i) a copy of an opinion, dated
such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the underwriters, stating that

pending or contemplated under the Securities Act, (B) the Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and each amendment
or supplement thereof comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act (except that such
counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements or other financial or statistical information contained therein)

such date from the independent public accountants retained by the Company, addressed to the underwriters, stating that they

accountants, the financial statements of the Company included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
Securities Act, and such letter shall additionally cover such other financial matters (including information as to the period ending
no more than five business days prior to the date of such letter) with respect to such registration as such underwriters
reasonably may request;
(l)                                     take all actions reasonably necessary to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (not
bearing any legend restricting the sale or transfer of such securities) representing the Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant
to the Registration Statement and to enable such certificates to be in such denominations and registered in such names as each
Investor or any underwriters may reasonably request; and
(m)                             take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and facilitate the registration of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.
6.                                      Obligations of Investor.  The Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding such
Investor, the number of Registrable Securities owned and proposed to be sold by it, the intended method of disposition of such
securities and any other information as shall be required to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities, and cooperate
with the Company in preparing the Registration Statement and in complying with the requirements of the Securities Act.  Each
Investor agrees to furnish to the Company a completed questionnaire in the form attached to this Agreement as Annex B (a
“Selling Stockholder Questionnaire”) on a date that is not less than three trading days prior to the Filing.
7.                                      Expenses.
(a)                                 All expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Sections 3, 4 and 5 including, without limitation, all
registration and filing fees (including the fees of the
9
Commission and any other regulatory body with which the Company is required to file), printing expenses, fees and
disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the Company, fees and expenses (including counsel fees)
incurred in connection with complying with state securities or “blue sky” laws, and fees of transfer agents and registrars are
called “Registration Expenses.” All underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the sale of Registrable
Securities are called “Selling Expenses.”
(b)                                 The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any Registration Statement filed
hereunder, and the Selling Expenses in connection with each such Registration Statement shall be borne by the participating
sellers in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities sold by each or as they may otherwise agree.
(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at the request of any Investor, the Company shall employ
its counsel at the Company’s expense to prepare any and all legal opinions necessary for the prompt removal of restrictive
legends from certificates representing Registrable Securities as, when and to the extent such legends may be removed in
compliance with the Securities Act and/or Rule 144.
8.                                      Indemnification and Contribution.
(a)                                 In the event of a registration of any of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless and pay and reimburse, each Investor thereunder, each
underwriter of such Registrable Securities thereunder and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which such Investor, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities
were registered under the Securities Act pursuant hereto or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged
violation of the Securities Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws and will reimburse each such Investor, each such
underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, that the Company will not be liable in any
such case if and to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon the Company’s
reliance on an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by any such seller, any such underwriter or any such controlling person in writing specifically for use in
such Registration Statement or prospectus.
(b)                                 In the event of a registration of any of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant hereto,
each seller of such Registrable Securities thereunder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, each officer of the Company
10
who signs the Registration Statement, each director of the Company, each underwriter and each person who controls any
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
the Company or such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
reliance on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration statement under
which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant hereto or any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such officer, director, underwriter and controlling person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability
or action; provided that such seller will be liable hereunder in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining to such seller, as such, furnished in writing to the
Company by such seller specifically for use in such Registration Statement or prospectus; and  provided, further, that  the 
liability  of  each  seller hereunder shall be limited to the proceeds received by such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity provided in this Section 8(b) shall not
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without
the consent of such indemnified party and provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in such Registration Statement, which untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is completely corrected in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement and the undersigned indemnitees thereafter fail to deliver or cause to be delivered such Registration Statement as so
amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities to the person asserting such loss,
claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) or expense after the Company has furnished the undersigned with the
same.
(c)                                  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the
indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to such indemnified party other than under this Section 8 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it
may have to such indemnified party under this Section 8 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by
such omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume
and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense
11
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided that if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded based upon written advice of its counsel that there may be reasonable defenses available to it that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to
conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to
assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such
separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred.
(d)                                 In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in
which either (i) any holder of Registrable Securities exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such
holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final
judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of
appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 8 provides for
indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling holder
or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 8; then, and in each
such case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they
may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented
by the percentage that the public offering price of its Registrable Securities offered by the Registration statement bears to the
public offering price of all securities offered by such Registration statement, and the Company is responsible for the remaining
portion; provided, that, in any such case, (A) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public
offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered by it pursuant to such Registration statement and (B) no person or entity
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 12(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution
from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
9.                                      Changes in Capital Stock.  If, and as often as, there is any change in the capital stock of the Company by
way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, or through a merger, consolidation, reorganization or
recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and
privileges granted hereby shall continue as so changed.
10.                               Representations and Warranties of the Company.  The Company represents and warrants to the Investor as
follows:
(a)                                 The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate action and will not violate any provision of law, any order of any court or other agency of government, the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which it
or any or its properties or assets is bound, conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any such indenture,
12
agreement or other instrument or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature
whatsoever upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.
(b)                                 This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and to general equitable principles and the availability of specific
performance.
11.                               Rule 144 Requirements.  The Company agrees to:
(a)                                 make and keep current public information about the Company available, as those terms are understood and
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;
(b)                                 use its best efforts to file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required
of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting
requirements); and
(c)                                  furnish to any Investor upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to
such reporting requirements), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and (iii) such other reports
and documents of the Company as such holder may reasonably request to avail itself of any similar rule or regulation of the
Commission allowing it to sell any such securities without registration.
12.                               Termination.  All of the Company’s obligations to register Registrable Shares under Sections 3, 4, and 5
hereof shall terminate upon the date on which the Investor holds no Registrable Securities or all of the Registrable Securities are
eligible for resale without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement for the
Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144, as determined by counsel to the
Company pursuant to a written opinion letter to such effect, addressed and acceptable to the Company’s transfer agent and the
Investor.
13.                               Miscellaneous.
(a)                                 All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto (including without limitation
transferees of any Registrable Securities), whether so expressed or not.
(b)                                 All notices, requests, consents and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered

furnished, in writing to the Company or its counsel (in the case of a holder of Registrable Securities) or to the holders of
Registrable Securities (in the case of the Company) in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.  Any notice or other
communication or deliveries hereunder shall be deemed given and effective upon actual receipt by the party to whom such
notice is required to be given.
(c)                                  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, without giving

ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT OR
AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
(d)                                 In the event of a breach by the Company or by the Investor, of any of their obligations under this Agreement,
the Investor or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this
Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The
Company and the Investor agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by
reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for
specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.
(e)                                  This Agreement may not be amended or modified without the written consent of the Company and the
Investor.
(f)                                   Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in

and signed by the party granting the waiver.

each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement, once executed by a party, may be delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile transmission or sent by electronic
mail of a copy of this Agreement bearing the signature of the party so delivering this Agreement.
14
(h)                                 If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision and shall not in any manner affect or render illegal, invalid or
unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be carried out as if any such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision were not contained herein.
(i)                                     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Company and the Investor relative to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior agreements, understandings and discussions with respect
thereto.

Form of
Plan of Distribution
Annex A
Each Selling Stockholder (the “Selling Stockholders”) of the securities and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-
interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on the OTCQB or any other stock exchange,
market or trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions.  These sales may be at fixed or negotiated
prices.  A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:
·                  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;
·                  block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion
of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;
·                  purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;
·                  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;
·                  privately negotiated transactions;
·                  settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part;
·                  in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such
securities at a stipulated price per security;
·                  through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or
otherwise;
·                  a combination of any such methods of sale; or
·                  any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), if available, rather than under this prospectus.
Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales.  Broker-dealers
may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of
securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the
case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in
the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.
17
In connection with the sale of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions
with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of
hedging the positions they assume.  The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close
out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities.  The Selling
Stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or
more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by
this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as
supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).
The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be
“underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.  In such event, any commissions received
by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be
underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.  Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it
does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities.
In no event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent
(8%).
The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the
securities.  The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject
to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder.  In addition, any securities covered
by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than
under this prospectus. The Selling Stockholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in
connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholders.
We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling
Stockholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without
the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act
or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect.  The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or
dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may
not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or
qualification requirement is available and is complied with.
18
Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities
may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted
period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution.  In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be
subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which
may limit the timing of purchases and sales of securities of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other
person.  We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to
deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172
under the Securities Act).

Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Subscription Agreements, Share Purchase Agreements and Registration Rights Agreements
On October 15, 2014, Pershing Gold Corporation (the “Company”) entered into Share Purchase
Agreements and Subscription Agreements with Levon Resources Ltd. (“Levon”) and Barry Honig. Mr.
Honig is a Director of the Company and owns approximately 16.8% of the Company’s outstanding
common stock following the transactions reported in this Form 8-K. The Share Purchase Agreements and
Subscription Agreements provided for the sale to Levon of 35,178,572 shares of the Company’s Common
Stock for $0.28 per share, or $9,850,000 in the aggregate, and the sale to Barry Honig of 535,715 shares
of the Company’s Common Stock for $0.28 per share, or $150,000 in the aggregate. The transaction was
completed and the shares issued on October 20, 2014. The gross proceeds to the Company totaled $10.0
million, and the net proceeds, after commissions and before legal and other costs, totaled $9.9 million.
The Share Purchase Agreements contain customary terms and conditions including, among other things,
customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company, closing deliverables and
indemnifications. The Subscription Agreements contain customary terms and conditions including, among
other things, terms of the subscription, representations and warranties by each investor, and
indemnification.
In connection with the private placement, the Company and the investors entered into registration rights
agreements dated October 15, 2014 (the “Registration Rights Agreements”) which require the Company to
file within 45 days following the closing a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, to register the resale of the Common Stock issued in the private placement. The Registration
Rights Agreement also contains piggyback registration rights requiring the Company to include such
holders’ shares of Common Stock in future registration statements that may be filed by the Company.
The foregoing summary of the terms of the Share Purchase Agreements, the Subscription Agreements,
and the Registration Rights Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the form of the Share Purchase Agreement, Subscription Agreement and Registration Rights
Agreement that are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K
and incorporated herein by reference.
On October 15, Mr. Honig entered into agreements with Levon pursuant to which he acquired 8,750,000
common shares of Levon for Canadian $0.22 per share, or $1.75 million in the aggregate. Mr. Honig’s
acquisition was part of a $5.4 million placement of Levon common shares. Other investors in the Levon
private placement include Dr. Philip Frost, who owns approximately 15.3% of the Company’s outstanding
common stock following the transaction reported in this Form 8-K. Levon reported that it planned to use
the proceeds of this placement to fund its purchase of the Company’s Common Stock in the private
placement described in this Form 8-K. Mr. Honig’s percentage ownership of Levon is 3.85%, and he is not
an officer or director of Levon.
Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts are U.S. dollars.
Item 3.02Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
The information provided in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the private placement, the Company issued 35,714,287 shares of Common Stock for
aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million after
commissions. A FINRA broker-dealer acted on behalf of the Company and will be paid aggregate cash
commissions of $100,000.
The Company relied on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act,
Regulation S and Rule 506 of Regulation D for purposes of the private placement.
Item 3.03Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders
The information provided in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company has determined that the private placement of Common Stock reported in this Form 8-K
constitutes a “Dilutive Issuance” as defined in Section 7.1(b) of the Certificate of Designation for the
Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”). Therefore, as a result of the private
placement, the Conversion Price for the Series E Preferred Stock has been reduced effective October 20,
2014 from $0.33 to $0.28 per share of Series E Preferred Stock (the “Adjusted Conversion Price”).
Following this adjustment, each share of Series E Preferred Stock will be convertible into the number of
shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the Series E Original Issue Price (as defined in the
Certificate of Designation), which is $990, by the Adjusted Conversion Price, or approximately 3,535.714
shares of Common Stock; prior to the adjustment, each share of Series E Preferred Stock was convertible
into 3,000 shares of Common Stock. A total of 9,425 shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, and as a result of the adjustment, the Series E Preferred Stock is convertible into
approximately 33,324,107 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, compared to 28,275,000 shares of
Common Stock prior to the adjustment. Mr. Honig beneficially holds 7,028 shares of Series E Preferred
Stock and Mr. Stephen Alfers, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company owns
100 shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), the number of shares (collectively, the “Shares”) of
the Company’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), set forth on the

M.D.T., on the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations
of the parties set forth herein and in the other Transaction Documents (other than such conditions as may,
by their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date), or at such other place or at such
other time or on such other date as the Company and the Purchaser mutually agree in writing. The day on
which the Closing takes place is referred to as the “Closing Date.”      Certain capitalized terms used, but
not otherwise defined herein, will have the respective meanings provided in the Share Purchase

5.            Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges,
represents, warrants, and agrees as follows:
(a)          None of the Shares have been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), or any applicable state securities laws. The Purchaser understands that
the offering and sale of the Shares is intended to be exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder,
and/or excluded from such registration requirements pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S promulgated
thereunder, based, in part, upon the representations, warranties and agreements of the Purchaser
contained in this Subscription Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement;
(b)          The Purchaser and the Purchaser’s attorney, accountant, purchaser representative and/or tax
advisor, if any (collectively, “Advisors”), have received and have carefully reviewed this Subscription
Agreement, and each of the Transaction Documents and all other documents requested by the Purchaser
or its Advisors, if any, and understand the information contained therein, prior to the execution of this
Subscription Agreement;
(c)          All documents, records, and books pertaining to the investment in the Shares including, but not
limited to, all information regarding the Company and the Shares, have been made available for
inspection and reviewed by the Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;
(d)          The Purchaser hereby acknowledges receipt and careful review of this Agreement, the Share
Purchase Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, and all exhibits, annexes and appendices
thereto, and has had access to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits thereto for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the “Form 10-K”) and all subsequent periodic and current
reports filed with the Commission as publicly filed with and available at the website of the Commission
which can be accessed at www.sec.gov, and hereby represents that the Purchaser has been furnished by
the Company during the course of the Offering with all information regarding the Company, the terms and
conditions of the Offering and any additional information that the Purchaser or its Advisors have requested
or desired to know, and the Purchaser and its Advisors, if any, have had a reasonable opportunity to ask
questions of and receive answers from the Company’s officers and any other persons authorized by the
Company to answer such questions, concerning, among other related matters, the Offering, the Shares,
the Transaction Documents and the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of
the Company and all such questions have been answered by the Company to the full satisfaction of the
Purchaser and its Advisors, if any;
(e)          In evaluating the suitability of an investment in the Company, the Purchaser has not relied upon
any representation or other information (oral or written) other than as stated herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, and the Company’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission;
(f)          The Purchaser is unaware of, is in no way relying on, and did not become aware of the offering of
the Shares through or as a result of, any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as those terms
are used in Rule 502(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) including, without limitation, any article,
notice, advertisement or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or
broadcast over television, radio or over the Internet, in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares
and is not subscribing for the Shares and did not become aware of the Offering through or as a result of
any seminar or meeting to which the Purchaser was invited by, or any solicitation of a subscription by, a
person not previously known to the Purchaser in connection with investments in securities generally;
(g)          The Purchaser has taken no action which would give rise to any claim by any person for
brokerage commissions, finders’ fees or the like relating to this Subscription Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby;
(h)          The Purchaser, either alone or together with its Advisors, if any, has such knowledge and
experience in financial, tax, and business matters, and, in particular, investments in securities, so as to
enable it to utilize the information made available to it in connection with the Offering to evaluate the
merits and risks of an investment in the Shares and the Company and to make an informed investment
decision with respect thereto;
(i)          The Purchaser is not relying on the Company or any of its employees or agents with respect to the
legal, tax, economic and related considerations of an investment in any of the Shares and the Purchaser
has relied on the advice of, or has consulted with, only its own Advisors;
(j)          The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely for such Purchaser’s own account for investment
purposes and not with a view to resale or distribution thereof, in whole or in part. The Purchaser has no
agreement or arrangement, formal or informal, with any person to sell or transfer all or any part of any of
the Shares and the Purchaser has no plans to enter into any such agreement or arrangement; provided
however that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Purchaser from subsequently offering,
selling, pledging, hypothecating, or otherwise transferring or disposing of the Shares, directly or indirectly,
so long as any such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and made in compliance with any applicable securities laws (including
state, local and Canadian securities laws);
(k)          The Purchaser understands and agrees that purchase of the Shares is a high risk investment and
the Purchaser is able to afford an investment in a speculative venture having the risks and objectives of
the Company. The Purchaser must bear the substantial economic risks of the investment in the Shares
indefinitely because none of the Shares may be offered, sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
transferred or disposed of, directly or indirectly, unless (i) subsequently registered under the Securities Act
and any applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration requirements is available
and (ii) such offer, sale, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or disposal complies with Canadian securities
laws. The legend substantially in the form set forth in Section (aa) below will be placed on the certificates
representing the Shares to the effect that such securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities laws, and also as to resale restrictions under applicable Canadian
securities laws, and appropriate notations thereof will be made in the Company’s books;
(l)          The Purchaser has adequate means of providing for such Purchaser’s current financial needs and
foreseeable contingencies and has no need for liquidity from its investment in the Shares for an indefinite
period of time;
(m)          The Purchaser is aware that an investment in the Shares involves a number of very significant
risks and has carefully read and considered the Company's periodic filings with the Commission, and, in
particular, the matters under the caption “Risk Factors” in such filings with the Commission, and
understands any of such risk may materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and future
prospects;
(n)          The Purchaser is eligible to purchase the Shares pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus
requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. The Purchaser has completed and delivered to the
Company the applicable Canadian Accredited Investor Certificate (the form of which is attached to this
Agreement, evidencing the Purchaser’s status under applicable Canadian securities laws) and confirms
the truth and accuracy of all statements made in such certificate as of the date hereof and as of the time of
the applicable Closing;
(o)          The Purchaser represents that: it is an “accredited investor” that meets one or more of the
categories set forth in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and it is purchasing as
principal for its own account and it was not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Shares; it is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization;
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is authorized by, and will not result in a
violation of, state (or equivalent) law or its charter or other organizational documents; it has full power and
authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or
certificates and to carry out the provisions hereof and thereof and to purchase and hold the Shares; the
execution and delivery of this Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action;
and this Subscription Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Purchaser and is
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser. The execution and delivery of this Subscription
Agreement will not violate or be in conflict with any order, judgment, injunction, agreement or controlling
document to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound;
(q)          The Purchaser represents to the Company that any information which the undersigned has
heretofore furnished or is furnishing herewith to the Company is complete and accurate and may be relied
upon by the Company in determining the availability of an exemption or exclusion from registration under
the Securities Act and any state securities laws in connection with the offering of securities as described
herein and in the other Transaction Documents;
(r)          The Purchaser has significant prior investment experience, including investment in non-listed and
unregistered securities. The Purchaser has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment
in the Company in the event such a loss should occur. The Purchaser’s overall commitment to
investments which are not readily marketable is not excessive in view of the Purchaser’s net worth and
financial circumstances and the purchase of the Shares will not cause such commitment to become
excessive. This investment is a suitable one for the Purchaser;
(s)          The Purchaser acknowledges that any and all estimates or forward-looking statements or
projections included in the Company’s filing with the Commission were prepared by the Company in good
faith, but that the attainment of any such projections, estimates or forward-looking statements cannot be
guaranteed, will not be updated by the Company and should not be relied upon;
(t)          No oral or written representations have been made, or oral or written information furnished, to the
Purchaser or its Advisors, if any, in connection with the offering of the Shares other than those set forth
herein or in the other Transaction Documents;
(u)          Within five (5) days after receipt of a request from the Company, the Purchaser will provide such
information and deliver such documents as may reasonably be necessary to comply with any and all laws
and ordinances to which the Company is subject;
(v)         THE SHARES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND ARE BEING OFFERED AND
SOLD IN RELIANCE ON EXEMPTIONS OR EXCLUSIONS FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS. THE SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY AND
RESALE AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, TRANSFERRED OR
DISPOSED OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, EXCEPT PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT, PURSUANT TO TRANSACTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR
PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES
LAWS (INCLUDING STATE, LOCAL OR CANADIAN SECURITIES LAWS). THE SECURITIES HAVE
NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, NOR HAVE ANY OF THE FOREGOING
AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THIS OFFERING. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNLAWFUL;
(w)          In making an investment decision, the Purchaser has relied on its own examination of Company
and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.
(x)          [Reserved]
(y)          The Purchaser has read each of the Transaction Documents in its entirety and all exhibits and
annexes thereto, including, but not limited to, all information relating to the Company and the Shares, and
understands fully to its full satisfaction all information included in such Transaction Documents;
(z)          The Purchaser represents that (i) the Purchaser was contacted regarding the sale of the Shares
by the Company while outside the United States;; (ii) the Purchaser is not a “U.S. person” as defined in
Rule 902 of Regulation S under the Securities Act (“U.S. Person”); (iii) the Purchaser is acquiring the
Shares and has executed (or its authorized signatory has executed) this Agreement outside of the United
States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act; (iv) the purchase of the Shares by the
Purchaser is for the Purchaser’s own account and not for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person or
person in the United States; and (v) the Purchaer hereby agrees not to engage in hedging transactions
with regard to such securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act.
(aa)         The Purchaser consents to the placement of a legend on any certificate or other document
evidencing the Shares that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities or “blue sky” laws and setting forth or referring to the restrictions on transferability and sale
thereof contained in this Agreement. The Purchaser is aware that the Company will make a notation in its
appropriate records with respect to the restrictions on the transferability of such Shares. The legend to be
placed on each certificate shall be in form substantially similar to the following:
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN
OCTOBER 2014 PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”) OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES OR “BLUE SKY LAWS,” AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED,
ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, EXCEPT: (A) TO THE
COMPANY, (B) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER THE ACT; (C)
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, IF AVAILABLE, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY LOCAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS, (D) IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER SUCH ACT, IF
AVAILABLE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR (E) IN
A TRANSACTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND IN THE CASE OF (C), (D)
OR (E) THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OF RECOGNIZED STANDING,
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL, TO SUCH EFFECT.
HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT.”
The above legend may be removed by delivery to the registrar and transfer agent for the Shares and to the
Company of an opinion of counsel, of recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that
such legend is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act.
In addition to the foregoing legend, the following legend (the “Canadian Legend”) shall also be placed on
each certificate issued to Purchaser, in form substantially similar to the following:
“CANADIAN LEGEND: UNLESS PERMITTED UNDER SECURITIES LEGISLATION, THE HOLDER OF
THIS SECURITY MUST NOT TRADE THE SECURITY BEFORE THE DATE THAT IS 4 MONTHS AND
A DAY AFTER THE LATER OF (I) [INSERT THE DISTRIBUTION DATE] AND (II) THE DATE THE
COMPANY BECAME A REPORTING ISSUER IN ANY PROVINCE OR TERRITORY OF CANADA.”
In order to remove the Canadian Legend from the certificates evidencing the Shares, the Company may
require such evidence from the Purchaser, which may include an opinion of Canadian legal counsel, that
is satisfactory to the Company confirming that the Canadian Legend is no longer required to be affixed to
the certificates evidencing the Shares.
(bb)         The Purchaser represents that it is not a FINRA member or an affiliate of a FINRA member firm.
(cc)         The Purchaser agrees not to issue any public statement with respect to the Offering, Purchaser’s
investment or proposed investment in the Company or the terms of any agreement or covenant between it
and the Company without the Company’s prior written consent, except such disclosures as may be
required under applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the
Purchaser’s securities may be traded or quoted.
(dd)         The Purchaser acknowledges that the Shares are not being qualified pursuant to a prospectus
for distribution to the public in Canada under applicable Canadian securities laws and are not freely
tradeable.
(gg)         The Purchaser acknowledges that the terms and conditions of the Offering and the information
contained in the Transaction Documents or otherwise made available to the Purchaser is confidential and
non-public and agrees that all such information shall be kept in confidence by the Purchaser and neither
used by the Purchaser for the Purchaser’s personal benefit (other than in connection with this
subscription) nor disclosed to any third party for any reason, notwithstanding that a Purchaser’s
subscription may not be accepted by the Company; provided, however, that (a) the Purchaser may
disclose such information to its affiliates and advisors who may have a need for such information in
connection with providing advice to the Purchaser with respect to its investment in the Company so long
as such affiliates and advisors have an obligation of confidentiality, and (b) this obligation shall not apply
to any such information that (i) is part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible at the
date hereof, (ii) becomes part of the public knowledge or literature and readily accessible by publication
(except as a result of a breach of this provision) or (iii) is received from third parties without an obligation
of confidentiality (except third parties who disclose such information in violation of any confidentiality
agreements or obligations, including, without limitation, any subscription or other similar agreement
entered into with the Company).
(hh)         The Purchaser understands that Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”)
requires, among other conditions, a minimum holding period of six-months prior to the resale of securities
acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the registration requirements under the
Securities Act. The Purchaser understands and hereby acknowledges that, except as provided in the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is under no obligation to register the Shares under the
Securities Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws or to assist the Purchaser in obtaining an
exemption from various registration requirements, other than as set forth herein.
6.            Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby acknowledges,
represents and warrants to the Purchaser that the Company’s representations in the Share Purchase
Agreement are true and correct as of the date hereof.
7.            Indemnification. The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each
of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, attorneys, control persons and affiliates from and
against all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs, fees and expenses whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, any and all expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation
commenced or threatened) based upon or arising out of any actual or alleged false acknowledgment,
representation or warranty, or misrepresentation or omission to state a material fact, or breach by the
Purchaser of any covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser herein or in any other document
delivered in connection with this Subscription Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
8.            Binding Effect. This Subscription Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives, and permitted
assigns.
9.            Modification. This Subscription Agreement will not be modified or waived except by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any such modification or waiver is sought.

communication given by overnight courier will be deemed given at the time of delivery.
11.           Assignability. This Subscription Agreement and the rights, interests and obligations hereunder
are not transferable or assignable by the Purchaser and the transfer or assignment of any of the Shares
will be made only in accordance with all applicable laws.
12.           Applicable Law. This Subscription Agreement will be governed by and construed under the
laws of the State of New York as applied to agreements among New York residents entered into and to be

The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to
detect, deter, and punish terrorists in
the United States and abroad. The Act
imposes new anti-money laundering
requirements on brokerage firms and
financial institutions. Since April 24,
2002 all brokerage firms have been
required to have new, comprehensive
anti-money laundering programs.
Money laundering is the process of
disguising illegally obtained
money so that the funds appear to
come from legitimate sources or
activities. Money laundering occurs
in connection with a wide variety of
crimes, including illegal arms
sales, drug trafficking, robbery,
fraud, racketeering, and terrorism.
To help you understand these efforts,
we want to provide you with some
information about money laundering
and our steps to implement the USA
PATRIOT Act.
How big is the problem
and why is it important?
The use of the U.S. financial
system by criminals to
facilitate terrorism or other
crimes could well taint our
financial markets. According to
the U.S. State Department,
one recent estimate puts the
amount of worldwide money
laundering activity at $1 trillion
a year.
What are we required to do to eliminate money laundering?
Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT Act, our anti-
money laundering program must designate a special
compliance officer, set up employee training, conduct
independent audits, and establish policies and procedures to
detect and report suspicious transaction and ensure
compliance with the new laws.
As part of our required program, we may
ask you to provide various identification
documents or other information. Until you
provide the information or documents we
need, we may not be able to effect any
transactions for you.

any offers to buy any security, under circumstances that would require registration of any of the Shares
under the Securities Act or that is likely to cause this offering of the Shares to be integrated with prior
offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act or any applicable stockholder approval
provisions, including without limitation, under the rules and regulations of any exchange or automated
quotation system on which any of the securities of the Company are listed or designated. Except as
disclosed in the SEC Reports, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, their affiliates and any person
acting on their behalf, have taken any action or steps referred to in the preceding sentence that would
require registration of any of the Shares under the Securities Act or cause the offering of the Shares to be
integrated with other offerings.

3.21         Application of Takeover Protections. The Company has taken all necessary action, if any, in
order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including
any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Company’s
Charter Documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become applicable to the
Subscriber as a result of the Subscriber and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their
rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the Shares and the
Subscriber’s ownership of the Shares.
3.22         Taxes. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign tax returns which are required to be filed by each of them and all such returns are true and correct
in all material respects, except for such failures to file which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary has paid all taxes pursuant to such returns or
pursuant to any assessments received by any of them or by which any of them are obligated to withhold
from amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party except where not reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary has properly accrued all taxes
required to be accrued and/or paid, except where the failure to accrue would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not
currently being audited by any state, local or federal authorities. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to any tax assessment or deficiency. The Company has set aside on its books adequate provision for the
payment of any unpaid taxes except where not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
3.23         Registration Rights. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.23, no person has any right to cause the
Company to effect the registration under the Securities Act of any securities of the Company.
3.24         Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section
12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has taken no action designed to, or which to its
knowledge is likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the
Exchange Act nor has the Company received any notification that the SEC is contemplating terminating
such registration. The Company has not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof, received notice from
the OTCQB to the effect that the Company is not in compliance with the rules or regulations of the
OTCQB. To the Company’s knowledge it is, and has no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable
future continue to be, in compliance with all such rules and regulations of the OTCQB.
3.25         Disclosure. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the Offering, the
Company confirms that neither it nor, to the Company’s knowledge, any other person acting on its behalf
has provided the Subscriber or its agents or counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or
might constitute material, non-public information. The Company understands and confirms that the
Subscriber will rely on the foregoing representation in purchasing the Shares. All disclosure in the
Transaction Documents is true and correct when considered in the aggregate and does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
press releases disseminated by the Company during the twelve months preceding the date of this
Agreement taken as a whole together with the SEC Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and when made, not misleading.
-9-
3.26        Private Placement. Assuming the accuracy of the Subscriber’s representations and warranties
set forth in Article II, no registration under the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the Shares
by the Company to the Subscriber as contemplated hereby.

Trust Company Automated Securities Transfer Program. The Company’s Common Stock is currently
eligible for transfer pursuant to the Depository Trust Company Automated Securities Transfer Program.
3.28        OFAC. Neither the Company nor, to the Company’s knowledge, any director, officer, agent,
employee, affiliate or person acting on its behalf, is currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (“OFAC”); and the Company will
not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the sale of the Shares, or lend, contribute or otherwise make
available such proceeds to any joint venture partner or other person or entity, towards any sales or
operations in Cuba, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Myanmar or any other country sanctioned by OFAC or for the
purpose of financing the activities of any person currently subject to any U.S. sanctions.
3.29        Bad Actor Disqualification
(a)          No Disqualification Events. With respect to Shares to be offered and sold hereunder in reliance
on Rule 506 under the Securities Act (“Regulation D Securities”), to the knowledge of the Company, none

of the “Bad Actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act (a
“Disqualification Event”), except for a Disqualification Event covered by Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3). The
Company has exercised reasonable care to determine whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a

obligations under Rule 506(e), and has furnished to the Subscriber a copy of any disclosures provided
thereunder.
(b)          Other Covered Persons. The Company is not aware of any person that (i) has been or will be paid

VI.         COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY
6.1          Transfer Restrictions.
(a)          The Shares may only be disposed of in compliance with state and United States federal
securities laws and applicable Canadian securities laws. In connection with any transfer of Shares other
than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, to
the Company or to an affiliate of a Subscriber, the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide
to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the
Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to
the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Shares under the Securities
Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, and shall have the rights of a Subscriber under this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing,
the Subscriber agrees and understands that (i) the Company is not a “reporting issuer” (as such term is
defined under applicable Canadian securities laws) in any province or territory of Canada, (ii) the
distribution of the Shares to the Subscriber is being made on a private placement basis only and is
exempt from the requirement that the Company prepare and file a prospectus with the Canadian securities
regulatory authorities, (iii) any resale or transfer of the Shares must be made in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, which may require resales or transfers to be made in accordance
with exemptions from the prospectus requirements of Canadian securities laws, pursuant to a
discretionary exemption therefrom or in a transaction not otherwise subject to such requirements (which
Canadian resale restrictions may in some circumstances apply to resales of the Shares made outside of
Canada). The Subscriber agrees to comply with applicable Canadian securities laws in connection with
any resale or transfer of the Shares. If requested by the Company in connection with any resale or transfer
of the Shares, the Subscriber will provide such evidence, which may include an opinion of Canadian legal
counsel, that is satisfactory to the Company confirming that such resale or transfer complies with the
requirements of Canadian securities laws.
-12-
(b)          The Subscriber agrees to the imprinting of a legend on the Shares substantially in the following
form until the Shares have been transferred pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act
that has been declared effective or an exemption thereunder:
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN
OCTOBER 2014 PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “ACT”) OR ANY STATE
SECURITIES OR “BLUE SKY LAWS,” AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED,
ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, EXCEPT: (A) TO THE
COMPANY, (B) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER THE ACT; (C)
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, IF AVAILABLE, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY LOCAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS, (D) IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER SUCH ACT, IF
AVAILABLE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR (E) IN
A TRANSACTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND IN THE CASE OF (C), (D)
OR (E) THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OF RECOGNIZED STANDING,
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL, TO SUCH EFFECT.
HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT.”
The above legend may be removed by delivery to the registrar and transfer agent for the Shares and to the
Company of an opinion of counsel, of recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that
such legend is no longer required under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act.
In addition to the foregoing legend, the following legend (the “Canadian Legend”) shall also be placed on
each certificate issued to Subscriber, in form substantially similar to the following:
-13-
“CANADIAN LEGEND: UNLESS PERMITTED UNDER SECURITIES LEGISLATION, THE HOLDER OF
THIS SECURITY MUST NOT TRADE THE SECURITY BEFORE THE DATE THAT IS 4 MONTHS AND
A DAY AFTER THE LATER OF (I) [INSERT THE DISTRIBUTION DATE] AND (II) THE DATE THE
COMPANY BECAME A REPORTING ISSUER IN ANY PROVINCE OR TERRITORY OF CANADA.”
(c)          Certificates evidencing the Shares shall not contain any legend (including the legend set forth in
Section 6.1(b) hereof, other than the Canadian legend): (i) following any sale of such Shares pursuant to
an effective registration statement covering the resale of such security under the Securities Act, or (ii)
following any sale of such Shares pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) if such legend is not required under
applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements
issued by the staff of the SEC). The Company shall cause its counsel, at the Company’s expense, to
issue a legal opinion to the Company’s transfer agent promptly if required by the Company’s transfer
agent to effect the removal of the legend if one of the preceding events has occurred and as permitted by
law. In order to remove the Canadian Legend from the certificates evidencing the Shares, the Company
may require such evidence from the Subscriber, which may include an opinion of Canadian legal counsel,
that is satisfactory to the Company confirming that the Canadian Legend is no longer required to be
affixed to the certificates evidencing the Shares.
6.2           Listing of Shares. The Company agrees, (i) if the Company applies to have the Common Stock
traded on any other trading market, it will include in such application the Shares, and will take such other
action as is necessary or desirable to cause the Shares to be listed on such other trading market as
promptly as possible, and (ii) it will take all action reasonably necessary to continue the listing and trading
of its Common Stock on a trading market and will comply in all material respects with the Company’s
reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the trading market.
6.3           Omitted
6.4           Replacement of Certificates. If any certificate or instrument evidencing any of the Shares is
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or
instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or
destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate or
instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs associated with the
issuance of such replacement securities. If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any
securities is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Company may require delivery of such mutilated
certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance of a replacement.
6.5           Omitted
6.6           Securities Laws; Publicity. The Company shall, by 8:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth
trading day immediately following a Closing hereunder, issue a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing
the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby and including the Transaction Documents as
exhibits thereto to the extent required by law. The Company shall not publicly disclose the name of
Subscriber, or include the name of any Subscriber in any filing with the SEC or any regulatory agency or
trading market, without the prior written consent of Subscriber, except: (a) as required by federal securities
law in connection with the filing of final Transaction Documents (including signature pages thereto) with
the SEC and (b) to the extent such disclosure is required by law, in which case the Company shall
provide the Subscriber with prior notice of such disclosure permitted under this clause (b).
-14-
6.7           Form D; Blue Sky Filings. The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with respect to the
Shares if required under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and to provide a copy
thereof, promptly upon request of the Subscriber. The Company shall take such action as the Company
shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for, or to qualify the Shares for,
sale to the Subscriber at the Closing under applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws of the states of the
United States, and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Subscriber.
6.8           Omitted
6.9           Indemnification. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Subscriber, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons (collectively,
the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against , any and all loss, liability, damage or deficiency suffered or
incurred by any Indemnified Party by reason of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty by the
Company made in this Agreement or, after any applicable notice and/or cure periods, nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company under this Agreement or other
Transaction Documents; and will promptly reimburse the Indemnified Parties for all expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) as incurred in connection with the investigation of,
preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim related to or arising in any manner out of
any of the foregoing, or any action or proceeding arising therefrom (collectively, “Proceedings”), whether
or not such Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such Proceeding (unless such action is based upon
a breach of such Subscriber’s representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Documents
or any agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such stockholder or any
violations by such  Subscriber of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Subscriber which
constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance). If any action shall be brought
against any Subscriber in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such
Subscriber shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Subscriber. Any
Subscriber shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Subscriber
except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in
writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to
employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material conflict on
any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Subscriber, in which
case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such
separate counsel. The Company will not be liable to any Subscriber under this Agreement (y) for any
settlement by a Subscriber effected without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that a loss, claim, damage or
liability is attributable to any Subscriber’s breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under the
Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such Subscriber may have with any such
stockholder or any violations by such Subscriber of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such
Subscriber which constitutes fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance. The
indemnification required by this Section 6.9 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are incurred. The
indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any
Subscriber against the Company or others and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to
law.
-15-
(a)          If for any reason (other than a final non-appealable judgment finding any Indemnified Party liable
for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for its gross negligence or willful misconduct) the
foregoing indemnity is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party
harmless, then the Company shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a
result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Advisor on the other, but also
the relative fault by the Company and the Indemnified Party, as well as any relevant equitable
considerations.
6.10         Non-Public Information. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Company covenants and agrees that
neither it, nor any other person acting on its behalf, will provide Subscriber or its agents or counsel with
any information that the Company believes constitutes material non-public information. The Company
understands and confirms that Subscriber shall be relying on the foregoing covenant in effecting
transactions in securities of the Company.

amended except by a writing signed by the parties hereto. No waiver of any default with respect to any
provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the
future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement
hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair
the exercise of any such right.
7.3           This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and to their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. The Company may not assign this
Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Subscriber (other
than by merger). Subscriber may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any person to
whom Subscriber assigns or transfers any Shares in accordance with applicable law, provided that such
transferee agrees in writing to be bound, with respect to the transferred Shares, by the provisions of the
Transaction Documents.
7.4           The Transaction Documents, together with the exhibits and schedules thereto, contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, which the parties acknowledge have
been merged into such documents, exhibits and schedules.
7.5           Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Subscriber and the Company, this
Agreement shall become a binding obligation of the Subscriber with respect to the purchase of Shares as

Transaction Documents shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party
agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (whether brought
against a party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents)
shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York. Each party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of
New York, borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith
or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the
enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any
such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such
proceeding.
7.7           The holding of any provision of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in whole or in part, such provision shall be interpreted so
as to remain enforceable to the maximum extent permissible consistent with applicable law and the
remaining conditions and provisions or portions thereof shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
and enforceable to the extent they are valid, legal and enforceable, and no provisions shall be deemed
dependent upon any other covenant or provision unless so expressed herein.
7.8           It is agreed that a waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate, or be construed, as a waiver of any subsequent breach by that same party.

agreements and instruments and take such other and further action as may be necessary or appropriate
and as permitted by law to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. In the event that any
signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, such
signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or “.pdf” signature page were an
original thereof.
7.11         Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any rights in any person or entity
not a party to this Agreement.
7.12         In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including
recovery of damages, the Subscriber and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under this
Agreement. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of any breach of obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to
waive in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate.
-18-
7.13         The Company further understands and acknowledges that (i) Subscriber may engage in
hedging activities at various times during the period that the Shares are outstanding, and (ii) such hedging
activities (if any) could reduce the value of the existing stockholders’ equity interests in the Company at
and after the time that the hedging activities are being conducted.  The Company acknowledges that such
aforementioned hedging activities do not constitute a breach of any of the Transaction Documents.
7.14         In order to discourage frivolous claims the parties agree that unless a claimant in any
proceeding arising out of this Agreement succeeds in establishing his claim and recovering a judgment
against another party (regardless of whether such claimant succeeds against one of the other parties to
the action), then the other party shall be entitled to recover from such claimant all of its/their reasonable
legal costs and expenses relating to such proceeding and/or incurred in preparation therefor.

3.             Automatic Registration.

registration statement (the “Automatic Registration Statement”) covering the resale of all of the
Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. The
Automatic Registration Statement required hereunder shall be on Form S-1 or Form S-3, as applicable,
and shall contain substantially the “Plan of Distribution” attached hereto as Annex A.  Subject to the terms
of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Automatic Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof,
but in any event not later than the Effectiveness Date, and shall use its best efforts to keep the Automatic
Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earlier of (i) the date when
all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement have been sold thereunder or pursuant
to Rule 144 or (ii) the date when all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement may be
sold by non-affiliates of the Company without current public information pursuant to Rule 144(c) (the
“Effectiveness Period”). The maximum amount of Registrable Securities that may be included in the
Automatic Registration Statement at any one time shall be limited by Rule 415 as required by the
Commission. In the event that there is a limitation by the Commission on the number of Registrable
Securities that may be included for registration at one time, the Company shall promptly so advise the
Investor and use its best efforts to file an additional Automatic Registration Statement covering such
ineligible Registrable Securities, on a pro-rata basis, within 30 days of the date such securities become
eligible and cause such Automatic Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as
soon as reasonably practicable.
(b)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall have the right to
delay the filing of any such Registration Statement for a period not in excess of 60 consecutive days and
no more than 90 days in any consecutive 12-month period (a “Delay Period”), if the Company is pursuing
a public offering of securities and the underwriter recommends a Delay Period.
(c)          In the case of an event that causes the Company to suspend the use of a Registration Statement
(a “Suspension Event”), the Company shall give written notice (a “Suspension Notice”) to the Investor
to suspend sales of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement and such notice
shall continue only for so long as the Suspension Event or its effect is continuing. The Investor shall not
effect any sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement (or such filings) at
any time after it has received a Suspension Notice from the Company and prior to receipt of an End of
Suspension Notice (as defined below) with respect to such Registration Statement. The Investor may
recommence effecting sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement (or
such filings) following further notice to such effect (an “End of Suspension Notice”) from the Company,
which End of Suspension Notice shall be given by the Company to the Investors in the manner described
above promptly following the conclusion of any Suspension Event and its effect.
-4-
(d)          If: (i) the Automatic Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to its Filing Date (if the Company
files the Automatic Registration Statement without affording the Holders the opportunity to review and
comment on the same as required by Section 5(a) herein, the Company shall be deemed to have not
satisfied this clause (i)), or (ii) a Registration Statement registering for resale all of the Registrable
Securities is not declared effective by the Commission within one hundred and thirty-five (135) days
following the Filing Date (unless the reason for such non-registration of all or any portion of the
Registrable Securities is as a result of SEC Guidance under Rule 415 or similar rule which limits the
number of Registrable Securities which may be included in a registration statement with respect to the
Holders), (any such failure or breach being referred to as an “Event”, and the Filing Date or the one
hundred thirty-fifth day following the Filing Date with respect to which such failure or breach occurred
being referred to as an “Event Date”), then, in addition to any other rights the Investors may have
hereunder or under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of each
such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date) until the applicable
Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each Investor $50,000.00, as partial liquidated damages and not
as a penalty, The parties agree that the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to an Investor
under this Agreement shall be $300,000.00.  If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages
pursuant to this Section in full within seven days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest
thereon at a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by
applicable law) to the Investor, accruing daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are due until
such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The partial liquidated damages pursuant to
the terms hereof shall apply on a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a month prior to the cure of an
Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payments shall be owed (i) to any affiliate of the Company, (ii)
with respect to any period during which all of the holder’s Registrable Shares may be sold by such holder
under Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public
information requirement under Rule 144, or (iii) in circumstances described in Sections 3(c).
4.             Piggyback Registrations.
(a)          With respect to any Registrable Securities not otherwise included in the Automatic Registration
Statement or any other Registration Statement as a result of any limitation imposed by the Commission
under Rule 415 (the “Excluded Registrable Securities”), whenever the Company proposes to register
(including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the Company for other shareholders) any of its
securities under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to (i) an Automatic Registration pursuant to
Section 3 hereof or (ii) registration pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any
successor forms thereto), and the registration form to be used may be used for the registration of
Registrable Securities (a “Piggyback Registration”), the Company will give written notice to the holder of
Excluded Registrable Securities of its intention to effect such a registration and will, subject to the
provisions of Subsection 4(b) hereof, include in such registration all Excluded Registrable Securities
with respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein within twenty (20)
days after the receipt of the Company’s notice.
(b)          If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the
Company’s securities, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion
the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be
sold in such offering without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the Company will, if
permitted by all applicable agreements, include in such registration a pro rata share of Excluded
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Registration Statement as calculated by dividing
the number of Excluded Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Registration Statement
by the number of the Company’s securities requested to be included in such Registration Statement by all
selling security holders. In such event, the holder of Excluded Registrable Securities shall continue to
have registration rights under this Agreement with respect to any Excluded Registrable Securities not so
included in such Registration Statement.
-5-
(c)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after giving a notice of Piggyback Registration and
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, the
Company shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay registration of such securities, the
Company may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each record holder of Excluded
Registrable Securities and, following such notice, (i) in the case of a determination not to register, shall be
relieved of its obligation to register any Excluded Registrable Securities in connection with such
registration, and (ii) in the case of determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay
registering any Excluded Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in registering such other
securities.
5.             Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of
any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will:
(a)          not less than four (4) trading days prior to the filing of each Registration Statement and not less
than one (1) trading day prior to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto (including any document that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference), and subject, if appropriate, to the relevant parties’ entry into a customary agreement to
maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information provided (a “Confidentiality Agreement”) or the
Company may excise any information which would constitute material non-public information regarding
the Company, the Company shall (i) furnish to one counsel on behalf of all sellers of Registrable
Securities copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such sellers, and
(ii) cause its officers and directors, counsel and independent registered public accountants to respond to
such inquiries as shall be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the sellers of Registrable
Securities, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to provide each seller of Registrable
Securities advance copies of any universal shelf registration statement registering securities in addition to
those required hereunder, or any Prospectus prepared thereto.
(b)          prepare and file with the Commission the Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable
Securities and use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective in an
expeditious manner;
(c)          (i) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments,
to a Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to
keep a Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable Securities for the
Effectiveness Period, (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required
Prospectus supplement (subject to the terms of this Agreement), and, as so supplemented or amended, to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably possible to any comments received
from the Commission with respect to a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and provide as
promptly as reasonably possible to one counsel for all sellers of Registrable Securities true and complete
copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to a Registration Statement (provided
that, the Company may either obtain a Confidentiality Agreement from Investors or excise any information
contained therein which would constitute material non-public information regarding the Company), and
(iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement
during the applicable period in accordance (subject to the terms of this Agreement) with the intended
methods of disposition by each seller of Registrable Securities thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.
-6-
(d)          if during the Effectiveness Period the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100%
of the number of shares of Common Stock then registered in a Registration Statement, then the Company
shall file as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case prior to the applicable Filing Date, an
additional Registration Statement covering the resale by the Investor of not less than the number of such
Registrable Securities.
(e)          furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities and to each underwriter such number of copies of
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein (including each preliminary prospectus)
as such persons reasonably may request in order to facilitate the intended disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
(f)          use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered

underwriter, reasonably shall request, (ii) to prepare and file in those jurisdictions such amendments
(including post-effective amendments) and supplements, and take such other actions, as may be
necessary to maintain such registration and qualification in effect at all times for the period of distribution
contemplated thereby and (iii) to take such further action as may be necessary or advisable to enable the

such purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;
(g)          use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement with any securities exchange on which the Common Stock of the Company is then
listed;
(h)          immediately notify each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter under such
Registration Statement, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of
which the Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing and promptly
amend or supplement such Registration Statement to correct any such untrue statement or omission;
-7-
(i)          promptly notify each seller of Registrable Securities of the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings
for that purpose and make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any
stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible time;
(j)          if the offering is an underwritten offering, enter into a written agreement with the managing
underwriter selected in the manner herein provided in such form and containing such provisions as are
usual and customary in the securities business for such an arrangement between such underwriter and
companies of the Company’s size and investment stature, including, without limitation, customary
indemnification and contribution provisions;
(k)          if the offering is an underwritten offering, at the request of any Investor, furnish to such Investor on

a copy of an opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, addressed to the underwriters, stating that such Registration Statement has become effective
under the Securities Act and that (A) to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the
effectiveness thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are
pending or contemplated under the Securities Act, (B) the Registration Statement, the related Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement thereof comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act (except that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial

regarding mineral reserves, mineralized material or resources, contained therein) and (C) to such other
effects as reasonably may be requested by counsel for the underwriters; and (ii) a copy of a letter dated
such date from the independent public accountants retained by the Company, addressed to the
underwriters, stating that they are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the

securities) representing the Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement and to
enable such certificates to be in such denominations and registered in such names as each Investor or
any underwriters may reasonably request; and

Investor thereunder, each underwriter of such Registrable Securities thereunder and each other person, if
any, who controls such seller or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Investor, underwriter or
controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant hereto or any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged
violation of the Securities Act or any state securities or “blue sky” laws and will reimburse each such
Investor, each such underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, that the Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that
any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon the Company’s reliance on an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by any such seller, any such underwriter or any such controlling person in writing
specifically for use in such Registration Statement or prospectus.
-9-
(b)          In the event of a registration of any of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant
hereto, each seller of such Registrable Securities thereunder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act, each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement, each director of the
Company, each underwriter and each person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Company or
such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon reliance on any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the registration statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
Securities Act pursuant hereto or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and will reimburse the Company and each such officer, director, underwriter and controlling
person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided that such seller will be liable
hereunder in any such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining to such seller, as such, furnished in
writing to the Company by such seller specifically for use in such Registration Statement or prospectus;
and provided, further, that the liability of each seller hereunder shall be limited to the proceeds received by
such seller from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity provided in this Section 8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid
in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the
consent of such indemnified party and provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any such
case pursuant to this Section 8 to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in
respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission in such Registration Statement, which untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission is completely corrected in an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement and the undersigned indemnitees thereafter fail to deliver or cause to be delivered
such Registration Statement as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently with the sale of the
Registrable Securities to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect
thereof) or expense after the Company has furnished the undersigned with the same.
-10-
(c)          Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any
action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party other
than under this Section 8 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified
party under this Section 8 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such
omission. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation
and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided that if the defendants in any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
based upon written advice of its counsel that there may be reasonable defenses available to it that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified
party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise
to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and
other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred.
(d)          In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in
any case in which either (i) any holder of Registrable Securities exercising rights under this Agreement, or
any controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8
but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction
and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may
not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 8 provides for indemnification in
such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling
holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 8; then, and in each such case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate
losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such
proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public
offering price of its Registrable Securities offered by the Registration Statement bears to the public
offering price of all securities offered by such Registration Statement, and the Company is responsible for
the remaining portion; provided, that, in any such case, (A) no such holder will be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered by it pursuant to
such Registration Statement and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 12(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
9.             Changes in Capital Stock. If, and as often as, there is any change in the capital stock of the
Company by way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, or through a merger,
consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization, or by any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be
made in the provisions hereof so that the rights and privileges granted hereby shall continue as so
changed.

Annex A
Form of
Plan of Distribution
Each Selling Stockholder (the “Selling Stockholders”) of the securities and any of their pledgees,
assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered
hereby on the OTCQB or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the securities are
traded or in private transactions.  These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices.  A Selling Stockholder
may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:
·ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;
block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and
·
resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;
·purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;
·an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;
· privately negotiated transactions;
settlement of short sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this
·
prospectus is a part;
in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number
·
of such securities at a stipulated price per security;
through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options
·
exchange or otherwise;
· a combination of any such methods of sale; or
· any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.
The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”), if available, rather than under this prospectus.
Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate
in sales.  Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any
broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be
negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency
transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440;
and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.
A-1
In connection with the sale of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into
hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short
sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume.  The Selling Stockholders may
also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge
the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities.  The Selling Stockholders may also
enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or
more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of
securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may
resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).
The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may
be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.  In
such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of
the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the
Securities Act.  Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or
oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. In no
event shall any broker-dealer receive fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would
exceed eight percent (8%).
The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the
registration of the securities.  The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against
certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities
Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172
thereunder.  In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. The Selling
Stockholders have advised us that there currently is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in
connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholders.
We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be
resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without current public information pursuant to
Rule 144(c), or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect.  The resale securities will be sold only through registered
or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain
states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified
for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is
available and is complied with.
A-2
Under applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of
the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the
common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement
of the distribution.  In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the
timing of purchases and sales of securities of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other
person.  We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed
them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale
(including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization
Pershing Gold Corporation (the “Company”), formerly named Sagebrush Gold Ltd., was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 2, 2007. The Company is a gold and precious metals
exploration company pursuing exploration and development opportunities primarily in Nevada. The
Company is currently focused on exploration of its Relief Canyon properties in Pershing County in
northwestern Nevada. None of the Company’s properties contain proven and probable reserves, and all
of the Company’s activities on all of its properties are exploratory in nature.
A wholly-owned subsidiary, EXCX Funding Corp., a Nevada corporation was formed in January 2011 and
held the note payable - related party, which was exchanged for the Company’s Series E Convertible
Preferred Stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”) and warrants in August 2013 and was cancelled. On April 6,
2014 EXCX Funding Corp. was liquidated and dissolved.
On August 30, 2011, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold Acquisition Corp. (“Gold
Acquisition”), acquired the Relief Canyon Mine property (“Relief Canyon”) located in Pershing County,
near Lovelock, Nevada, for an aggregate purchase price consisting of $12,000,000 cash and $8,000,000
in senior secured convertible promissory notes.
A wholly-owned subsidiary, Pershing Royalty Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed on May 17,
2012 to hold royalty interests in two gold exploration properties.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“US GAAP”) and present the consolidated financial statements of the Company as
of September 30, 2014. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. All
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial
position as of September 30, 2014, and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2014 have been included. The results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The
accounting policies and procedures employed in the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements have been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2013, which are contained in the Company’s Form 10-K as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 26, 2014. The consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2013 contained herein, was derived from those financial statements.
Use of estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ
significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited
to, the useful life of property and equipment, amounts and timing of closure obligations, the assumptions
used to calculate fair value of options and warrants granted, beneficial conversion on convertible notes
payable and preferred stock, capitalized mineral rights, asset valuations, common stock issued for
services, common stock issued for conversion of notes and common stock issued in connection with an
acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial
institutions. The Company’s accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. At September 30, 2014, the Company had bank balances
exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. To reduce its risk associated with the
failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial
institutions in which it holds deposits.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash consists of cash and investments which are held as collateral under a surface
management surety bond issued on the Company’s behalf.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Marketable securities
Marketable securities consist of the Company’s investment in publicly traded equity securities and are
generally restricted for sale under Federal securities laws. The Company’s policy is to liquidate securities
received when market conditions are favorable for sale. Since these securities are often restricted, the
Company is unable to liquidate them until the restriction is removed. Marketable securities that are bought
and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Pursuant to ASC Topic 320,
“Investments — Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company’s marketable securities have a readily
determinable and active quoted price, such as from NASDAQ, NYSE Euronext, the Over the Counter
Bulletin Board, or the OTC Markets Group.
Trading securities are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized holding gains and losses included
in income and classified within interest and other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
Available for sale securities are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains or losses are
recognized as an element of comprehensive income based on changes in the fair value of the security.
Once liquidated, realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities available for sale are
reflected in the net income (loss) for the period in which the security was liquidated.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company adopted ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), for assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for
fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair
value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about
such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company’s
financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820
requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs.
These inputs are prioritized below:
Level 1:Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2:Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level
3:
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting
entity’s own assumptions.
The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the
FASB’s accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, prepaid
expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their estimated fair market values based
on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the note payable at September 30,
2014 approximates its respective fair value based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses of $351,370 and $582,278 at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013,
respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid
expenses principally include prepayments for consulting and business advisory services, insurance
premiums, drilling services, and mineral lease fees which are being amortized over the terms of their
respective agreements.

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs
Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as
incurred. The Company expenses all mineral exploration costs as incurred as it is still in the exploration
stage. If the Company were to identify proven and probable reserves in its investigation of its properties
and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the development stage and capitalize
future costs until production is established. When a property reaches the production stage, the related
capitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the proven
and probable reserves. If in the future the Company has capitalized mineral properties, these properties
will be periodically assessed for impairment.
To date, the Company has not established the commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects;
therefore, all exploration costs are expensed. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
2013, the Company incurred exploration cost of $3,900,798 and $1,793,214, respectively.
ASC 930-805, “Extractive Activities-Mining: Business Combinations” (“ASC 930-805”), states that mineral
rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a portion of the benefits from mineral
deposits. Acquired mineral rights are considered tangible assets under ASC 930-805. ASC 930-805
requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. As a result, the direct
costs to acquire mineral rights are initially capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs
associated with acquiring patented and unpatented mining claims.
ASC 930-805-30-1 and 30-2 provides that in fair valuing mineral rights, an acquirer should take into
account both:
·           The value beyond proven and probable reserves (“VBPP”) to the extent that a market participant
would include VBPP in determining the fair value of the assets.
·           The effects of anticipated fluctuations in the future market price of minerals in a manner that is
consistent with the expectations of market participants.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred;
major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are
included in income in the year of disposition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the assets, generally one to twenty five years.
Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company accounts for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets according to the ASC 360
“Property, Plant and Equipment”. The Company continually monitors events and changes in
circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including mineral rights,
may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets in the exploration stage are monitored for impairment based on
factors such as the Company’s continued right to explore the area, exploration reports, assays, technical
reports, drill results and the Company’s continued plans to fund exploration programs on the property, and
whether sufficient work has been performed to indicate that the carrying amount of the mineral property
cost carried forward as an asset will not be fully recovered. The tests for long-lived assets in the
exploration stage are monitored for impairment based on factors such as current market value of the long-
lived assets and results of exploration, future asset utilization, business climate, mineral prices and future
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. When
necessary, impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value based on the best information
available. Estimated fair value is generally based on either appraised value or measured by discounting
estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted
future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. The Company
recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset. The Company did not record any charges for impairment of its long-lived
assets at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.

PERSHING GOLD CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”), consisting primarily of estimated mine reclamation and closure costs
at the Company’s Relief Canyon property, are recognized in the period incurred and when a reasonable
estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially
estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges
to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. Asset retirement
obligations are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from
revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. The Company reviews and
evaluates its asset retirement obligations annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed
necessary.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“ASC 740-10”) which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to
calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset
any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred
asset will not be realized.
The Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax
Position. When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the
amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-
10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based
on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax
positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount
of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable
taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount
measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the
accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to
the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than
not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax
benefits.
The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, “Definition of Settlement”, which provides guidance on how
an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing
previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the
completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions
considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax
position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical
merits and the statute of limitations remains open.  The federal and state income tax returns of the
Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after
they are filed.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment
Topic of ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation”, which requires recognition in the
consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services
in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the
cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair
value of the award.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, “Equity Based Payments to Non-employees”, for share-based payments
to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the “measurement date.”
The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached,
the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.
Treasury stock
Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method, with the purchase price of the common stock
recorded separately as a deduction from stockholders’ equity.

Related party transactions
Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or
more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related
parties also include principal stockholders of the Company, its management, members of the immediate
families of principal stockholders of the Company and its management and other parties that control or
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the Company. The Company
discloses all related party transactions.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net
Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists” (“ASU 2013-11”).
ASU 2013-11 provides guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits related to any
disallowed portion of net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards, if
they exist. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. The adoption of
ASU 2013-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of
Certain Financial Reporting Requirements”. ASU 2014-10 eliminates the distinction of a development
stage entity and certain related disclosure requirements, including the elimination of inception-to-date
information on the statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity. The amendments in
ASU 2014-10 are effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014,
and interim periods within those annual periods; however early adoption is permitted. The Company
evaluated and adopted ASU 2014-10 for the interim reporting period ended September 30, 2014.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern.” The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess an entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in
U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for
considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement
and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period
of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The
amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for
annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU No.
2014-15 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until
a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon
adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an
impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.
NOTE 3 — MARKETABLE SECURITIES
In January 2013, the Company sold the remaining 1,513,333 shares of American Strategic Minerals Corp.
common stock it owned in a private transaction and generated net proceeds of $151,333. Between
February 2013 and May 2013, the Company sold 25,000,000 shares of Valor Gold Corp. common stock in
private transactions and generated net proceeds of $1,505,000. The Company recorded a realized gain

NOTE 4 — MINERAL PROPERTIES (continued)
Relief Canyon Mine
Through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold Acquisition, the Company owns 164 unpatented
lode mining claims and 120 unpatented millsites at the Relief Canyon Mine property. The property
includes the Relief Canyon Mine and gold processing facilities, currently in a care and maintenance
status. The Relief Canyon Mine includes three open pit mines, heap leach pads comprised of six cells,
two solution ponds and a cement block constructed adsorption desorption-recovery (ADR) solution
processing circuit. The ADR type process plant consists of four carbon columns, acid wash system,
stripping vessel, and electrolytic cells. The process facility was completed in 2008 by Firstgold Corp and
produced gold until 2009 and is currently in care and maintenance status. The facilities are generally in
good condition. Most of the Relief Canyon Mine property is burdened by a production royalty equal to 2%
of net smelter returns payable to Battle Mountain Gold Exploration LLC (now owned by Royal Gold).
Pershing Pass Property
The Pershing Pass property consists of over 700 unpatented mining claims covering approximately
12,000 acres and a mining lease covering approximately 600 acres.  The Pershing Pass property also
includes approximately 490 unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 9,700 acres that the
Company acquired from Silver Scott Mines in March 2012 and approximately 283 unpatented lode mining
claims covering about 5,660 acres owned directly by a Victoria Gold Corp. subsidiary prior to our
purchase. Victoria Gold has reserved a 2% net smelter return production royalty on the 221 claims that are
located outside the area of interest related to the Newmont Leased property, discussed below.  The
Pershing Pass property also includes 17 unpatented mining claims acquired from a third party in
April 2012 subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty, 17 unpatented mining claims that the Company
located in mid-2012, and approximately 635 acres of private lands that the Company leased in
January 2013.
The primary term of the lease is ten years, which may be extended as long as mineral development work
continues on the property. Production from the lease is subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty on all
metals produced other than gold, and to a royalty on gold indexed to the gold price, ranging from 2% at
gold prices of less than $500 per ounce to 3.5% at gold prices over $1,500 per ounce. Prior to one year
after commercial production, the Company can repurchase up to 3% of the royalty on gold production at
the rate of $600,000 for each 1%.
In September 2013, the Company entered into a lease agreement and purchase option with Wolf Pack
Gold (Nevada) Corp for 19 unpatented mining claims (approximately 400 acres) in the Pershing Pass
Property.  The lease grants the Company exclusive rights to conduct mineral exploration, development
and mining and an exclusive option to purchase the claims. The primary term of the lease is ten years,
which may be extended as long as mineral exploration, development, or mining work continues on the
property. Production from the lease is subject to a 1% net smelter return royalty on precious metals and a
0.5% net smelter royalty on all other metals produced from the lease. Prior to production, and starting in
September 2016, the Company is required to pay a $10,000 per year advance minimum royalty payment
to Wolf Pack Gold. The advance minimum royalty remains at $10,000 per year until September 2023 and
then increases to $12,500 per year.  The advance royalty payment increases to $15,000 per year in
September 2028 and $20,000 per year in September 2033.  The advance minimum royalty payments are
due on or before the anniversary dates of the lease agreement. If the Company decides to exercise the
purchase option, which is exercisable at any time, it can acquire the 19 unpatented mining claims from
Wolf Pack Gold for $250,000.
Newmont Leased Properties
On April 5, 2012, the Company purchased from Victoria Gold Corp. and Victoria Resources (US) Inc. their
interest in approximately 13,300 acres of mining claims and private lands adjacent to the Company’s
landholdings at the Relief Canyon Mine in Pershing County, Nevada. Victoria Gold has reserved a 2% net
smelter return royalty from the production on 221 of the 283 unpatented mining claims that it owned
directly.
Approximately 8,900 acres of the lands that the Company acquired from Victoria Gold Corporation are a
leasehold interest comprised of unpatented mining claims and private lands subject to a 2006 Mineral
Lease and Sublease with Newmont USA Ltd., which the Company refers to as the Newmont Leased
property. The Newmont Leased property consists of 155 unpatented lode mining claims owned by
Newmont comprising approximately 2,800 acres, approximately 4,900 acres of privately-owned fee
minerals leased by Newmont from the owners, and 62 unpatented mining claims that were owned by
Victoria within the Newmont Leased property and area of interest.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2014
NOTE 4 — MINERAL PROPERTIES (continued)
In order to maintain the 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease with Newmont, the Company was required to
spend approximately $1.0 million in exploration expenses in 2013. The Company has satisfied this 2013
direct drilling work commitment. Starting in 2014, the Company is required to spend $0.5 million per year
on exploration expenditures or pay Newmont rental payments of $10 per acre per year. The rental
payments will escalate by 5% per year. The Company has also satisfied the 2014, 2015 and 2016 direct
drilling work commitments. Under the current terms of the 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease and
commencing in 2014, the annual rent, if the Company elects not to or fails to incur at least $0.5 million in
exploration expenditures, would be approximately $0.1 million. Because the Company has satisfied
the direct drilling work commitment for 2014, 2015 and 2016, it will not incur annual rental payments in
2014, 2015 or 2016. The Company will be required to expend $0.5 million in additional direct drilling
expenditures in 2017 in order to avoid the annual rental payment requirement.
Pursuant to the 2006 Minerals Lease and Sublease, the Company is subject to a 3% to 5% net smelter
royalty tied to the gold price in the event Newmont elects not to pursue the Venture Option and quitclaims
the claims and leased lands to the Company. The 5% net smelter royalty would apply if the monthly
average gold price is equal to or greater than $400 per ounce. In addition, the Company is subject to a
2.5% net smelter returns royalty payable to the underlying lessor on approximately 800 acres of the
Newmont Leased properties under the 1994 Mining Lease and a 3.5% net smelter returns royalty payable
to the underlying lessor on approximately 495 acres of the Newmont Leased properties under the 1999
Mining Lease; these royalties would offset the Newmont royalty down to 2%.
General
The Company has posted a statewide bond with the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of
Land Management (“BLM”) as required by the State of Nevada in an amount of approximately $5.4 million,
which is currently approximately $235,000 in excess of the current coverage requirement, to reclaim land
disturbed in its exploration and mining operations. Previously the Company posted a reclamation bond
deposit in the amount equal to the bond requirement with the BLM. In November 2013 the Company
replaced the bond deposit by issuing a surface management surety bond in the amount of $5.0 million
through a third-party insurance underwriter, which was increased to $5.4 million in October 2014.
In order to issue the surface management surety bond the Company was required to place 45% of the
original $5.0 million bond ($2,250,000) in a collateral account. No further collateral was required for the
bond increase in October 2014. The funds deposited in the collateral account have been classified as
restricted cash on the Company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2014.
As of September 30, 2014, based on management’s review of the carrying value of mineral rights,
management determined that there is no evidence that the cost of these acquired mineral rights will not be
fully recovered and accordingly, the Company has determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of
mineral rights was required.
As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has not established any proven or
probable reserves on its mineral properties and has incurred only acquisition and exploration costs.

Company’s Board of Directors establish.
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
As of September 30, 2014, 2,250,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value were
authorized with none issued and outstanding.

As of September 30, 2014, 3,284,396 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value were

9% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock
As of September 30, 2014, 7,500,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value were
authorized with none issued and outstanding.
Series E Preferred Stock
On August 5, 2013, the Company designated 15,151 shares of its Series E Preferred Stock. Each share of
Series E Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate
of 3,000 shares of common stock for each share of Series E which is equivalent to a conversion price of
$0.33 per share of common stock, subject to certain adjustments in the event of stock dividends, stock
splits and subsequent equity sales. As discussed below, the Series E conversion price was adjusted
effective October 20, 2014.
The holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis on all matters on
which the holders of the common stock have a right to vote.  The Company may, at any time after
February 8, 2014, redeem all the then outstanding Series E Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal
to 110% of the purchase price for the Series E Preferred Stock, provided that the optional redemption
provisions are met as defined in the certificate of designation.  Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Company, each holder of Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to receive the greater of: (i) 110% of
the purchase price of the Series E Preferred Stock, or (ii) the amount each holder would be entitled to
receive if such holder’s shares of Series E Preferred Stock were converted into common stock.  Upon a
change of control, all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares
of common stock and the holders will also be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to 10% of the
purchase price paid for the Series E Preferred Stock. The Company believes that the occurrence of the
optional redemption is considered a conditional event and as a result the instrument does not meet the
definition of mandatorily redeemable financial instrument based from ASC 480-10-25, “Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity”.

with accredited investors.  The gross proceeds totaled approximately $10.0 million and net proceeds of
approximately $9.9 million after commissions and expenses.
As a result of the October 2014 private placement, the conversion price for the Series E Preferred Stock
has been reduced effective October 20, 2014 from $0.33 to $0.28 per share of Series E Preferred Stock
(the “Adjusted Conversion Price”). Following this adjustment, each share of Series E Preferred Stock is
convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the Series E Original Issue
Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation), of is $990.00, by the Adjusted Conversion Price,
resulting in each share of Series E Preferred Stock being convertible into approximately 3,535.714 shares
of Common Stock. A total of 9,425 shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, and as a result
of the adjustment, are convertible into approximately 33,324,114 shares of Common Stock in the
aggregate, compared to 28,275,000 shares of Common Stock prior to the adjustment. The adjusted
conversion price generated additional value to the convertibility feature of the Series E Preferred Stock.
Accordingly, the Company will record a deemed dividend of approximately $1.7 million for the additional
value of the beneficial conversion feature in October 2014, the period of the adjustment.

ITEM 2    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Pershing Gold Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Pershing Gold”, the “Company” or “we”) is a gold and
precious metals exploration company pursuing exploration and development opportunities primarily in
Nevada.  We are currently focused on exploration at our Relief Canyon properties in Pershing County in
northwestern Nevada.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us may contain
so-called “forward-looking statements,” all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Forward-
looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “plans,” “will,” “forecasts,”
“projects,” “intends,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements include,
without limitation, statements relating to our business goals, planned exploration, business strategy,
planned engineering studies, future operating results, planned permitting activities, our efforts to obtain
extended financing or enter into asset sale or business consolidation transactions, and our liquidity and
capital resources outlook.  Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions.  Our actual results may
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified.  Important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward- looking statements
include without limitation results of future exploration and engineering studies on our Relief Canyon
properties; increases in estimates or costs of exploration and recommissioning activities; our ability to
raise necessary capital to conduct our exploration and recommissioning activities and do so on
acceptable terms or at all; reinterpretations of geological information; problems or delays in permitting or
other government approvals; and the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2013.  One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that
many factors could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements.  These factors may
include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that
are known and some that are not.  No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future
results may vary materially.
Overview
During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we focused primarily on expansion of the Relief
Canyon Mine deposit, advancing towards production at the Relief Canyon Mine and exploring new
targets. An overview of certain significant events follows:
In July 2014, we completed private placements to accredited investors for the purchase of 35,854,259
·
shares of our common stock and 14,341,676 warrants to purchase shares of common stock for aggregate
net proceeds of approximately $10.9 million.
In September 2014, we received final permit approval from the BLM and the Nevada Division of
·
Environmental Protection/Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation authorizing mining within the
existing open pit mine at Relief Canyon.
·In October 2014, we completed a private placement to accredited investors for the purchase of
35,714,287 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $9.9 million.
We commenced drilling on a new target north of the Relief Canyon mine in October 2014. We expect to
·
complete approximately 12 holes for a total of approximately 9,200 feet during the fourth quarter 2014.
In March 2014, we completed an updated estimate of mineralized material at the Relief Canyon Mine
·
totaling 34,062,000 tons of mineralized material at an average grade of 0.019 ounces per ton gold. The
Company’s in-house technical staff calculated the estimate under Industry Guide 7 of the SEC.
In May 2014 we launched our 2014 drilling campaign along the high-wall of the current pit, and within
and north of the existing pit, focused on finding mineable ounces to add to our recently updated estimate
of mineralized material. Through September 30, 2014 we have drilled 64 holes for a total of
·
approximately 38,000 feet under this campaign. For the remainder of the 2014 drilling program, we plan
to drill approximately 35 more holes for a total of approximately 21,000 additional feet. The remaining
holes will be equally divided between continued step-out drilling in the north target and on targets to the
southwest extension of the Relief Canyon deposit.
20
Throughout the period we performed column leach tests on gold-bearing samples from the Relief Canyon
Mine property in order to estimate average gold recovery. In May and June 2014, we reported preliminary
·
results of these tests which show higher gold recoveries than reported by previous operators of the
property and also indicate that the mineralized material leaches relatively quickly.
Results of Operations
Three and Nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
Net Revenues
We are an exploration stage company with no operations and we generated no revenues for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2013, were $4.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The $100,000
increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 is comprised largely of a
$0.9 million increase in exploration expenses on our Relief Canyon properties and an increase of $0.2
million in general and administrative expenses primarily for public company expenses and legal costs in
the current period offset by a $0.8 million decrease in compensation expense related primarily to lower
stock-based compensation expense and fewer shares awarded and a decrease of $0.2 million in
consulting fees.
Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2013, were $10.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The $0.3 million increase
in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is comprised largely of a $2.1
million increase in exploration expenses on our Relief Canyon properties and an increase of $0.2 million
in general and administrative expenses primarily for public company expenses and legal costs in the
current period offset by a $1.5 million decrease in compensation expense related primarily to lower stock-
based compensation expense and fewer shares awarded and a decrease of $0.4 million in consulting
fees.
Loss from Operations
We reported loss from operations of $4.0 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in operating loss was due primarily to the increases in
operating expenses described above.
We reported loss from operations of $10.9 million and $10.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in operating loss was due primarily to the increases in
operating expenses described above.
Other Income (Expenses)
Total other income (expense) was ($900) and ($5,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2014
and 2013, respectively. The change in other income (expense) is primarily attributable to a decrease in
interest expense of $4,100.
Total other income (expense) was ($3,200) and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in other income (expense) of $1.6 million is primarily
attributable to the absence in 2014 of $1.7 million of realized gain from the sale of our Amicor and Valor
Gold securities and a decrease in interest expense of $20,000.
Net Loss
As a result of the operating expense and other income (expense) discussed above, we reported a net loss
of ($4.0) million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to a net loss of ($3.9)
million for the three months ended September 30, 2013.
As a result of the operating expense and other income (expense) discussed above, we reported a net loss
of ($10.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to a net loss of ($9.0)
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
21
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $10.4 million. Our cash and cash
equivalents increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 by $2.7 million from our cash
and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2013 of $7.7 million. The increase in cash and cash
equivalents was primarily the result of net cash provided by financing activities of $10.7 million from the
July 2014 private placements of our common stock partly offset by cash used in operations of $7.9 million
that was comprised largely of exploration expenditures, primarily at the Relief Canyon Mine to establish
our estimate of mineralized material, and general and administrative functions, including consultant fees,
compensation costs, legal fees and public company expenses. Subsequent to the third quarter, we
completed an additional private placement of common stock in October 2014 for approximately $9.9
million net proceeds.
We plan the following expenditures for the remaining quarter of 2014:
$2.8 million on general and administrative expenses (including employee salaries, public company
·
expenses, consultants and land holding costs);
·$0.8 million on exploration drilling to expand the current resource at the Relief Canyon Mine property;
$0.5 million on additional work at the Relief Canyon Mine including further metallurgy results, progress
·
towards an internal economic analysis and pre-development.
·$0.4 million on exploration drilling at our Buffalo Mountain project; and
$0.2 million on additional permitting and bonding, including an Environmental Assessment to expand the
·
open-pit mine at the Relief Canyon Mine property.
The actual amount we spend for the remaining quarter of 2014 may vary significantly from the amounts
specified above and will depend upon several factors, including the results of our exploration and pre-
development work at the Relief Canyon Mine property and timing of obtaining the necessary permitting
approvals. If we continue with our plans to commence mining at Relief Canyon in the second half of 2015,
we expect to require additional external financing to fund exploration and commencement of mining by
mid-2015. This funding could be in the form of equity, debt, asset sales and strategic alternatives,
including potential investors in our projects and potential business combination transactions.  There is no
assurance that we will be successful and if we are not, we will be required to significantly curtail our
activities and possibly cease our business.
In October 2014, we completed a private placement to accredited investors for the purchase of 35,714,287
shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $9.9 million.
Changes in Significant Accounting Policies
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of
Certain Financial Reporting Requirements”. ASU 2014-10 eliminates the distinction of a development
stage entity and certain related disclosure requirements, including the elimination of inception-to-date
information on the statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity. The amendments in
ASU 2014-10 will be effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2014, and interim periods within those annual periods; however early adoption is permitted. We evaluated
and adopted ASU 2014-10 for the interim reporting period ended September 30, 2014.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements—Going
Concern.” The provisions of ASU No. 2014-15 require management to assess an entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in
U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial
doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for
considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement
and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period
of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The
amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for
annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and present the financial statements of the Company and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of subsidiaries
applicable to non-controlling interests.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
balance sheet, and revenues and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ
significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited
to, the useful life of property and equipment, amounts and timing of closure obligations, the assumptions
used to calculate fair value of options and warrants granted, beneficial conversion on convertible notes
payable and preferred stock, capitalized mineral rights, asset valuations, common stock issued for
services, common stock issued for conversion of notes and common stock issued in connection with an
acquisition.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment
Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and
director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or
director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period).
ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange
for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-
based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
“measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the
measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred;
major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are
included in income in the year of disposition. We examine the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed
assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be
recoverable. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets,
generally from one to twenty five years.
Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration Costs
Costs of lease, exploration, carrying and retaining unproven mineral lease properties are expensed as
incurred. The Company has chosen to expense all mineral exploration costs as incurred given that it is
still in the exploration stage. Once the Company has identified proven and probable reserves in its
investigation of its properties and upon development of a plan for operating a mine, it would enter the
development stage and capitalize future costs until production is established. When a property reaches
the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized, using the units-of-production method
over proven and probable reserves.
23
When the Company has capitalized mineral properties, these properties will be periodically assessed for
impairment of value and any diminution in value. To date, the Company has not established the
commercial feasibility of any exploration prospects; therefore, all costs are being expensed.
ASC 930-805, states that mineral rights consist of the legal right to explore, extract, and retain at least a
portion of the benefits from mineral deposits. Mining assets include mineral rights. Acquired mineral rights
are considered tangible assets under ASC 805. ASC 805 requires that mineral rights be recognized at fair
value as of the acquisition date. As a result, our direct costs to acquire mineral rights are initially
capitalized as tangible assets. Mineral rights include costs associated with acquiring patented and
unpatented mining claims and mill sites. If proven and probable reserves are established for the property
and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed, costs will be
amortized using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserve. For mineral rights in
which proven and probable reserves have not yet been established, we assess the carrying values for
impairment at the end of each reporting period and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Long-Lived Assets
We review for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets
may not be recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets”.  An impairment is considered to exist when the sum of expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as
the difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying amount.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations, consisting primarily of estimated mine reclamation and closure costs at the
Company’s Relief Canyon property, are recognized in the period incurred and when a reasonable
estimate can be made, and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Such obligations, which are initially
estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges
to accretion expense. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. Asset retirement
obligations are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from
revisions to the estimated timing or amount of reclamation and closure costs. We review and evaluate the
asset retirement obligations annually or more frequently at interim periods if deemed necessary.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of
structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.
Contractual Obligations

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Finance, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and
procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and
procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.
24
With respect to the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s
management has concluded that certain disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2014.
Changes in Internal Controls.
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three
months ended September 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
