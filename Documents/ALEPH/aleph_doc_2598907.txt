1.  Summary 
Troy Resources Limited (Troy) has prepared this technical report for the Karouni Gold Project (the 
Project) in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” 
and in respect of a preliminary feasibility study (PFS) on the Karouni Gold Project.  The PFS is 
preliminary in nature and is based on an open pit mine on the Smarts and Hicks Deposits that make 
up part of the Karouni Gold Project. It assumes processing on site. The outcome of the PFS will form 
the basis for ongoing exploration and development as well as construction of a mining operation. 
 
1.1  Property Description and Location 
The Karouni Gold Project is located in the central northern portion of Guyana and lies approximately 
180km south-southwest of the capital of Guyana, Georgetown (see Figure 1-1).  
 
The Karouni Gold Project covers approximately 40km along strike of the mineralised Omai - Smarts-
Hicks-Whitehall (Kaburi) Corridor.  This corridor also hosts the historical Omai Gold Mine which is 
located about 35km to the southeast of the Project.  A summary of the key features of the Karouni 
Gold Project are:
•  Hicks Deposit – a near surface Mineral Resource defined in 1996.  Recent infill drilling has
resulted in a new Mineral Resource and Reserve estimate which is documented in this report.
•  Smarts Deposit – an artisanal bedrock gold anomaly where an Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resource was announced in August 2013. Recent infill drilling has resulted in a new Mineral 
Resource and Reserve estimate which is documented in this report.
•  Larken Prospect – a small artisanal open pit in saprolite, approximately 50m wide by 120m in
strike and less than 15m deep, that was mined in the mid to late 1990’s.  The pit lies 
approximately 700m to the northeast of the Hicks Zone and is likely to be a sub parallel 
structure to the one that hosts both the Hicks and Smarts Deposits. A new Inferred Resource 
estimate has been completed based on 2013 - 2014 drilling which is documented in this 
report.
•  Numerous targets and alluvial workings which require further investigation.
1.2  Ownership 
Through its wholly owned subsidiary Pharsalus Gold Inc. (Pharsalus Gold), Troy owns and manages 
the Karouni Gold Project which has an aggregate area of 113,581ha, comprising small, medium and 
large scale tenements.  The permits grant the holders the right to explore for gold and in some cases 
diamonds and/or precious stones.  The tenements have been acquired by either direct grant to 
Pharsalus Gold (10,517ha) or by vendor agreements (103,064ha).  Apart from the Kaburi Agreement 
(11,794ha), which provides for Pharsalus Gold to earn a 90% interest, all other vendor agreements 
once options are exercised will provide Pharsalus Gold with an ultimate interest of 100%.

1.3  Geology and Mineralisation 
Primary gold mineralisation is exposed at several localities within the Karouni Gold Project, the most 
notable being the Hicks, Smarts and Larken Zones along the northern extremity of the Project (see 
Figure 1-3).  Here the White Sand Formation cover has been removed by erosion to expose the 
underlying Palaeoproterozoic greenstone successions which host a mineralised northwest trending, 
sub-vertical to steeply southwest dipping shear zone in the order of 40m to 60m in width.  Extensive 
superficial cover of White Sand Formation within the central and southern portions of the project 
tenements masks the basement lithology and conceals any gold mineralisation.  The evaluation of 
regional airborne geophysical data has however indicated that the Barama-Mazaruni Greenstone 
Belts and associated syntectonic intrusives persist at shallow depth beneath this cover.

Figure 1-3: Karouni Gold Project, Omai-Hicks-Whitehall (Kaburi) Corridor
Secondary gold mineralisation at Eldorado and Whitehall (Kaburi) was mined from partially lithified, 
immature quartz conglomerates and arkoses (presumed to be of Tertiary age), which discontinuously 
overlie mineralised portions of the basement.  Alluvial deposits are also being actively mined along the 
Kuribong and Potaro Rivers (and tributaries) that comprise the south-western project boundary.   
No mineral production is officially recorded within the Karouni Gold Project area, however historic 
records indicate that the Eldorado Vein was worked in 1913 via limited shaft and drift development.  
The Whitehall (Kaburi) Pit is believed to have produced saprolite-hosted and alluvial gold to a depth of 
5m to 15m although no official production records have been compiled. 
 
1.4  Mineral Resource – Mineral Reserve Estimate 
The reported Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves for the Karouni Gold Project have been 
prepared by/or under the supervision of Mr. Peter Doyle and Mr. Richard Maddocks, who are full-time 
employees of Troy. Mr. Doyle has visited the Project site 8 times between May 2013 and July 2014. 
Mr. Maddocks visited the site from October 23 – 30, 2013. 
 
Table 1-1 shows the  Mineral Resource estimate for  the  Karouni Gold Project. This includes  the 
Smarts Deposit, Hicks Deposit and Larken Prospect which are discussed individually later in this 
report.  A  significant portion of  the  Mineral  Resource estimate has  now  been upgraded into  the 
Measured  Category  reflecting  the  increased  understanding  of  the  geology  and  controls  on 
mineralisation, especially at Smarts. This increased understanding has however also resulted in a 
reduction of the Inferred Resource particularly at depth in the Smarts Deposit. Resource outlines 
were  constructed  using  three  dimensional  interpretations  based  on  mineralised  envelopes, 
constructed using logged geology, in particular the shear zone, and a nominal 0.5g/t gold cut-off 
grade with a minimum 2m downhole width and no edge dilution.  Minor zones of internal dilution 
were included to maintain continuity of the resource wireframes. A LIDAR topographic survey was

used to create a topographic surface.  Geological logging was used to create weathering surfaces 
for the top of fresh (tofr) and base of oxidation (boco) surfaces. A base of overburden surface and 
cross-cutting dolerite  dyke were also  interpreted.  All  modelling and  wireframing were completed 
using Vulcan Software.  The estimates for the deposits used standard Vulkcan block models using 
Ordinary Kriging (OK) grade interpolation for Hicks and Smarts and inverse distance squared for 
Larken, within wireframes, and the models have been reported at a 1.0g/t gold cut-off.

The  Mineral  Reserve  estimate  is  summarised  in  Section  15  of  this  report.  The  Mineral  Reserve 
estimate is based on the Mineral Resource estimate described above. The Mineral Reserve estimate 
has only considered Open Pit mining at Smarts and Hicks Deposits. 
 
The Mineral Resource estimate was optimised using proprietary software utilising Lerchs Grossman 
algorithms to produce a series of optimal pit shells. Cost inputs are summarised in the operating costs 
section of this report. The optimal pit shell was based on a gold price of US$1,300/oz. 
 
The  geotechnical  parameters  used  in  the  optimisation  are  tabulated  in  Table  1-2.  The  optimisation 
assumed “ore loss” of 5% and mining dilution of 10%. These are appropriate factors considering the 
average ore width and dip. 
 
A processing recovery of 94% was applied to all ore types.

1.5.1  Overview  
The PFS considers a combination of two open cut mines feeding a conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) 
gold plant with a nominal capacity of 1Mtpa. The PFS assumes that a total of 2.61 million tonnes of 
material  will  be  processed  with  an  average  grade  of  3.84g/t  gold  with  recovered  gold  production  of 
303,521 ounces over a 3 year mine life.
Highlights from the PFS, assuming a gold price for the base case of US$1,250/oz, are as follows (all 
figures in US$ unless otherwise stated):
•  Three  year  open  pit  mine  life  with  annual  average  gold  production  of  101,000  ounces  and
production in the first 12 months of 104,400 ounces.
•  Conventional  CIL  plant  augmented  with  gravity  gold  recovery  treating  a  nominal  1Mtpa
configured to allow easy low cost expansion at a later date.
September 2014
Page 5
•  Approximately 2.6 million tonnes of material to be processed with an average grade of 3.84g/t 
gold.  The  sources  in  terms  of  tonnes  are:  Smarts  -  68%  and  Hicks  -  32%  and  in  terms  of 
contained gold, Smarts - 83% and Hicks - 17%.
•  The Smarts Pit is expected to produce 1,774,000 tonnes of plant feed at 4.70g/t gold, have a
mining strip ratio of 9.6:1 and be mined to a depth of 120m.
•  The  Hicks  Pit  is  expected  to  produce  840,000  tonnes  of  plant  feed  at  2.02g/t  gold,  have  a
mining strip ratio of 4.6:1 and be mined to a maximum depth of 80m. 
Initial  capital  of  $84.6  million  (including  pre-production  mining  costs  of  $11.3  million  and 
contingency of $4.7 million) and sustaining capital and capital spares over the life of mine of 
$6.4 million.
•
•  Assumed metallurgical recovery of 94%. 
•  LOM average C1 Cash Costs (excluding royalties) of $480/oz. 
•  LOM All in Cash Costs of $602/oz. 
•  After tax payback of 1.2 years.  
•  After tax NPV at 6% of $72.0 million. 
•  After tax IRR of 50.2%.
The  Project  licences’  are  considered  highly  prospective  with  only  limited  exploration  having  been 
conducted to date.  Numerous drill targets have already been identified within trucking distance of the 
proposed plant site.
Project Parameters
1.5.2 
The PFS assumes owner mining of the ore feeding a conventional CIL plant. Figure 1-4 shows the 
annualised gold production and mill feed grade.  The Smarts Deposit will be mined as a four stage 
development with the deepest part of the pit being 120m below the surface.
Figure 1-4:  Proposed Gold Production and Mill Feed Grade
The lower grade Hicks Deposit will be mined via 3 small open pits, the deepest of which would extend 
80m.  Using  a  flexible  mining  fleet  with  a  maximum  of  three  excavators,  mining  will  be  scheduled 
between the Smarts and Hicks pits to optimise grade to the mill and earth moving requirements taking 
into account the various strip ratios. At this stage underground mining has not been included in the 
PFS. Drilling is continuing into the Smarts Deeps Target to further define the geometry and extent of 
the  high  grade  shoots.    The  processing  plant  will  be  a  conventional  CIL  with  a  nominal  throughput 
capacity  of  1MTPA.  Ore  will  be  fed  through  a  primary  jaw  crusher  to  a  secondary  cone  crusher. 
Crushed material will be fed to a 3.2 MW ball mill for grinding with material passing through a gravity 
circuit  to  recover  coarse  gold  before  the  addition  of  cyanide.  Gold  solution  will  be  stripped  using

activated carbon and smelted to produce doré on site. The doré will be flown to the Guyana capital, 
Georgetown, for export to a refinery. Waste tailings will be pumped to a tailing facility.
Employees will be housed in an accommodation village located near the processing plant. Employees 
will  work  a  rotating  roster  with  transport  provided  to  and  from  Georgetown.  An  airstrip  will  allow 
contract  flights  to  and  from  Georgetown.  Fresh  water  will  be  stored  in  tanks  and  sourced  from 
rainwater.  Fuel  and  other  consumables  will  be  trucked  in  from  Georgetown  and/or  Linden  along  a 
dedicated access road.
1.5.3  Mining  
Mining  will  commence  approximately  six  months  before  the  processing  plant  is  scheduled  to  be 
commissioned. This will enable removal  of sand overburden  and  adequate high grade stocks to be 
accumulated prior to the commencement of processing.  An initial fleet comprising two excavators and 
up to  8 trucks will commence at the  Smarts and Hicks Deposits. There is  overburden consisting  of 
white sand up to 30m thick covering much of the northern part of Smarts Deposit whereas the Hicks 
Deposit outcrops. Initial production will be predominantly sourced from the Hicks Deposit while Smarts 
overburden is removed. Production will then focus on the higher grade Smarts Deposit. An additional 
fleet  will be mobilised after 3 months to provide further capacity for the  Smarts Deposit. Mining  will 
then progress with three excavator fleets until the pits are complete.
Mining will be done on 2.5m flitches over a 5m high blast. Initial sand overburden removal will be free 
dig with no blasting required (see Table 1-3 below).

1.5.4  Metallurgical Testwork and Recovery 
Communition Testing
Unconfined Compressive Strength results showed that there would be no issues processing any of the 
material tested through a  standard jaw crusher on the basis of required energy. The oxide material 
was classified as very weak, while the primary and shear materials were classed in the range of weak 
to  medium-strong.  The  Crushing  Work  index  results  showed  that  there  will  be  no  identified  issues 
through the crushing circuit. The results ranged from 0.4kWh/t to 17.9kWh/t for one of the sulphide 
samples, with the high sulphide result being classified as hard. The remaining sulphide tests returned 
values of soft to medium, indicating that this was an outlier. The Bond Work index results indicated 
that  all  samples  were  medium  to  hard,  across  all  zones  tested.  The  range  of  values  was  between 
12.57kWh/t and 15.28kWh/t, with the highest value being recorded by the sulphide ore, and the lowest 
by  the  shear  ore.  Rod  mill  work  index  testing  was  conducted  on  the  primary  and  shear  master 
composites. Both results showed the material to be hard, with results of 19.9kWh/t and 17.5kWh/t for 
the primary and shear zones respectively. The primary material showed that there may be some build-
up  of  critical  sized  material.  Due  to  the  lower  grinding  feed  size  and  higher  ball  content  it  is  not 
expected that this will be an issue for the grinding circuit.
Gravity – Cyanidation Leach Optimisation
September 2014
Page 7
A  series  of  tests  were  conducted  to  determine  the  optimal  grind  size  and  cyanide  dosage  for  the 
leaching process. As part of this testing process the effectiveness of the gravity stage was evaluated. 
Initial testing replicated the historical testwork, using a 72 hour leach time. It was determined, after the 
first round of testing, that a 24 hour leach time would be adopted due to negligible improvements in 
leach  recovery  being  achieved  from  longer  leach  times.  The  testwork  program,  conducted  on  the 
oxide, primary and shear master composites, determined that a P80 of 63 microns would be used for 
subsequent testing and throughout the process plant, with a cyanide dosage of 250ppm. Under these 
conditions  all  samples  displayed  fast  leaching  kinetics  and  high  recoveries.  The  gravity  recovery 
varied between the three composites, with the oxide displaying a gravity recovery of around 30%, the 
shear 40% and the primary 60%. The initial evaluation of the master composites for the Project was to 
determine the grind size to be used for further testing. Following on the results observed during the 
historical testing, which indicated that there was an increase in gold extraction as the grind size was 
reduced, it was decided to test three grind sizes, being P80 106, 75 and 45 micron. This would allow 
for a comparison to the previous testing at P80 106 and 75 micron, and also allow for the results at the 
coarser  grind  size  to  be  compared  to  a  finer  grind.  The  results  from  this  series  of  testwork  are 
summarised in Table 1-4 below.

Following  the  results  of  the  initial  optimisation  testwork  it  was  decided  that  additional  work  was 
required to further optimise the process. As seen in Table 1-5, at the 24 hour mark there was a 5% 
increase in gold extracted for the primary material, and a 1.1% increase in the shear material, between 
the P80 75 and 45 micron grind size. As a result of this it was decided that both a P80 63 and 53 
micron grind would be tested on the primary material only, due to its greatest sensitivity to grind size. It 
was  decided  that  the  leach  would  be  undertaken  under  similar  conditions  to  the  earlier  master 
composites tests, with the only change, other than the grind sizes, being the leach time being limited 
to  a  24  hour  leach.  The  key  data  from  the  additional  grind  variation  tests  are  shown  in  Table  1-5 
below.

The  leach  tests  on  the  new  grind  sizes  displayed  a  more  consistent  head  grade  than  the  previous 
tests, and also displayed a greater gravity recovery. The recoveries from gravity, and at all leach time 
intervals, between these two grind sizes however were very similar to each other. It is noted however 
that there is an increase in overall recovery similar to that seen at the P80 45 micron leach compared 
to the P80 75 micron leach. As the P80 75 micron leach showed a very similar recovery in this series 
of  testwork  compared  to  the  historical  testing,  it  is  deemed  that  below  75  micron  on  the  primary 
material  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  gold  that  is  unlocked  and  recoverable  during  the  leach. 
Further  grinding,  below  P80  63  microns,  does  show  a  greater  amount  of  liberation  of  the  gold, 
however not to the same significant increase seen when moving below 75 microns. Based on these 
findings it was determined that a P80 of 63 micron would be used for further testing on the Karouni 
material.
Variability Testing
Variability testing was conducted on 5 primary samples only, due to the amount of available mass for 
this ore zone, and the limited mass of the other ore zones. The variability samples were formed from 
high and low points in the primary zone, as well as over a range of gold grades to assess the effect of 
grade and depth variation. The results show that the gravity recovery ranged between 42% and 79%, 
almost independent of the head grade. Overall recovery ranged from 79% to 97%. There was a slight 
dependence on head grade, with the two lowest head grades displaying the lowest overall recovery. 
The cyanide consumption was low for all samples tested, while the lime consumption was at levels 
below concern. It is thus concluded that there is no undue reagent costs to be incurred for the primary 
ore.
Permitting
1.5.5 
Necessary government approvals are  in  the  process of being finalized.   All required  documentation 
has  been  submitted  and  is  following  the  governmental  internal  process.  The  Minerals  Agreement, 
which is the definitive agreement allowing for project exploitation, tax and royalty issues, importation 
allowances, physical and economic parameters for the extraction and sale of minerals, is in the final 
stages of its approval process.
1.5.6  Capital and Operating Costs 
The estimated capital cost to construct and commission the Project is US$73.3 million, which includes 
a  contingency  of  US$4.7  million.  A  further  US$11.3  million  is  required  for  pre-production  mining, 
including  waste  pre-strip  and  building  a  high  grade  stockpile  ahead  of  treatment  through  the 
processing plant. Sustaining capital over the life of mine is estimated at US$2.4 million and a further 
US$4.0  million  has  been  included  for  working  capital  spares.  These  costs  include  all  procurement, 
delivery and construction direct and indirect costs. The estimates are based on the PFS design and 
are considered to have an accuracy of +10% to -10%.
Operating costs have been developed from first principles following a review of local market conditions 
and are shown in Table 1-6 below.

1.5.7  Royalties and Taxes 
The payment of gross production royalties are provided for by the Guyana Mining Act and the amount 
of royalty to be paid is prescribed by the Minister. As such royalties may be varied from time to time. 
Based on currently prescribed royalties and recent mineral agreements, royalties on gold production 
have been assumed as follows:
•  8% if the gold price is above US$1,000 per ounce; and 
•  5% at a gold price of US$1,000 and less.
Certain tenements in the mining area have an additional vendor royalty of 2%. 
 
The corporate tax rate in Guyana for gold companies is 30%.

1.6  Exploration 
The  PFS  only  considered  Open  Pit  Mineral  Reserves  at  the  Smarts  and  Hicks  Deposits.  Drilling  is 
continuing into Smarts Deeps Target to infill and extend the existing Mineral Resources in this area. 
Drilling is also planned to infill and extend the Larken Inferred Mineral Resource in order to upgrade 
that Mineral Resource estamate to Indicated. 
September 2014
Page 10
The remaining licences are also considered very prospective with numerous targets already identified 
within a 30km radius (see Figure 1-5 below) of the proposed plant site. Troy intends to recommence 
brownfields exploration later in calendar 2014 and believes there is good potential to identify additional 
Mineral Resources.
Figure 1-5:  Karouni Brownfields Exploration Targets within 20km of Processing Plant
1.7  Conclusions and Recommendations 
Given the positive results of the PFS it is recommended that the Smarts – Hicks Open Pit Mine be 
developed. 
 
Additional drilling should be conducted to upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resources estimate on the 
Smarts Deposit so as to enable Mineral Reserves to be estimated. 
 
The Karouni Gold Project area is prospective and under explored. Further exploration is warranted to 
investigate the project potential.  This significant regional Brownfields potential warrants further 
systematic exploration.

medium and large scale tenements west of the Essequibo River (see Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1:  Location of the Karouni Gold Project and East Block Project Area Tenements
4.2  Property Location 
The Karouni Gold Project is centred at 5º37’N and 59º05’W in the central-northern portion of Guyana 
(refer Figure 1-1).  The project lies approximately 180km south-southwest of Georgetown.
4.3  Mineral Tenure 
4.3.1  Guyana Mining Act 
The ownership of all minerals within the Republic of Guyana is vested in the Co-operative Republic of 
Guyana. Correspondingly, the owners of surface title whose rights are governed by the State Lands 
Act (Chapter 61-01) have no mineral rights.
The  Guyana  Mining  Act  of  1989  ("Act"),  and  the  regulations  made  under  the  Act  (“Regulations”) 
empower  and  define  the  duties  of  the  Minister  responsible  for  mining  ("Minister")  and  the  Guyana 
Geology  and  Mines  Commission  ("GGMC")  to  carry  out  the  objects  of  the  Act  and  Regulations 
including the grant of mineral title and supervising the conduct of mining and prospecting operations.  
The  Act  and  Regulations  also  govern  the  rights,  obligations  and  restrcitions  imposed  upon  those 
granted mineral title.  The Minister and GGMC enforce the procedures to be followed in the grant and 
regulation of all mineral titles in Guyana. At the present time the Minister responsible for mining is the 
Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment. 
September 2014
Page 14
The types  of mineral title  granted under  the Act that are relevant to Troy current operations  are as 
follows:
•  Prospecting permits for small scale operations which grant the permit holder the right to carry
out prospecting operations (which is defined as operations carried for or in connection with 
exploration for any mineral) and locate and mark out claim licences;
•  Claim licences which grant the claim holder the right to carry out small scale mining
operations;
•  Prospecting permits for medium scale operations which grant the permit holder the right to
carry out prospecting operations and may be converted into mining permits for medium scale 
mining operations;
•  Mining permits for medium scale operations which grant the permit holder the right to carry out
medium scale mining operations;
•  Prospecting licences which grant the licensee the right to carry out prospecting operations and
may be converted into mining licences for large scale mining operations;
•  Mining licences which grant the licensee the right to carry out large scale mining operations;
and
•  Permission for geological and geophysical survey (“PGGS”) which grant the holder the right to
conduct geological and geophysical surveys over a larger area of land than a prospecting 
licence.
The first four types of titles can only be granted to and held by Guyanese citizens or companies whose 
shareholders are exclusively Guyanese citizens. The last three types of titles may be granted to either 
foreign or Guyanese citizens or entities. Despite the restrictions on foreign ownership for the first three 
title types, it is possible for foreign citizens and entities to enter into exclusive commercial contractual 
arrangements  to  explore  develop  and  mine  within  such  tenements.  The  Civil  Law  of  Guyana  Act 
(Chapter  6-01,  Section  3)  determines  that  English  Common  Law  applies  as  the  common  law  of 
Guyana and accordingly all contractual commercial agreements are based on English Common Law.
The definition of small, medium and large scale operations is prescribed by the Regulations or from 
time  to  time  by  notice  from  the  Minister.    Currently,  small  scale  operations  are  considered  to  be 
operations in which less than 200 cubic metres of material is mined per day, medium scale operations 
in  which  200  to  1,200  cubic  metres  of  material  are  mined  per  day  and  large  scale  operations  are 
operations in which greater than 1,200 cubic metres of material are mined per day.
The period for which mineral titles and the conditions under which titles are granted and renewed are 
stipulated by the Act and are summarised as follows:
•  Prospecting  permits  for  small  scale  and  medium  scale  operations  are  granted  for  one  year 
and are essentially renewable indefinitely once application for renewal is made and prescribed 
fees  paid  to  the  GGMC.    However,  once  the  holder  discovers  a  “mineral  of  anomalous 
occurrence"  (a  term  which  not  defined  under  the  Act)  an  application  for  a  claim  licence  or 
mining  permit  must  be  made  to  the  GGMC  within  60  days  (or  such  longer  period  as  the 
GGMC may allow) of the discovery or the prospecting permit shall lapse.
•  Claim  licences  for  small  scale  operations  are  granted  for  one  year  and  may  be  renewed 
indefinitely. However, the GGMC may not renew a claim licence if it has reasonable grounds 
to believe that an applicant for renewal does not intend to carry on in good faith, within the 
limits of their competence and resources, mining operations within the claim licence.  The Act 
defines mining operations in broad terms as "operations carried out for or in connection with 
the mining of minerals".
•  Mining permits for medium scale operations are granted for five years and may be renewed 
for  successive  periods  of  not  greater  than  five  years  or  the  life  of  the  mineral  deposit 
whichever is shorter.  However, the GGMC may not renew a mining permit if it has reasonable 
grounds  to  believe  that  an  applicant  for  renewal  does  not  intend  to  carry  on  in  good  faith, 
within the limits of their competence and resources, mining operations within the permit.
September 2014
Page 15
•  Prospecting licences are granted for a period of three years and may be renewed twice for a 
period  of  one  year.    Grant  and  renewal  of  prospecting  licences  are  subject  to  the 
applicant/licensee  having  sufficient  financial  and  technical  capacity  to  carry  out  prospecting 
operations, 
the  applicant's/licensees  proposed  annual  prospecting  operations  being 
considered  adequate  by  the  GGMC  and  the  applicant/licensee  having  made  adequate 
provision for the employment and training of Guyanese citizens.  In addition the GGMC may 
grant or renew a prospecting licence under any special circumstances that it deems adequate 
or warranted by exceptional circumstances.
•  Within  30  days  of  the  discovery  of  "a  mineral  of  anomalous  occurrence"  the  holder  of  a 
prospecting licence must notify the GGMC of the discovery in writing and promptly undertake 
to quantify the mineral occurrence.  Within a further 30 days after the initial discovery notice, a 
licensee must notify the GGMC whether or not he considers the discovery to be of commercial 
interest after which a licensee may at any time within one year from the notice of commercial 
interest apply for a mining licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing the GGMC with the Ministers 
approval may allow the licensee further time which the GGMC considers reasonable for the 
licensee to apply for a mining licence. If the licensee applies for a mining licence in line with 
this  procedure  and  the  application  otherwise  complies  with  the  Act  and  Regulations  the 
Minister must grant a mining licence to the licensee over the area applied for.
•  Mining  licences  may  be  granted  for  a  period  of  20  years  and  subsequent  renewals  are  for 
periods not exceeding 7 years.  Renewals may be refused if the licensee is in default of the 
Act or the Regulations.
•  An application for a mining licence requires the applicant to submit a detailed proposal for the 
establishment and conduct of mining operations, all supporting data and any other particulars 
as  may  be  prescribed.  A  mining  licence  requires  its  holder  to  carry  out  development  and 
mining  operations  in  accordance  with  the  forgoing  detailed  proposal,  and  duly  notify  the 
GGMC upon the commencement of production.  Other conditions that are currently prescribed 
are:
•  approval  of  an  environmental  impact  statement  by  the  Guyana  Environmental
• 
• 
•
Protection Agency; 
the submission of an adequate mine closure plan in accordance with the Regulations; 
compliance with obligations to keep accurate production records; and 
the submission of half-yearly and annual reports to the GGMC on all prospecting and 
mining operations.
•  The Minister may grant a PGGS for the purpose of geological and geophysical surveys or any 
other investigation in Guyana or any part of it, which the Minister considers relevant for the 
prospecting or mining of minerals on terms and conditions that may be negotiated between 
the Minister and the applicant for the PGGS.
•  Typically  the  holder  of  a  PGGS  has  the  exclusive  right  to  file  applications  for  a  number  of 
prospecting licences (as negotiated and defined by the terms of a PGGS) located within the 
area of a PGGS at any time prior to the expiry of the PGGS.  The granting of a time extension 
to a PGGS may be negotiated but the grant of such extensions is solely at the discretion of the 
Minister.
For all of the above types of title, the mineral to be mined or prospected for must be specified by an 
applicant for mineral title and the title  documents will state the mineral or minerals for which title is 
granted. Furthermore the holder of a prospecting  permit or prospecting licence may in general only 
apply for a claim licence, mining permit or mining licence for the mineral or minerals the subject of the 
preceding prospecting permit or licence.
Regulations defining the size of and fees payable for each type of mineral title are prescribed by the 
Minister and may be varied from time to time.  Currently the fees and prescribed sizes of the various 
mineral titles are as follows:
September 2014
Page 16
•  Prospecting permits for small scale operations cost US$5.00 per year and allow prospecting 
operations for the location of claim licences for small scale operations within any part of any 
one of the five mining districts in Guyana.
•  Claim licences may be no larger than 800 feet (243.8m) by 1,500 feet (457.2m) and may not
be located within other previously existing granted mineral title.  The annual fee for claim 
licences is US$5.00 per licence.
•  Prospecting permits for medium scale operations may be between 150 and 1,200 acres.
Annual fees commence at US$0.25 per acre and increase by US$0.10 per acre upon each 
subsequent annual renewal.
•  Mining permits for medium scale operations may be between 150 and 1,200 acres. Annual
fees are US$1.00 per acre.
•  Prospecting licences may be no larger than 12,800 acres. Annual fees are US$0.50 per acre 
during the first year, US$0.60 per acre during the second year and US$1.00 per acre for the 
third year and for each of year of the two subsequent renewals.  The holders of prospecting 
licences are required to submit annual work plans and budgets for approval by the GGMC.  A 
performance bond of 10% of each annual work budget must be posted by the licensee each 
year.
•  Mining licences require the payment of annual fees of US$3.00 per acre for Guyanese
Companies and US$5.00 per acre. As most mining licences are granted subsequent to a 
prospecting licence they typically may be no larger than 12,800 acres.
•  Permissions for geological and geophysical survey may be of any size and fees of any amount
as negotiated between the Minister and the permit holder.
The payment of gross production royalties are provided for by the Act and the amount of royalty to be 
paid is prescribed by the Minister.  As such royalties may be varied from time to time.  Currently, the 
prescribed royalties on gold production are ad valoren of gross production sales at the following rates:
•  For claim licences  5%; 
•  For mining permits for medium scale operations 5%; 
•  For mining licences 5%, however recent mineral agreements entered into stipulate a royalty of
8% if the gold price is above US$1,000 per ounce.
The  Act  makes  broad  provision  for  the  GGMC,  with  approval  of  the  Minister,  to  enter  into  mineral 
agreements with applicants for, or holders of, prospecting and mining licences with respect to:
•  The conditions to be included in the licence as granted, applied for or renewed. 
•  The procedure to be followed by the GGMC while exercising any discretion conferred to it by
the Act.
•  Any matter incidental to or connected to a licence.
At  present,  it  is  usual  for  two  mineral  agreements  to  be  entered  into.    One  applicable  to  the  early 
stages  of  prospecting  operations  and  the  other  prior  to  the  grant  of  a  mining  licence  or 
commencement of mining operations.
Such mineral agreements provide incentives, define the fiscal regime and ensure the stability of the 
incentives  and  the  fiscal  regime  for  the  entire  term  of  a  prospecting  licence  or  for  a  set  period 
(currently 15 years) for a mining licence.  While it is possible for provisions of a mineral agreement to 
be negotiated it has been the practice of the GGMC and the Minister to provide the same terms and 
conditions at any one time for all holders of or applicants for prospecting and mining licences.
Currently  the  holders  of  prospecting  licences  are  granted  the  following  incentives  under  mineral 
agreements:
September 2014
Page 17
•  Zero rating on all customs duties, VAT and excise taxes on the purchase and importation of all
equipment and supplies to be used directly in prospecting operations with the exception of 
food and office equipment apart from computers.
•  Exemption from all excise tax on fuel used in prospecting operations.   
•  10% rating on consumption tax for aviation fuel.
Currently mineral agreements entered into prior to the grant of mining licences or the commencement 
of mining operations ensure the following incentives and fiscal regime:
•  Zero rating on all customs duties, VAT and excise taxes on the purchase and importation of all
equipment supplies, consumables, and spares to be used directly in mining operations.
•  Exemption from all excise tax on fuel used in mining operations. 
•  10% rating on consumption tax for aviation fuel. 
•  Consignment of the above incentives to contractors of the company who provide services
directly in support of mining operations.
•  Zero rating on VAT for payments to certain contractors such as drilling or mining contractors. 
•  Corporate tax rate of 30%. 
•  Exemption from withholding taxes on dividends and interest payments to the parent company
•  Deductibility of royalty payments against corporate taxes. 
•  Offset of the cost of certain infrastructural works of general benefit to Guyana against the
or other offshore entities.
mineral royalty.
US$1,000 per ounce.
•  Royalty of 5% if the gold price is below US$1,000 per ounce and 8% if the gold price is above
•  Capitalisation of prospecting costs.   
•  20% straight line depreciation. 
•  Stability of royalties, incentives and tax rates for the term of the licence, the life of the deposit
or for 15 years whichever is shorter.
4.4  Ownership 
Azimuth, formerly Epsilon Energy Limited, announced positive completion of due diligence in relation 
to the acquisition of Takatu Minerals Limited (Takatu) on 3 November 2009 resulting in the acquisition 
by  Epsilon  of  the  projects  controlled  by  Takatu;  including,  among  others,  the  Karouni  Gold  Project 
(formerly known as the West Omai Gold Project) in central Guyana.  In July 2013 Troy completed a 
takeover  of  Azimuth.  Troy  holds  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  tenement  rights  through  Pharsalus  Gold 
Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsdidiary of Troy (see Figure 4-2).

The Karouni Gold Project tenements cover an aggregate area of 270,706 acres (113,581ha), granting 
the holders the right to explore for gold or gold and diamonds. The tenements have been acquired by 
either  direct  grant  to  (Pharsalus  Gold)  (25,990  acres  /10,517ha)  or  by  contractual  agreements  with 
tenement  holders  (254,668  acres  103,064ha).  Apart  from  the  Kaburi  Agreement  (29,143  acres 
11,794ha),  which  provides  for  Pharsalus  Gold  to  earn  a  90%  interest,  all  other  vendor  agreements 
provide Pharsalus Gold with the right to obtain an ultimate interest of 100%.
The  Karouni  Gold  Project  comprises  a  single  (large  scale)  mining  licence,  94  (small  scale)  claim 
licences, 220 (medium scale) prospecting and mining permits, and 6 (large scale) prospecting licences 
as  shown  in  Table  4-1.    All  licences,  permits  and  claims  are  granted  for  either  gold  or  gold  and 
diamonds.  The  (large  scale)  prospecting  licences  include  three  licences  won  by  Pharsalus  Gold  at 
open auction on 22 November 2007 (GS14: P-18, P-19 and P-20) and which are owned 100% by the 
Company.
The tenements were granted and held in good standing at the time of this report.

* Pharsalus Gold has the right to explore and acquire the tenements under various option agreements.  The agreements require the future 
payment of cash and/or shares, and/or exploration expenditure commitments.  Pharsalus Gold has not to date satisfied all the payment 
obligations under the respective agreements, or satisfied the minimum exploration expenditure commitments.  
 
** The “Shani” small claim is subject to a title dispute between the registered tenement holder (Brian Chase) and the GGMC. Due to its location, 
prospectivity, and size, it is not considered material to the Karouni Gold Project.

GPS and are marked by cut-lines and corner boards. The single large scale mining licence number 2 
of 2009, originally granted as MD9/39/16 No 641, has been surveyed via GPS, and is marked by a 
notice and defined by cut-lines.
•  The 41 small scale claim licences have all been surveyed by GPS and are defined by cut-lines and

require holders of prospecting and mining permits to lodge ‘environmental bonds’ with the Guyana Geology 
and  Mines  Commission  (GGMC)  to  cover  the  costs  of  restoring  the  environment  in  case  of  malpractice.  
Bonds are repayable if no damage is found.  Social impact assessments are also required as part of the EIA. 
Existing environmental bonds held by GGMC to the credit of Pharsalus Gold in respect of mining licences, 
prospecting  licences  (large-scale),  and  mining  permits  under  the  control  of  Pharsalus  Gold  are  detailed  in

Bonds for applicable West Kaburi (Harding) & Pereira tenements were lodged by, and are still registered in the name 
of the original tenement holder, and are not held by GGMC to the credit of Pharsalus Gold.
Upon granting of licences/permits in each of the above tenement categories, the GGMC enters into a formal 
standard environmental management agreement (“EMA”) with the tenement holder. At this time, the tenement 
holder must lodge an environmental bond in cash with the GGMC.  The EMA sets out specific protocols for 
licence/permit holders in relation to activities such as exploration disturbances, mining excavation, limited 
deforestation, removal and stockpiling of topsoil, sediment loading in adjacent waterways, and the control of 
hazardous wastes.  Once the area disturbed is restored / rehabilitated to the standard required and approved 
by GGMC, the environmental bond will normally be refunded. 
 
Troy is aware of a potential environmental issue related to alluvial mining surface distrubance caused by local 
illegal miners on the P20 tenement. Troy is working with government authorities to resolve the issue. The 
matter is currently under review by the GGMC and discussions with governmental officals are ongoing. Troy is 
not aware, nor has been made aware, of any other environmental liabilities associated with the Karouni Gold 
Project.   The title documents include no specific environmental requirements beyond those required under 
the Guyana Mining Act and associated regulations. 
The site visit to Karouni Gold Project identified significant environmental disturbance associated with areas of 
historic and current formal and informal small scale mining, particularly at the Hicks Deposit, Eldorado  and 
Whitehall Prospects.  It is understood that the various agreements between Pharsalus Gold and the vendors 
incorporate  a  clause  leaving  existing  environmental  liabilities  with  the  vendors.    In  all  other  cases, 
environmental liability under the Mining and Environmental Protection Acts will lie with Troy.
Troy  is  progressing  through  the  established,  prescribed  permitting  process  to  obtain  all  of  the  required 
environmental approvals to develop the Project.

5.  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and
Physiography
5.1  Topography, Elevation, Vegetation and Land Use 
The Karouni Gold Project is dominated by gently undulating terrain at elevations ranging from 50m to 100m 
above sea level.  The area is drained by a dendritic network of moderately incised small streams and creeks.  
The  Project  area  is  veneered  entirely  by  tropical  lowland  forest  (see  Figure  5-1)  with  the  canopy  height 
ranging  from  approximately  20m  to  50m.    Aside  from  logging  tracks,  the  forest  cover  has  essentially  been 
preserved by very selective logging practices.
Figure 5-1:  Karouni Gold Project Looking Northwest
5.2  Climate 
 
The Karouni Gold Project experiences a tropical monsoonal climatic regime, consistent with Guyana’s location 
between 2º and 8º north of the equator.  The climate is characterised by hot, wet summers and warm, damp 
winters.  The annual average rainfall approximates 2,500mm, concentrated in two wet seasons respectively 
extending from May to July and November to January.  Average maximum temperatures show little seasonal 
variation, averaging 27ºC, tempered by year-round trade winds.  Maximum temperatures rarely exceed 28ºC 
on the more elevated Pakaraima Plateau 100km to the west.  The length of exploration field season is all year 
round with occasional interruptions by rain during the wet season.
5.3  Access 
The Karouni Gold  Project  is located  approximately  180km south-southwest of  Georgetown.   The  Project  is 
situated  in  a  remote  area  with  no  established  population  centres  within  the  Project  area  aside  from  small 
portable mining alluvial camps/operations. The nearest town is Linden to the north-northest on the road route 
from Georgetown to site (5 - 6hr drive from Hicks Camp). The Project can be accessed by 4WD car or truck 
form  either  Bartica  or  Georgetown.    Access  from  Bartica  is  via  the  Bartica-Potaro  Road,  taking  the  Issano 
Branch Road 135km from Bartica to the small settlement of 14 Mile, thence via a further 5.5km of bush track 
to Hicks Camp.  The journey from Bartica to the Hicks Deposit takes approximately seven hours.  Alternative 
access from Georgetown is gained via Sherima Crossing, a journey of approximately 7-10 hours.  The Project
September 2014
Page 37
can also be accessed via helicopter to a pad constructed at the Hicks Camp.  Topography and existing road 
access  to  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  are  displayed  on  Figure  5-2.  In  early  2014,  Troy  completed  the 
construction and permitting of the site airstrip.
Construction  of  an  access  road  connecting  the  proposed  Amalia  hydropower  project  site  to  the  existing 
Bartica-Potaro Road started in the first quarter of 2011.  The completed road runs through the Karouni Gold 
Project area. Troy has completed road access from the Hicks Camp to the new Amalia Falls Road.
Figure 5-2:  Topography and Roads Relevant to the Karouni Project
Infrastructure and Services
5.4 
The  population  within  the  Project  area  is  limited  to  small  gold  mining  camps.  Aside  from  the  road  and 
helicopter  access  described  above,  infrastructure  within  the  Project  area  is  essentially  non-existent.  The 
Project is serviced by an exploration camp located at the Hicks Zone that can accommodate up to 100 people 
(see Figure 5-3).The new mine development will be operated on diesel generated power.
The main administration office and warehouse will be located adjacent to the processing facility. The office will 
house  all  administration  and  technical  staff.  The  warehouse  will  carry  all  necessary  spare  parts  and 
consumables  for  daily  operational  requirements.  An  accommodation  village  for  300  personnel  will  be 
constructed to the south of the processing facility and adjacent to the airstrip. The village will have facilities for 
accommodating 30 personnel in ensuited type units. The village will include messing facilities for meals and 
access to satellite television and telephones. 
 
The  processing  plant  will  require  electrical  energy  and  water  to  operate.  The  expected  level  of  electrical 
energy use is ~5.7MW with electricity supplied from a Troy owned and operated diesel powered generating 
facility.  The  power  generation  capability  will  be  made  up  of  5  diesel  gensets  of  2MW  capacity  each.  The 
powerhouse will be located adjacent to the processing plant. Diesel will be trucked in from Georgetown and 
stored in a dedicated storage facility onsite.
September 2014
Page 38
A  facility  for  storing  160,000  liters  of  diesel  fuel  will  be  constructed  adjacent  to  the  processing  plant.  The 
facility  will  be  fully  bunded  and  will  deliver  fuel  to  the  powerhouse.  In  addition,  there  will  be  provision  for 
refuelling light vehicles. Another storage facility will be located at the laydown and workshop area. This facility 
will be utilised for refuelling the open pit. 
 
A fresh water storage facility will be constructed to hold potable water.  In addition, a process water facility will 
also  be  constructed.  The  water  usage  will  initially  be  high  until  the  tailings  return  water  has  stabilized. 
Expected  use  of  process  water  is  ~800,000m3/a  to  cover  wash  down,  camp,  mine  and  other  uses. 
Approximately  45%  of  the  process  water  is  expected  to  be  returned  from  the  TSF.  The  remainder  will  be 
derived from pit de-watering, a bore field and possibly small dams. Guyana is a very high rain fall area and a 
lack of water is not seen as a potential issue.
Waste rock dumps will be located to the north-east of the Hicks and Smarts Deposits. The Smarts Deposit 
dump will consist of one main dump whereas the Hicks Deposit dumps will be located adjacent to each of the 
pits. Top soil and oxidised waste material will be stored until completion of the dumps and then spread over 
them in order to enable rehabilitation and revegetation of the completed dumps.
The tails storage facility will be accommodated in a natural valley located to the south-west of the main Smarts 
and Hicks Deposits. A compacted, earthern embankment will contain the tails. The tails dam will be designed 
to hold all of the planned tails discharge from the processing plant over the forecast 3 year mine life.

6.  History 
6.1  Historical Background 
Portions of the Karouni Gold Project have been held more or less continuously by small family gold mining 
syndicates (locally termed ‘Pork Knockers’) since the 1960’s.  This situation persists to the present day.
Portions of the current Project area  were  variously held  under option to purchase agreements by Cominco 
(1974-1975), Overseas Platinum Corporation (1988) and Cathedral Gold Corporation (1993-2002).
In 1999, Cathedral Gold corporate joint ventured the property to Cambior Inc., then owner and operator of the 
Omai  Gold  Mine  located  40km  to  the  east,  with  a  view  to  processing  the  Hicks  mineralisation  through  the 
Omai processing facility.  Cambior intended to use its existing mining fleet, rather than road trains, to haul mill 
feed  from  the  Hicks  Zone.    Execution  of  this  approach  proved  uneconomic  and  disruptive  to  the  mining 
schedule at Omai itself.  No further work was undertaken and the joint venture was terminated in 2000.
In 2002, Cathedral Gold Corporate became a service company to the oil and gas sector and spun its gold and 
base  metals  assets  into  a  new  company  called  Imperial  Metals  Inc.    Imperial  Metals  has  maintained  an 
interest in the Hicks Zone to the present day and, under its agreement with Troy, retains a 1% net smelter 
return (NSR) royalty in the Project, applicable after the initial 200,000oz of gold production.
Azimuth, formerly Epsilon Energy Limited, announced the acquisition of Takatu Minerals Limited (Takatu) on 3 
November  2009  resulting  in  the  acquisition  by  Epsilon  of  the  Projects  including  the  Karouni  Gold  Project 
(formerly known as the West Omai Gold Project) in central Guyana.  In July 2013, Troy completed a takeover 
of  Azimuth.  Troy  holds  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  tenement  rights  through  Pharsalus  Gold  Inc.,  an  indirect, 
wholly owned subsdidiary of Troy.
6.2  Past Exploration Work 
The Eldorado Vein was worked in 1913 via limited shaft and drift development.  A review of historic reports 
indicate that a single vein some 0.5m in width and grading between 23g/t gold and 37g/t gold was worked to a 
depth of 12m along a strike length of around 90m.
In  1933,  the  Geological  Survey  Department  of  British  Guiana  investigated  an  area  of  approximately  600 
square miles along an area to the West of the Kaburi River.  The exact boundary of this survey is not shown in 
the final report (Grantham et. al., 1933).  The investigation included field mapping, soil sampling and washing 
and collection of rock specimens.  A total of 70 microscope slide were prepared from the rock samples and a 
further 30 slides from sands and washed sample concentrate.
In  1947,  the  Geological  Survey  drilled  three  Diamond  Core  holes  at  the  Eldorado  Target  spaced  at 
approximately 120m intervals along strike.  Core recoveries were reportedly extremely poor but nonetheless 
defined a 2m wide  zone of veining  and silicification  at the contact between  “white clay”  and carbonaceous 
clay.  No core was preserved and no assays are recorded.
In  1959,  the  Eldorado  Target  was  described  by  a  geological  survey  team  as  quartz  veinlets  and  stringers 
developed over a width of at least 30m, hosted by black carbonaceous clay.
In 1962, the Larken Zone was described by a geological survey team as a 1.2m wide zone, extending over a 
strike  length  of  150m  to  180m,  exposed  in  several  short  trenches.    Panning  of  crushed  material  revealed 
considerable gold, however no assays are recorded.
In 1963, the British Guyana Geological Survey completed a geochemical survey over the Hicks Zone defining 
a 60m wide zone of high chromium values over a strike length of at least 400m.  This anomaly is interpreted to 
reflect  the  high  magnesian  basalt  incorporated  within  the  basement  greenstone  succession  comprising  the 
Hicks Zone, and is consistent with the presence of fuchsite alteration.
In  1968  the  Hicks  –  Eldorado  - Whitehall  (Kaburi)  Goldfield  was  investigated  with  the  dominant  control  on 
mineralisation  reported  as  a  band  of  carbonaceous  meta-sediments  which  contained  “good  grades 
throughout” and  that  elevated chromium values (presumably associated  with fuchsite alteration) provided  a 
reliable guide to higher gold values.

During 1974 - 1975, Cominco completed geological mapping and geochemical surveys, and drilled 64 25/8” 
auger holes (1,442m) and two AX Diamond Core holes (240m) at the Hicks Zone.
In  1988,  Overseas  Platinum  Corporation  (OPC)  completed  a  program  of  geochemical  and  geophysical 
surveys, geological mapping, shallow trenching, auger drilling and 10 Diamond Core holes.  This exploration 
was  primarily  designed  to  assess  the  platinum  potential  of  the  chrome  anomaly  associated  with  the  Hicks 
Zone, at which time the company identified and refocused exploration on gold mineralisation.
In  1989,  Denison  Mines  Guyana  Limited  through  option  agreements  with  local  vendors  conducted  a 
systematic mapping, stream sediment program (1,002 samples), soil sampling program (1,646 samples) and 
airborne magnetometer survey.  Soil samples were collected on a 200m x 50m grid and delineated a broad 
region of approximately 1.5km by 4km of anomalous soils in the vicinity of the Whitehall - Kaburi Target (see 
Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1:  Denison 1989 Whitehall Kaburi Soil Sampling Results (White Sand Formation shown in tan)
In  1993,  Cathedral  Gold  Corporation  (Cathedral  Gold)  optioned  the  Whitehall  (Kaburi)  -  Eldorado  Targets 
(including  the  Hicks  Zone),  completing  an  initial  program  of  surface  trenching,  mapping  and  sampling, 
resulting in the excavation of 30 trenches at 25m to 150m spacing, and to an average depth of approximately 
2m, over the Hicks Zone.  This work defined a northwest trending zone of semi-continuous gold mineralisation 
over  a  1,600m  strike  length,  within  a  zone  of  deformation  and  alteration  averaging  some  44m  in  width.  
Significant intervals recorded from trench channel sampling appear to represent the only valuable information 
remaining (see Figure 6-2).
September 2014
Page 41
The  only  information  available  on  trench  channel  sampling  completed  by  OPC  and  Cathedral  Gold  is  that 
consistent 1m sample lengths were reportedly adopted, with the single exception of Cathedral Gold trench 93-
19, where there are several intervals of 1.75m in length.  While the sample preparation, analysis and security 
aspects  associated  with  the  Cathedral  Gold  trench  channel  sampling  and  diamond  drilling  are  again  not 
formally documented, it is reasonably presumed that the approach was identical to that adopted for the “super 
pit” samples described below, however this cannot be substantiated.
Figure 6-2:  Karouni Gold Project – Hicks Zone Trenching
In 1994, Cathedral Gold completed 39 Diamond Core holes (3,901.7m) at the Hicks Zone on 100m spaced 
traverses, with two holes completed on each line.  Additional trenching was carried out on the southeast and 
northwest ends of the Hicks Zone and followed up by limited drill testing where warranted.  Other programs 
included magnetic and IP geophysical surveys and hand auger/soil sampling.
In  1995,  Cathedral  Gold  completed  a  further  19  Diamond  Core  holes  in  two  campaigns  at  the  main  Hicks 
Zone,  designed  to  infill  selected  sections  on  a  50m  line  spacing.    The  orientation  of  mineralised  zones 
comprising the Hicks Zone is well established, and it is estimated that the true width of mineralised intercepts 
reported in Table 6-1 represents some 60% to 70% of the downhole intervals.  Additional ground magnetic 
surveys were completed over the entire property at 100m line spacing, infilling to a 50m line spacing over the 
Hicks  Zone.    Previously  untested  magnetic  anomalies,  primarily  within  the  Eldorado  Batholith  and  at  the 
southeast extremity of the Hicks Zone, were followed up with infill hand-auger sampling, trenching and drilling.

The majority of the Cathedral Gold Diamond Core is located within collapsed core racks and scattered over 
the site at the Hicks Camp. This drill core cannot be salvaged in any meaningful manner and is unsuitable for 
further  use.  Examination  of  the  Cathedral  Gold  Diamond  Core  remaining  at  the  Hicks  Camp  indicates  that 
selected mineralised intervals were cut using a diamond saw, with half-core bagged for analysis.  The drilling 
database  indicates  a  considerable  range  of  sample  lengths  up  to  a  general  maximum  of  2m,  with  very 
occasional intervals (presumably internal waste) up to a maximum of 7.06m in length. For details of the 1994 
– 1995 Cathedral Gold Diamond Drilling Gold Assay intercepts refer to Section 6 of the NI-43101 Technical 
Report “Preliminary Economic Evaluation West Omai Gold Project dated February 28, 2014.
Also  in  1995,  Cathedral  Gold  excavated  a  pit,  termed  the  ‘Super  Pit’,  at  the  Hicks  Zone  adjacent  to  the 
existing  Blackwater  Pit previously  worked by  artisanal miners.  The pit measured 80m in length by  14m in 
width  by  3.8m  in  depth  and  approximately  4,000m3  (6,800t)  of  material  was  excavated  and  placed  on  the 
periphery  of  the  pit  to  preserve  the  mineralised  material  and  protect  the  pit  from  rainwater  influx  and  the 
adjacent  hydraulic  mining  operations.    The  pit  floor  was  gently  sloped,  and  a  drain  installed  inside  the 
periphery of the pit to preserve the floor for sampling. 
Considerable  mapping  detail  and  sampling  within  the  “Hicks  Super  Pit”  was  undertaken  and  the  resulting 
maps and sample locations are still available.  The sampling maps provide an indication of saprolite grades 
and the continuity of gold mineralisation in oxide material.  Mapping results from the “Hicks Super Pit” shows 
that mineralisation (in plan-view) occurs in lenses; while historical drillhole 94-30 which intercepts this zone at 
depth illustrates that the zones are also lensoidal with depth.
In  January  1996,  a  preliminary  mineralisation  estimate  was  undertaken  for  the  Hicks  Zone.    Further 
exploration  included  limited  regional  exploration  to  identify  additional  mineralisation  to  compliment  that 
identified at the Hicks Zone, however exploration was largely suspended during 1997 due to a declining gold 
price and an inability to access capital.
In 1998, Cathedral Gold joint ventured the property to Cambior Inc., owner and operator of the Omai Gold 
Mine  located  35km  to  the  east,  with  a  view  to  processing  the  Hicks  Zone mineralisation  through  the  Omai 
processing  facility.    Cambior  constructed  an  access  road  between  the  two  projects  and  completed  22 
confirmatory  Diamond  Core  holes  at  Hicks  (1,118m),  prior  to  preparing  a  Mineral  Resource  estimate  and 
undertaking preliminary “internal” mining studies.  Cambior Inc. intended to use its existing mining fleet, rather 
than road trains to haul mill feed from the Hicks Zone, however execution of this approach proved uneconomic 
and disrupted the mining schedule at Omai Mine itself.  No further work was undertaken and the joint venture 
was terminated in 2000.  A total of 9,463m of trench and channel sampling and 17,191m of Diamond Core 
drilling in 93 holes were completed by Cathedral Gold and Cambior Inc. during the period 1992 to 2000.
Between 2000 and 2003, the GGMC completed two separate (yet systematic) investigative programs covering 
the  current  Karouni  Gold  Project  (see  Figure  6-3).    These  programs  involved  GIS  database  compilation, 
geological mapping, stream sediment sampling, rock chip sampling and petrology.  Stream sediment sampling 
a sampling density of one site per 6.5km2, with -30# BLEG and panned concentrate samples collected from 
each site.  The samples were analysed for gold, silver, copper, platinum and palladium.  While an extensive 
cover of White Sand Formation masked the basement geochemical response over much of the Project area, 
clusters  of  gold  values  >200ppb  gold  from  the  -80#  samples  are  clearly  associated  with  known  gold 
occurrences wherever the Barama-Mazuruni Greenstone Belts are exposed (see Figure 6-3).  These clusters 
coincide with the Hicks, Eldorado and Whitehall (Kaburi) Prospects, where respective recorded -80# sample 
maxima are 2,670ppb gold, 1,850ppb gold and 4,530ppb gold.
Similarly, the BLEG results generated local sample maxima of 2,330ppb gold, 63ppb gold and 376ppb gold at 
the  Hicks,  Eldorado  and  Whitehall  (Kaburi)  Targets  respectively.    Local  BLEG  maxima  associated  with 
tributaries along the Kuribong River, representing the southern project boundary, include 53ppb gold, 171ppb 
gold and 68ppb gold.  These results may reflect alluvial material associated with the Kuribong River itself.

Figure 6-3:  Karouni Gold Project – GGMC Stream Sediment Gold Geochemistry
Azimuth, formerly Epsilon Energy Limited, announced the acquisition of Takatu Minerals Limited (Takatu) on 3 
November  2009  resulting  in  the  acquisition  by  Epsilon  of  the  Projects  including  the  Karouni  Gold  Project 
(formerly known as the West Omai Gold Project) in central Guyana. Takatu Minerals had assembled the land 
package that is the Karouni Gold Project but did not conduct any field exploration.
Modern exploration resumed on the Karouni Gold Project in 2010 when Azimuth commenced a program that 
included;  prospecting,  geological  mapping,  geochemical  sampling,  rock  sampling,  trenching,  channel 
sampling as well as Reverse Circulation (RC), Aircore (AC) and Diamond Core (DC) drilling.
Azimuth’s drilling campaigns to date have targeted mainly the Hicks and Smarts Deposits with limited tests of 
satellite targets such as further campaigns at Whitehall (Kaburi), Larken and a number of other prospects.  For 
the purposes of this report the database close-out is considered to be April 30, 2014. Since March 2013, Troy 
has managed the drilling with all of the drilling focussed within the Mineral Resource areas at Smarts, Hicks 
and  Larken  Zones.  Azimuth  commenced  drilling  of  the  Hicks  and  Smarts  Zones  in  August  2010  and  this 
continued through to July 2013.  Azimuth has completed 1002 RC drillholes all are five inch diameter holes 
and  range  in  length  from  6m  to  396m  for  a  total  of  89,013m  of  drilling.    The  majority  of  RC  drilling  was 
completed at Smarts (596 holes for 47,020m), Hicks (187 holes for 17,580m), Larken (31 holes for 3,322m) 
and Whitehall  (Kaburi)  (40  holes  for  5,627m).    Minor  RC  drilling  campaigns  have  also  been  carried  out  at 
Eldorado, Croft, Far SE Hicks, Gibbs, Kaburi West, Kanhai, Norby, El Paso, Gold Star and Powers. 
 
Under Azimuth, Diamond Core drilling commenced at the Smarts Zone in August 2010 and at Hicks Zone in 
September 2012.  The majority of core is of HQ and HQ3 size and minor PQ was used to gain better recovery 
through the oxide zone.  Diamond holes range in length from 31m to 480m for a total of 32,826m of drilling.  
Azimuth drilled 94 holes at the Smarts Zone for 16,528m of drilling, 19 holes at the Hicks Zone for 5,148m, 2
September 2014
Page 44
holes at Larken for 308m, and 2 holes at Kaburi for 348m.  Detailed core logging has been completed with 
core sampling carried out over visually mineralised sections with visible gold associated with quartz veins in 
sheared  chlorite  +/-  sericite  +/-  carbonate  altered,  strongly-sheared  Mafic  to  Intermediate  Volcanics  and 
Volcanoclastics. 
 
Azimuth also drilled 93 air-core (AC) holes for 5,193m which were drilled at the Smarts and Hicks Deposits 
and for further regional exploration purposes.  
 
Auger  sampling  has  been  carried  out  by  Azimuth  and  previous  companies.    Data  is  available  for  16,700 
samples of which 11,100 were collected by Azimuth.   
In  July  2013,  Troy  completed  a  takeover  of  Azimuth.  Troy  holds  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  tenement  rights 
through Pharsalus Gold Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsdidiary of Troy.
The current Karouni Gold Project database contains all available historical trench and drilling data.  A total of 
166  trenches  appear  in  the  database.    Of  these,  32  trenches  have  unknown  coordinates  and  19  have  not 
been  surveyed.    A  total  of  125  trenches  have  both  known  co-ordinates  and  surveys.    Information  is  not 
available from the historical log sheets, but the majority of trenches were excavated between 1993 and 1995 
and  correspond  with  Cathedral  Gold  trench  maps  so  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  majority  of 
trenches were excavated by Cathedral Gold.
A total of 134 historical drill  holes appear in the database and  are summarised in  Table  6-1.   Of these 13 
Diamond  Core  drill  holes  have  unknown  collar  coordinates.    Troy  re-surveys  old  drill  collars  as  they  are 
located and verified.

6.2.1  Historical Bulk Density Test work Pre-Azimuth  
Bulk density test work was conducted by Cathedral Gold and later Cambior.  Bulk density was determined for 
1,074 core samples from drill holes DH94-01 to DH94-32 and DH95-32 to DH95-50.  All historical diamond 
holes are located on the Hicks Deposit.  The average total density of 2.84t/m3 is similar to the primary bedrock 
value of 2.75t/m3 used by Cathedral in 1996 and 2.75t/m3 used by Cambior in 1998.  These measurements 
represent  dry  bulk  density  values  for  in-situ  material.  Neither  Cathedral  Gold  nor  Cambior  conducted  bulk 
density  measurements  for  the  weathered  saprolite  material.    This  reflected  a  lack  of  available  drill  core  to 
undertake bulk density test work on.

6.3  Production 
No  mineral  production  is  officially  recorded  within  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  however  gold  continues  to  be 
mined by small private syndicates operating within the property or within tenements excised from the property 
on both an informal and formal basis.
Historic records indicate that the Eldorado Vein was worked in 1913 via limited shaft and drift development.  A 
single vein some 0.5m in width and grading between 23g/t gold and 37g/t gold was reportedly worked to a 
depth of 12m along a strike length of around 90m. Inspection of the Eldorado Target in 1923 by the Geological 
Survey  of  Guyana,  found  that  the  workings  had  collapsed,  but  reported  that  approximately  100  tonnes  of 
stockpiled quartz, grading around 30g/t gold, remained.
In 1959 the Eldorado Target was being worked by several small parties.  The clay was washed for its direct 
gold content and the vein material preserved for later crushing and additional gold recovery.
In  1963,  a  small  sluicing  operation  was  commenced  at  the  Eldorado  Target,  however  production  ceased 
shortly afterwards following the death of the owner.
The Whitehall (Kaburi) Vein was reportedly worked sporadically by manual methods between 1916 and 1926.  
Mining is understood to have comprised the development of a small open pit some 10m wide, 10m long and 
15m deep before the walls collapsed and operations ceased.
The vein zone was again worked in 1933 by about 20 men, developing numerous shallow quartz veins and 
stringers over an unrecorded width, along strike from the earlier workings.
Between  1996  and  2006,  private  operator  Patrick  Harding  exploited  the  Whitehall  (Kaburi)  Vein  Zone  and 
associated  alluvials  via  hydraulicking  and  sluicing.    A  D6  bulldozer  and  30t  excavator  were  utilised  in 
overburden removal.  Operations during the initial two years focussed on alluvial deposits along a 3km length 
of Lucky Strike Creek and other watercourses, which drain the primary source of mineralisation. As mining 
progressed  upstream,  the  Vein  Zone  was  ultimately  exposed  in  the  bed  of  Lucky  Strike  Creek  and 
progressively extended.  The operation excavated a pit approximately 200m in diameter to a depth of 5m to 
15m  into  saprolite  through  superficial  White  Sand  Formation  cover.    The  depth  of  mining  was  limited  by 
inefficient  gravel  pumps,  rather  than  the  base  of  saprolite  mineralisation.    Production  records  filed  with  the 
Mines  Commission  indicate  that  approximately  18,000  ounces  of  gold  were  produced  between  1996  and 
2007.  Presently the area is not being worked and the pit is partially backfilled with white sand overburden and 
flooded where it remains open.
The  majority  of  production  from  the  Karouni  tenements  continues  to  be  derived  from  alluvial  and  eluvial 
sluicing operations, predominantly associated with the Hicks, Eldorado and Whitehall (Kaburi) Targets.   
7.  Geological Setting and Mineralisation 
7.1  Regional Geology 
7.1.1 
Guyana is located on the northeast coast of South America, and is entirely comprised or underlain by rocks of 
the  Precambrian  Guiana  Shield.    The  Guiana  Shield  lies  between  the  Orinoco  and  Amazon  Rivers  and 
encompasses  all  or  portions  of  neighbouring  countries  Suriname,  French  Guiana,  Venezuela,  Brazil  and 
Columbia, aggregating to an area of 1.6 million km2.
Stratigraphy
From  oldest  to  youngest,  the  Guiana  Shield  and  cover  sequences  comprise  the  following  principal 
stratigraphic successions (see Figure 7-1).
•  The  Imataca  Complex,  an  Archaean  complex  composed  of  3.4Ga  -  2.7Ga  protolith,  on  which  are 
superimposed high grade metamorphic rocks of Trans-Amazonian age (2.2Ga - 2.0Ga) exposed  in 
the Ciudad Bolivar region of Venezuela.
•  High  grade granulites and  gneisses of the Central Guyana Granulite  Belt of Palaeoproterozoic age
(2.4Ga - 2.3Ga).
September 2014
Page 46
•  A  widely  developed  Palaeoproterozoic  granite-greenstone  succession,  which  was  deformed  and 
metamorphosed  during  the  Trans-Amazonian  tectono-thermal  event  (2.2Ga  -  2.0Ga).    The  Trans-
Amazonian  age  rocks  stretch  across  much  of  the  northern  third  of  the  shield,  incorporating  a 
succession of older gneissic granitoids, with the two principal occurrences in Guyana referred to as 
the Bartica Gneiss and Kanuka Group.  These gneissic complexes are considered equivalent to the 
Cape Coast Suite of West Africa and are enveloped by a less deformed succession of basic to acid 
volcanics, sediments and syntectonic granitoids.  In Guyana, the greenstones are referred to as the 
Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup, in Venezuela the Pastora Supergroup, while in Surinam and French 
Guiana the term Maroni Supergroup is used.  The greenstones are intruded by syntectonic granitoids 
(2.25Ga - 2.0Ga) equivalent to the Dixcove Suite of West Africa, providing an upper age limit for the 
Trans-Amazonian Orogeny, similar to that recorded for the Eburnean Orogeny of West Africa.
•  The  Uatuma  Supergroup  comprises  a  mostly  undeformed  and  unmetamorphosed  Mesoproterozoic 
(1.9Ga - 1.5Ga) sequence of supracrustals deposited above a major regional unconformity with the 
underlying  Palaeoproterozoic  basement.    From  oldest  to  youngest,  these  include  1,000m  -  1,600m 
thick continental sandstones and conglomerates of the Muruwa Formation, and the 1,000m - 2,000m 
thick  felsic  volcanics,  terrigenous  sediments  and  sub-volcanic  intrusives  comprising  the  Iwokrama 
Formation.
•  The Uatuma Supergroup is unconformably overlain by the topographically distinctive Roraima Group, 
which  forms  the  Pakaraima  Plateau  bounded  by  a  near  vertical  escarpment.    The  Roraima  Group 
comprises  a  1,000  –  3,600m  thick  sequence  of  relatively  flat  lying,  unaltered,  conglomerates  and 
sandstones with subordinate siltstones and felsic volcanics.  The age of the Roraima is constrained by 
the underlying basement and mafic intrusives to between 1.9Ga - 1.6Ga. 
Intruding the Roraima and Trans-Amazonian basement are dykes and sills of gabbro and dolerite of 
the Avanero Suite.  These intrusives are typically of substantial thickness and may extend laterally for 
hundreds of kilometres.  The Avanero Suite intrusives are undeformed and unmetamorphosed.  Ages 
of the Avanero suite have been determined by radiometric dating to 1.84Ga - 1.61Ga.
•
•  Other  basic  intrusives,  younger  than  the  Avanero  Suite,  which  cluster  at  ages  of  1330,  1213,  907, 
700-570 and 430-500 million years before present.  These dykes are designated the PAPA dykes, an 
acronym standing for Post-Avanero Pre-Apaotoe.
•  Opening of the Atlantic during the Mesozoic resulted in the formation of intracratonic rifts within the 
Guiana  Shield,  which  were  filled  with  basaltic  lavas  and  terrestrial  sediments.    In  Guyana  these 
Mesozoic rifts are represented by the Takutu Graben, an east-northeast trending rift structure, and the 
mostly offshore Guyana coastal basin.
•  Associated with the opening of the Atlantic Rift was the emplacement of the dyke swarms known as 
the Apatoe Suite.  Dykes of this suite are typically narrow, fine grained doleritic dykes of great strike 
extent, which predominantly trend north-northeast to east-northeast.
•  Quaternary to Recent sediments of the Corentyne Group veneer much of the basement geology in 
northern  Guyana.    Clean  shallow  marine  to  estuarine  quartz  sands  of  the  Berbice  Formation  (also 
referred to as the Mackenzie or White Sand Formation) are most prevalent, increasingly overlain by 
reducing fluviatile clays of the Demerara Formation towards the northern coast.
The Guiana Shield has been correlated with the Leo-Man Shield of West Africa, and it is generally accepted 
that prior to the opening of the Atlantic during the Mesozoic the two shields formed a contiguous craton.  The 
Archaean  Imataca  Complex  can  be  correlated  with  the  Archaean  Liberian  Province,  the  Central  Guyana 
Granulite  Belt  with  the  Dimbroko  Zone  in Ivory  Coast, the Barama-Mazaruni greenstones  with the Birimian 
greenstones and the Trans-Amazonian tectono-thermal event with the Eburnean Orogeny.
Structure
7.1.2 
The boundary between the Imataca Complex and the Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup in Guyana is represented 
by the Guri Faults, which collectively comprise a distinct linear east-northeast trending crustal break.
The greenstone belts of the Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup are strongly deformed, with at least two episodes 
of  tectonism  evident  in  many  areas.    The  metamorphic  grade  of  the  greenstone  succession  is  typically 
greenschist facies, but may reach amphibolite facies close to belt margins and granitoids.
September 2014

The Muruwa and Iwokrama Formations of the Uatuma Supergroup are weakly deformed, typically comprising 
broad open folds.

7.1.3  Mineralisation 
The Imataca Complex incorporates substantial iron ore deposits in Venezuela, comparable to similar deposits 
within Archaean portions of the Leo-Man Shield in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone of West Africa.
Just as the  Birimian  Series of West Africa is noted for its substantial  gold endowment, the  lesser explored 
Barama-Mazaruni  Greenstones  of  Guyana  and  their  equivalents  in  adjacent  countries  include  several 
significant gold occurrences such as Omai in Guyana, El Callo, Las Christinas and Brisas in Venezuela, Gross 
Rosebel in Suriname, and Camp Caiman, Dorlin and Yaou in French Guiana (see Figure 7-2).  Similarly, the 
greenstones are  also known for their significant deposits of bauxite, manganese and  diamonds, along  with 
lesser copper, molybdenum, lead-zinc, chrome and  nickel. During the Tertiary  and Quaternary periods, the 
Guiana  Shield  has  undergone  continuous  passive  subsidence  along  its  oceanic  margin,  creating  deep 
(2,500m  -  4,800m)  and  mostly  offshore  sedimentary  basins  prospective  for  oil.  The  substantial  bauxite 
deposits of the Guiana Shield typically occur at the contact between recent unconsolidated sediments of the 
Berbice Formation and the basement successions.

7.2  Local Geology 
Although partially obscured by a veneer of Tertiary to Holocene sedimentary cover, the basement geology of 
the  Karouni  Project  is  dominated  by  west-northwest  trending  greenstone  belts  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Barama-Mazaruni Supergroup, interspersed with extensive Granitoid Batholiths also of Trans-Amazonian age.
The northern tenements straddle the northeast limb of an interpreted shallowly plunging, northwest trending 
anticline  (see  Figure  7-3).    The  core  of  the  anticline  is  occupied  by  relatively  undeformed  syntectonic 
Granitoids,  notably  Granodiorite  and  Monzonite,  around  which  is  wrapped  greenstone  stratigraphy.    The 
greenstones locally comprise a basal succession of high magnesian basalts, tholeiitic basalts and andesites, 
which  are  locally  intruded  by  a  Felsic  to  Intermediate  Porphyry,  overlain  by  a  succession  of  Intermediate 
Volcanoclastics  and  Sediments,  incorporating  more  persistent  Carbonaceous  Shale  horizons.    This 
stratigraphy reasonably is consistent with that recorded at the Omai Mine, 35km to the southeast.
Figure 7-3:  Karouni Project Geology – Main Prospect Areas
The  Greenstone  succession  is  variously  metamorphosed  to  Upper  Greenschist  Facies,  increasing  to 
Amphibolite  facies  along  the  granite  contact.  The  basement  is  intruded  by  a  series  of  northeast  trending 
dolerite dykes of the Avanero Suite,  one of  which intersects mineralisation  associated  with the Hicks Zone 
immediately east of Blackwater Creek. 
Most of southwest portion of the tenement block that hosts the Hicks, Eldorado and Whitehall (Kaburi) Zones, 
is veneered by Tertiary to Holocene Sediments.  The Lower Cover Sequence mantling the basement is less 
persistent  and  comprises  a  cream  coloured,  poorly  sorted,  Oligomictic  Conglomerate  with  angular  quartz 
fragments cemented by Quartzose Sand or Arkose.  This Conglomerate is un-named, but is presumed to be 
of Tertiary age.  It is mildly silica indurated and frequently strongly mineralised with gold where proximal to 
basement mineralisation.  Where exposed, the unit appears to be up to 8m in thickness.

The Basal Conglomerate is overlain by more persistent cover of the Corentyne Group, more specifically, the 
Pleistocene  to  Oligocene  White  Sand  (or  Berbice)  Formation.    As  the  name  suggests,  the  White  Sand 
Formation  comprises  distinctively  unconsolidated  clean  white  sand  of  littoral  or  shallow  marine  origin  that 
veneers much of the coastal plain of Guyana.  The unmineralised White Sand Formation ranges up to 40m in 
thickness and obscures much of the basement geology (see Figure 7-4).
Figure 7-4:  Karouni Project Geology & Main Prospect Areas
All surface “bedrock” in the area is typically altered to saprolite to depths of several metres to several tens of 
metres (see Figure 7-5).  The stratigraphy is locally overlain by unconsolidated marine and Deltaic Sands plus 
Clays of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Berbice Formation.

7.3  Property Geology and Mineralisation 
Primary gold mineralisation is exposed at several localities within the Karouni Project, the most notable being 
the Hicks, Smarts and Larken Zones along the northern extremity of the project (see Figure 7-6 and Figure 
7-7).    Here  the  White  Sand  Formation  cover  has  been  removed  by  erosion  to  expose  the  underlying 
mineralised  Palaeoproterozoic  Greenstone  successions  of  the  Trans-Amazonian  Barama-Mazaruni  Group.  
Extensive  superficial  cover  of  White  Sand  Formation  within  the  central  and  south  portions  of  the  project 
tenements  masks  the  basement  lithology  and  would  conceal  any  gold  mineralisation.    The  acquisition  and 
evaluation of airborne geophysical data has however indicated that the Barama-Mazaruni Greenstone Belts 
and associated syntectonic intrusives persist at shallow depth beneath this cover.

Hicks Deposit 
Gold mineralisation at the Hicks Deposit is hosted by a northwest trending, sub-vertical to steeply southwest 
dipping shear zone some 2,500m in strike length and up to 60m wide in places.  The shear has developed 
within Basalts and Andesites comprising the footwall Greenstone Succession along the north-eastern limb of a 
shallowly  northwest plunging anticline.   Auriferous mineralisation is  also  noted  at the contacts of Porphyry-
Granite intrusives.  The shear is comprised of semi-continuous zones of quartz lenses and quartz-carbonate 
veining or brecciating.   
 
Numerous,  moderately  well-defined  gold-rich  lenses,  up  to  15m  wide,  occur  within  the  shear  and  are 
characterized  by  anomalous  quartz  veining,  quartz  flooding,  shearing,  chloritization,  seritisation  and 
pyritisation.  Visible gold and the majority of gold values typically occur within  and along margins of quartz 
veins, in silicified Granitic Dykes, and in adjacent, pyritic, often sheared Meta-Andesite.  Pyrite is common at 
up  to  3%  by  volume,  with  local,  trace  amounts  of  molybdenite,  galena  and  sphalerite,  associated  with 
auriferous  quartz  veins.    Mineralisation  is  variously  accompanied  by  silica-sericite-chlorite-carbonate-pyrite-
tourmaline  alteration,  while  fuchsite  is  developed  within  porphyry  intrusives  in  contact  with  high  magnesian 
basalts and along shear zones. 
 
In  general,  the  northwest  trending  mineralised  shear  has  developed  within  a  steeply  inclined  sequence  of 
metamorphosed  Andesitic  to  Basaltic  Volcanics,  adjacent  to  the  northwest  margin  of  the  Eldorado 
(Granodiorite) Batholith.  The volcanic stratigraphy is cut by a multiple series of Andesitic to Felsic intrusive 
phases that precede and post-date the introduction of gold.
Smarts Deposit 
Exploration has identified extensive gold mineralisation at the Smarts Deposit.  Gold is hosted by a northwest 
trending, sub-vertical to steeply southwest dipping shear zone 2,800m in strike length and up to 60m wide.  
The shear zone has developed within Basalts and Andesites comprising the footwall Greenstone Succession 
along the northeast limb of a shallowly northwest plunging anticline.  Auriferous mineralisation is also noted at

the contacts of porphyry-granite intrusives.  The shear zone is comprised of semi-continuous zones of quartz 
lenses and quartz-carbonate veining or brecciation.   
 
Numerous, moderately  well-defined gold-rich lenses,  up to 15m wide,  occur  within the shear  zone and are 
characterized  by  anomalous  quartz  veining,  quartz  flooding,  shearing,  chloritization,  seritisation  and 
pyritisation (see Figure 7-8 and Figure 7-9).  Visible gold and the majority of gold values typically occur within 
and along margins of quartz veins, in silicified Granitic Dykes, and in adjacent, pyritic, often sheared Meta-
andesite.  Pyrite is common at up to 3% by volume associated with auriferous quartz veins.  Mineralisation is 
variously  accompanied  by  silica-sericite-chlorite-carbonate-pyrite-tourmaline  alteration.    In  general,  the 
northwest 
trending  mineralised  shear  zone  has  developed  within  a  steeply  inclined  sequence  of 
metamorphosed  Andesitic  to  Basaltic  Volcanics,  adjacent  to  the  northwest  margin  of  the  Eldorado 
(Granodiorite) Batholith.  The volcanic stratigraphy is cut by a multiple series of Andesitic to Felsic intrusive 
phases that precede and post-date the introduction of gold.

Larken Zone 
The  Larken  Zone  is  located  2km  northwest  of  the  Hicks  Zone  and  2km  southeast  of  the  Eldorado  Target.  
These three mineralised occurrences essentially represent parallel zones arranged in an en echelon series 
across the stratigraphy. 
 
In 1962, the Larken Vein was described as being 1.3m in width and 150m to 180m in strike length.  At this 
time the vein was exposed in several short trenches, and panning of crushed vein material is reported to have 
revealed  considerable  gold,  however  no  assays  are  recorded.    Parts  of  the  vein  have  been  sporadically 
worked by artisanal means since 1962. 
 
On 10th January 2013 Azimuth reported RC drilling results from the Larken Zone.  These results included 12m 
at 4.8g/t gold from 25m (LRC007) and 5m at 2.5g/t gold from 91m (LRC009).   
 
In July 2013 the Company completed a limited Diamond Core and Reverse Circulation drill program to test of 
the continuity of the mineralisation along the Larken Zone as defined by earlier auger gold-in soil sampling, 
trench channel sampling and wide spaced drilling.  This target is located just north of the Smarts-Hicks Trend 
on  a  parallel  northwest  –  southeast  striking  shear.  The  drilling  confirmed  continuity  of  mineralisation  and 
although  the  best  grades  are  associated  with  narrow  intervals,  additional  drilling  is  warranted.  Significant 
assay intervals are as follows (see Figure  7-10, Figure 7-11  and Table 7-1):  6m at 3.78g/t gold from 34m, 
including 2m at 9.69g/t gold from 36m; 4m at 1.59g/t gold from 49m; 1m at 12.18g/t gold from 39m; 1m at 
7.45g/t  gold  from  103m;  1m  at  3.59g/t  gold  from  76m  and  1m  at  2.30g/t  gold  from  67m.  Further  drilling  is 
warranted.

Whitehall (Kaburi) Target 
The  Whitehall  (Kaburi)  Target  is  located  some  10km  to  the  northwest  of  the  Hicks  Zone.    The  Main  Vein 
consists of several in-situ sub-parallel stockworks and sheeted quartz vein zones exposed over a collective 
width  of  at  least  200m  and  a  strike  length  of  at  least  500m  (see  Figure  7-12).    Gold  mineralisation  is 
associated  with  black,  vitreous  quartz  exhibiting  ‘crack-seal’  laminations  and  breccia  textures  reflecting 
episodic  pulses  of  hydrothermal mineralisation.    Individual  zones  range  from  5m  to  30m  in  width,  are  sub-
vertical and strike northwest.
September 2014
Page 57
Figure 7-12:  Karouni Project - Whitehall (Kaburi) Prospect Location Drilling Assay Intercepts
The host sequence is dominated by Intermediate Volcanics and Volcanoclastics intercalated with Siltstones, 
and Carbonaceous Shales (similar to the Eldorado Target), along with associated Quartz Feldspar Porphyry 
Dykes.  Stockworks and sheeted vein zones appear to be preferentially developed within the more brittle units 
along the margins of the Carbonaceous Shale. 
Saprolitic mineralisation  has been  worked by sluicing to a depth  of approximately 10m to 15m (see Figure 
7-13).    Mineralisation  remains  open  in  all  directions  beneath  White  Sand  Formation  cover  5m  to  20m  in 
thickness.
In late 2011, Azimuth drilled 12 Reverse Circulation (RC) scout holes for 2,141m and 2 Diamond Drill holes for 
349m to test potential mineralisation.   As reported December 19, 2011, drilling intersected a small altered and 
mineralised  Granitoid  which  intrudes  Mafic-Intermediate  Volcanics  and  Volcanoclastics.  The  drilling  results 
suggest there maybe 3 three styles of mineralisation:

•  Scattered narrow gold mineralisation associated with quartz veining in Mafic-Intermediate Volcanics 
and  Volcanoclastics  that  are  the  host  rock  of  the  small  Granitoid  Intrusive  exemplified  by  KRC005 
which intersected 7m at 1.04g/t gold from 106m,  KRC002 which intersected 5m at 1.1g/t gold from 
148m and KRC008 which intersected 1m at 56g/t gold from 5m;
•  Pervasive mineralisation within a small Granitoid Intrusive exemplified by KDD001 which intersected
111m at 0.32g/t gold from 69m and KRC011 which intersected 135m at 0.35g/t gold from 32m;
•  Higher tenor mineralisation focused on the contacts of the Granitoid Intrusive such as KRC009 which 
intersected 9m at 9.2g/t gold from 118m (including 1m at 71g/t gold) and KRC012  which intersected 
1m at 7.3g/t gold from 73m (with the hole ending in mineralisation).
Figure 7-13:  Whitehall Target - Shallow Alluvial Mine Workings
Alluvial Deposits
Secondary gold mineralisation at Eldorado and Whitehall (Kaburi) Targets was mined from partially lithified, 
immature Quartz Conglomerates and Arkoses (presumed to be of Tertiary age), which discontinuously overlie 
mineralised portions of the basement.  Alluvial deposits are also being actively mined along the Kuribong and 
Potaro Rivers (and tributaries) that comprise the southwest project area boundary, as shown in Figure 7-14.

8.  Deposit Types 
8.1  General 
The  Karouni  Gold  Project  deposits  are  situated  on  the  west-northwest  trending  Greenstone  Belts  of  the 
Palaeoproterozoic  Barama-Mazaruni  Supergroup  interspersed  with  extensive  Granitoid  Batholiths  also  of 
Trans-Amazonian age. Basement lithologies in the project area are partially obscured by a veneer of Tertiary 
to Holocene sedimentary cover.
Primary gold mineralisation is exposed at several localities within the Karouni Project, the most notable being 
the  Hicks,  Smarts  and  Larken  Zones  along  the  northern  extremity  of  the  project.  Here  the  White  Sand 
Formation  cover  has  been  removed  by  erosion  to  expose  the  underlying  mineralised  Palaeoproterozoic 
greenstone successions of the Trans-Amazonian Barama-Mazaruni Group.
8.2  Geology Model 
Gold mineralisation within the Karouni Gold Project comprises mesothermal quartz, quartz-carbonate, quartz-
tourmaline  structurally  controlled  lodes,  veins,  stockworks  and  breccia  zones  variously  hosted  by  Mafic  to 
Intermediate Volcanics and Volcanoclastics, Carbonaceous Shales and syntectonic Granitoid Stocks.  Gold is 
commonly accompanied  by  pyrite  and  less commonly  arsenopyrite,  in the latter instance particularly  where 
hosted by Carbonaceous Shales and Phyllites.  In essence, the style of mineralisation is entirely consistent 
with  similar  gold-bearing  Archaean  and  Palaeoproterozoic  greenstone  terrains  world-wide.  Gold  workings 
associated with recent alluvial deposits are notable along virtually all streams and rivers throughout the project 
area, where the barren White Sand Formation cover has been removed by erosion.
8.3  Exploration Model 
The  Company  is  primarily  targeting  large  tonnage,  medium  to  high  grade  gold  deposits  along  north-west 
south-east trending mineralised shear zone within Omai – Hicks – Smarts – Whitehall (Kaburi) Corridor (see 
Figure  7-6).  Most  exploration  undertaken  to  date  has  been  on  prospects  that  have  had  either  historic 
exploration or recent alluvial mining.
The  Company  has  an  exploration  strategy  which  will  test  the  mineralised  shear  zone  through  regional 
trenching, auger drilling, geophysical and LiDAR surveys through to extensional and infill Reverse Circulation 
(RC) or deeper diamond drilling.
This exploration strategy has resulted in the definition of gold resources at the Hicks Zone and Smarts Zone 
where RC and diamond core drilling by Troy (and previous explorers at Hicks) has outlined zones of semi-
continuous gold mineralisation over a strike length of 2,900m and 2,700m respectively.
Troy  is  continuing  its  exploration  program,  targeting  resource  extensions,  the  Larken  Zone  and  other 
prospective targets within the Karouni tenements.
8.4  Hicks 
The  Hicks  Deposit  is  the  southernmost  deposit  defined  to  date  along  Omai  –  Hicks  –  Smarts  –  Whitehall 
(Kaburi)  Corridor.    Gold  is  hosted  by  a  northwest  trending,  sub-vertical  to  steeply  southwest  dipping  shear 
zone  some  2,900m  in  strike  length  and  up  to  60m  wide  in  places  with  average  grade  mineralisation  of 
approximately 2g/t gold.
8.5  Smarts 
The  Smarts  Deposit  was  discovered  in  January  2011  when  Azimuth  used  RC  drilling  to  follow-up  earlier 
encouraging trench results around the local workings known as ‘Smarts Pit’.  The prospect is located 4km to 
the northwest of the Hicks Zone.  Gold is hosted by a northwest trending, sub-vertical to steeply southwest 
dipping shear zone, that has been observed in drill holes for some 2,800m of strike length and up to 200m 
wide in places with average grade mineralisation of approximately 4g/t gold - 5g/t gold.
The nature of mineralisation has been identified as having the following key features;
•  Gold mineralisation occurs within the Smarts Shear, and also in the footwall and hangingwall.   
•  Gold mineralisation also occurs in the hangingwall and footwall of the porphyritic dacite marker unit.
September 2014

o  Disseminated sulphides within reactive host rocks,

o  Stratigraphically controlled visible gold-bearing vein arrays within finer grained volcanoclastic

or hangingwall also correlated with elevated gold grades.
pyrite, carbonate and possible tellurides).
•  The highest gold grades within veins outside the Smarts Shear are associated with veins that transect 
the  dominant  foliation  and  bedding.    These  styles  of  veins  are  commonly  associated  with  the  finer 
grained unit within the larger package defined as coarse and fine grained volcanoclastic sediments.  
This style of veining is interpreted to be stratabound (i.e. it dominantly occurs within this host rock).
•  A major set of steeply northwest-dipping veins that transect bedding and foliation occur in the footwall 
of the Smarts Shear on section 2850 (this vein set has underground potential).  This vein set is hosted 
within a stratigraphic lens of fine grained sediments in the footwall of the Smarts Shear that does not 
exist on the other logged section.  The significance is that major laterally continuous vein arrays in this 
unit may abruptly stop along strike if the critical stratigraphic unit lenses out.  Likewise there is the 
potential for an entirely new vein array within a stratigraphic lens of this stratigraphy along strike from 
a non-mineralised section that lacks the critical host rock.  More isolated lenses of this key unit are 
likely to occur in the footwall of the Smarts Shear within the foliated footwall volcanoclastic unit.
•  The foliated grey volcanoclastic unit is a very poor host rock. The lithic tuff and porphyritic rhyodacite 
also  appear  to  be  poor  host  rock  types  for  gold.  Significant  gold  mineralisation  occurs  in  all  other 
stratigraphic units.
Host rocks play an important role in the gold deposition at Smarts, Hicks and Larken. Key stratigraphic units 
identified in core logging to date include (see Figure 8-1, Figure 8-2 and Figure 8-3) 
 
Porphyritic Rhyodacite (Marker Unit): This unit has clear plagioclase crystals and is an excellent marker 
bed.  This unit has an interval ranging from 0.4m to 3.2mwith most intervals measuring approximately 1.5m.  
Early in the project’s history the term “Rhyodacite” was the most common classification used by the geologists 
on site, but has not been confirmed by petrography or geochemistry.  The unit is conformable with bedding 
(and may not be extrusive or intrusive in nature).
Interlayered  Fine  and  Coarse  Grained  Volcanoclastic  Sediments:    These  units  have  clearly  defined 
bedding with bedding thicknesses ranging from 1cm to 30cm.  These units are normally light green to green in 
colour.  The coarser grained units commonly have chlorite and disseminated pyrite in mineralised zones, the 
finer grained units are commonly silicified and host vein arrays.  This unit contains the Porphyritic Rhyodacite 
marker unit.  The definition of “coarse grained” and “fine grained” reflects the current observable texture and 
probably reflects modification via metamorphism and alteration, and not the primary state. There are major 
variations  in  the  distribution  of  the  fine  and  coarse  grained  units,  in  some  areas  the  fine  grained  unit 
dominates.  In the logging program it was not possible to correlate these variations from drill hole to drill hole 
and so they have been grouped into one unit (the significance is that the areas dominated by the finer grained 
unit commonly have mineralised vein arrays).
Massive Mafic Unit (Foliated and Unfoliated): individual examples of this unit commonly have a thickness 
of 5m to 10m. Bedding cannot be readily identified within this unit (and at the Hicks Deposit this unit can have 
blue quartz).  The interpretation is that this unit is a  basalt or a mafic intrusive.  In some areas this unit  is 
foliated, in other areas it isn’t.  There is also a range of alteration over printing it with examples of silicification, 
chloritisation and pyritisation.  When strongly silicified it is hard to definitively ascertain if the rock was derived 
from a mafic protolith (potential for misidentification as a mafic unit in some of the logging).
September 2014
Page 61
Lithic Tuff (Commonly Silicified): This unit is strongly silicified tuff with clearly defined lithic fragments, the 
term is also the most common classification used by the geologists on site.  In some areas this unit is strongly 
foliated.
Foliated Footwall Volcanoclastic Unit (Extensive Carbonate): This is the dominant footwall sequence east 
of the Smarts Shear.  The unit is strongly foliated and can in places be difficult to distinguish from the Lithic 
Tuff and the foliated grey Volcanoclastic unit.  The distinguishing feature of this unit is ubiquitous distinctive 
carbonate  lenses  and  layers  –  the  lenses  are  commonly  1cm  to  10cm  in  length.    The  layers  also  extend 
across  the  entire  length  of  core.    In  some  areas  the  foliated  footwall  volcanoclastic  unit  is  in  conformable 
contact with the finer grained sequences of the interlayered fine and coarse grained volcanoclastic sediments.
Foliated Grey Volcanoclastic Unit (Coarse Carbonate Porphyroblasts): This unit is grey to dark grey in 
colour and is a strongly foliated unit with distinctive carbonate porphyroblasts that can be elongate within the 
foliation plane.
Sulphide-Rich  Sediments:  Small  zones  (less  than  1m  thick)  of  thinly  bedded  sulphidic  sediments  were 
identified intermittently but could not be correlated between drill holes.

There  are  major  lateral  facies  variations  in  stratigraphy  both  within  a  section  and  also  between  sections.  
Examples are the variation in the coarse and fine grained Volcanoclastic Sediments and also the Lithic Tuff.  
There is a major lens of the coarse and fine grained Volcanoclastic Sediments in the footwall of the Smarts 
Shear that up section grades into the foliated footwall Volcanoclastic sequence.  Drillhole SDD034 is located 
in the transitional zone and both of these units occur and are conformably interlayered, this appears to mark a 
transitional  zone  between  the  two  units.    Only  one  major  lens  of  the  massive  Mafic  Unit  was  defined  on 
Section 2850, but multiple lenses were defined on Section 2380.  The foliated grey Volcanoclastic Unit was 
most commonly associated with the massive Mafic Unit.
There  are  major  internal  variations  in  the  distribution  of  the  fine  and  coarse  grained  sequences  in  the  unit 
defined as “Interlayered fine and coarse grained Volcanoclastic Sediments”, in some areas the fine grained 
unit dominates.
The Porphyritic Dacite unit was utilised as a marker horizon in the drillcore and could be correlated across 
multiple drillholes.  The correlation of this unit across multiple drillholes indicates the stratigraphy is steeply 
west dipping. This Porphyritic Dacite marker unit is conformable with bedding in drillcore.

Unit in the Transitional Zone between the Two Units
Structural Features 
A dominantly steeply west dipping foliation observed throughout the deposit. A late crenulation cleavage was 
identified in some areas.  In drillcore foliation and stratigraphic contacts are in most cases close to parallel 
(due to the stratigraphy being flatted during foliation development).  However, logging of the stratigraphic units 
highlights  that  these  packages  must  be  transected  by  the  foliation  in  areas  due  to  the  major  lateral  facies 
variations along strike and in section.
The major  distinctive  structural  feature  within  the  deposit  is  the  Smarts  Shear  (see  Figure  8-4,  Figure  8-5, 
Figure 8-6 and Figure 8-7).  The Smarts Shear is dominantly steeply west-dipping, but can dip to the east in 
some areas.  This dip change is most notable on Section 2380 and appears to correlate with the appearance 
of the Lithic Tuff on the eastern side of the shear.  In core the Smarts Shear is a strongly foliated zone, with 
foliation parallel carbonate and quartz veins.  The shear is 50cm to 2m wide, and in some areas it has smaller 
subsidiary shears.  Late stage brittle brecciation is common.  There are major differences in the amount of 
veining within the Smarts Shear. In some areas there is no major veining, in other areas there are laminated 
quartz veins with high gold values.  Areas with no major veins within the shear commonly correlate with areas 
the  foliated  footwall  Volcanoclastic  Unit  is  in  fault  contact  with  the  foliated  grey  Volcanoclastic  Unit  in  the 
hangingwall.  Wide zones of quartz veining (up to 4m) within the Smarts Shear occur where the shear dips 
back to east.  Veins also develop adjacent to the massive mafic units, and adjacent to the interlayered coarse 
and fine grained volcanoclastic sediments.  The geometry suggests the veining is related to dilation on the 
lower angle segment.
On section 2850 there is a repetition of the Porphyritic Dacite Marker unit and the interlayered fine and coarse 
grained  Volcanoclastic  Sediments  across  the  Smarts  Shear  implying  a  major  component  of  reverse 
movement.  The repeated massive mafic units on Section 2380 may reflect fault imbrication.
There  are  multiple  sets  of  veins  parallel  and  oblique  to  the  dominate  foliation  and  stratigraphic  contacts.  
Extensive boudinage of veins parallel to the foliation with the development of internal tension veins implies a 
component  of  vertical  stretch.    This  is  consistent  with  reverse  movement  and  imbrication  of  stratigraphy 
across the Smarts Shear.

There is a clear host rock control on the development of vein arrays that are oblique to the dominant steeply 
west-dipping  foliation.    The  finer  grained  silicified  units  within  the  Volcanoclastic  Sediments  are  the  most 
common host rock.  In some cases these veins terminate against the coarser units.  This indicates some of 
the  veins  are  tensional  in  nature  and  are  not  shear  veins  –  this  is  relevant  for  both  mineralised  and  non-
mineralised veins. Many of the veins are foliation parallel/ steep dipping and some have 30 degrees dips due 
to making a 90 degree core axis angle).

Gold Mineralisation 
The nature of mineralisation has been identified as having the following key features;
•  An inferred low grade early gold phase with hematite, pyrite with extensive silicification.  
•  A  late-stage  dominant  gold  phase  with  dominant  pyrite,  pyrrhotite,  chlorite,  quartz  and  carbonate
assemblages.  This has the following styles;
o  Laminated veins within the Smarts Shear;,  
o  Disseminated sulphides within reactive host rocks;  
o  Foliation parallel veins;  
o  Stratigraphically controlled visible gold-bearing vein arrays within finer grained Volcanoclastic
Sediments small scale discrete reverse shears with visible gold, pyrite.
•  Gold mineralisation occurs within the Smarts Shear, and also in the footwall and hangingwall.   
•  Significant  gold  mineralisation  also  occurs  in  the  hangingwall  and  footwall  of  the  Porphyritic  Dacite
Marker Unit (this unit itself was not a prospective host rock).
•  The foliated grey Volcanoclastic unit is a very poor host rock type in all intervals logged. 
•  The Lithic Tuff also appeared to be a poor host.  
•  Significant gold mineralisation was logged in all other stratigraphic units.
The  above  relationships  have  been  used  to  correlate  gold  mineralisation  identified  in  the  drilling  which  is 
detailed below; see Figure 8-8 and Figure 8-9.
Early Hematite Associated Veins: Low angle vein arrays associated with hematite alteration were observed 
in several areas.  These veins are associated with extensive silicification and low gold grades were observed 
in all areas they could be positively identified.
September 2014
Page 70
Laminated  Veins:  Laminated  veins  were  observed  within  ductile  shears  in  several  locations,  but  the  most 
economically significant occur within the Smarts Shear.  The highest grade zones of laminated veins within 
the shear are at the region where there is a dip change in the Smarts Shear beneath the Lithic Tuff.  This 
geometry of veining on a lower angle segment suggests the lodes were linked to reverse movement with the 
formation of dilational jogs.  At deeper  levels, in areas with a steeply  west-dipping geometry, lower grades 
occur in the current drilling data.  Apart from the dip of the shear there also appears to be a host rock control 
on the formation of mineralised veins within the Smarts Shear. Areas of the Smarts Shear with the massive 
Mafic  Unit  in  the  footwall  or  hangingwall  correlated  with  elevated  gold  grades.    Areas  with  no  major  veins 
within the shear commonly correlated with areas the foliated footwall Volcanoclastic Unit was in fault contact 
with the foliated grey Volcanoclastic Unit in the hangingwall.   
 
Disseminated Sulphides within Reactive Host Rocks: There is extensive evidence for sulphidation of the 
wallrock, particularly by pyrite.  The extent of gold mineralisation associated with this is hard to estimate due 
to the dominance of high grade gold in quartz veins. The presence of higher gold grades within the Smarts 
Shear  adjacent  to  the  massive  Mafic  Unit  is  inferred  to  reflect  it  is  a  reactive  host  rock  with  potential  for 
laterally continuous mineralisation.  There are host rock variations linked to the amount of sulphidation i.e. the 
foliated Mafic Unit versus the Tuff or the fine versus the coarse grained units in the Volcanoclastic Sediments.  
There is also a foliation control on the sulphidation with evidence for sulphidation along the foliation. This most 
likely  reflects  permeability  and  fluid  flow  along  the  foliation.  The  grey  foliated  Volcanogenic  Unit  with 
overgrowth of carbonate porphyroblasts is a very poor host rock with little to no sulphidation observed. 
 
Stratigraphically  Controlled  Visible  Gold-Bearing  Vein  Arrays  and  Veins  Parallel  to  Foliation:  In  drill 
core  there  are  major  variations  in  the  orientations  of  the  mineralised  veins.    A  set  of  mineralised  quartz-
carbonate veins have developed sub-parallel to, or close to, the foliation.  These veins are associated with 
carbonate, chlorite and pyrite.  In general these veins have lower grades in comparison to veins that transect 
the  foliation.    The  highest  gold  grades  appear  to  be  associated  with  veins  that  transect  the  foliation  and 
bedding. These styles of veins were most commonly associated with the finer grained unit within the coarse 
and  fine  grained  Volcanoclastic  Sediments;  this  unit  is  commonly  highly  silicified.    This  style  of  veining  is 
interpreted to be stratabound in that it dominantly occurs within this host rock.   
 
The orientations of the veins that transect bedding within the Fine Grained Unit vary.  Furthermore, in some 
cases high grade gold intercepts of these vein types could be correlated between drillholes, but in other cases 
they could not.  Some examples of these are as follows;
•  A set of high grade gold bearing veins (115 g/t) within the hangingwall of the Smarts Shear that occur 
within the Fine Grained Unit.  Some of these dip at about 60 degrees to the east and are offset by 
small reverse shears.  This set of veins could not be correlated updip or downdip (even though the 
stratigraphy could).
•  A set of steeply northwest-dipping veins occurring in the footwall of the Smarts Shear.  These veins 
have  consistent  core  axis  angles  in  both  of  the  drill  holes  they  were  intersected  in,  which  are 
interpreted  to  mean  that  they  are  a  vein  array  with  a  similar  trend.    In  plan  view  the  veins  have  a 
north-easterly strike (assuming the foliation is north-trending in mine grid).  The veins do not project 
up into the foliated footwall Volcanoclastic Unit.   This vein set is hosted within a stratigraphic lens in 
the footwall of the Smarts Shear. The significance of this is that major correlatable lateral vein arrays 
in this unit may abruptly stop along strike if the stratigraphy lenses out.  Likewise there is the potential 
for an entirely new vein array within a stratigraphic lens of this stratigraphy along strike from a non-
mineralised section that lacks the critical host.  There is major potential for more of these vein arrays 
within the Deposit.
•  An inferred lens of correlated mineralisation in the footwall of the Smarts Shear has been interpreted 
on  section  2850  between  SDD012  and  SDD061).  The  interpretation  is  that  the  mineralisation  is 
controlled  by  a  stratigraphic  variation  in  the  footwall  Volcanoclastic  Unit  (in  this  case  the  likely 
presence of a fine grained unit intercalated within the foliated footwall Volcanoclastic Unit).
•  An  inferred  lens  of  correlated  mineralisation  in  the  hangingwall  of  the  Smarts  Shear  has  been 
interpreted on section 2850 between SDD061, SDT601, SDD055, and SDD034).  The interpretation is 
that the mineralisation is controlled by the presence of a laterally continuous Fine Grained Unit within 
the interlayered fine and coarse grained Volcanoclastic Sediments.  This interpreted stratabound zone 
of mineralisation is parallel to the Porphyritic Rhyodacite Marker Bed.

Discrete Reverse Shears with High Grade Gold: Narrow discrete steeply east-dipping shears exist in the 
foliated  footwall  Volcanoclastic  sequence.    These  contain  visible  gold  within  dilation  jogs  and  also  pyrite, 
carbonate,  and  possible  tellurides  with  strong  hydrothermal  alteration  of  the  wallrock.    These  shears  also 
provide evidence that the mineralisation was associated with reverse movement on the shears.  These high 
grade structures cannot currently be correlated between drill holes or sections.

•  The presence of stratabound vein arrays controlled by the fine grained volcanoclastic sediments.   
•  Gold associated with sulphidation of wall rocks (e.g. the massive mafic unit). 
•  The lithic tuff correlates with the dip change on the Smarts Shear – this either may reflect it being a
control on the orientation of the shear.  It may also have acted as a seal to mineralising fluids.
•  A component of oblique movement cannot be excluded.
The current model (see Figure 8-10) is that shortening during the main stage of gold mineralisation resulted in 
the reactivation of pre-exising steeply dipping shears in a dominantly reverse manner. The mineralisation is

Structural Model: 
The following observations were used to constrain a simple and preliminary kinematic/ structural model for the 
Smarts Deposit;
•  The  mineralisation  is  late-stage  (the  mineralised  veins  are  not  obviously  folded  or  flattened  by  the 
foliation development).  This event is interpreted to have reactivated an existing steeply dipping set of 
shears and stratigraphic units.
•  Evidence  for  larger  laminated  veins  on  lower  angle  segments  of  the  Smarts  Shear  implies  the
formation of dilational jogs via reverse movement.
•  There are isolated steep east-dipping high grade reverse shears with possible tellurides. 
•  The  presence  of  mineralised  low  angle  veins  is  indicative  of  compressional  deformation  (normally
associated with reverse movement).
complicated  by  marked  variations  in  host  rocks  both  up  and  down  dip,  and  along  strike.  Lower  angle 
segments  of  the  Smarts  Shear  developed  major  dilational  jogs,  with  a  possible  hydrothermal  fluid  seal 
provided by the over-lying lithic tuffs.  Discrete east-dipping shears developed in the footwall and could merge 
with the main Smarts Shear (these contain ultra-high grade gold with possible tellurides).  Gold is associated 
with the massive mafic unit adjacent to the Smarts Shear, and also within stratabound vein arrays within fine 
grained  sedimnetary  packages  that  reflect  low  strain  shearing  of  these  units  (in  both  the  footwall  and 
hangingwall of the Smarts Shear).

9.  Exploration 
9.1 
Introduction 
Exploration  work  between  March  and  July  2013  documented  in  this  report  was  managed  by  Azimuth  and 
conducted  using  funding  provided  by  Troy  with  technical  input  and  oversight  by  Troy  management.    Troy 
acquired Azimuth  in  late July 2013  and assumed control  of all in-country field  based  and support /logistics 
activities. 
 
The majority of exploration work undertaken by Troy has consisted of Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond 
Core drilling of the Smarts, Hicks and Larken Zones which is described in Section 10 below.  Earlier Azimuth 
managed drilling occurred within the Karouni Gold Project and included Whitehall (Kaburi), Larken and other 
prospects.    Other  work  includes  regional  field  reconnaissance,  airborne  geophysical  surveys,  geological 
mapping, prospecting, rock chip sampling, trenching, channel sampling.     
 
Geobase  Australia Pty  Ltd (Geobase)  was commissioned by Azimuth to compile, validate and manage the 
historical  exploration  dataset  for  the  Karouni  Gold  Project.    Information  on  historical  exploration  is  outlined 
separately within Section 6.  The Karouni Gold Project was the main exploration focus for Azimuth exploration 
and the initial scope of work included:-
•
Initial  compilation  of  available  current  and  historic  exploration  data  (drilling,  trenching  and  surface 
geochemical sampling).
•  Establishing an auditable and robust Exploration Data Management System (EDMS). 
•  Validation of critical historical exploration data.
These objectives were met and Geobase and the historic data is now part of the active project database for 
the Karouni Gold Project.  
 
Since July 2013, Troy has managed exploration of the Karouni Gold Project with work consisting of Diamond 
Core  and  Reverse  Circulation  Resource  infill  drilling  of  the  Smarts  Deposit,  Hicks  Deposit  and  the  Larken 
Zone. The Karouni Gold Project database has been maintained by Troy personnel on site at Hicks Camp with 
back-ups in Georgetown and Perth offices.  
 
9.2  Karouni Survey Grids 
Troy has reviewed the historical local grids in use within the Project and assigned database codes as listed 
below.
•  BKLG - Black Local Grid. 
•  ELLG - Eldorado Local Grid.   
•  HILG - Hicks Local Grid. 
•  KELG - Kaburi East Local Grid. 
•  LALG - Larken Local Grid. 
•  NMLG - Nine Mile Local Grid. 
•  RALG - Ravines Local Grid.
At the time of initial drill database compilation in November 2011, an interim 2 point local grid transformation to 
the PSAD56_21N grid system was created where possible.  Differential GPS surveys at the Hicks Prospect 
during  2011  have  located  several  historical  holes  with  a  corresponding  local  grid  coordinate.    A  review  of 
these  drillholes  in  relation  to  the  standardised  grid  coordinates  still  gives  some  inconsistency  although  it  is 
thought historical drillholes have been determined to within +/-5m of actual location on the PSAD56_21N grid 
system.  The database retains the original local grid survey for historical drillholes and also the DGPS survey 
pickup (for located holes only), until further survey analysis provides a more refined grid transformation.  More 
recent  drillholes  retain  transformation  coordinates  based  on  the  interim  2  point  transformation  between  the 
local grid and PSAD56_21N grid system. 
 
Within  the  historical  data  there  is  very  little  Meta  data  available  for  down-hole  survey  control.    Meta  data 
includes such information as the grid system of survey, type of survey, instrument used and dates.  If available 
this data has been added to the database and any unknown details flagged accordingly.  The DGPS collar 
survey, grid transformation and survey analysis was carried out by Troy.  Troy is responsible for validating the 
data entered in the database. 
 
Troy will extend the existent Ground Magnetics Survey to NW and to SE existent survey that covers Hicks 
area.
September 2014
Page 75
The NW part of the survey will cover 10,000m of the Smarts-Hicks Corridor and parallel mineralised trends 
which include Smarts, West Powers, Norby, NW Smarts, Gibbs, Whitehall and El Paso Targets, as shown on 
Figure 9-1.
The Ground Magnetic Survey totals 375km of survey lines spaced at 100m and 10m station intervals.  310km 
of lines of the first grid is opened.
Troy is also contracting IP/Resistivity Survey, Dipole-Dipole Array to be carried out firstly on orientation lines 
over known deposits to be further applied on the targets.

10. Drilling 
10.1  Introduction 
For the purposes of this report the database close-out is considered to be April 30, 2014. Since March 2013, 
Troy  has  managed  the  drilling  conducted  by  Azimuth  with  all  of  the  drilling  focussed  within  the  Mineral 
Resource  areas  at  the  Smarts,  Hicks  and  Larken  Zones.  A  total  of  1,403  holes  for  150,545m  have  been 
completed to this date.  Drilling of the Hicks and Smarts Zones commenced in August 2010 and continued 
through  to  February  2014.    All  drilling  completed  by  Troy  and  Azimuth  on  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  is 
summarised in Table  10-1.  Complete  drillhole collar  information listing drillhole  locations  is included  within 
Table 10-2 and Table 10-5 is a complete listing of significant drillhole assay intercepts of the drilling completed 
under Troy. 
 
Since July 2013, Troy has continued to employ both Reverse Circulation and Diamond Core drill rigs to infill 
and upgrade the existing Mineral Resources. In terms of total Troy drilling; to date 123 holes have been drilled 
at the Smarts Zone for 16,895m of drilling and 62 holes at the Hicks Zone for 6,476.5m. The drilling metreage 
breakdown is as follows; Reverse Circulation; 69 holes have been drilled at the Smarts Zone for 6,050m of
September 2014
Page 76
drilling and 19 holes at the Hicks Zone for 2,079m, as well as Diamond Core; 54 holes have been drilled at the 
Smarts Zone for 10,845m of drilling and 43 holes at the Hicks Zone for 4,397.5m. 
 
Troy  also  drilled  15  sterilization  Reverse  Circulation  holes  for  1623m  at  the  proposed  tailings  containment 
area, to processing plant site and the new camp site. 
 
Troy is compiling information from recent auger holes and validating this against the historical data set.  The 
anticipated completion date of the auger database validation and re-compilation is the last calendar quarter of 
2014. An orientation auger program was carried out by Troy in 2014 at Hicks and Smarts with the objective of 
studying the gold and multi-elements dispersion in saprolite.  72 Auger holes at Hicks and 126 Auger holes at 
Smarts were completed by Troy in May 2014.

Figure 10-2:  Drilling Completed at the Smarts Deposit
10.2  Collar and Downhole Survey 
RC and Diamond Core holes at Smarts were drilled at 20m to 80m spacings on 25m to 220m spaced north-
east southwest orientated drill sections. At Hicks, the drill spacing is 25m to 60m on 15m to 100m spaced drill 
sections of the same orientation. These spacings are sufficient to show a continuity of mineralisation in the 
main mineralised zones of both deposits. The mineralisation at Hicks and Smarts is generally steep dipping 
and holes drilled from the surface are generally not orthogonal to the mineralisation down-dip.  Consequently 
the true thickness of intersections is generally less than the downhole thickness and typically 60% to 80% of 
the  downhole  length  as  a  guideline.    Troy  has  orientated  the  drill  holes  to  be  generally  orthogonal  to  the 
northwest striking mineralisation.
Drillhole collars are surveyed with Differential GPS by Troy personnel and compared to a 2011 LiDAR surface 
for verification.  All holes are inclined holes with the dip ranging between 40° and 75°.  Holes are inclined from 
collar positions outside of the mineralised zone and intersect the mineralised zone at a high angle. (refer to 
Figure 10-3 and Figure 10-4).

10.3  Bulk Density 
10.3.1  Bulk Density Test work  
10.3.2.1   Methodology – Drill Core 
Troy  conducts  density  test  work  using  the  water  immersion  technique.   The  work  has  been  undertaken  on 
recent Smarts and Hicks Diamond Core drilled by Azimuth/Troy.  All density test work is currently conducted 
on-site as follows:-
•  Testwork locations are marked on drill core by the logging geologist.  The samples are generally 10 to 
15cm in length and are marked with a unique sample identification number.  Samples are collected 
from  intact  whole  core  and  are  chosen  to  be  broadly  representative  of  the  main  lithological  and 
mineralisation units (see Figure 10-5).  Core samples are chosen at a rate of one sample every two 
core boxes or more frequently where required.
Figure 10-5:  Core Samples for Bulk Density Test Work
•  Samples  are  weighed  in  grams  on  a  digital  scale  to  an  accuracy  of  one  decimal  place.    A  200g 
standard weight is tested in air and water each morning before test work commencement to ensure 
the scale is calibrated correctly.  The scale calibration test is repeated at the commencement of test 
work for each drillhole.
•  Samples are sealed in candle wax or clear film after drying and before re-weighing in  water.  Wax 
coating  or  film  wrap  is  undertaken  immediately  after  drying  to  ensure  samples  do  not  re-absorb 
moisture from the atmosphere. 
10.3.2.2   Methodology – Surface Sample 
The Company has additionally carried out bulk density test work for the unconsolidated sand overburden. A 
surface sample was collected for density test work as only minor core drilling has been carried out in the oxide

and overburden zone. The test work procedure uses the volume displacement method with minor variation 
depending on surface topography. The procedure can be outlined as follows: -
•  Flat topography
o  Surface sample is collected from a nominally sized 30cm by 30cm by 30cm hole. 
o  A plastic bag  is placed in  the  hole  and filled  water to surface. The bagged  water is then 
o  The removed material is also bagged and transported to site. 
o  Bagged  samples  are  oven  dried  and  weighed  to  allow  calculation  of  a  dry  bulk  density
measured using a marked beaker.
value.
•  Steep to vertical topography
o  A 2” PVC spear of known length and dimensions is used to collect a sample. The spear is 
driven  into  the  surface  until  completely  filled  at  which  point  the  sample  is  retrieved  and 
bagged.
o  Bagged  samples  are  oven  dried  and  weighed  to  allow  calculation  of  a  dry  bulk  density
value.
10.3.2.3   Results 
Statistical analysis of the core density data by weathering zone and inside/outside the mineralisation domain 
was conducted. Bulk density results are shown below in Table 10-4. A review of the bulk density for barren 
sand overburden  was also carried out.   An  average  density  was obtained  by  material type.  Outlier  values 
were excluded using the following criteria listed below and in Table 10-3:-
•  Overburden: - Samples rejected where <1.2 or >2.0. 
•  Oxide: - Samples rejected where >2.7 (6 samples). 
•  Transition: - One obvious outlier was rejected. 
•  Fresh: - Samples rejected where <1.5 or >3.5 (3 samples).

10.5  Soil/Saprolite Auger Sampling 
For  auger  sampling,  material  is  collected  in  one  metre  intervals  using  a  “Dutch”  or  Edelman  auger  and 
homogenized on a clean plastic sheet.  Most auger samples were collected by hand, excluding a brief period 
where a mechanized auger was used.  Auger depths have varied, but are often as much as 9m and reach a 
maximum depth of 15m.  A representative 1kg - 2kg sample is extracted by coning and quartering either from 
a 1m or 2m sample interval.  A blank control sample, a field duplicate and a standard are inserted every 40-50 
samples.
Lithology  type,  colour  and  the  presence  of  sulphide,  quartz  veins  or  alluvial  material  is  recorded  for  each 
metre  upon  sampling  and  subsequently  cross  checked  by  the  supervising  geologist.    Data  entry  has  been 
carried out in the same way as for drill data to ensure consistency in information collection.
Two types of auger sampling have been carried out with the majority of auguring collected at 25m intervals on 
regularly  spaced  0350  trending  grids,  joined  by  a  local  baseline.    Each  collar  site  is  also  surveyed  using  a 
GPS,  and  in  some  cases  has  been  surveyed  using  DGPS.    In  some  areas  where  valleys  are  filled  with 
alluvium  and  tailings,  ridge  and  spur  sampling  at  25m  intervals  has  been  carried  out  using  a  similar 
methodology.
Auger sampling results are used to guide further exploration such as RC and diamond drilling. The auger data 
is not included in the resource estimation process.
10.6  Drilling Conditions 
The drill pad area is maintained at a good house-keeping standard to ensure equipment is in good working 
order for the drill campaign.  This includes level working conditions and weather protection.
The cyclone is cleaned before drilling starts for each RC hole and is kept clean throughout drilling and sample 
collection  Samples  for  each  metre  are  spread  evenly  across  the  splitter  and  care  is  taken  to  ensure  the 
sample does not spill over the edge of the splitter.  Any material adhering to the splitter represents a source of 
potential contamination between intervals (as is the case for the cyclone).  The splitter is regular checked for 
corrosion or any damage and the sample may be assisted through the splitter with the aid of a rubber mallet.  
Wet samples were collected and allowed to dry before splitting.
Recent drilling by Troy has been conducted by two Contractors; Orbit Drilling and Drillex.  Multiple drill rigs are 
in  operation  including:  Orbit  Diamond  Core  (DC)  rig,  Orbit  Reverse  Circulation  (RC  rig)  and  Drillex  6000 
Multipurpose. Since late 2012 through to April 2014 only the Orbit Contract rigs were in operation (see Figure 
10-6 and Figure 10-7).

10.7  Sample Quality and Recovery 
The sampling methodology described in this section relates specifically to the post-2009 drilling campaigns by 
Troy (Azimuth now Troy).  Pre-2009 diamond core drilling was cut in half using a core saw and sampled to 1m 
intervals or to geological boundaries, although some larger composites were taken in barren zones.
10.7.1  Sample Collection of RC Drilled Intervals 
All RC drilling to date has been completed by using a 5” to 5 ½” face hammer with samples collected mainly at 
1m or 3m intervals. The rig geologist determines if the sampling is to be done at 1m increments or composited 
into  a  3m  interval.  Sample  pertaining  to  mineralised  composites  returning  >0.25g/t  gold  are  retrieved  and 
these 1m samples are dried, re-split and submitted for assay.
10.7.2  RC Drill Core Recovery 
The RC drilling has an average drill sample recovery of 18kg.  Theoretical sample weights are 20kg weight for 
100% recovery in oxide material and a 36kg weight for 100% recovery in fresh material.  The theoretical drill 
sample weights include 5% moisture content.
Sample recovery appears acceptable for the RC drilling after allowing for varying density by weathering.  The 
sample weight is relatively low in near-surface intervals; however some recovery loss would be expected in 
unconsolidated material which forms a relatively minor rock type.
10.7.2.1   Weight of RC Sample Dispatched to Assay Laboratory 
Sample submission was supervised by a Company geologist and also checked by the receiving laboratory to 
ensure  sufficient  sample  mass  was  obtained  for  assay  analysis.    Troy  maintains  an  ongoing  continuous 
QAQC Program. Troy completed a QAQC quality assurance program during 2011-12 whereby the laboratory 
sample weight was recorded.  As the laboratory sample is a representative sub-lot of the sample mass at a 
constant split from the two-tier or three-tier riffle splitter, a measure of overall sample quality and representivity 
is provided by this analysis.
The  date  of  the  sample,  water  content  (as  wet,  moist  or  dry)  and  sample  identification  were  recorded  for 
15,733 samples mainly from the Smarts and Hicks drilling.  This represents approximately 27% of the assay 
database as at 13 July 2013.  Approximately 22% of the samples were recorded as wet with the remainder 
recorded as dry or moist.  Summary statistics for the original field sample by sample length are compiled in 
Table 10-4 below.

A  sample  weight  comparison  between  the  original  sample  and  the  field  duplicate  sample  is  presented  in 
Figure  10-8  for  429  samples.    Results  are  reasonable  in  both  cases.  It  is  recommended  sample  weights 
continue to be recorded on an ‘as dry’ basis for sample recovery analysis. Site visits conducted by Troy’s QPs 
have concluded that the field procedures in place are suitable and well maintained.

10.7.3  Sample Collection of Diamond Drilled Intervals 
Diamond Core drilling is mainly done HQ and HQ3 sized equipment and minor PQ, with samples collected 
mainly at 1m lengths.  Diamond Core is retrieved from the drill site twice daily by a geologist and secured in 
the back of a Landcruiser pick up using ratchet straps.
10.7.4  Diamond Core Drilling Recovery 
The Diamond Core recovery has been calculated for historical drill core and results have been entered into 
the database.  Average core recovery for the diamond drilling is 91%.  Of note is that approximately 3% of the 
sample intervals record a recovered core recovery above 100%.  The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, 
however, it is thought this largely reflects a data translation error.  Other additional errors are thought to reflect 
inexact locations of core depth marker blocks or possible drill core lifter problems with minor core from one 
core barrel run being included in the next core barrel run.
Unfortunately  historical  drillcore  is  considered  lost  due  to  poor  preservation  from  an  inappropriate  storage 
facility  used  by  previous  explorers.    It  is  considered  likely  that  any  impact  from  the  data  translation  errors 
would be of minor importance and of minor risk.   
The diamond drill core recovery has also been calculated for core drilled up to July 2013 and core recovery 
was found to be excellent in fresh rock.  Average core recovery for the Diamond Core drilling is 99%.  Visual 
inspection of core during the site visits supported the quality and recovery of the core (see Figure 10-9). There 
are no known core recovery factors which would materially impact the accuracy and reliability of assay results.

10.8  Geological Controls 
Important geological controls or domain boundaries for gold mineralisation relate to the flat-lying weathering or 
barren  overburden  horizons  and  the  sub-vertical,  mineralised  shear  zones.    In  this  respect,  the  structurally 
related  shear  zones  provide  the  most  important  parameter  in  selecting  the  sample  interval  length.    The 
mineralised  shear  zones  vary  from  several  metres  wide  to  a  width  of  tens  of  metres  in  places.    The 
mineralisation boundary is sharply defined over an interval of decimetres and the waste separation between 
mineralised zones is also in the order of several metres and up to ten metres width in places.  The inclined 1m 
sample interval is sufficient to define the mineralisation and domain boundaries at a scale suitable for further 
block model and optimisation studies.
Gold  mineralisation  downhole  is  variable  and  significantly  higher  grade  intersections  do  occur  adjacent  to 
mineralisation  boundaries  and/or  lower  grade  intersections.    Studies  to  date  on  the  better  drilled  Smarts 
deposit indicate that the coefficient of variation (CV) is 2.96 for mineralised intersections.  This suggests that 
standard industry techniques such as Ordinary Kriging with minor top-cuts can be used for the block model 
estimate and that the quality of the estimate will be sufficient for optimisation studies.
10.9  True Thickness of Intersections 
Troy  has  released  the  results  of  exploration  drilling  conducted  during  2012  -  2014  as  assay  results  have 
returned.  The visual mineralisation is recognised as iron-oxide stained quartz veins within a shear zone and 
has been identified in the majority of holes.  The orientation of mineralised zones comprising each prospect is 
well established, and it is estimated that the true width of mineralised intercepts reported in the tables below of 
significant intersections represents some 60% to 80% of the downhole intervals.  Significant intersections for 
the recent drilling at the Smarts and Hicks Deposits, as well as some of the local prospects are listed below in 
Table 10-5.

10.10  Data Excluded 
Trench information was used to guide mineralisation wireframe interpretation however was excluded from the 
estimation process at both Hicks and Smarts.  This reflected concerns with the quality, age and location of the 
data.  In general the trench information agreed with the structural interpretation from drilling at deeper levels.
At Smarts RC drillhole SRC321 was also excluded from the estimation as results conflicted with surrounding 
holes SRC009 and SDT008.

11. Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
The  sampling  preparation,  analyses  and  security  described  in  this  section  relates  specifically  to  the  drilling 
campaigns since July 2013 by Troy.
11.1  Sample Interval Selection and Mineralisation Controls 
A  sample  interval  of  1m  has  been  selected  for  the  RC  and  Diamond  Core  drilling  with  proximity  to  gold 
mineralisation (buffer zone).  This sample spacing ensures a representative sample weight is collected at a 
scale  sufficient  to  define  geological  and  mineralisation  boundaries.    The  1m  samples  are  assayed  at  1m 
intervals in visibly conspicuous mineralisation or otherwise composited to 3m intervals before assay.  Any low 
grade  internal  zones  are  also  assayed  at  1m  intervals  and  a  sample  buffer  is  placed  before  and  after  the 
mineralisation  boundary  to  ensure  the  assays  do  not  begin  or  end  within  high-grade  mineralisation.    The 
original  1m  samples  are  sent  for  assay  where  any  significant  gold  assay  grades  are  recorded  for  the  3m 
composite samples.
The use of a 1m sample interval was selected after consideration of the following:
•  Consideration of previous sampling methodology. 
•  The RC drilling method and sample collection process for current drill campaigns. 
•  A representative sample weight suitable for transport, laboratory preparation and analysis. 
•  The lithological thickness of the White Sands Formation and underlying basement lithology. 
•  A mineralisation zone thickness ranging from several metres to tens of metres.  
•  Suitability for statistical analysis.  A standard sample length ensures all assay results are treated on 
equal support when reviewing assay statistics (before sample compositing for geostatistical analysis 
and resource estimation).
•  The  Diamond  Core  and  RC  drilling  method  will  in  general  provide  superior  sample  collection 
compared  to  open-hole  drill  methods  (e.g.  auger  or  RAB)  and  reduce  the  possibility  of  down-hole 
grade smearing or contamination.
11.2  RC Drilling Sampling Methodology 
All RC drilling to date used a 5 to 5 ½” face hammer with samples collected mainly at 1m or 3m intervals.  The 
rig  geologist  determines  if  the  sampling  is  to  be  done  at  1m  increments  or  composited  into  a  3m  interval.  
Sample pertaining to mineralised composites returning >0.25g/t gold are retrieved and these 1m samples are 
dried, presplit and submitted for assay.
A sample sheet is completed on the rig by the geologist that corresponds to a sample ticket book.  Data such 
as down hole interval, sample identification number, sample method, sample quality, bulk bag weights, water 
content and QA/QC sample checks are recorded on both the sample sheet and ticket book.  This includes the 
name of the sampling supervisor.
The  rig  geologist  determines  the  placement  of  duplicate  samples,  standards  and  blanks  to  be  inserted.  
Sample identification numbers designated for standards or blanks are written on the bags with the bags left 
empty.  These QA/QC check samples are inserted at frequency of no less than 5% standard, 5% blanks and 
10% duplicate.
The downhole samples are recovered from the drill rig cyclone and collected in UV-stabilized plastic sample 
bags.  Each plastic bag is labelled with the relevant drillhole name and sample interval.  An identification plate 
made from non-perishable aluminium is placed inside each bag and the bag is sealed to prevent spillage.
Each  sample  bag  is  then  split  at  the  drill  site  to  provide  a  representative  sample  for  assay  analysis.    The 
representative sample is collected in a pre-numbered calico bag after passing through a three tier riffle splitter 
supplied by Troy.  The sample splitters are made in Australia and certified to industry standards.  In cases of 
wet  samples  Troy  practice  was  to  collect  a  “spear”  sample  as  moist  samples  clog  the  splitter.    Troy  has 
implemented a system of drying all moist samples and then splitting with riffle splitter.
Holes are then assayed at 1m intervals in visibly conspicuous mineralisation or otherwise composited to 3m 
intervals.  While not always weighed, samples sent to the laboratory are in the order of three to four kilograms. 
The coarse field reject is stored on-site until assay results are received and validated.  Troy recognises that 
spearing is a relatively poor quality method of splitting compared to riffle or cone splitting. Therefore spear
September 2014
Page 117
samples  which  return  assays  >0.2g/t  gold  are  re-assayed  by  drying  the  coarse  field  reject,  riffle  splitting  a 
sample when dry and re-sending for laboratory analysis.
All samples are allocated a unique sample identification number.  The number is written on the cloth sample 
bag and a weather proof paper tear out from the ticket book with the same identification number is placed 
within each cotton sample bag.  The cotton sample bags are lined with plastic to avoid leakage and possible 
contamination issues from wet or damp samples.  Samples are then weighed and range from 1kg minimum to 
7kg maximum.
All  samples  are  collected  from  the  drill  site  each  day  and  taken  to  the  sample  processing  shed  at  Hicks 
exploration camp (see Figure 11-1).  Typically, one hole is collated into one assay batch run.
Figure 11-1:  RC Samples Awaiting Dispatch at the Hicks Exploration Camp
The  geologist  creates  a  chain-of-custody  dispatch  before  off-site  sample  transport.    Included  in  these 
documents is the sample batch numbers loaded on the transport truck.  The transport driver signs off on the 
dispatch which is also checked and signed for by the receiving laboratory.  This signed copy identifying that all 
samples sent off-site were also received by the laboratory is then sent back to Troy for record keeping.
11.3  Diamond Drilling Sampling Methodology 
Diamond  Core  drilling  is  mainly  done  using  HQ  and  HQ3  sized  equipment  and  minor  PQ,  with  samples 
collected primarily at 1m lengths.  Diamond Core is retrieved twice daily from the drill site by a geologist and 
secured  in  the  back  of  a  Landcruiser  pick  up  using  ratchet  straps.    All  core  boxes  are  identified  with  the 
drillhole number and down hole from and to intervals in permanent marker pen.
After geological and geotechnical logging takes place the core is photographed wet and dry.  Photos include 
sample intervals and assay sample numbers identified from tickets in the core trays.  All photos are checked 
for quality before the core is cut.
September 2014
Page 118
The core is placed in the saw cradle facing downhole (see Figure 11-2).  If the core is oriented, the core is cut 
perpendicular to the orientation line.  For consistency the orientation line is placed on the left hand side of the 
saw blade with the right hand side of the core taken for assay sample.  The ½ core marked by the orientation 
line is retained in the core box.  If there is no orientation line for reference, the core is still placed in the saw 
cradle facing down hole with the right hand side taken for assay and the left retained in the core box.
Once the core is halved, it is sampled every 1m (unless otherwise noted). Blanks and standards are inserted 
at a rate of not less than one every 20 samples.  Halved core samples for analysis are placed in a cotton 
sample bag and identified with the sample number (see Figure 11-3).  A sample number ticket is also taken 
from  the  sample  ticket  book  and  placed  inside  each  bag.    Sample  ticket  books  are  retained  on  site  at  the 
Camp.  Samples are laid out in rows by sample identification and grouped by drill hole number.
All core boxes with the retained ½ core are stacked according to drill hole number and retained on site at the 
camp.

Page 119
Figure 11-3:  Core Samples Awaiting Dispatch at the Hicks Exploration Shed
Historic  Diamond  Core  was  cut  in  half  using  a  core  saw  and  sampled  to  1m  intervals  or  to  geological 
boundaries, although some larger composites were taken in barren zones.  Detailed sampling procedures for 
the historic core drilling are not available.
11.4  Auger Sampling Methodology 
Most  auger  sampling  programs  are  conducted  from  camps  remote  from  the  Hicks  Camp  and  accordingly, 
auger  samples  are  collected  on  a  weekly  basis.   When  the  auger  samples  arrive  at  the  sample  shed,  the 
samples and data sheets are handed to a senior crew leader for dispatch preparation.
The hole number and sample range is written on a tri-pod and placed at the head of the batch run.  These are 
checked  against  the  data  sheets  and  ticket  books  by  the  supervising  sample  crew  leader  and  checked  a 
second time by a senior geologist.  Concurrent with the checking of sample intervals and sample numbers, 
blanks  and  standards  are  inserted  into  the  empty  numbered  cloth  bags  by  the  geologist.    All  samples  are 
placed  in  large  plastic  lined  poly-weave  bags  that  have  been  pre-labelled  with  the  sample  range  and  bag 
number and the assay lab address.
11.5  Sample Chain of Custody and Transport from Camp 
All samples are loaded into large plastic bags on site and freighted to the laboratory under the supervision of 
Troy personnel.  The plastic bags are sealed with metal ties and sample transport is provided by contractors.  
A Chain of Custody form is filled in by the Senior Geologist as a summary of all samples leaving site on each 
sample dispatch.  Included in this form is the batch number, sample range, the date of dispatch, laboratory 
destination and a check box.  This form is signed by the supervising geologist and also signed by the transport 
contractor.  The vehicle registration is also noted.  All samples are subsequently loaded onto the truck and are 
transported  to  Georgetown.    All  documentation  is  emailed  to  the  destination  assay  laboratory.    The  assay 
laboratories are independent of Troy.
Pharsalus  Gold  has  previously  employed  two  sample  preparation  laboratories  within  Guyana  to  prepare 
samples for analysis: -
1.  Acme Laboratory, located at Lot 13 Plantation Non Pariel, East Coast Demerara;  and
September 2014
Page 120
2.  ActLabs Guyana, located at 27/28 Parcel Beterverwagting, Industrial Area, East Coast Demerara.
More recently, Troy has contracted the ActLabs Guyana laboratory has been used for sample preparation.
On receipt of samples, the preparation laboratories are required to check that each sample on the Dispatch 
Requisition  has  been  received  and  match  the  authorized  Chain  of  Custody  document.    The  laboratory 
undertakes reconciliation between physical sample numbers and received paperwork before sample crushing.  
Troy  is  advised  by  the  laboratory  of  any  issues  such  as  missing  or  additional  samples,  insufficient  sample 
mass for analysis or problems with sample identification.  The preparation laboratory manager then authorizes 
the batch by signing the Chain of Custody document and returns it to Troy’s office in Georgetown for filing.
Quality  assurance  samples  are  inserted  by  Troy  personal  prior  to  sample  transport  to  the  preparation 
laboratories.    Quality  assurance  is  undertaken  on  a  systematic  basis  with  blanks,  standards  and  field 
duplicates  inserted  at  regular  intervals.    Troy’s,  and  previously  Azimuth’s,  Quality  Assurance  and  Quality 
Control (QAQC) protocol entails two QAQC samples are inserted for every 10 samples.  The QAQC samples 
consist of a field duplicate sample and either a standard or blank.  The standards and blanks are inserted in 
an alternating sequence.
Chain of custody and sample transport procedures are incomplete for historic drilling at the Project.  As such 
Troy is not aware of any issues that may be present for historic drilling.  The current chain of custody and 
sample transport procedures developed for the Karouni Gold Project drilling and exploration to be adequate.
11.6  Assay Sample Preparation from Drilling Samples 
For the Hicks Deposit, sample preparation  was mainly conducted by  ActLabs  Guyana  at  their Georgetown 
facility (East Coast Demerara).  Some of the earlier Hicks samples were prepared at ACME Guyana at their 
Georgetown facility (East Coast Demerara).  For the Smarts Deposit, sample preparation was conducted by 
ActLabs Guyana at their Georgetown facility (East Coast Demerara).
Batches of individual samples are loaded into sacks and sealed on site, and transported by Company vehicle 
to  the  appropriate  sample  preparation  facility.    Dispatch  sheets  accompany  each  shipment,  with  a  copy 
retained on site.  The laboratory undertakes sample reconciliation with the dispatch sheet upon arrival of the 
samples.  Any significant differences are flagged with Troy for resolution.  The laboratory is responsible for 
assay sample preparation and the subsequent assay procedure.
In  the  author’s  opinion  the  sample  preparation,  security  and  analytical  procedures  are  appropriate  for  the 
deposit style, at industry standard and will provide results suitable for Resource estimation.
11.7  Methodology of Sample Assay Analysis for Drilling Samples 
Prior to 2012, assays of drilling samples for the Smarts and Hicks Deposits were mainly performed by ActLabs 
in Chile.  In January 2012 ActLabs commissioned their assay laboratory in Guyana and ISO certification was 
received in June 2012 (see Figure 11-4 and Figure 11-5).  The same assay methodology has been used at 
both ActLabs laboratories. P. Doyle visited the ActLabs laboratories in May 2013 and again in March 2014.
September 2014

Figure 11-4:  Furnaces at ActLabs Guyana
Samples were initially assayed using a 30g aliquot for fire assay with AAS finish.  Assayed samples returning 
>3g/t gold were repeat fire assayed using a 30g charge with gravimetric finish.  The fire assay with gravimetric 
finish is the preferred result for subsequent use. Since mid-year 2013 a 50g fire assay with AAS finish has be 
adopted  as  the  standard  analytical  method  and  assayed  samples  returning  >10g/t  gold  were  repeat  fire 
assayed using a 50g charge with gravimetric finish.
When the logging geologist notes the presence of visible gold or geological characteristics suggesting high 
gold grade in mineralised drill intervals a screen fire assay using a 500g charge is undertaken.  These results 
supersede all other assay methods.  The screen fire assay is undertaken on the logged interval with additional 
samples also taken for screen fire assay.  Typically additional samples are collected from a distance of 5m to 
10m  on  either  side  of  the  interval  containing  visible  gold.    The  screen  fire  assay  method  is  considered  to 
provide more reliable assay results when compared to the initial fire assay or fire assay with gravimetric finish 
methods.
The selection of the assay method is similar for 1m samples and 3m composite samples.
The following information for sample preparation and analysis is listed for ActLabs:
•  Record sample batch received. 
•  Crush,  pulverise  to  pulp  material  and  split  sample.    A  size  fraction  check  is  carried  out  every  8th 
sample  or  to  customer  requirements  (e.g.  90%  passing  12  mesh).    Internal  laboratory  blanks  are 
inserted  every  35th  sample  in  addition  to  cleaning  of  crushing  and  pulverising  equipment  with 
compressed  air  after  preparation  of  each  sample.    These  blanks  are  analysed  and  reported  to  the 
client as part of laboratory quality control.  A barren silica wash is also carried out at the end of each 
assay batch.
•  Assay  via  fire  assay  (FA)  and  AAS  finish  on  a  30g  test  weight.    A  repeat,  second  fire  assay  with 
gravimetric  finish  is  undertaken  where  the  initial  FA  assay  is  >3g/t  gold.    The  second  assay  is 
considered more correct for use.  The laboratory undertakes analysis of a sample duplicate every 35th
September 2014
Page 122
sample  and  reports  the  results  to  the  client  as  a  part  of  laboratory  quality  control.    In  addition,  the 
laboratory inserts certified and in-house standards which are of similar grade and material matrix to 
the client samples.  The in-house laboratory standards are subjected to round robin testing from other 
laboratories to determine the accepted value and confidence intervals. 
Internal laboratory controls (standards and blanks) are carried out for each sample batch and reported 
with sample assay results.  All results are stored in a dedicated Laboratory Information Management 
System (LIMS) database.

11.8  Assay Quality Control Measures (QAQC) for Drilling 
In-house  and  laboratory  QAQC  data  for  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  have  been  reviewed  for  analytical  data 
collected between July 2013 and April 2014.
Introduction
11.8.1 
All drilling programs carried out at the Karouni Gold Project have included ongoing QAQC procedures.  These 
procedures  include  the  use  of  certified  standards  and  blanks,  internal  laboratory  quality  control  and 
submission of field duplicate samples.
The Rig Supervising Geologist determines the placement of standards, blanks and duplicate samples to be 
inserted in the sample stream.  Sample identification numbers designated for standards or blanks are written 
on the bags with the bags left empty.  These QAQC check samples are inserted at frequency of no less than 
5% standard, 5% blanks and 10% duplicate.  A summary of sample percentage by QAQC type for Hicks and 
Smarts is presented in Table 11-1 and Table 11-2.
A QAQC assessment of the data is completed on a regular basis by Company geologists.  The QAQC report 
provided  by  Geobase  (Lloyd,  2013)  concluded  that  all  sampling,  sample  preparation,  sample  security  and 
analytical procedures conform to industry best practice and are adequate to give a representative picture of
September 2014
Page 123
the  nature  of  the  mineralized  body  and  its  host  rocks.  Since  mid-year  2013  monthly  QAQC  reports  are 
generated  by  Troy  staff.  Consulting  Geochemist.  Dr.  Mark  Fedikow;  Ph.D.  P.Eng.  P.Geo.  C.P.G.  of  Mount 
Morgan Resources Ltd Consultancy; 627 Manchester Blvd. North, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada was engaged 
by Troy to review QAQC results as well as current procedures and protocols.

11.8.2  Standards and Blanks 
The following quality control procedures are currently in use for blanks and standards:
•  Blanks – consisting of uniform material containing no gold.  Troy uses blanks consisting of silica sand 
and  a  second  described  as  gabbro  GT  siftings.  Blanks  are  utilized  to  track  possible  sources  of 
contamination during sample preparation.
•  Standards – currently there are up to 21 different standards in use by Troy.  The standards have been 
sourced  from  Geostats  Pty  Limited  and  Rocklabs  Limited,  and  are  all  certified  gold  reference 
materials.  The standards have been selected on the basis of their grade to match the average grade 
range of gold mineralisation. Matrix matching in standards is outstanding.
September 2014
Page 124
The  standards  are  supplied  as  pre-crushed  powders  and  their  use  provides  an  indication  of  the  ability  to 
determine the content of the metal of interest in an accurate and reproducible manner in the assay procedure.
The  use  of  field  introduced  blank  standards  is  primarily  to  assess  any  sequence  contamination  introduced 
during sample preparation and analysis.  Blank material consists of non-certified in-house blank material of 
barren rock types.  The material used for Blank 1 has been collected from white sand on-site while Blank 2 
has been collected from gabbro siftings.  The field preparation of blank material has not been documented.  
Blank 2 is utilized to demonstrate the lack of contamination of the samples in the laboratory analytical stream.
The certified standard reference materials used by Troy and reviewed in this report are summarised in Table 
11-3.  Only those standards with >25 replicate analyses are displayed in this Table.  Twenty-five replicates are 
considered the minimum number of assays upon which to base significant observations and conclusions.  The 
silica sand blank Blank2 has returned results within acceptable limits.  A small number of elevated spikes in 
the  replicate  analyses  of  blank  Blank2  are  documented  (Figure  11-6)  however  these  are  interpreted  as 
spurious and not indicative of a particular pattern of contamination (Figure 11-7).  Additional under-reporting 
occurs for standards G900-5 (Figure 11-8) and G909-5 (Figure 11-9). Control charts for standards G903-9, 
G904-8  and  G909-1  are  given  in  Figure  11-10,  Figure  11-11  and  Figure  11-12  respectively.  Accuracy  and 
reproducibility as demonstrated by the standards is excellent.

The results of 287 replicate analyses of Blank2 indicate the relative lack of contamination measured in this 
blank  (see  Figure  11-6).    Exceptions  occur  at  several  points  during  the  analytical  time  frame  for  these 
measurements  but  these  are  neither  systematic  nor  indicative  of  serious  contamination  in  the  assay 
laboratory.

11.8.3  Laboratory Duplicate Samples 
Duplicates  for  Spear  and  Three  Tier  riffled  core  samples  indicate  good  linear  relationships  between  the 
original and the repeat analysis for both Spear and Three Tier riffled samples (see Figure 11-13 and Figure 
11-14)

Figure 11-14:  Results for Laboratory Duplicate Au Assays (FA-AAS-PPB), Three Tier Samples
Sample Size in Laboratory Duplicates: Gold assay results for quarter core and half core are compared in 
Figure 11-15. It is clear the appropriate sample size has been utilized for the Karouni assays. Quarter core 
results indicate a significantly less linear association than do the results for the half core samples. There is a 
suggestion of nugget effect in the Three Tier assays at elevated concentrations.

Field Duplicates:  The results of simple linear regression for both Spear and Three Tier samples indicates 
scattered  data  indicative  of  possible  nugget  effects  in  the  Spear  samples  and  highly  variable  data  for  the 
Three  Tier  samples.  The  cause  for  the  variability  is  likely  an  inhomogenous  sample  resulting  from  nugget 
effect.  Interestingly,  in  over-range  sample  assays  both  Spear  and  Three  Tier  samples  appear  to  be  less

variable than assays at lower concentrations. This may be the difference between fire assay results and those 
for AAS (see Figure 11-16, Figure 11-17 and Table 11-4)

11.9  Adequacy of Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
Notwithstanding the lack of information regarding sample preparation, security and analytical procedures for 
historic  drilling  at  the  Project  the  assay/analytical  procedures  implemented  for  modern,  recent  drilling  are 
considered  appropriate  and  adequate  for  the  deposit  style  and  the  environment  within  which  exploration  is 
being undertaken.  The approaches are based on best practice industry standards and results are suitable for 
comparison  with  historic  results  and  ongoing  assessments.  As  part  of  future  quality  control  measures  at 
Karouni an examination of the distribution of particulate and/or sulphide bound gold might alleviate some of 
the reproducibility issues observed in field duplicate samples.
11.9.1  Summary of Observations and Conclusions to Date 
 
Duplicates
Field Duplicates: There is significant scatter at all levels of concentration in this data particularly for
the gold assays determined by Fire Assay with atomic absorption (“AA”) finish (ppb). In fact there are 118 
samples out of 420 (28%) that fall outside the error limits. This is a reflection of sample inhomogeneity and the 
difficulty in selecting a representative sample for assay that ensures a reliable distribution of gold or gold-
bearing particles in the sample.
There is significantly less scatter in the Field Duplicates for gold determined by Fire Assay-Gravimetry (ppm) 
although there are only 21 assays used to assess this. Nevertheless, 11 out of 21 assays fall outside of the 
error limits for a 52% failure rate. The inhomogeneity in the field duplicates is also reflected in this approach to 
gold assay. Gravimetry or AA-based analytical approaches cannot make up for an inhomogenous sample.
Lab Duplicates
Labdup_lp: Laboratory duplicates reflect far less variability in analyses for gold assays determined by
AA or Gravimetry. In the AA data (ppb) there is relatively good reproducibility observed with 39 of 278 
samples falling outside of the error limits for a success ratio of 14%. In the Gravimetric determination of gold 
(ppm) there are only 4 samples observed and one of these falls outside of error limits (25%). These data are 
considered superior to the Field Duplicates in terms of reproducibility.
September 2014
Page 132
Labdup_p: Despite a large number of gold determinations by Fire Assay and AA finish (n=350; ppb)
for these duplicate samples many fall below the lower limit of detection (“LLD”) for the analytical method 
(206/350=59%). Of those samples >LLD 72 (20%) are outside of the error limits. The gold assays by 
Gravimetry (ppm) are few (n=11) however none of these exceed the error limits and on this basis, albeit a 
small sample population, appear to offer a more accurate and reproducible gold assay.
Lab Replicates: Gold analyses by Fire Assay and AA finish (ppb) are based on 436 samples of which
276 are below the limits of detection for this analytical method and 74 of 436 (17%) are outside of the error 
limits. Variability is significant but with 274 of 436 or 63% of the samples <LLD it is difficult to appreciate just 
how variable these data are. There is only one duplicate pair analyzed by Fire Assay with Gravimetry and as 
such is not commented upon further.
Blanks
Blanks: Blank2 is the only blank for which data is available. Only 3 samples exceed the error limits for
902 analyses for an excellent 0.3%. The 3 samples outside of the error limits are considered to be spurious. 
There are however 3 distinctive periods where some minor gold contamination was documented at very low 
levels. These periods occurred during the first two weeks of September (2013), during the period September 
30 to November 16 and onwards from February 13 (2014).  These periods of slightly elevated gold in Blank2 
are derived from a moving average of samples assayed during these periods and as such may not be as 
consistent as initially thought. There are no significant issues identified in Blank2.
Standards
The analysis of gold in standards is reviewed for two analytical approaches: Fire Assay-Atomic Absorption 
finish and Fire Assay-Gravimetric finish. Observations based on both are given below for most standards.
G900-5: Au-Fire Assay-Atomic Absorption (ppb): A slow but progressive decrease in gold
concentration is documented for these analyses. It is likely however this pattern or trend is strongly influenced 
by 6 very low assay results produced after December 24/13. There are only 6 of 82 measurements (7%) are 
outside of the error limits. The additional assay approach of Fire Assay-Gravimetry for these standards 
indicates low to very low variability with no assays outside of the error limits. Both analytical approaches 
indicate excellent results for G900-5.
G903-9: There were no samples plotted for gold assays by FA-AA (ppb). However the plot for gold 
 
assays for G903-9 by FA-Gravimetry documents no samples outside of the error limits but with a slow and 
steady decrease in concentration in assay results from November 22/13 to March 4/14.
G904-8: There are no samples assayed for gold by FA-AA (ppb) that fall outside of the error limits for
Au-FA-AA (ppb). There is however a couple of general trends within the plotted data. These are a small 
progressive decrease in gold abundance between December 10/13 and February 11/14. At the end of this 
trend the opposite occurs with a slow progressive increase in gold content of the standard between 
February11/14 through March 1/14. In the Au-FA-Gravimetry (ppm) determinations no samples fall outside the 
error limits but like the FA-AA Au determinations those for Gravimetry demonstrate a steady increase between 
July 16/13 and September 6/13. It is noted that only 8 assays were undertaken with Gravimetry finish.
G907-2: Based on 386 determinations for gold on this standard by FA-AA (ppb) only 3 samples lie 
outside the error limits (0.7%). The results are well-constrained. There were no results reported for gold by 
FA-Gravimetry.
G909-1:  Like standard G907-2 the analytical results based on gold assays by FA-AA (ppb) G909-1 
are well constrained with only 1 sample outside of the error limits for 226 determinations (0.4%). There were 
no patterns of variability observed within the data. There were no results reported for gold by FA-Gravimetry.

G909-5: The analytical results based on for gold assays by FA-AA (ppb) in standard G909-5 are well
constrained with only 1 sample outside of the error limits for 128 determinations (0.7%). There were no 
patterns of variability observed within the data. The FA-AA Au determinations based on Gravimetry for only 3 
samples indicate none lay outside of the error limits.
Conclusions:
1.  The Field Duplicates are by far the most variable dataset for gold analyses regardless whether they
are assayed with AA finish or Gravimetry. This is understandable given the collection and 
homogeneization of a field sample is likely to be less rigorous than one prepared for assay in the 
laboratory. The variability for assays by AA-Gravimetry is less because the magnitude of the 
measurement is in parts per million and not parts per billion.
2.  Laboratory duplicates are generally excellent in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. Laboratory
replicates are tough to assess because 63% of the assays are <LLD.
3.  Standards are performing well. There are minor variabilities with the standards over time but none of
this variability is of significance.
reproducibility.
4.  The quality of the gold assays is therefore interpreted to be very good based on accuracy and
5.  As part of future quality control measures at Karouni an examination of the distribution/siting of
particulate and/or sulphide bound gold might alleviate some of the reproducibility issues observed in 
field duplicate samples.

12. Data Verification 
Database  verification  was  carried  out  during  on-site  reviews  and  Mineral  Resource  estimation.    The  due 
diligence  included  field  checks  on  the  collar  and  downhole  orientation  as  well  as  verification  of  site  and 
database  procedures.    Regular  spot  check  of  the  database;  collar,  downhole  survey,  assay  and  geology 
tables against original files are undertaken. As a result of the verification process, the authors are confident 
the quality of the data is of a high standard suitable for use in this report.
12.1  Historical Drill Hole Database Pre –Troy 
No  assay  certificates  are  available  for  any  exploration  completed  by  the  British  Guyana  Geological  Survey 
(GGMC),  Overseas  Platinum  Company  (OPC)  or  Cathedral  Gold.   While  these  results  cannot  therefore  be 
verified,  documentation  in  relation  to  trenching,  diamond  drilling  and  pit  sampling  completed  by  Cathedral 
Gold is sufficient to suggest that there is no reason to doubt their validity.
Similarly, stream sediment sampling completed by the GGMC appears to have been undertaken in a rigorous 
manner to best international standards at the time.  While no assay certificates are available for this work, the 
procedures and results are well documented and there is no reason to doubt their validity.
At the Azimuth’s request Geobase Consultants undertook cross referencing of the compiled assay data with 
the  original  assay  laboratory  files.    A  number  of  inconsistencies  were  noted.    These  inconsistencies,  in 
conjunction with a lack of metadata available on assay techniques, deemed it necessary to reload all of the 
original data.  In addition, random checks of assay data from original drill paper logs were also undertaken.  
No significant issues were identified.  Samples of unknown origin were given a Lab ID of "Unknown".  If the 
date of analysis was unknown a default value of 01/01/1900 was used.
12.2  Recent Exploration 
In the past Azimuth outsourced all its on-going database management services to an independent company, 
Geobase.  All exploration derived data such as drilling, surface geochemistry and point data is stored within a 
SQL  database  model  designed  for  the  storage  of  exploration  derived  data  (Geomodel).    This  provides  a 
flexible and efficient environment for validating, storing and assessing data from diverse software applications 
and sources.  
 
Access to the database is restricted to personnel only who have been trained in database management.  All 
appropriate  and  valid  changes  requested  from  site  are  made  only  by  the  Database  Administrator.    Site 
personnel do not have the ability to directly access the database which allows the integrity of the data to be 
maintained. 
 
Since mid-2013, Troy has managed the database as part of its global database management system. Troy 
has set up a comprehensive suite of procedures for drilling, sampling and assaying.  The procedures include 
standardised templates for geological logging and sample selection (including insertion of standards, blanks 
and duplicates).  A spreadsheet based log is completed for each drillhole and then submitted to the Database 
Administrator  for  verification  and  uploading  to  the  drillhole  database.    The  capture  of  exploration  data  is 
outlined within Figure 12-1 below.  Standard lithological codes for the major rock types are presented within 
Figure 12-2.  The table structure of the database for drilling and trenching is presented below in Figure 12-3.   
The preferred means of data capture is to record data digitally, however it has been necessary in some cases 
to  complete  hardcopy  paper  logs  which  are  then  entered  into  Excel  based  tables  at  a  later  stage.    The 
spreadsheet  also  allows  for  the  recording  of  comments  made  in  relation  to  the  captured  meta-data  (e.g. 
drilling conditions, sample recovery, abandoned holes, etc.).  Database verification includes validation based 
on code checks (e.g. geology legend), multi-table (e.g. drillhole collar or end of hole) and spatial validation.  
Database queries flagged by database Administrator are then sent to the field based team for resolution and 
correction before database finalisation.  The validation check list is comprehensive and includes:
•  Checks for non-standard character codes. 
•  A check of numeric values against a minimum and maximum range. 
•  Missing coordinates, height and drillhole depth in the collar file. 
•  Large deviations in both dip and azimuth in the survey file.
September 2014
Page 135
•  Missing intervals in the down-hole interval file. 
•  Duplication of drillhole numbers or overlapping intervals in the down-hole interval file. 
•  Records in the interval file that exceeds the total depth in the collar file. 
•  Missing holes in either the collar file or down-hole interval file. 
•  Missing intervals inserted and classified accordingly to knowledge base. 
•  Down-hole survey dip and azimuth data checks (Magnetic vs. True North vs. Local).  
•  Spatial distribution of mineralisation. 
•  Spatial distribution of down-hole geology.

12.3  Twinned Drillholes or Sample Lines 
The drilling of twinned drill holes refers to an industry practice of repeat drilling an earlier drillhole.  The repeat 
drillhole trace is generally designed to pass within 5m of the existing drillhole and aims to provide additional 
confidence on items such as:
Intersections of high grade mineralisation or nugget effect
• 
•  Geological boundaries 
•  Historical information 
•  Drilling method
12.3.1  Twinned Drillholes 
Azimuth carried out a twin drillhole program at the Smarts Deposit to compare RC versus twin RC and RC 
versus twin diamond drilling.  A total of six sets of twin drill holes occur throughout the Smarts Deposit and 
were compiled by RPM for comparison.  All twin drilling was carried out between May 2011 and January 2012.
The  twin  drill  comparison  data  set  relates  only  to  drilling  conducted  and  was  restricted  to  within  the  gold 
mineralisation domain objects.  The average distance between hole trace for the twin holes was approximately 
4m with the maximum separation distance being 7m.  All twin drillholes are parallel to sub-parallel.
As  documented  in  earlier  technical  reports,  the  comparison  results  in  terms  of  overall  gold  grade  average 
between original drill holes is 4.73g/t gold for 10.0m average mineralisation length versus twin drill holes at 
4.73g/t gold for 8.7m average mineralisation length.  This provides additional confidence that the position of 
geological boundaries and mineralisation information is robust on a global basis.
Comparison  results  for  diamond  versus  RC  and  RC  versus  RC  drill  twins  show  greater  difference.    Also 
considerable variation can be noted on a twin hole by hole examination.  The variation partly reflects the small 
data set and is considered reasonable for the style of the deposit and nuggety nature of mineralisation.
12.4  Database Verification 
12.4.1  Historical Data 
The drill data queries raised during the Mineral Resource estimation process were resolved promptly and a 
validated  database  re-issued,  if  required.    There  are  no  significant  queries  outstanding  from  this  review 
process.
During  2011,  RPM  Consultants  undertook  a  random spot  check  of  20  database  assay  results.    The  assay 
results were from Azimuth conducted drilling activities during mid-2011.  The review comparison was between 
the drillhole database assay table and digital assay laboratory files over random assay batch numbers.  No 
errors were noted in the database records.
A further data validation process was carried in April 2012 and involved the comparison of the database for 17 
holes  against  the  data  files.    The  data  validation  was  undertaken  for  both  the  Hicks  and  adjacent  Smarts 
Deposits.  This included the assay, geology, collars and downhole survey information.  The validation process 
noted the following:
•  No issues were found with assay information.  
•  No major issues were found with collar information.  
•  No issues were found with geology information.  Variation between hardcopy and database geological 
logging codes was noted.  The database contains the correct legend.  Site geologists are using the 
correct geological logging legend.
•  No issues were found with downhole surveys.
Table 12-1 summarizes the validation results.

12.4.2  2013 Drilling Campaign 
Data validation of the recent drilling involved the analysis of database records for both diamond drill holes and 
RC holes. All original data files were uploaded to the database for comparison against the  Resource data.  
The  process  included  change  detection  for  the  assay,  geology,  collars  and  downhole  survey  information.  
Conclusions from the data verification are listed below: 
•  No issues were found with assay information.
•  No major issues were found with collar information.  Collar RL information was compared to a LiDAR 
surface  by  the  Company  prior  to  finalisation  of  the  database,  all  records  correspond  to  the  LiDAR 
elevation.
•  No  issues  were  found  with  geology  information.    The  database  contains  the  correct  legends,  with
lithology and weathering codes for each interval.
•  No issues were found with downhole surveys.

12.4.3  Results of Data Verification 
Through  the  processes  of the  site  visits,  data  review,  analysis  of  QAQC  data  and  validation  of  digital  data 
against  original  drilling  records  the  exploration  data  compiled  in  the  drillhole  database  and  the  exploration 
procedures undertaken by Troy has been verified.
The digital data correctly represents the original data gathered from field activities.  Differences found between 
the  digital  data  and  field  location  or  hard  copy  data  for  previous  drilling  were  resolved.    These  differences 
reflect updated information correctly located within the database. Data validation for recent drilling discovered 
no discrepancies. It is the author’s opinion that the data is sufficient for the purposes of this technical report 
and that the data is suitable for further geological studies. 
 
13. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
13.1  Hicks Deposit 
 
An initial metallurgical program comprising eleven samples from the Hicks Deposit was completed at ACME 
Metallurgical  Laboratories  in  Vancouver,  Canada  in  February  2012.  The  metallurgical  program  tested  the 
amenability  of  gold-bearing  material  to  both  cyanide  leach  and  gravity  recovery  methods.  The  composites 
were chosen to represent a range of grades from both oxidised and fresh material. In addition, one composite 
of fresh material representing a spread of grades from spatially diverse locations within the deposit was also 
tested.  
 
The leach tests were conducted for 72 hours at a target grind size of P80 = 75 microns and at 40% solids pulp 
density with industry standard reagent addition rates maintained. For the leach program, the average recovery 
for the 11 composites was 93%. The high extraction rates (recoveries) achieved in both oxidised and fresh 
materials  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  at  the  Hicks  Deposit  is  not  refractory  and  both  oxide  and  fresh 
material  will  be  amenable  to  treatment  by  conventional  CIP  or  CIL.  Test  data  is  shown  in  Table  13-1  and 
Table 13-2 hereafter. 
 
The  Smarts  Deposit  metallurgical  test-work  also  comprised  11  composites  and  was  tested  at  ACME 
Metallurgical  Laboratories  in  Vancouver  in  October  2011.  The  metallurgical  program  targeted  definition  of 
Leaching and Gravity performance as separate processes. The composites were chosen to represent a range 
of grades from both oxidised and fresh material. In addition, two composites each of oxide and fresh material 
representing a spread of grades from spatially diverse locations within the deposit were also tested. The leach 
tests were conducted for 72 hours at a target grind size of P80 = 75 microns and at 40% solids pulp density.  
 
For  the  leach  program,  the  average  recovery  for  the  11  composites  was  93%.  Not  all  samples  displayed 
complete leaching at 72 hours, indicating the possible presence of free gold. This presents opportunities for 
further improvement of recoveries with the integration of gravity and leaching processes. Test data is shown in 
Table 13-3 hereafter. 
 
Further metallurgical testwork was also undertaken at AMMTEC in Perth during 2013 as a part of the Scoping 
Study. The Karouni gold ore was found to be free milling and gravity gold recovery was necessary to achieve 
high overall gold recoveries.  A gravity gold recovery of 40 to 50% could be expected. The ore has approx. 
0.5% sulphur is low in silver and contains no deleterious elements. The oxide ore is relatively soft whilst the 
primary ore has a range of Bond Ball Work Indices from 14kWh/t 6 to 18.4kWh/t which is moderately hard. 
The Abrasion Index was low so crushing liners and ball consumption should be low.

Following a gap analysis, further metallurgical testing is currently under way at Bureau Veritas in Perth, WA to 
test the potential for increasing recovery and to aid in equipment sizing and operating parameters.  
 
A program which was conducted by Bureau Veritas in Perth Western Australia, investigated the response of 
the  three  ore  zones  consisting  of  primary,  shear  and  oxide,  to  a  range  of  processing  parameters.  This 
included comminution, leaching, and processing characterisation. 
 
The testwork samples were selected based on geological data and review of the core which was provided by 
Troy for the testwork program. Testing was staged in order to confirm gold containing intervals as soon as 
possible  prior  to  the  continuation  of  gold  recovery  testwork.  Initially  only  comminution  testing  that  required 
material larger than 3.35mm was conducted, prior to assaying the material on a per metre basis. Composites 
were  formed  based  on  this  assay  data  for  the  remainder  of  the  testing,  both  for  variability  and  for  master 
composites.  
 
Comminution Results
September 2014
Page 144
Comminution testing was conducted on all zones of the ore body. Depending on the sample mass available 
and condition of the core provided, not all zones were could be tested for all comminution parameters.  
 
Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) 
 
UCS results showed that there should be no concerns in processing any of the ores tested through a standard 
jaw crusher, based on the required energy input. The oxide material was classified as very weak, whilst the 
primary and shear materials were classed in the range of weak to medium-strong.  
 
The  UCS  results  are  presented  in  Table  13-4  below,  showing  the  ranking,  average,  maximum,  minimum 
values and the standard deviation for each hole and zone tested.

Crushing Work Index (CWi) 
 
An average of the results of the CWi tests showed that all material could be classified as “very soft”. There will 
be no identified issues as a result of any of these ores being treated through the crushing circuit as presented 
in the design. The results  ranged from 0.4kWh/t to 11.2kWh/t for one  of the shear samples. These results 
show that there should be no issue for processing through a standard jaw crusher. 
 
The  CWi  results  are  presented  in  Table  13-5  below,  showing  the  ranking,  average,  maximum,  minimum

SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) 
 
SMC testing is conducted to further evaluate ore hardness and competency for size reduction. This testing 
uses a smaller particle starting size than that of the crushing tests. This testing is used to determine the power 
requirements and ore performance through the grinding circuit.
September 2014
Page 145
The  oxide  material  was  not  tested  through  SMC  testing  due  to  insufficient  mass  of  material  of  suitable 
competency  and  of  the  required  size  fraction  being  available.    Testing  was  conducted  on  the  primary  and 
shear material.  
 
The  shear  material  was  seen  to  be  the  least  competent,  being  classified  as  soft  -  medium.  The  primary 
material was seen to be more competent, being rated as hard to very hard. These rankings were achieved on 
the basis of the A*b values (material hardness), and the ta values (resistance to abrasion).  
 
The SMC results are presented in Table 13-6 below, showing the SMC A&b values, and A*b and ta ranking 
for each hole and zone tested.

The  shear  material  should  not  pose  any  comminution  issues,  whilst  the  harder  primary  material  will  likely 
result in a higher power consumption in the grinding circuit than the shear material. Simulations show however 
that this should not be a problem for the process plant. Should any significant issues arise, it is probable that 
blending of the shear and primary materials will assist in negating any increased energy requirement for the 
primary material.  
 
Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi) 
The  Bond  ball  mill  work  index  is  a  standard  test  for  determining  the  grinding  energy  required  to  grind  the 
material undergoing testwork. This test was conducted on the primary and shear material, using the resulting 
products from the SMC testing, which was -3.35mm which is the particle size required for this test.  
 
The BWi results indicated that all samples were medium to hard, across all zones tested. The range of values 
was between 12.57kWh/t and 15.28kWh/t, with the highest value being recorded by the primary ore, and the 
lowest by the shear ore. The BWi results are presented in Table 13-7 below, showing the measured BWi and 
the ranking for each hole and zone tested.

The results of these tests show that there is no expectation that any processing issues will result from the ore 
grindability.  These  BWi  values  were  used  during  the  grinding  modelling  and  simulating  of  the  project 
comminution circuit.  
 
Bond Rod Mill Work Index (RWi) 
 
RWi testing is conducted on coarser material than the BWi test, and this testwork program was conducted 
primarily to acquire  information to compare the RWi and BWi indices. This comparison can be used as  an 
indication  of  potential  grinding  performance  problems,  particularly  the  build-up  of  critical  sized  material  in 
SAG/AG milling.
September 2014
Page 146
Rod mill work index testing was conducted on the primary and shear master composites. Both results showed 
the material to be hard, with results of 19.9kWh/t and 17.5kWh/t for the primary and shear zones respectively. 
 
The  RWi  results  are  presented  in  Table  13-8  and  Table  13-9  below,  showing  the  measured  RWi  and  the 
ranking for each hole and zone tested.

The primary material test results showed that there may be some build-up of critical sized material in a SAG 
milling circuit. Due to the smaller grinding feed size and higher ball content it is not expected that this will be 
an  issue  for  the  grinding  circuit  as  planned.  Should  there  be  any  build-up  of  critical  sized  material  during 
processing there will be a requirement to recycle any scats discharge from the ball mill. 
 
Bond Abrasion Index (Ai) 
 
The Ai test uses standard testing equipment in order to determine how abrasive an ore is and hence indicate 
how much wear will be expected in the crushing and grinding circuits, as well as in any transfer chutes.  
 
The primary and shear master composites were tested. The primary material returned a result of 0.13 which 
classifies this ore as moderately abrasive. The shear material returned a value of 0.09, which is classified as 
non-abrasive. See Table 13-10 for the results.

These  results  indicate  that  there  should  be  no  undue  wear  experienced  in  the  plant,  though  the  primary 
material will cause a higher level of wear than that of the shear.  
 
Head Assays 
 
A  total  of  five  variability  samples  were  selected  from  the  primary  ore  zone.  The  head  assays  for  the  5 
variability samples are shown in Table 13-11 below. The variability samples are designated as follows:

The  variability  samples  were  formed  on  a  per  hole  basis  and  were  composited  to  form  a  range  of  head 
grades, from low to high, but around the expected plant feed grade. This would allow the performance of the 
leaching  circuit  to  be  evaluated  through  a  range  of  gold  concentrations.  The  variability  composites  were 
subjected to bottle roll testing at the optimal leach conditions as determined by the master composite testing.  
 
The gold grades of the samples ranged from 2.6g/t gold through to 14.0g/t gold. It can be seen that there is no 
noticeable correlation between the gold grade and the silver grade present in the samples, whilst the sample 
with highest silver grade is also the sample with the highest gold grade, the lowest silver grade is seen in P-V4 
which has the second highest gold grade at 9.8g/t gold. 
 
Most samples exhibit copper, nickel and zinc levels below that of concern (300ppm each, or 1000ppm total). 
P-V2 however does have elevated nickel levels at 428ppm nickel. This may cause a slight increase in cyanide 
consumption during leaching, depending on the nickel species, i.e. whether they are cyanide soluble or not.  
 
Iron grades seen in the samples are below 10% iron. On this basis it is not expected that any issues will be 
experienced with cyanide consumption, depending on the iron form.  
 
All samples showed very low levels of both arsenic and mercury, with mercury being below detection limits in 
all samples. This will be beneficial in terms of the occupational health and safety risk, particularly during gold 
smelting. 
 
Both P-V4 and P-V5 show slightly elevated levels of carbon and so may be a source of “preg robbing” during 
the leaching and adsorption process. The use of the carbon in leach process will negate this issue to a large 
extent should it arise.  
 
The total sulphur levels are low overall in all samples, with P-V1 and P-V3 showing the highest levels of total 
sulphur  at  just  over  1%.  Though  a  high  sulphide  analysis  indicates  a  possiblility  of  some  reduction  in  gold
September 2014
Page 148
extraction  should  the  gold  be  sulphide  locked,  and  possibly  a  slight  increase  in  cyanide  consumption,  the 
indication is that this should not be a major cause for concern for the Project. 
 
The master composites formed were submitted for a head assay. Select species from these head assays are 
shown in Table 13-12 below.

The  summary  table  was  formed  from  all  results  received.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  values  displayed, 
particularly  the  gold  grades,  are  reported  as  averages  of  those  determined  by  duplicate  assays.  Where  a 
minus value is shown, this indicates that concentration was below the species detection limit.  
 
It is noted that in the duplicate assays for the primary and shear materials, both returned an outlier on the gold 
grade in the raw testwork results. Discussions with the laboratory determined that it is likely that these results 
were  switched  between  the  two  composites  involved.  Given  the  reasonably  strong  correlation  between  the 
other duplicate assays on the gold grade the decision was taken to remove the outliers from the average and 
use  only  the  conforming  values  returned.  This  decision  would  be  validated  once  the  leach  work  calculated 
grades are available. This problem is considered to be due to the nuggetty nature of the gold and its effect on 
the assays. This was shown repeatedly during the extraction testwork and the consolidation of the calculated 
and assayed head grades.  
 
13.1.1  Primary Master Composite
September 2014
Page 149
The primary master composite displayed a high gold grade, with 11.1g/t gold being returned as the average 
grade, with the outlier as mentioned above removed. Minimal silver was seen within the sample assay, which 
aligned with the variability sample head assays. 
 
The 88ppm copper, 52ppm nickel and 71ppm zinc were all below levels of concern, and it is not expected that 
any increased cyanide consumption will be experienced as a result of these species.  
 
The  iron  level  in  the  sample  assay  is  6.3%.  At  these  levels  it  is  not  expected  that  reagent  consumption 
increases will be seen due to cyanide soluble iron.  
 
Both  the  arsenic  and  mercury  levels  within  the  sample  assay  were  below  levels  of  concern,  being  1.5ppm 
arsenic and 45ppb mercury respectively. This is encouraging from a reduced occupational health and safety 
risk point of view for the process plant.  
 
The  carbon  level  within  the  sample  is  low  (0.8%),  and  is  hence  not  expected  to  cause  issues  with  preg-
robbing. 
 
The sulphur grade of the sample is low (0.5%). It is not expected that increased cyanide consumption or an 
excessive amount of gold locking will be seen as a result of this. 
13.1.2  Shear Master Composite 
The shear master composite displayed a gold grade of 5.9g/t gold, following the same averaging process as 
that used for the primary master composite. This sample also has a low silver grade (0.6g/t gold).  
 
The  assayed  levels  of  99ppm  copper  and  71ppm  zinc  are  below  levels  of  concern,  however  the  nickel 
concentration  is  elevated  at  417ppm  nickel.  This  higher  nickel  concentration  may  cause  some  issues  of 
increased cyanide consumption during leaching.  
 
The iron content of the sample is higher than the primary sample, however it is still considered to be low at 
6.9% iron. It is not expected that this will cause any undue effect on the reagent consumption.  
 
The arsenic levels are very low at 2.5ppm arsenic, and the mercury levels are below detection limits. As with 
the primary material this indicates a reduced occupational health and safety risk. 
 
The carbon is slightly elevated at 1.8%. There will be a requirement during plant operation therefore to check 
for any preg-robbing occurrences. 
 
The sulphide level is low, as with the primary ore and it is not expected any issues will be seen during the 
processing of the ore as a result of this.  
 
13.1.3  Oxide Master Composite 
The oxide master composite displayed a gold grade of 3.5g/t gold, using the same averaging method as for 
the other master composites. The silver level was low, with a grade of 1.4g/t silver. 
 
The copper and zinc levels were below levels of concern, at 100ppm and 101ppm respectively. The nickel 
content was elevated at 405ppm. This may cause some increase in cyanide consumption during leaching.  
 
The iron content of the sample was 9.6%, which was below levels of concern and should not cause issues 
with increased cyanide consumption. 
 
The arsenic was low at 1.5ppm, and the mercury was also low at 45ppb. This should present no occupational 
health and safety issues even though there will be natural concentration of the mercury in the leaching and 
carbon absorption stages. 
 
The oxide material assays returned the lowest values for both the sulphur grade and carbon grade, at 0.1% 
and 0.2% respectively, for all the master composites. Hence it is not expected that there will be issues with 
preg-robbing or with gold locking due to sulphide association.

Master Composite Testing 
 
Master composites of primary, shear and oxide ores were formed. While not all tests were conducted on all 
composites, the primary, shear and oxide master composites were used to assess optimal leaching conditions 
and determine predicted process performance. The optimal leaching conditions were determined initially, with 
these conditions being used for the variability testing.  
 
Gravity – Cyanidation Leach Optimisation 
 
A  series  of  tests  were  conducted  to  determine  the  optimal  grind  size  and  cyanide  dosage  for  the  leaching 
process.  As  part  of  this  testing  process  the  effectiveness  of  the  gravity  stage  was  evaluated.  Initial  testing 
replicated the historical testwork, using a 72 hour leach time. It was determined, after the first round of testing, 
that a 24 hour leach time would be adopted due to negligible improvements in leach recovery being achieved 
from longer leach times.   
 
The testwork program, conducted on the oxide, primary and shear master composites, determined that a P80 
of  63  microns  would  be  used  for  subsequent  testing  with  a  cyanide  dosage  of  250  ppm.  Under  these 
conditions all samples displayed rapid leaching kinetics and high recoveries.  
 
The grind sensitivity results as a function of grind size (106, 75 and 45 micron) are presented in Table 13-13 
below, showing the calculated head grade, gravity recovery, leach recoveries at 8, 24 & 72 hours, and the 
lime and NaCN consumption.

The  gravity  recovery  varied  between  the  three  composites  with  the  oxide  material  displaying  a  gravity 
recovery  of  around  30%,  the  shear  40%  and  the  primary  60%.  Given  the  high  performance  of  the  gravity 
stage, it is recommended that a gravity stage be incorporated into the processing circuit.  
 
Mineralogy – QEMSCAN  
 
QEMSCAN was undertaken on heavy liquid separation sinks and floats following desliming of a sub-sample of 
the primary master composite material.  
 
The  floats  contained  a  majority  of  quartz,  feldspar  and  other  silicates.  Based  on  work  conducted  in  the 
testwork  program,  the  feldspar  and  silicates  present  show  a  negligible  negative  effect  on  the  rheological 
properties of the primary ore.  
 
The  analysis  of  the  sinks  showed  that  the  sulphides  identified  in  the  head  assays  were  present  as  pyrite. 
Other major minerals present in the sinks include iron oxides and hydroxides, as well as iron silicates. These 
results give basis to the assumption that the unleached gold remaining in the leach residue may be locked in 
pyrite. A diagnostic leach could be used to confirm this.  
 
The QEMSCAN results showed no major cause for concern for the processing of these ores. 
 
Oxygen Uptake Testing 
 
Oxygen uptake testing is used to determine how much air is required in the leaching circuit, or if there is a 
requirement for oxygen sparging due to a higher consumption of oxygen. Oxygen forms an integral part of the 
chemical reactions in the leaching process. 
 
The oxygen consumption ranged (Table 13-15) between maximum values of -0.024mg/l/min for the oxide, and 
-0.035 mg/l/min as a maximum value seen for both the shear and primary ore types.

Oxygen consumption levels under -0.05 mg/l/min typically require air sparging only, with pure oxygen being 
added in some cases to improve leach kinetics. As the maximum uptake results are far under the levels that 
require  oxygen  sparging  (-0.15  mg/l/min)  it  is  not  expected  that  there  will  be  any  requirement  for  oxygen 
during leaching, with slurry agitation assumed to be sufficient to provide the oxygen required for all ore types.  
 
Carbon Loading Testing
September 2014
Page 152
Carbon loading tests were conducted on the primary and shear master composites, with the slurry from a bulk 
leach test on gravity tailings being used to generate a representative carbon loading feed. As a result, the 
primary material showed a lower gold concentration in solution being used in the tests than the shear, due to 
the greater amount of gold in the primary ore being recovered by gravity. The slurry was split into three equal 
parts for a three stage carbon contact test. 
 
The carbon loading tests generate two slurry dependant constants, k and n, which are used in the Fleming 
equation to evaluate carbon loading performance. Suitable performance is achieved with k values over 200, 
and n values over 0.6.  
 
The primary material had a k value of 177, and an  n value of 0.74. This indicates that  while there is good 
mixing  efficiency  with  the  slurry,  the  rate  and  efficiency  of  the  carbon  loading  is  lower  than  would  be 
preferable. Reviewing the results it was seen that the gold concentration in the feed solution was low, due to a 
high percentage of the gold being recovered by gravity and hence not present in the CIL circuit. The final gold 
concentration was very low (0.016 mg/l), and hence it is not deemed that there will be any issue with carbon 
loading of the gold for the primary material and therefore no significant anticipated gold losses in the plant 
tailings. 
 
The shear material had a higher feed gold concentration, due to the lower gravity recovery when compared to 
the primary material. The k and n values for the shear test were 202 and 0.70 respectively, resulting in a final 
gold concentration of 0.048 mg/l. This indicates therefore that there should be no processing issues. 
 
Rheology Testwork 
 
Rheology testing was conducted on all three master composites. Rheology testing analyses the viscosity of 
the  slurry  under  a  range  of  shear  rates,  indicating  the  viscosity  of  the  slurry  under  high  and  low  shear 
conditions. High viscosity values can result in increased pumping or some difficulties in slurry transport Based 
on the expected design of the process plant, the tests were conducted at a P80 of 63 micron, at 40, 50 and 
60% solids by weight. A range of shear rates was applied to the slurries, with shear rates of 5 s-1 and 200 s-1 
being taken as low shear and high shear conditions respectively for the analysis.  
  
Viscosities  under  3000  mPa.s  for  a  low  shear,  and  300  mPa.s  for  high  shear  conditions,  are  taken  as 
recommended  limits  and  were  used  in  the  analysis  of  results.  Viscosities  above  these  levels  indicate  that 
there may be difficulty in pumping and/or mixing, or that excessive power requirements may be needed during 
pumping (high shear) or tank agitation (low shear) conditions (see Table 13-16).

It was seen that the oxide material had viscosity issues at 60% solids, with the lower slurry densities (40 and 
50% solids) being below the recommended limits, and hence there should be no issue when processing the 
oxide. There would however, be a requirement for additional power input when pumping the oxide slurry under 
high density conditions, such as the cyclone feed pumps. This may be avoided through blending with other 
ore zones, depending on the flexibility of the mining program. As it is not expected that slurry densities at or
September 2014
Page 153
above 60% solids are expected in the leach circuit, there is no expectation that any high viscosity slurries will 
cause issues with tank agitation. 
 
The shear and primary material, under low shear conditions and 40% solids, displayed viscosities of 0 mPa.s. 
This indicates that in these situations the material was settling out of the slurry. In order to maintain correct 
agitation the leaching circuit will need to be kept above this slurry density. This issue was not seen at the 50 or 
60% solids situations, nor were there any issues with viscosities at levels above the recommended limits. 
 
Based on the current process plant design, with optimal thickener control, it is not expected that any viscosity 
issues will be seen throughout the process plant.  
 
Thickening Tests - Column 
 
Thickening  testwork  is  used  to  determine  slurry  settling  rates  for  thickeners  and  for  determining  optimal 
flocculant dosing. To conduct these tests the slurry was conditioned to pH 10.5. As the material consisted of 
RC chip samples and therefor already very fine, no additional grinding was conducted. 
 
The  tests  were  conducted  on  RC  chip  samples  (SRC730  and  SRC711)  provided  by  Troy,  with  three 
flocculants being tested. It was determined that Magnafloc 351 and 345 had the most potential for the ores 
tested, due to the clarity of the overflow. The initial testing was conducted at dosing rates of 25g/t.  
 
Both Magnafloc products showed good solid settling  performance, with both showing rapid settling kinetics 
and clear overflows. The results in Table 13-17 show that for both samples tested the Magnafloc 351 showed 
higher underflow solids density. This flocculant also displayed a higher hindered settling velocity than the 345 
product.  It  was  hence  recommended  to  proceed  with  the  Magnafloc  351  as  the  preferred  flocculant  in  the 
design work until such time that the Outotec thickening testwork was conducted.

Outotec Thickening Testwork 
 
Dynamic thickener testing was conducted on a sub sample of the master composite material. This material, as 
in the bulk leach testwork below, was formed from the master composite, and ground to a P80 of 63 microns. 
As  the  processing  plant  was  to  operate  with  a  pre-leach  thickener,  the  dynamic  thickening  tests  were 
conducted on material representative of cyclone overflow, as opposed to leach tailings. The slurry fed to the 
thickener was to be conditioned to pH 10.5 prior to testing to represent the expected plant slurry. Outotec also 
provided  recommendations  for  thickener  sizing  based  on  the  continuous  settling  tests.  This  unit  sizing  test 
was based on a flowrate of 125tph.  
 
Particle Size Distribution Results 
 
As  part  of  the  testwork  program,  a  laser  sizing  particle  size  distribution  analysis  was  undertaken  on  the 
samples tested. The d80 determined from this size distribution was used by Outotec. This was reported as the 
P80  of  the  sample  in  the  Outotec  report  supplied,  resulting  in  some  variation  in  the  size  expected  (P80  63 
micron) and the size determined, due to the different sizing methods used. The samples tested however were 
all within plus or minus 5 micron of the required P80 size when determined by screening.  
 
Flocculant Screening
September 2014
Page 154
Flocculant  screening  was  undertaken  by  Outotec  prior  to  undertaking  the  dynamic  thickener  testing.  Five 
flocculants  were  tested,  including  the  previously  tested  Magnafloc  351.  Based  on  the  screening  process 
Magnafloc 155 was selected for the dynamic testing. Although not the fastest settling flocculant, Magnafloc 
155 provided the best combination of good settling rates and overflow clarity. 
 
Dynamic  testing  was  subsequently  conducted  on  all  three  samples  (oxide,  shear  and  primary).  A  range  of 
settling flux rates (m2/t/hr) and flocculant dosages were trialled during the program, with the underflow solids 
density and the overflow clarity being recorded at each level.  
 
The oxide and shear ores were shown to perform best at 30g/t flocculant dosage, while the primary material 
was  tested  at  a  lower  rate  of  20g/t.  As  shown  in  Table  13-18,  all  samples  tested  produced  a  range  of 
underflow densities, depending on the dosage rate and the flux rate. With a flux rate of 1m2/t/h, typical for a 
high rate thickener, the underflow densities are also provided with an upscale from the dynamic test thickener 
through  to  the  full  size  unit  as  defined  by  Outotec.  In  this  instance  all  samples  tested  displayed  underflow 
densities above the required 50%w/w solids.  
 
The primary ore showed a greater amount of solids in the overflow compared to the other samples tested. It is 
noted  that  with  an  increased  flocculant  dosage  from  20g/t  to  30g/t,  the  overflow  solids  content  drops  from 
around  350mg/l  down  to  210mg/l  at  a  lower  flux  rate.  All  samples  tested  display  overflow  clarities  below 
500mg/l, which will be suitable for plant operation and process water recycle.

The  testing  also  provided  an  indicated  thickener  diameter,  with  all  samples  tested  showing  suitable 
performance  in  a  13m  diameter  high  rate  thickener.  It  is  hence  not  expected  that  difficulties  will  be 
experienced with any of the ore types using the current 25m thickener selected for the process plant. 
 
Bulk Leach and Detoxification 
 
In order to conduct the detoxification testwork a 10kg sample from the primary and shear master composites 
was used as feed. To generate the tailings required two bulk leaches were conducted, one for each master 
composite tested (see Table 13-19). The tests were run under the optimal conditions as determined by the 
optimisation testwork, being:
•  P80 63 micron 
•  pH 10.5 
•  Free cyanide 250ppm 
•  24 hour leach time 
•  Gravity pre-leach stage

Shear MC 
 
The primary master composite displayed a gravity recovery of 65% in this test, with the overall recovery being 
94.3%. These results were similar to those seen in other testing, with the head grade of the feed to the gravity 
and cyanidation leach test being 5.74g/t. Due to the bulk leach being conducted in a vat leach rather than a 
smaller bottle roll leach, as expected, the cyanide consumption increased slightly to 0.24kg/t, where the lime 
was fell to 0.57kg/t. These results are deemed to be closer to those expected for the plant operation. 
 
The bulk leach test on the shear material was run under the same conditions as the primary material, with a 
feed grade of 6.60g/t. The gravity recovery was, as expected, lower than the primary material at 40%, with an 
overall recovery of 93.9%. The cyanide and lime consumptions were almost identical to that of the primary, 
being 0.26kg/t and 0.60kg/t respectively. 
 
The  final  cyanide  concentrations  for  both  leach  tests  were  122ppm  -  123ppm.  To  better  simulate  plant 
operation, no cyanide was added to the leach after the 8 hour mark. The leach slurry was taken directly from 
the  bulk  leach  and  split  into  equal  sizes  for  use  in  the  detoxification  testwork  (see  Table  13-20  and  Table 
13-21). 
 
To prevent degradation of the cyanide, the three addition ratios of SO2:CN to be tested (ratios of 2,3,4) were 
run in parallel.  
 
The primary material showed strong performance at all addition ratios, with the cyanide level, both free and 
WAD  (weak  acid  dissociable)  cyanide,  being  below  1ppm  after  2  hours. The  shear material  was  unable  to 
achieve free or WAD cyanide levels below 1ppm after 8 hours at the lowest ratio, however at ratios of 3 and 4 
both the free and WAD cyanide were seen to be below 1ppm.

Variability Testing
Variability testing was conducted on 5 primary samples only, due to the amount of available mass for this ore 
type. The other ore zones had limited mass and were hence not tested for variability. The variability samples
September 2014
Page 156
were formed from high and low points in the primary ore, as well as over a range of gold grades to assess the 
effect of grade and depth variation.  
 
The results (summarised below in Table 13-22) show that the gravity recovery ranged between 42% and 79%, 
almost  independent  of  the  head  grade.  Overall  recovery  ranged  from  79%  to  97%.  There  was  a  slight 
dependence on head grade, with the two lowest head grades displaying the lowest overall recovery.  
 
The cyanide consumption  was low for all samples tested,  whilst the lime consumption  was at levels below 
concern. It is thus concluded that there is no need for reagent costs to be incurred for the primary ore.

14. Mineral Resource Estimates 
14.1  Overview 
Resource outlines were constructed using cross sectional interpretations prepared using logged geology and 
a  nominal  gold  cut-off  grade  of  0.5g/t  gold  however  some  lower  grade  intersections  were  included.    A 
minimum  downhole  intersection  of  2m  was  used  with  no  edge  dilution  and  minor  zones  of  internal  dilution 
were included to maintain continuity of the Resource wireframes.
The  LiDAR  survey  was  used  to  create  a  topographic  surface.    Geological  logging  was  used  to  create 
weathering surfaces for the top of fresh (TOFR) and base of oxidation (BOCO) surfaces as well as a base of 
transported overburden surface.  A cross-cutting dolerite dyke at the Hicks Prospect was also interpreted.
All  modelling  and  wireframing  were  completed  using  Vulcan  Software  Version  9.  Statistical  analysis  and 
variography  were  completed  using  Vulcan  software.  The  estimates  for  the  deposits  used  standard  Vulcan 
block models with Ordinary Kriging (OK) grade interpolation and inverse distance squared for Larken, within 
wireframes and the models have been reported at a 1.0g/t gold cut-off.  The Mineral Resource estimate for the 
Karouni Project is summarised below Table 14-1.

14.2.1  Preparation of Wireframes 
14.2.1.1   Resource Mineralisation 
The  interpreted  sectional  outlines  were  manually  triangulated  to  form  wireframes  as  shown  in  Figure  14-1.  
Geological  information  from  trenches  was  used  to  guide  the  interpretation  of  mineralisation  boundaries.  
Information from drilling was used in preference where generally minor contradictions in trench and drill data 
were noted.  This reflects the historical nature of the trench information and the more uncertain location of the 
trench sample lines.
To form ends to the wireframes, the end section strings were copied to a position midway to the next section 
or to approximately 20m depending on sample information along strike or down dip.  The end section strings 
were adjusted to match the dip, strike and plunge of the zone.  The wireframed objects were validated using 
Vulcan software and set as solids.
A total of 7 mineralisation domain wireframes were created and used to select the sample data to be used for 
grade estimation, and to constrain the block model for estimation purposes.  The mineralisation wireframes 
were treated as hard boundaries for all estimation purposes, that is, only assays from within each wireframe 
were used to estimate blocks within that wireframe.

14.2.1.2   Weathering Surfaces
September 2014
Page 159
Weathering  surfaces  were  interpreted  on  cross  section  and  extended  to  cover  the  block  model  limits.  
Weathering codes and degree of oxidation were included in the geology database and used to define the base 
of complete oxidation (boco_2014.00t) and top of fresh rock (tofr_2014.00t) surfaces.
The  database  geological  codes  used  to  define  the  weathering  surfaces  are  presented  in  Table  14-2.    The 
surfaces were mainly defined from the database field “Regolith”.
Conversely,  both the regolith  zone and  the  transition  zone (i.e.  base  of complete oxidation)  are defined by 
geological  codes  starting  with  ‘R’.  The  regolith  unit  is  generally  composed  of  the  Rpa  (pallid  zone),  Rmo 
(mottled zone), Rlt (laterite), Rfe (ferricrete), and Rsp (saprolite). The weathering of these units may vary, but 
generally spans from moderately weathered (mw) to extremely weathered (ew). It should be noted that the 
degree of weathering is not directly linked to the degree of oxidization, but to the competency of the rock.
The transition zone refers to the transition between the regolith and fresh rock. The database geological code 
used is Rsr (saprock). Since this does define the transition between regolith and fresh rock, this unit tends to 
be weakly weathered (ww).

14.2.1.3   Geological Surfaces 
The  overburden  unit  is  defined  by  geological  codes  starting  with  ‘O’,  and  is  generally  composed  of  Osd 
(overburden  sand)  and  Ocy 
  The  overburden  surface 
(overburden_2014.00t) was interpreted on cross section and extended to cover the block model limits.

14.2.1.4   Topographic Surface 
The surface elevation  is moderately undulating and ranges from 55m to 90m in elevation above sea level.  
This reflects the incisement of overburden and basement lithologies by numerous streams.

The  current 
late  2011 
(contour_wo_resource_2m.00t).  The survey was undertaken by Digital World Mappine Inc. and is nominally 
accurate to +/- 0.3m on flat terrain. The surface was thinned and re-contoured to reduce file size, however 
trench excavation lines are still generally visible and the surface is considered to be of excellent quality.
from  a  LiDAR  survey  undertaken
in
Drill  collars,  trench  excavation  lines  and  the  LiDAR  topographic  surface  generally  show  a  reasonable 
correlation.  To ensure consistency drill collars were adjusted in the Z direction (elevation) to match the LiDAR 
surface.  Collar  adjustments  were  generally  minor  or  reflected  corrections  to  either  historical  drill  collars  or 
where a hand held GPS had been used.
14.2.1.5   Dolerite Dyke 
A  near-vertical  barren  dolerite  dyke  of  approximately  80m  true  thickness  orthogonally  cross-cuts  the 
mineralisation at the Hicks Zone. Drilling and trench assay and logging information was used to constrain the 
position  of  the  dyke  boundaries  (see  Figure  14-2).    The  orientation  of  several  drillholes  were  designed  to 
intersect the dyke position and this information, along with field mapping of the dyke, where exposed in creek 
beds has accurately fixed the position of the hanging wall and footwall positions of the dyke.

14.2.2  Sample Statistics 
14.2.2.1   General 
The wireframes of the mineralised zones were used to define the Resource intersections. The drill samples 
used to interpret the mineralisation are dominantly of 1m length although some sample interval variation does 
occur  to  reflect  geological  boundaries.  A  1m  interval  length  was  selected  for  compositing  and  further 
geostatistical  analysis.    This  composite  length  reflects  the  majority  of  sample  intervals  and  is  at  a  suitable
September 2014
Page 161
scale  for  the  width  of  the  Resource  wireframes.  Any  residual  composites  of  less  than  0.5m  in  length  were 
added to the preceding composite.
Vulcan software was then used to extract 1m down-hole composites within the intervals coded as Resource 
intersections.    A  small  number  of  negative  assays  representing  assay  detection  limit  were  converted  to 
0.005g/t grades.
The composites were checked for spatial correlation with the objects, the location of the rejected composites 
and zero composite values. A master composite file was created including each of the individual Resource 
objects in the wireframe model.
14.2.2.2   Deposit Statistics 
The composite sample data for the Hicks Deposit was grouped by ore zone object.  Summary statistics for 
gold are shown in Table 14-3 for all the ore zone solid triangulations.
An analysis was conducted on the statistics of the different modelled weathering zones. All gold sample data 
was used for this comparison which showed that there is only minor difference in grade population distribution 
between the oxide, transitional and fresh samples (Figure 14-3). A statistical review indicated that some gold 
enrichment of the weathering and transition zones has occurred at the Hicks Deposit as indicated in Table 
14-4,  however  the  impact  on  the  overall  Mineral  Resource  estimate  is  minimal  given  the  relatively  small 
number of tonnes associated with the oxide and transition zones compared to the fresh mineralisation. 
It was concluded that an estimation hard boundary at the weathering surfaces was not necessary.

14.2.3  High Grade Cuts 
To  assist  in  the  selection  of  appropriate  high  grade  cuts,  the  composite  data  was  interrogated  and  a 
population histogram, log probability plot and the coefficient of variation (CV) statistics were generated for the 
modelled ore zone domains.  High grade cuts were determined by noting distinct breaks in the shape of the 
distribution on the log probability plot and population histogram.  High CV values also indicate the need for 
high grade cuts.
It was determined that high grade cuts were required for four of the seven objects.  High grade cut statistics 
for each applicable object are listed in Table 14-5 below.

The Mineral Resource estimate is reported using cut gold values.
14.2.4  Geostatistical Analysis 
Downhole  and  three  orthogonal  variograms  were  modelled.  Directions  were  based  on  the  strike  and  dip 
direction  of  the  modelled  ore  zone  domains.  The  ore  zones  all  display  long  major  axes  along  the  NW-SE 
direction and shorter semi-major and minor axes.The variograms displayed reasonable structure.
The experimental variograms are normalised against the sample variance so that the sill value is 1 and the 
structures are viewed as ratios or proportions of the sill.
A two structured nested spherical model was found to model the experimental variogram well.  The downhole 
variogram provides the best estimate of the true nugget value which is 0.1.
The orientation of the plane of mineralisation was aligned with the interpreted wireframes.  The experimental 
variograms were calculated with the first aligned along the main mineralisation continuity while the second is 
aligned in the plane of mineralisation at 90° to the first orientation.  The third is orientated perpendicular to the 
mineralisation plane, across the width of the mineralisation.  See Figure 14-4.

Figure 14-4:  Hicks Zone Variograms
14.2.5  Kriging Parameters 
The  gold  composite  grades  were  interpolated  into  a  Vulcan  block  model  using  the  ordinary  kriging  (OK) 
algorithm  using  the  nugget,  sill  values  and  ranges  determined  from  the  variogram  models  discussed  in 
Section 14.2.4.  The ranges obtained from the variogram models were used  as a guide in determining the 
search ellipse parameters used in the resource estimate.  The kriging parameters resulting from analysis of 
the main lode (a) were applied to the relevant adjacent minor lodes.
14.2.6  Block Model 
A Vulcan block model was created to encompass the full extent of the Zone.  A list of block model parameters 
is displayed in Table 14-6 below.
The block model used a primary block size of 20m along strike (NW-SE) by 4m across strike by 10m vertical 
with sub-cells of 5m by 1m by 2.5m.  The block model was rotated to 305 degrees on the horizontal plane to 
match the strike direction of mineralisation.  Block model co-ordinates are on the national grid PSAD56-UTM 
Zone 21N to match the trench and drillhole database.
The parent Y block size was selected on the basis of approximately half of the average drill section spacing in 
better  drilled  areas  of  the  Hicks  Deposit.  The  model  cell  dimensions  in  other  directions  were  selected  to 
provide  sufficient  resolution  to  the  block model  in  the  across-strike  and  down-dip  direction.  In  addition,  the 
selection of a 10m model cell height reflected the spacing of exploration drilling down-dip.

14.2.7  Grade Interpolation Parameters 
For  all  zones  in  the  Hicks  Zone,  the  wireframe  objects  were  used  as  hard  boundaries  in  the  interpolation.  
That is, only grades inside each wireframe object were used to interpolate the blocks inside the coded object.  
The  Ordinary  Kriging  (OK)  algorithm  was  selected  for  grade  interpolation.  This  was  to  allow  the  measured 
spatial variation of gold mineralisation to be incorporated into the model.
An  orientated  ‘ellipsoid’  search  was  used  to  select  data  for  interpolation.    The  ellipse  was  oriented  to  the 
average  strike,  dip  and  plunge  of  the  mineralised  zones,  and  varied  accordingly  within  each  object.    The 
maximum  search  radius  was  set  at  a  distance  similar  to  the  variogram  range  for  the  major  direction  or  as 
required to ensure all blocks were estimated in the final kriging pass.  The major to semi-major and the major 
to minor search ratios were determined from the variogram ranges.
A two-pass estimation search was used to complete estimation for gold within the domain objects.  A first pass 
search  radius  of  50m  and  a  second  pass  search  radius  of  200m  along  strike  were  used  with  a  minimum 
number of samples of 10 for the first pass and 5 for the second.
Estimation parameters used in the estimate are listed in Table 14-7.

14.2.8  Bulk Density and Material Type 
Bulk density values were assigned to each weathering material type based on values compiled from historical 
and  recent  bulk  density  test  work  for  the  Hicks  and  Smarts  Zones.    Domain  values  for  bulk  density  were 
further separated by locality related to the mineralisation object wireframes (Section 10.3).  The assigned bulk 
density values are detailed below in Table 14-8 and are considered to be consistent with nearby deposits in 
the region.
Material type was also defined on the basis of weathering state.  Material type and the corresponding bulk 
density were coded into the block model in the ‘type’ and ‘bd’ attributes respectively.

14.2.9  Resource Classification 
The  Hicks  Zone  shows  reasonable  continuity  of  mineralisation  within  well  defined  geological  constraints.  
Drillholes are located at 25m to 60m spacings on 15m to 100m spaced north-east orientated drill sections.
Trench  information  was  used  to  guide  mineralisation  wireframe  interpretation  but  was  excluded  from  the 
estimation process.  This reflected sample quality concerns with the trench information.  However, in general 
the trench information agreed with the structural interpretation from drilling at shallow levels.
The drill spacing is sufficient to allow the grade intersections to be modelled into coherent wireframes for each 
domain.  Reasonable consistency is evident in the thickness and grade of the domains.
The  authors  consider  that  geological  and  mineralisation  continuity  has  been  demonstrated  with  sufficient 
confidence to allow the Hicks Zone to be classified as either Indicated or Inferred Mineral Resource. Indicated 
Mineral  Resources  are  defined  by  drilling  density  and  confidence  in  continuity  of  mineralisation  between 
drillholes.  This  generally  corresponds  to  the  50m  drilling  sections  whereas  the  100m  drilling  sections  are 
classified as Inferred Mineral Resources.  Mineralisation generally forms a series of coherent gold envelopes 
along strike and is open down-dip.
The Resource block model has an attribute “class” for all blocks within the Resource wireframes coded as “Inf” 
or “Ind”.

Figure 14-6:  Hicks Zone - Global Bench Tonnage by Material Type
Mineral Resource tonnes and grade per 10m bench are graphed below in Figure 14-7.  The tonnage decrease 
at  depth  represents  estimation  constraints  as  drill  density  decreases  rather  than  a  geological  limit  to  the 
Mineral  Resource  boundary.    Gold  grade  is  relatively  consistent  for  all  levels  although  a  moderate  grade 
increase  is  noted  for  the  upper  levels  and  a  relatively  sharp  increase  for  lower  levels  of  the  Hicks  Deposit 
however  this  is  in  the  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  category  with  relatively  few  tonnes.    The  grade  tonnage 
curves for the Mineral Resource are compiled below in Figure 14-8.

14.2.11  Model Validation 
A  three  step  process  was  used  to  validate  the  Hicks  Zone  estimate.    Firstly  a  qualitative  assessment  was 
completed  by  slicing  sections  through  the  block  model  in  positions  coincident  with  drilling.    Overall  the 
assessment indicated that the trend of the modelled grade appeared consistent with the drillhole grades.
A  quantitative  assessment  of  the  estimate  was  completed  by  comparing  the  average  gold  grades  of  the 
composite  file  input  against  the  gold  block  model  output  for  all  the  resource  objects.    The  results  of  the 
comparison are presented in Table 14-10.

As  a  further  check  that  the  interpolation  of  the  block  model  correctly  honoured  the  drilling  data,  a  trend 
analysis  was  completed  by  comparing  the  interpolated  blocks  to  the  sample  composite  data.    The  trend 
analysis  was  completed  for  100m  northings  and  for  elevation  in  10m  bench  heights.    All  objects  were 
combined and used for the model validation.
Results are summarised in Figure 14-9 and Figure 14-10.
September 2014
Page 169
The validation plots show good correlation between the composite grades and the block model grades for the 
comparison by northing and elevation, variations are where limited intercepts have defined individual objects.  
The trends shown by the raw data are honoured by the block model.
The elevation plot shows the effect of extending the wireframes at depth beyond the last drill hole intercept 
resulting in no sample composites to support the estimated block grades.
The  comparisons  show  the  effect  of  the  interpolation,  which  results  in  smoothing  of  the  block  grades, 
compared to the composite grades.
An  additional  check  was  conducted  with  the  estimation  of  grades  using  an  inverse  distance  squared 
methodology. Search directions were along the main ore zones axes and search distances were determined 
from drill spacing. The results from this estimation were within about 2% for contained metal.

14.3.1  Preparation of Wireframes 
14.2.1.1   Resource Mineralisation 
The interpreted sectional outlines were manually triangulated to form wireframes as show in Figure 14-11.
Geological  information  from  trenches  was  used  to  guide  the  interpretation  of  mineralisation  boundaries.  
Information from drilling was used in preference where generally minor contradictions in trench and drill data 
were noted.  This reflects concerns with the sample quality of the trench information.
To form ends to the wireframes, the end section strings were copied to a position midway to the next section 
or to approximately 25m depending on sample information along strike or down dip.  The end section strings 
were adjusted to match the dip, strike and plunge of the zone.  The wireframed objects were validated using 
Vulcan software and set as solid triangulations.
Modelling was conducted on two main geological domains; the ore zones and the shear zones. A total of 22 
ore zones were modelled and 6 shear zones were modelled as shown in Figure 14-12.
The  mineralisation  wireframes  were  treated  as  hard  boundaries  for  all  estimation  purposes,  that  is,  only 
assays from within each wireframe were used to estimate blocks within that wireframe.

14.2.1.2   Weathering Surfaces 
Weathering  surfaces  were  interpreted  on  cross-section  and  extended  to  cover  the  block  model  limits.  
Weathering codes and degree of oxidation were included in the geology database and used to define the base 
of complete oxidation (boco_2014.00t) and top of fresh rock (tofr_2014.00t) surfaces.
The  database  geological  codes  used  to  define  the  weathering  surfaces  are  presented  in  Table  14-2.    The 
surfaces were mainly defined from the database field “Regolith”.
Conversely,  both the regolith  zone and  the  transition  zone (i.e.  base  of complete oxidation)  are defined by 
geological  codes  starting  with  ‘R’.  The  regolith  unit  is  generally  composed  of  the  Rpa  (pallid  zone),  Rmo 
(mottled zone), Rlt (laterite), Rfe (ferricrete), and Rsp (saprolite). The weathering of these units may vary, but 
generally spans from moderately weathered (mw) to extremely weathered (ew). It should be noted that the 
degree of weathering is not directly linked to the degree of oxidization, but to the competency of the rock.
The transition zone refers to the transition between the regolith and fresh rock. The database geological code 
used is Rsr (saprock).  Since this does define the transition between regolith and fresh rock, this unit tends to 
be weakly weathered (ww).
14.2.1.3   Geological Surfaces 
The  overburden  unit  is  defined  by  geological  codes  starting  with  ‘O’,  and  is  generally  composed  of  Osd 
(overburden  sand)  and  Ocy  (overburden  clay).    The  overburden  surface  (overburden_2014.00t)  was 
interpreted on cross section and extended to cover the block model limits.
14.2.1.4   Topographic Surface 
The surface elevation  is moderately undulating and ranges from 55m to 90m in elevation above sea level.  
This reflects the incisement of overburden and basement lithologies by numerous streams.
topographic  surface  was  coded
in
The  current 
late  2011 
(contour_wo_resource_2m.00t).  The survey was undertaken by Digital World Mapping Inc. and is nominally 
accurate to +/- 0.3m on flat terrain. The surface was thinned and re-contoured to reduce file size, however 
trench excavation lines are still generally visible and the surface is considered to be of excellent quality.
from  a  LiDAR  survey  undertaken
September 2014
Page 173
Drill  collars,  trench  excavation  lines  and  the  LiDAR  topographic  surface  generally  show  a  reasonable 
correlation.  To ensure consistency drill collars were adjusted in the Z direction (elevation) to match the LiDAR 
surface.  Collar  adjustments  were  generally  minor  or  reflected  corrections  to  either  historical  drill  collars  or 
where a hand held GPS had been used.
A  typical  cross  section  from  the  Smarts  Zone  highlighting  the  weathering  surfaces  and  the  mineralisation 
wireframes is shown in Figure 14-13.  The section location can be referred to in Figure 14-11.

14.3.2  Sample Statistics 
14.2.2.1   General 
The wireframes of the mineralised zones were used to define the Resource drillhole intersections.
The drill samples used to interpret the mineralisation are dominantly of 1m length.
A 1m interval length was selected for compositing and further geostatistical analysis.  This composite length 
reflects the majority of sample intervals and is at a suitable scale for the width of the Resource wireframes.
A small number of negative assays representing assay detection limit were converted to 0.005g/t grades (half 
the detection limit).
The composites were checked for spatial correlation with the objects, the location of the rejected composites 
and zero composite values.  A master composite file was created for the deposit with composites within each 
sold wireframe flagged.

14.2.2.2   Deposit Statistics 
The composite sample data for the deposit was grouped by Resource object for analysis.  Summary statistics 
for gold are shown in Table 14-11 for all ore zones and shear zones.

14.3.3  High Grade Cuts 
To assist in the selection of appropriate high grade cuts, the composite data  was analysed and population 
histograms, log probability plots and the coefficient of variation (CV) statistic was assessed for each Resource 
object. 
 
Following a review of the population histograms and the CV by domain, it was determined that high grade cuts 
were required for some objects. High grade cut statistics for each applicable object are listed in Table 14-12.

14.3.4  Geostatistical Analysis 
Geostatistical analysis  was carried  out on the three representative ore  zones  with sufficient data points for 
such an analysis. Ore Zones 1 and 6 and Shear Zone 1 were used as the basis for all other zones.
September 2014
Page 176
Downhole  and  three  orthogonal  variograms  were  modelled.  Directions  were  based  on  the  strike  and  dip 
direction  of  the  modelled  ore  zone  domains.  The  ore  zones  all  display  long  major  axes  along  the  NW-SE 
direction and shorter semi-major and minor axes. A two structured nested spherical model was found to model 
the experimental variogram well.
The orientation of the plane of mineralisation was aligned with the interpreted wireframes.  The variograms 
were calculated with the first aligned along the main mineralisation continuity while the second is aligned in 
the  plane  of  mineralisation  at  90°  to  the  first  orientation.    The  third  is  orientated  perpendicular  to  the 
mineralisation  plane,  across  the  width  of  the  mineralization  (see  Figure  14-14,  Figure  14-15  and  Figure 
14-16).

14.3.5  Kriging Parameters 
The gold grades were interpolated into a Vulcan block model using the Ordinary Kriging algorithm using the 
nugget,  sill  values  and  ranges  determined  from  the  variogram  models.    The  ranges  obtained  from  the 
variogram models  were  used  as  a  guide  in  determining  the  search  ellipse  parameters  used  in  the  Mineral 
Resource estimate.  The kriging parameters resulting from analysis of the two main ore zones (1 and 6) and 
shear  zone  1  were  applied  to  the  relevant  adjacent  minor  lodes.    All  parameters  are  summarised  in  Table 
14-13.

The block model used a primary block size of 20m along strike (NW-SE) by 4m across strike by 10m vertical 
with sub-cells of 5m by 1m by 2.5m.  The block model was rotated to 305 degrees on the horizontal plane to 
match the strike direction of mineralisation.  Block model co-ordinates are on the national grid PSAD56-UTM 
Zone 21N to match the trench and drillhole database.
The parent Y block size was selected on the basis of at least half of the average drill section spacing in better 
drilled areas of the Smarts Deposit. The model cell dimensions in other directions were selected to provide 
sufficient resolution to the block model in the across-strike and downdip direction. In addition, the selection of 
a 10m model cell height reflected the spacing of exploration drilling downdip.
14.3.7  Grade Interpolation Parameters
September 2014
Page 181
For all zones in the Smarts Zone, the wireframe objects were used as hard boundaries in the interpolation.  
That is, only grades inside each wireframe object were used to interpolate the blocks inside the coded object.  
The Ordinary Kriging algorithm was selected for grade interpolation. This was to allow the measured spatial 
variation of gold mineralisation to be incorporated into the model.
An  orientated  ‘ellipsoid’  search  was  used  to  select  data  for  interpolation.    The  ellipse  was  oriented  to  the 
average  strike,  dip  and  plunge  of  the  mineralised  zones,  and  varied  accordingly  within  each  object.    The 
maximum  search  radius  was  set  at  a  distance  similar  to  the  variogram  range  for  the  major  direction  or  as 
required to ensure all blocks were estimated in the final kriging pass.  The major to semi-major and the major 
to minor search ratios were based on the variogram ranges.
A  three-pass  estimation  search  was  used  to  complete  estimation  for  gold  within  the  domain  objects.    The 
second pass was about twice the distance as the first pass and the third pass was double again.
Estimation parameters used in the estimate are listed below in Table 14-15.

14.3.8  Bulk Density and Material Type 
Bulk density values were assigned to each weathering material type based on values compiled from historical 
and recent bulk density test work for the Smarts Zone.  Domain values for bulk density were further separated 
by inside/outside the mineralisation object wireframes.  The assigned bulk density values are detailed below in 
Table 14-16.  These values are considered to be consistent with nearby deposits in the region.

Bulk density information is relatively sparse in the oxide and transition zones, reflecting the lower amount of 
available drill core for density test work.  These two weathering zones comprise a relatively small proportion of 
the mineralisation total, however these zones will be the first areas exposed in mining.
Material type was also defined on the basis of weathering state.  Material type and the corresponding bulk 
density were coded into the block model in the ‘type’ and ‘bd’ attributes respectively.
14.3.9  Resource Classification 
The  Smarts  Zone  shows  good  to  reasonable  continuity  of  mineralisation  within  well-defined  geological 
constraints.  The drill hole spacing throughout the project is approximately 50m along strike with recent infill 
drilling targeting 25m by 25m spaced drilling within the proposed open pits.  Drill section spacing increases to 
greater than 100m on more sparsely drilled areas generally on the margins of the zone.  Drill spacing downdip 
is of similar dimensions.
The drill spacing is sufficient to allow the grade intersections to be modelled into coherent wireframes for each 
domain.  Reasonable consistency is evident in the thickness and grade of the domains.
The Mineral Resource was classified on the basis of sample spacing and continuity of the interpreted zones.  
The Measured Mineral Resource was defined  within  areas of 25m by 25m spaced drilling due to the good 
continuity and predictability of the lode positions. Successive infill drilling campaigns in the open pit area from 
100m spacing to 50m and finally to 25m has confirmed the geological and grade model for this part of the 
Resource,  accordingly  the  25m  spaced  areas  have  generally  been  classified  as  Measured  Resource.  The 
Indicated  Mineral  Resources  was  generally  defined  by  50m  x  50m  spaced  drilling.  The  Inferred  Mineral 
Resource included areas of the Mineral Resource where sampling was greater than 50m by 50m and small 
isolated pods of mineralisation outside the main mineralised zones.  The Mineral Resource classification for 
the Ore Zone wireframes is shown in Figure 14-17 and for the Shear Zone wireframes in Figure 14-18.

The Resource block model has an  attribute “class” for all  blocks within the  Resource wireframes coded  as 
“Mea”, “Ind” or “Inf”.

To show the tonnage and grade distribution throughout the entire Smarts Zone, a bench breakdown has been 
prepared for gold by weathering type material.  The material type breakdown is shown in Figure 14-21.

14.3.11  Model Validation 
A three step process was used to validate the Mineral Resource estimate.  Firstly a qualitative assessment 
was completed by slicing sections through the block model in positions coincident with drilling.  Overall the 
assessment indicated that the trend of the modelled grade appeared consistent with the drillhole grades.  A 
representative section is shown in Figure 14-24 below.
September 2014
Page 187
Figure 14-24:  Smarts Zone Example of Correlation between Drillhole Grades and Block Model Grades
To check that the interpolation of the block model correctly honoured the drilling data, further validation was 
carried out by comparing the interpolated blocks to the sample composite data.  Resource validation plots by 
easting panels and elevation are presented in Figure 14-25 and Figure 14-26 respectively.  
 
The validation plots show acceptable correlation between the composite grades and the uncut and cut block 
model grades.  The trends shown by the raw data are generally honoured by the block model and generally 
the model grades are lower than the composite grades.
The  comparisons  also  show  the  effect  of  the  interpolation,  which  results  in  some  smoothing  of  the  block 
grades  compared  to  the  composite  grades.    This  would  be  expected  where  drill  sample  data  density 
decreases.

14.4.1  Preparation of Wireframes
September 2014
Page 189
14.4.1.1   Resource Mineralisation 
The interpreted sectional outlines were manually triangulated to form a single wireframe as shown in Figure 
14-27.
To form ends to the wireframes, the end section strings were copied to a position approximately midway to the 
next  section  or  no  greater  than  25m.    The  end  section  strings  were  adjusted  to  match  the  dip,  strike  and 
plunge of the Larken Zone mineralisation.  The wireframed objects were validated using Vulcan software and 
set as solids.
The mineralisation wireframe was treated as a hard boundary for all estimation purposes, that is, only assays 
from within the wireframe was used to estimate blocks within the wireframe.
Figure 14-27:  Oblique View of Larken Resource Wireframe (View Looking North)
14.2.1.2   Weathering Surfaces 
Weathering  surfaces  were  interpreted  on  cross  section  and  extended  to  cover  the  block  model  limits.  
Weathering codes and degree of oxidation were included in the geology database and used to define the base 
of complete oxidation (boco_2014.00t) and top of fresh rock (tofr_2014.00t) surfaces.
The  database  geological  codes  used  to  define  the  weathering  surfaces  are  presented  in  Table  14-2.    The 
surfaces were mainly defined from the database field “Regolith”.
Conversely,  both the regolith  zone and  the  transition  zone (i.e.  base  of complete oxidation)  are defined by 
geological  codes  starting  with  ‘R’.  The  regolith  unit  is  generally  composed  of  the  Rpa  (pallid  zone),  Rmo 
(mottled zone), Rlt (laterite), Rfe (ferricrete), and Rsp (saprolite). The weathering of these units may vary, but 
generally spans from moderately weathered (mw) to extremely weathered (ew). It should be noted that the 
degree of weathering is not directly linked to the degree of oxidization, but to the competency of the rock.
The transition zone refers to the transition between the regolith and fresh rock. The database geological code 
used is Rsr (saprock). Since this does define the transition between regolith and fresh rock, this unit tends to 
be weakly weathered (ww).
14.2.1.3   Geological Surfaces
September 2014
Page 190
The  overburden  unit  is  defined  by  geological  codes  starting  with  ‘O’,  and  is  generally  composed  of  Osd 
(overburden sand) and Ocy (overburden clay) (Table 14-2).  The overburden surface (overburden_2014.00t) 
was interpreted on cross section and extended to cover the block model limits.
14.2.1.4   Topographic Surface 
The surface elevation  is moderately undulating and ranges from 55m to 90m in elevation above sea level.  
This reflects the incisement of overburden and basement lithologies by numerous streams.
topographic  surface  was  coded
in
The  current 
late  2011 
(contour_wo_resource_2m.00t).  The survey was undertaken by Digital World Mappine Inc. and is nominally 
accurate to +/- 0.3m on flat terrain. The surface was thinned and re-contoured to reduce file size, however 
trench excavation lines are still generally visible and the surface is considered to be of excellent quality.
from  a  LiDAR  survey  undertaken
Drillcollars,  trench  excavation  lines  and  the  LiDAR  topographic  surface  generally  show  a  reasonable 
correlation.  To ensure consistency drill collars were adjusted in the Z direction (elevation) to match the LiDAR 
surface.  Collar  adjustments  were  generally  minor  or  reflected  corrections  to  either  historical  drill  collars  or 
where a hand held GPS had been used.
14.4.2  Sample Statistics 
14.4.2.1   General 
The wireframe of the mineralised zone was used to define the Resource intersections. The drill samples used 
to interpret the mineralisation are dominantly of 1m length. A 1m interval length was selected for compositing 
and further geostatistical analysis.  This composite length reflects the majority of sample intervals and is at a 
suitable scale for the width of the Resource wireframes. Any residual composites of less than 0.5m in length 
were added to the preceding composite.
Vulcan software was then used to extract 1m down-hole composites within the intervals coded as resource 
intersections.    A  small  number  of  negative  assays  representing  assay  detection  limit  were  converted  to 
0.005g/t grades.
The composites were checked for spatial correlation with the objects, the location of the rejected composites 
and zero composite values. A master composite file was created including each of the individual Resource 
objects in the wireframe model.
14.4.2.2   Deposit Statistics 
Summary statistics for gold are shown in Table 14-3 for the ore zone solid triangulation.  Summary statistics 
by domain for gold for the Larken Zone are shown below in Table 14-18.

14.4.3  High Grade Cuts 
Due  to  the  lack  of  data  points  within  the  mineralization  solid  shape  is  was  not  possible  to  statistically 
determine the appropriate top cut.  The Larken Zone is very similar geologically to the nearby Smarts Deposit 
so a top cut of 20g/t was applied which is the same as several of the Smarts Deposit mineralised wireframes.
The Mineral Resource estimate is reported using cut gold values.
14.4.4  Geostatistical Analysis 
A detailed geostatistical analysis was not possible due to the lack of data points within the solid shape.
September 2014
Page 191
14.4.5  Grade Interpolation Parameters 
The gold composite grades were interpolated into a Vulcan block model using inverse distance squared (ID2) 
algoithm. The search direction was based on the orientation of the mineralization and the ranges based on the 
drill spacing.  All parameters are summarised in Table 14-19.

14.4.6  Block Model 
A Vulcan block model was created to encompass the full extent of the zone.  A list of block model parameters 
is displayed in Table 14-20 below.
The block model used a primary block size of 20m along strike (NW-SE) by 4m across strike by 10m vertical 
with sub-cells of 5m by 1m by 2.5m.  The block model was rotated to 305 degrees on the horizontal plane to 
match the strike direction of mineralisation.  Block model co-ordinates are on the national grid PSAD56-UTM 
Zone 21N to match the trench and drillhole database.
The parent Y block size was selected on the basis of approximately half of the average drill section spacing in 
better  drilled  areas  of  the  deposit.  The  model  cell  dimensions  in  other  directions  were  selected  to  provide 
sufficient resolution to the block model in the across-strike and down-dip direction. In addition, the selection of 
a 10m model cell height reflected the spacing of exploration drilling down-dip.

14.4.8  Resource Classification 
The Larken Zone shows reasonable continuity of mineralisation but due to the lack of drilling data it has been 
classified  as  100%  Inferred  Mineral  Resource.  Drillholes  are  located  at  about  70m  spaced  north-east 
orientated drill sections.
The  drill  spacing  is  sufficient  to  allow  the  grade  intersections  to  be  modelled  into  a  coherent  wireframe.  
Reasonable consistency is evident in the thickness and grade of the domain.
The  authors  consider  that  geological  and  mineralisation  continuity  has  been  demonstrated  with  sufficient 
confidence to allow the Larken Zone to be classified as Inferred Mineral Resource.

To show the tonnage and grade distribution throughout the entire Larken Zone, a bench breakdown has been 
prepared for gold by weathering type material.  The material type breakdown is shown in Figure 14-29.  Grade 
tends to be higher in the transition and oxide zones.

September 2014
Page 194
Due to lack of data points normal validation processes using swarth plots were not assessed. A qualitative 
assessment was completed by slicing sections through the block model in positions coincident with drilling.  
Overall the assessment indicated that the trend of the modelled grade appeared consistent with the drillhole 
grades.
15. Mineral Reserves 
Mineral Reserves have been estimated for open pits only at the Smarts and Hicks Zones. Future underground 
operations  will  be  estimated  at  a  later  date  following  the  completion  of  deeper  drilling  and  subsequent 
modelling.
15.1  Open Pit Mineral Reserves 
Mineral Reserves were estimated based on the Mineral Resources that have been presented in Section 14 of 
this Technical Report. Mineral Resource estimates are inclusive of Mineral Reserves. The Mineral Resource 
block  models  were  imported  onto  Whittle™  software  and  a  series  of  pit  shells  generated.  The  input 
parameters used in the optimization are shown in Table 15-1. The optimal pit shell was chosen based on the 
economic analysis and the relative volumes. The optimization was conducted with underground mining costs 
included so as to limit the pit depth should underground mining become more economically attractive. This did 
not impact the pit volumes or reserves significasntly due to the geometry and location of high grade shoots. 
The lower high grade shoot that will be the subject of a future mining study was too deep to be exploited by 
open pit mining methods at the gold price and cost scenarios considered.

The Karouni Gold Project is made up of the Hicks Deposit and the Smarts Deposit. These are reported with 
an effective date of June 30th 2014.
Mineral Reserves by definition have taken into account environmental, permitting, legal title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing and political factors and constraints, as discussed in Section 20 and Section 21 of this 
PFS. The Mineral Reserves are adequate to support mine planning. 
16. Mining Methods 
The  Karouni  Gold  Project  will  be  developed  initially  as  an  open  pit  operation  at  the  Smarts  and  Hicks 
Deposits. The total mine life for the pits is three years. Underground mining will be assessed later.
16.1  Open Pit Mining Operations  
Mining  will  commence  six  months  before  the  processing  plant  is  commissioned.  This  will  enable  adequate 
high grade stocks to be accumulated prior to the commencement of processing.
An  initial  fleet  comprising  two  excavators  will  commence  at  the  Smarts  and  Hicks  Deposits.  There  is  sand 
overburden up to 30m thick covering much of the Smarts Deposit whereas the Hicks Deposit outcrops. Initial 
ore production will be sourced from the Smarts Deposit with production at the Hicks Deposit commencing in 
month 5. Ore production will then focus on the higher grade Smarts Deposit. An additional fleet is mobilised 
after 5 months to provide additional capacity for the Hicks Deposit. This fleet is then demobilised in month 30 
with a second fleet demobilised in month 29 and open pit mining concluded in month 36.
16.1.1  Smarts 
The Smarts Deposit will be mined as a 4 stage pit. The first two stages will target shallow, higher grade pods 
with the final two stages amalgamating the pits into a single final pit. Mining will be via conventional backhoe 
configured excavators loading 30t rigid trucks. Mining will be done on 2.5m flitches over a 5m high blast. Initial 
sand overburden removal will be free dig with no blasting required.
September 2014
Page 196
Oxidation/weathering is of moderate depth at the Smarts Deposit with average depths to fresh rock of about 
50m below natural surface. Blasting will however be required in the transitional zone and deeper parts of the 
oxidised profile in order to maintain excavator dig rates.
Final vertical depth of the stage 4 Smarts Pit is 140m. Total volume excavated will be 8,614,000m3. 
The final pit design incorporates the following design parameters see Table 16-1 and Figure 16-1:

Drilling has encountered water accumulating at the base of the sand overburden. It is proposed to divert this 
water away from the pit crest via drains. Any naturally occurring water courses will also be diverted around the 
excavation using purpose built drainage channels.
Water in the pit will be pumped out using conventional in-pit sumps excavated as the pit progresses and water 
pumped to the pit crest for dispersal utilising the previously mentioned surface drainage infrastructure.
16.1.2  Hicks 
The Hicks Deposit will be developed as a series of three discrete pits along the Hicks line of mineralisation 
(see Figure 16-2). Open pit mining will target higher grade, shallow mineralisation. The deepest pit, stage 2, 
extends to 90m below natural surface.
September 2014
Page 197
There is no overburden masking mineralisation at the Hicks Deposit. Mining will commence in month 5 after 
mining has started at the Smarts Deposit with the first two mining fleets.
Mining parameters will be the same as those used for designing the Smarts Pits.

17. Recovery Methods 
 
The  proposed  method  of  gold  recovery  is  via  a  conventional  CIL  gold  processing  facility.  This  will  involve 
crushing, grinding, leaching and adsorption followed by elution and electrowinning. Final product will be gold 
in the form of doré bars. The plant throughput rate is designed to treat 1,000,000 tonnes per annum of run of 
mine ore delivered to the primary crusher. 
 
17.1  Description and Flow Sheet of Process Plant 
 
The  process  plant  design  is  based  on  a  conventional  CIL  plant  with  primary  and  secondary  crushing  to 
produce mill feed for the grinding circuit where water is added. The mill product will be controlled by the use of 
hydro-cyclones  to  produce  the  desired  feed  size  to  the  leach  circuit.  A  pre-leach  thickener  will  be  used  to 
control leach feed density. Oversize material returning from the cyclones for further grinding  will pass over 
screens to remove the +2mm material. The +2mm material will overflow the screen back to the grinding mill, 
while the -2mm undersize is fed to two centrifugal concentrators for recovery of the coarser gravity gold. The 
concentrate from the centrifugal concentrators provides a high gold grade feed to an intensive leach reactor 
system. The expected free or coarse gold is anticipated to  be of the  order of 40% – 50% of the total  gold 
entering the plant. The high tenor gold solution from the intensive leach reactor (ILR) will be sent to the gold 
refinery section for electrowinning and smelting. The doré bars produced  will  be transported to an  external 
refinery for final processing.
September 2014
Page 199
The leach feed will be processed in a series of agitated tanks comprising one leach tank and six carbon tanks, 
with sodium cyanide being added into the first four tanks as required by the process. Compressed air will also 
be added to assist in the leaching process, as required, in the first three tanks.  Activated carbon will be added 
to the adsorption circuit and it will adsorb the gold with the loaded carbon moving counter current to the slurry 
flow in the circuit until sufficiently loaded for stripping, when the carbon will be sent to an elution circuit for gold 
recovery  by  electrowinning  and  smelting.  The  stripped  carbon  will  be  regenerated  and  returned  to  the 
adsorption circuit. 
 
The leached ore (tailings) will pass through a series of three detoxification tanks where sodium metabisulphite 
(SMBS) and copper sulphate will be added together with air to drive the detoxification reaction. Lime slurry will 
also be added for pH control to improve the destruction kinetics. The detox circuit will remove any free and 
  ion  concentration  down  to  or  lower  than  the  required  levels.  The 
WAD  cyanide  driving  the  contained  CN
detoxified tailings are then pumped to a large tailings storage facility (TSF). As tails settle any water recovered 
will pumped back to the processing plant or stilling ponds along with any rain water retained.
-
17.2  Plant Design, Equipment Characteristics 
The  processing  plant  has  been  designed  for  an  annual  processing  rate  of  1,000,000t/a  as  a  start-up 
configuration, with the capacity to increase production when or if required. The crushing circuit is based on the 
use of a Metso C 120 jaw primary crusher followed by a HP 500 secondary cone crusher and a double deck 
vibrating  screen  with  the  screen  oversize  from  both  decks  being  returned  to  the  cone  crusher  for  further 
crushing. The crushed product will be transferred via a conveyor to a covered mill feed stockpile, which has a 
live capacity sufficient for 24hr of production. The mill feed will be drawn from the stockpile using an open slot 
and a belt feeder with variable speed control. There is an emergency mill feed system in place to allow for 
crusher overhauls and down time. The emergency mill feed system utilises a feed hopper mounted over the 
mill feed conveyor belt. The mill feed conveyor will have a weightometer to record production and to control 
the mill feed tonnage rate. Lime slurry will be added to the mill feed chute as required to maintain a high pH 
(10.5) in the milled ore, which will prevent cyanide losses by volatilisation.  
 
The  grinding  circuit  will  consist  of  a  3.2MW  ball  mill  with  the  grind  size  being  controlled  by  a  bank  of  six 
hydrocyclones  of  which  four  will  be  in  use  with  two  on  standby.  Grinding  balls  will  be  added  to  the  mill, 
manually as required.  
 
A pre-leach thickener will be used to control the leach feed density. The leach circuit will consist of 7 x 600m3 
steel tanks, each with agitators. Compressed air inlets will be available on the first four tanks and utilised as 
required. Carbon transfer pumps will be installed in the CIL tanks. The tailings from the leach circuit will be 
treated using the INCO SO2 Air process reducing any free and WAD cyanide down to permitted levels. The 
tailings will be deposited in a TSF built to contain the total calculated volume for the life of mine. Excess water 
will  be  pumped  back  to  the  plant  for  re-use,  with  excess  rain  water  passing  through  stilling  ponds  prior  to 
being discharged from the site. The control of and measurement of feed and discharge volumes and density 
of  milled  material  is  carried  out  by  way  of  nucleonic  density  meters  fitted  to  the  leach  circuit  feed  and 
discharge  lines  respectively.  Total  plant  operation  will  be  controlled  by  an  Emerson  Delta  V  computerized 
process  control  system  to  ensure  control  over  feed,  discharge,  chemical  levels,  tank  level  control  and  to 
promote maximum efficiency.  
 
Gold recovery from the coarse gold fraction during the grinding and classification process will be by way of 
centrifugal concentrators followed by an intensive leach reactor system with the final pregnant leach solution 
going to the refinery for electrowinning and smelting.  
 
The elution and refining circuit will strip the carbon of gold by way of a pressurised strip circuit containing a 
carbon acid wash column, gold stripping column, integrated pressurized electrowinning system and a carbon 
transfer and regeneration system. The production of gold doré bars will be achieved by cleaning the electro-
won gold sludge, and drying and smelting the product with appropriate fluxes. The gold room will be a high 
security facility.  See Figure 17-1 below.

17.3  Current or Projected Requirements for Energy, Water and Process Materials 
 
The  processing  plant  will  require  chemicals,  electrical  energy  and  water  to  operate.  The  expected  level  of 
electrical energy use is ~5.7MW with electricity supplied from a company owned and operated diesel powered 
generating  facility  of  ~10MW  capacity  consisting  of  a  number  of  smaller  units,  delivering  power  to  be 
distributed over a 13,800 volt network at 60Hz. This will provide backup power and room for expansion. 
 
The water usage  will initially be high until the tailings return  water has stabilized. Expected use of process 
water is ~800,000m3/a to cover wash down, camp, mine and other uses. Approximately 45 % of the process 
water is expected to be returned from the TSF. The remainder will be derived from pit de-watering, a bore field 
and possibly small dams. Guyana is a very high rain fall area and a lack of water is not seen as a potential 
issue.  
 
In terms of chemicals, the Karouni Gold Project will require approximately 500t of CN, 1,600t of lime, 700t of 
grinding balls, 17,675t of diesel fuel, 480t of SMBS, 100m3 of 32% hydrochloric acid, 30t of flocculant, 30t of 
caustic soda and a number of smaller quantities of other chemicals each year. None of the required products 
are available in Guyana so these will need to be imported.  See proposed plant layout in Figure 17-2.

The processing plant is proposed to be located centrally between Smarts and Hicks Deposits.
18.2  Power Generation 
The power generation capability will be made up of 5 diesel gensets of 2MW capacity each. The powerhouse 
will be located adjacent to the processing plant. Diesel will be trucked in from Georgetown and stored in a 
dedicated storage facility onsite.
18.3  Offices and Warehouse 
The main administration office and warehouse will be located adjacent to the processing facility. The office will 
house  all  administration  and  technical  staff.  The  warehouse  will  carry  all  necessary  spare  parts  and 
consumables for daily operational requirements.
18.4  Fuel Storage 
A  facility  for  storing  160,000  liters  of  diesel  fuel  will  be  constructed  adjacent  to  the  processing  plant.  The 
facility  will  be  fully  bunded  and  will  deliver  fuel  to  the  powerhouse.  In  addition  there  will  be  provision  for 
refuelling light vehicles.
Another  storage  facility  will  be  located  at  the  laydown  and  workshop  area.  This  facility  will  be  utilised  for 
refuelling the open pit.
18.5  Laydown and Workshop Area 
An area dedicated to heavy vehicle maintenance will be located near the main pit haulage road. This area will 
contain an undercover maintenance facility for the servicing of heavy equipment and offices for maintenance 
personnel. It will also have a diesel storage facility for the refuelling of mining vehicles.
18.6  Accommodation Village 
An accommodation village for 300 personnel  will be  constructed to the south of the processing facility  and 
adjacent to the airstrip. The village will have facilities for accommodating 30 personnel in ensuited type units. 
The village will include messing facilities for meals and access to satellite television and telephones.
18.6  Tails Storage Facility 
The tails storage facility will be accommodated in a natural valley located to the south-west of the main Smarts 
and Hicks Deposits. A compacted, earthern embankment will contain the tails. The tails dam will be designed 
to hold all of the planned tails discharge from the processing plant over the forecast 3 year mine life.
18.7  Water Storage 
A fresh water storage facility will be constructed to hold potable water.  In addition, a process water facility will 
also be constructed.
18.8  Haul Roads 
A  network  of  haul  roads  will  be  constructed  to  transport  material  from  the  mines  to  the  processing  facility. 
These roads will not be accessible to the public.  The haul roads will be sprayed with water to minimise any 
potential dust.

19. Market Studies and Contracts 
No market studies were carried out for this technical report. The final product of the Karouni Gold Project will 
be  gold  doré  bars.  These  will  be  easily  sold  and  absorbed  in  the  current  market  at  prevailing  global  gold 
prices. 
 
20. Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 
A draft Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been completed for the Karouni Gold Project 
and  lodged  with  the  Guyana  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA).  The  ESIA  has  been  prepared  to 
conform  to  guidelines  established  by  the  EPA  and  as  detailed  in  the  EPA  publication  titled  Environmental 
Impact  Assessment  Guidelines,  Volume  3  Mining,  Version  1,  August  2000.  In  accordance  with  those
September 2014
Page 204
guidelines the ESIA is comprised of three components, the Environmental Baseline Study, the Environmental 
and Social Assessment and the Environmental and Social Impact Management Plan.
The Environmental and Social Assessment identifies and assesses the impacts of the proposed action and its 
alternatives taking into consideration the measures that are proposed to mitigate and/or enhance the probable 
impacts.    The  Environmental  and  Social  Assessment  identifies  the  project-environment  interactions  during 
design, construction and operation and after closure of the operation. The planned implementation schedule, 
associated with mitigation of environmental effects, is also detailed as part of the ESIA.
Final  requirements  and  plans  for  waste  and  tails  disposal,  site  monitoring  and  water  management  were 
determined as part of the PFS process. Permitting is progressing and will include rehabilitation and bonding 
requirements. Mine closure planning, including remediation and reclamation,  will  be finalised as part of the 
permitting process.
20.1  Approach 
The primary reports available for the  Karouni Gold Project are the  baseline characterization report and the 
Preliminary  Scoping  Report.  These  reports  were  prepared  over  the  period  2012  to  2013.  The  baseline 
characterization report details the physical, ecological and sociocultural baseline data for the project area and 
its immediate vicinity. The Preliminary Scoping Study (PSS) presents details on the mine site infrastructure, 
the  process  plant  and  plans  for  project  implementation.  The  ESIA  incorporates  both  the  baseline 
characterization data and information presented in the PSS.
The overall ESIA process followed is depicted in Figure 20-1 below.

20.2  ESIA Methodology 
The methodology incorporated the following tasks which are described in more detail below:
Figure 20-1:  ESIA Process
Review of existing documentation; 
Assessment of policy, legislative and regulatory framework; 
Evaluation of historic baseline data; 
Determination of scope of assessment;
September 2014
Public meetings; 
2012 & 2013 field activities and surveys;  
Impact assessment and rating; 
Development of environmental and social management plan; 
Institutional analyses for project implementation; 
Development of monitoring program; 
Preparation of emergency response procedures; and  
Preparation of closure guidelines
20.3  Review of Existing Documentation 
The ESIA reviewed available historic data for the mine site and related areas.  The review examined data on 
environmental,  economic and social  variables  which  included  site  geology,  hydrogeology, surface  water flow, 
biodiversity, conservation priorities, the proximity of indigenous communities, mining operations now underway 
and those formerly  taking  place  in  the area,  and the  likely  presence  of archaeological resources  in  the area. 
Examples of documents reviewed include:
Indigenous Groups reports for the mining sector;
•  Geological reports for the area; 
•  Checklists of Plants, Fish, and Terrestrial Fauna of the Guiana Shield Region; 
•  2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; 
•  NatureServe and IUCN species distribution maps and GIS data; 
•  Alliance for Zero Extinction data; 
•  Guiana Shield Initiative studies and GIS data; 
•  Forestry Studies for the area; 
•  Data on Aquatic Resources of the area; 
• 
•  NGO information, including Conservation International (CI) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF); 
•  World Bank (IFC) guidelines on Baseline Characterization; 
•  World Bank (IFC) guidelines on Environmental Assessment; 
•  Guyana Environmental Protection Act; 
•  Guyana Town and Country Planning Act; 
•  Guyana Forestry Commission Guidelines; 
•  Guyana EPA Guidelines on Environmental Management Plans; 
•  Guyana EPA Guidelines on Human and Environmental Risk Assessment; and 
•  Guyana EPA Guidelines on Air Emissions Modeling.
Guidelines  for  the  mining  industry  (e.g.,  ICMM),  including  those  for  the  management  of  cyanide  and  other 
hazardous  chemicals  and  standards  for  the  construction  of  roads  in  mining  areas,  were  also  reviewed  to 
determine their relevance to the project. 
 
20.4  Assessment of Policy, Legislative and Regulatory Framework 
A review of the applicable Guyanese Regulatory Framework regarding environmental and social requirements 
of  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  was  undertaken.  A  comparison  was  made  with  requirements  of  the  IFC 
Performance  Standards  (PSs)  and  Environmental,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  standards.  In  those  instances 
where Guyana regulations differed from the levels and measures presented in the IFC EHS guidelines, the 
more stringent of the two requirements formed the basis of this ESIA.
20.5  Evaluation of Historic Baseline Data 
Physical,  biological,  and  socio-cultural  baselines  were  completed  for  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  by  Ground 
Structures Engineering Consultants (GSEC) in 2012. The baseline compilation program included biological field 
surveys, recovery and analyses of surface water samples, visits to communities within proximity of the mine site 
and compilation of data for the Karouni Gold Project area and its vicinity. This ESIA is based on a review of that 
baseline  information  and  data  gathered  from  additional  field  programs  to  fill  data  gaps  and  to  confirm  data 
acquired by the initial baseline studies.
September 2014
Page 206
20.6  Determination of Scope of Assessment  
Based  on  the  review  and  analysis  of  existing  information,  the  scope  of  the  assessment  was  determined, 
including  the  methodologies  to  be  followed  for  the  additional  baseline  field  studies  including  hydrogeology, 
biodiversity, and socio-economic. Scoping identified:
•  The appropriate boundaries of the Karouni Gold Project (e.g., project area of influence); 
•  Major issues and concerns; 
•  The information necessary for decision-making;  
•  The significant effects and factors to be considered; and  
•  The scope and methodology of the assessment.
20.7  Public Meetings  
 
Representatives of PGI and GSEC attended mandatory government agency sector and community stakeholder 
meetings  chaired  by  the  Environmental  Assessment  Board  under  the  Guyana  EIA  legislation.  A  Government 
Agency  Sector  Review  meeting  was  held  in  Georgetown  on  November  15,  2013  and  an  advertised  public 
meeting was held by the EPA with a presentation of the Karouni Gold Project and proposed activities by PGI at 
the Kaburi Village Benab, the regional seat of Region 7, on November 16, 2013. Concerns and issues raised by 
attendees at the meeting have been incorporated into the analysis. 
 
20.8  Field Activities and Surveys 
 
The baseline data was expanded to include ecology information for the proposed new access road to the mine 
site.  The initial baseline ecology was acquired by utilizing various methodologies including field surveys, direct 
observation,  and  where  appropriate,  through  interviews  and  questionnaires.  Data  collection  for  the  physical 
environment  focused  on  surface  and  groundwater  water  hydrology  and  quality  and  soil  type.  The  biological 
environment  data  collection  was  focused  on  flora  and  fauna,  rare/endangered  species,  sensitive  and  critical 
natural habitats, species of commercial importance, migratory species and the biodiversity of the area.  
   
20.9  Hydrogeological Data Acquisition 
 
Five (5) well nests were drilled within the mine site area. Each nest was comprised of three wells, one each in 
alluvials, saprolite and bedrock. A groundwater monitoring well was installed in each well at each well nest. One 
borehole  was  located  within  the  footprint  of  the  area  identified  for  the  tailings  pond  and  another  within  the 
footprint of the area identified for the process plant. Ground water levels were recorded at each monitoring well 
to provide data for hydrogeological evaluation. 
 
Groundwater  samples  were  collected  from  each  the  appropriate  monitoring  well  at  each  well  nest  after 
development. Each ground water sample was analyzed for the presence and concentrations of heavy metals, 
and  other  constituents  to  conform  to  Guyana  EPA  guidelines.  The  minimum  list  of  parameters  for  which  all 
samples  were  analyzed  coincided  with  those  identified  by  the World  Bank  for  cyanidation  operations  for  the 
recovery of gold. 
 
20.10  Surface Water 
 
Water samples were recovered from several streams in the Karouni Gold Project area and tested to determine 
the  concentration  of  chemical  constituents.  Snap  shots  estimates  of  surface  water  flows,  on  major 
streams/creeks/rivers upstream and  downstream of the mine site  were measured and coupled  with surveyed 
cross-sections of those streams to develop discharge estimates for surface water modeling. The slope of each 
stream was also recorded  at various  locations to provide additional data for surface  water modeling. Surface 
water samples  were  also recovered from major streams/creeks/rivers upstream and downstream of the mine 
site.  Sediment samples were also recovered from point coincident with surface water sampling points to confirm 
to  Guyana  EPA  guidelines.  Both  surface  water  and  sediment  samples  were  analyzed  for  the  presence  and 
concentrations of heavy metals, and other constituents to conform to Guyana EPA guidelines. The minimum list 
of  parameters  for  which  all  samples  were  analyzed  coincided  with  those  identified  by  the  World  Bank  for 
cyanidation operations for the recovery of gold.
September 2014
Page 207
An analytical model was utilized to assess potential impacts to surface water from various discharge, spill, and 
release scenarios during mine construction and operation.  The primary objective for the ESIA was to assess 
the duration, spatial extent, and dilution of accidental discharges, potentially containing cyanide, to the Kaburi 
River.  Both  small  spills  that  may  occur  from  time  to  time  and  catastrophic  releases  were  assessed  for  the 
proposed Karouni Gold Project. 
 
20.11  Biological Resources 
 
Two field survey of biological resources for the mine site area and its environs was conducted, one each for a 
single wet and a single dry season. During the surveys all biological features at the mine site and its environs 
were sampled.  Unknown varieties were sampled, preserved and returned to Georgetown for identification. In 
addition, a forester prepared estimated quantities of the most dominant species by measuring the breast height, 
diameters and other data necessary to determine plant biomass. 
 
20.12  Socio-Economic Resources 
The socio-economic baseline was compiled by both stakeholder mapping and information gathering. Focused 
consultations were held with the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs and with Indigenous Peoples NGOs (GOIP, APA 
and TAAMOG) to gather information on the presence of indigenous communities in the Karouni Gold Project 
area. Data was compiled on the presence of human communities in the area and agricultural, forest production, 
fishing and hunting practices. The socio-economic baseline also established resource use patterns in the area 
and examined land use such as agriculture, forestry and mining. The presence of social infrastructure such as 
schools,  medical  facilities,  communications/transport  networks  and  markets  was  established.  Data  was  also 
compiled on public health and on health risks and diseases in the vicinity of the project. 
 
A fact finding or information seeking exercise was undertaken of small rural communities in the vicinity of the 
project  through  consultations.  The  key  objective  was  to  assess  the  baseline  of  the  communities  and  identify 
impacts  (if  any)  that  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  could  potentially  have  on  the  human  environment.  The  main 
approach  therefore  was  stakeholder  ‘consultation’  focused  and  was  aimed  at  participatory  engagement  of 
stakeholders in project conception, design and implementation.  
 
An  information  seeking/research  oriented  exercise  was  also  undertaken  with  the  communities  in  the  Karouni 
Gold Project Area of influence to profile the socioeconomic baseline conditions of these communities and the 
potential impacts (if any) that might arise as a result of the Karouni Gold Project. The following activities were 
carried out in the communities:
•  Discussion with community leaders - informal discussion to provide information on the Karouni Gold
Project and to understand community concerns;
•  Focus  Group  Discussions  -  open  ended  discussions  with  groups  or  sub  groups  within  each
communities such as women, youth, elderly people; and
•  Community survey forms - these forms were completed in each community to gain basic information 
on the natural setting, governance, local customs and economy, social development, infrastructure, 
administrative and economic conditions.
20.13  Impact Assessment and Rating 
An  impact  rating  system  was  developed  for  the  ESIA  to  enable  a  systematic  ranking  of  identified 
environmental and social  impacts and presentation of a summary table  which can  be  used by the  Karouni 
Gold Project to prioritise mitigations according to ranking. The impacts section presented in this report ranks 
impacts using the criteria presented in the following sections. 
 
The impact rating is the product of two elements: (1) the severity of the potential impact and (2) the likelihood 
of the impact or “event” occurring. 
 
20.14  Severity and Enhancement Criteria 
 
Firstly, the severity or enhancement of each impact was rated using the criteria identified in Table 20-1, Table 
20-2, Table 20-3 and Table 20-4. Note that colours are used to assist the reader in reviewing the impacts and 
their relative magnitude. As such, they should not be considered definitive.

20.15  Limitations of the ESIA  
 
The ESIA has the following limitations: 
 
Timing of the study- the ESIA was undertaken while the Karouni Gold Project PFS was being prepared. The 
Karouni Gold Project design details and facility location are expected to evolve and change during the PFS. This 
draft ESIA is not consequently based on definitive positions for several of the proposed site facilities including 
waste disposal and the water management pond.  
 
The  analysis  and  findings  of  this  draft  ESIA  are  therefore  based  on  the  status  of  the  Karouni  Gold  Project 
description as of 30 September 2013. Any changes or additions to the Karouni Gold Project design and plans 
subsequent  to  September  2013  would  not  necessarily  be  covered  under  this  draft  ESIA  or  associated 
management plans. 
 
Necessary government approvals are in the process of being finalized.  All required documentation has been 
submitted and is following the governmental internal process. The Minerals Agreement, which is the definitive 
agreement  allowing  for  project  exploitation,  tax  and  royalty  issues,  importation  allowances,  physical  and 
economic parameters for the extraction and sale of minerals, is in the final stages of its approval process.

21. Capital and Operating Cost Estimates
21.1  Capital Costs 
The estimated capital cost to construct and commission the Karouni Gold Project is US$73.3 million, including 
a  contingency  of  US$4.7  million.  A  further  US$11.3  million  is  required  for  pre-production  mining,  including 
waste  pre-strip  and  building  a  high  grade  stockpile  ahead  of  treatment  through  the  processing  plant. 
Sustaining capital over the life of mine is estimated at US$2.4 million and a further US$4.0 million for working 
capital spares.
These costs include all procurement, delivery and construction direct and  indirect costs. The estimates are 
based  on the  PFS design  and  are considered to have an accuracy  of +10 to  -10%. Table 21-1 shows the 
capital cost summary.

21.3  Taxes & Royalties 
The  payment  of  gross  production  royalties  are  provided  for  by  the  Guyana  Mining  Act  and  the  amount  of 
royalty to be paid is prescribed by the Minister. As such royalties may be varied from time to time. Based on
September 2014
Page 211
currently  prescribed  royalties  and  recent  mineral  agreements,  royalties  on  gold  production  have  been 
assumed as follows:
•  8% if the gold price is above US$1,000 per ounce;  
•  5% at a gold price of US$1,000 and less; and 
•  Additional 2% vendor royalties on some parts of the Karouni Gold Project.
The corporate tax rate in Guyana for gold companies is 30%.

The sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project is economically robust with reasonable variations to major 
cost and revenue factors. For example a 20% reduction in gold price from the base case of $1,250/oz still 
results in an NPV of $33.87m.

23. Adjacent Properties 
The Omai Gold Mine, which was previously owned and operated by Cambior Inc., is located 160km south of 
the capital Georgetown and 35km east of the Karouni Gold Project.
Between  1990  and  2004,  Denison  Mines  Ltd.,  Cambior  Inc.,  and  subsequently  Omai  Gold  Mines  Ltd 
completed  exploration  consisting  of  stream  sediment  geochemistry,  profile  and  grid  auger  drilling  and  MMI 
(Mobile Metal Ion) geochemical sampling in several stages around and fringing the Wenot and Fennel Pits 
and  extending  to  the  east.  Auger  drilling  indicated  several  gold  anomalies  attributed  to  the  Wenot  Shear. 
Cambior Inc., (Val d’Or, Quebec) a Canada-based gold mining company, replaced Placer Dome at the Omai 
project and, as project operator, completed a “bankable feasibility study” and subsequently secured a mining 
license. A total of 394 diamond drill holes (60,486m) were drilled in the Fennel area up to 2006. Omai Gold 
Mines Ltd conducted open pit mining from two separate deposits (Wenot and Fennel) which commenced in 
March, 1994 and ceased in September, 2005. Between 1993 and 2005, the Omai open pit mining and CIL 
processing operation  produced  3.7Moz gold (Cambior Inc.  Annual  Report, 2005).  The mill production  was 
sourced from mineralised material grading approximately 1.3g/t under the management of Cambior Inc.  The 
operation comprised two adjacent deposits, being the Fennell and Wenot pits.  The Fennell Pit was the largest 
contributor, generating some 49Mt of mill feed at 1.5g/t Au for 2.37Moz. 
Mineralisation  at the Fennel Deposit comprised stacked sub-horizontal  vein sets developed  within  a broad, 
steeply dipping quartz diorite intrusive.  The Fennel Deposit was mined to a depth of 250m before bottoming 
out on a 180m thick unmineralised dolerite dyke.
Mineralisation at the Wenot Deposit was hosted by a succession of basaltic and andesitic volcanics, underlain 
by  a  polymictic  conglomerate  and  overlain  by  sediments  variously  comprising  shales,  siltstones  and
September 2014
Page 213
greywackes.    The  volcanics  are  intruded  by  a  conformable  quartz-feldspar  porphyry  dyke  and  subsidiary 
rhyolite dykes.  Mineralisation is spatially associated with a 100m wide zone of ductile deformation termed the 
Wenot Shear, along which the quartz-feldspar porphyry intrudes.  The dyke has been dated at 2120 ± 2Ma, 
and  its  appearance  and  position  is  highly  consistent  with  that  observed  at  the  Hicks  Zone  at  the  Karouni 
Project.
The majority of deformation, which appears to post-date the dykes, has induced several well-developed zones 
of brittle fracturing and mineralised quartz veining.  These zones are preferentially developed with the dykes 
and  andesitic  volcanics  immediately  adjacent  to  the  Wenot  Shear.    Mineralisation  was  mined  over  a  strike 
length of 2,000m and the mineralised zone was up to 200m in width.
The Wenot Deposit was depleted in April 2002 and the last blast in the Fennell Deposit took place in October 
2004.    Processing  of  low-grade  hard  rock  from  the  stockpiles  accumulated  during  the  initial  years  of 
production ceased in 2005.  Over the course of its life, the mine produced over 3.7 million ounces of gold, 1.6 
million ounces in excess of the production originally forecasted by the feasibility study.
On  July  25,  2011,  Mahdia  Gold  Corp  (Mahdia)  submitted  an  application  to  the  Guyana  Geology  &  Mines 
Commission for a prospecting license over the former Omai Mine area, a concession of 7,244 acres located in 
the  central  part  of  Guyana.  On  January  25,  2012,  the  government  of  Guyana  granted  Mahdia  Gold  Corp. 
(Guyana) Inc. (Mahdia Gold), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mahdia, the Prospecting License (GS14: M-39) PL 
01/2012 (the Prospecting License, or PL), covering an area of 7,244 acres (2,931.54 hectares).
The information included within this section and relating to adjacent properties is separate to the property that 
is  the  subject  of  the  technical  report.    The  adjacent  property  (Omai  Gold  Mine)  and  the  property  of  this 
technical report (Karouni Gold Project) are separated by 15 kilometres.
Information relating to the Omai Gold Mine property was sourced from publically released documents by mine 
operator  Cambior  Inc.  and  from  final  exploration  reports  on  the  Omai  licences  lodged  with  the  Guyana 
Geology  and  Mines  Survey.    These  exploration  reports  are  available  to  the  public  through  the  CN  Barron 
Library.
The  Qualified  Person  has  been  unable  to  verify  the  information  and  that  the  information  is  not  necessarily 
indicative of the mineralisation on the Karouni Gold Project that is the subject of this report.

25. Interpretation and Conclusions 
The  Karouni  Gold  Project  covers  approximately  40km  along  strike  of  the  mineralised  Omai-Hicks-Smarts-
Whitehall (Kaburi) Corridor.  A summary of the key features of the Karouni Gold Project are:
•  Hicks Deposit – Troy has conducted extensional RC and Diamond Core drilling along strike and at 
depth to an historic near-surface resource defined for the Hicks Zone in 1996 and 1998.  Drilling has 
combined  with  the historic results to  allow the reporting a significant  low to medium grade Inferred 
Mineral Resource.
•  Smarts Deposit – artisanal bedrock gold anomaly where Azimuth discovered significant primary gold 
mineralisation during an RC drilling program in 2011.  Follow-up RC and diamond core drilling has 
defined a significant medium to high grade Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource.
•  Larken Zone - a small artisanal open pit in saprolite, approximately 50m wide by 120m in strike and 
less than 15m deep, that was mined in the mid to late 1990s.  The pit lies approximately 700m to the 
northeast of the Hicks Deposit and is likely to be a sub parallel structure to the one that hosts both 
Hicks and Smarts Deposits.
•  Numerous alluvial workings along strike of the mineralised corridor.
Drilling  has  confirmed  the  continuation  of  mineralisation  underneath  partial  sand  cover  at  the  Hicks  and 
Smarts Deposits and semi-continuous gold mineralisation has been identified along shear zone with individual 
shears averaging 15m in width. Weathered material occurs to an average depth of 35m and the mineralisation 
is open at depth below oxide material and along strike.
Drilling completed since 2011 at the Hicks Deposit has confirmed historical drilling and trenching information 
where  previous  diamond  drilling  had  defined  a  persistent  zone  of  mineralisation  extending  at  least  2,500m 
along strike. Troy has drilled the overlying weathered  zones to replace trenching and pit information  and is 
completing further infill drilling to confirm the continuity of mineralisation based on historical diamond drilling at 
depth.
The Smarts Deposit is located at a shallow artisanal open pit in saprolite approximately 50m wide by 120m in 
strike.  The pit lies approximately 4km to the northwest of the Hicks Deposit and is likely on strike with a lateral 
offset from the Hicks Deposit or a parallel zone to the Hicks Deposit.  Visually the mineralisation is recognised 
as iron-oxide stained quartz veins within the shear zone.  Assay results from the drilling have extended the 
known  strike  of  mineralisation  to  2,800m  at  the  Hicks  Deposit  and  2,900m  at  the  Smarts  Deposit.  The 
mineralised shear zone remains open along strike, at depth and across strike to a maximum likely width of 
200m.  Recent drilling campaigns completed by Troy have aided the constraint of the mineralisation.
Comprehensive  drilling  and  QA/QC  protocols  have  been  employed  by  Azimuth  and  now  by  Troy  and  the 
recent RC and Diamond Core data is considered acceptable for use in this Resource estimation.
The Hicks and Smarts Mineral Resources represent geologically well-defined zones of low to medium grade 
(Hicks)  and  medium  to  high  grade  (Smarts)  gold  mineralisation.  The  zones  are  orientated  in  a  north-west 
direction  and  significant  enrichment  or  depletion  within  oxide  material  has  not  occurred.    The  mineralised 
domains  show  variation  in  thickness  and  geometry  along  strike,  however,  the  drill  density  has  allowed  the 
delineation of coherent bodies of mineralisation.
The drill spacing is sufficient to allow the grade intersections to be modelled into coherent wireframes for each 
domain.  Reasonable consistency is evident in the thickness and grade of the domains. The authors consider 
that  geological  and  mineralisation  continuity  has  been  demonstrated  with  sufficient  confidence  to  allow  the 
Hicks and Smarts Deposits to be classified as Inferred and/or Indicated Mineral Resource.  Further drilling is 
recommended to increase confidence in the Mineral Resource.
The Hicks and Smarts Deposits appears to have reasonable potential for profitable exploitation by a medium 
to large scale open pit and possibly underground mining.

The Whitehall (Kaburi) Target is a multiple sheeted vein and stockworks occurrence over a collective width of 
400m and strike length of at least 500m represents a high priority target for immediate surface sampling and 
further.  An RC and Diamond Core campaign conducted during 2012 confirmed the presence of lower grade 
continuous gold mineralisation.
Elsewhere along the Smarts - Hicks- Whitehall (Kaburi) mineralised trend, much of the remaining basement 
potential is obscured by superficial cover of the barren White Sand Formation.  It is considered plausible that 
extensions to known mineralisation or mineralised repetitions along this trend exist and that exploration should 
investigate  this  area.    Prospective  basement  structures  obscured  by  the  White  Sand  Formation  may  be 
defined and prioritised via ground magnetic surveys which would infill the airborne survey.  More prospective 
corridors could then be followed up by pattern Aircore drilling, with the objective being to sample the interface 
between the cover sequence and basement, and normalising the results for iron content.
Many of the Karouni Gold Project tenements are almost entirely veneered by White Sand Formation cover; 
however  the  area  is  essentially  surrounded  by  alluvial  deposits  derived  from  the  restricted  basement 
exposures.  It is highly likely that additional basement mineralisation exists beneath this cover and exploration 
using the above approach is equally applicable and justified.
At present, Troy is continuing to explore the Karouni Gold Project, focusing on the shear zone that hosts the 
Smarts and Hicks Deposits as well as shear zones parallel to this structure.
During 2014, systematic field evaluations consisting of prospecting, geological mapping, geophysical surveys 
and geochemical sampling are planned to rank the various regional targets for drilling within the Karouni Gold 
Project.

26. Recommendations 
26.1  Exploration Strategy 
The  Karouni  Gold  Project  worthy  of  further  exploration  and  notes  the  project  forms  the  newest  focus  of 
exploration for Troy.  An initial Mineral Resource estimate at the Hicks and Smarts Deposits was reported in 
April 2012 with a subsequent Resource update in January 2013 and most recently in July 2014.  Troy intends 
to conduct further staged exploration strategy over the Karouni Gold Project as discussed below:
•
In 2011, a significant amount of airborne radiometric and magnetic surveys were flown over the area. 
Interpretation  and  further  processing  of  the  data  from  that  exercise  will  provide  better  definition  of 
geological units and structural features in the underlying basement rock to better define targets.
•  Further  mapping,  prospecting  and  regional  auger  drilling  to  investigate  targeted  areas  will  be 
undertaken.  Exploration will extend along strike from drilled out areas and mapping will be carried out 
on areas of interest.
•  Detailed Ground Magnetic and Dipole-Dipole Induced Polarization surveys will be completed over the 
Smarts  –  Hicks  Trend  in  attempt  to  characterize  the  mineralisation  and  develop  a  geophysical 
“thumbprint” for gold mineralisation that is outcropping and/or under shallow sand cover.
•  Detail soil auger sampling of both the Smarts and Hicks Deposits is planned with samples analysed 
for a multi-element suite of elements in an attempt to identify pathfinder elements associated with the 
gold mineralisation.
•  Scout drilling using  Diamond Core (DC) or possibly Aircore (AC) and Reverse Circulation (RC) rigs 
aimed  at  targets  within  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  area  that  have  been  identified  through  ground 
investigations (mapping and geochemical sampling) and geophysical techniques (airborne Magnetics 
/  Radiometrics)  has  been  conducted  simultaneously  with  the  infill  drilling  at  the  Smarts  and  Hicks 
Deposits.  Further scout drilling will focus on identifying new structures and mineralised corridors as 
well as targeting extensions to known mineralised zones.  
Infill  drilling  will be carried  out at  the  Smarts Deeps (Underground)  and the Hicks Deposit areas to 
further  improve  geological  confidence  and  scale  of  these  deposits  and  to  build  upon  the  Mineral 
Resource
•
Troy intends to continue a systematic exploration approach with progressive work programs to not only grow 
its resource base, but also to identify other future targets in the project area.  The magnetic, radiometric and 
LiDAR surveys should be particularly effective at focusing exploration on the identified (and any new) targets.  
The survey will also be useful in defining the continuation of the mineralised corridor under the barren White 
Sands Formation.   Surface exploration  would be scheduled to fit  in  with the exploration field season.   The 
proposed  strategy  builds  on  available  data  and  geological  interpretation,  and  should  continue  to  prove 
effective.
26.2  Recommendations – Exploration Program 
Troy has a continuous improvement program in place for exploration campaigns and these recommendations 
form  a  part  of  that  strategy.    These  recommendations  are  outlined  for  the  Karouni  Gold  Project.  
Recommendations are listed below as:
•
Infill  drilling  at  Smarts  Deeps  (Underground)  Resource  to  upgrade  Inferred  Mineral  Resources 
(7,000m)  to  at  least  Indicated  to  enable  the  estimation  of  updated  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral 
Reserves. Estimated Cost: USD$2,500,000;
•  Detailed  independent  review  of  regional  and  brownfields  area  prospectivity  including  target
identification and ranking. Estimated Cost: USD$70,000;
•  Brownfields area targets will be the focus ongoing field assessment consisting of geological mapping, 
prospecting  and  regional  auger  drilling  to  investigate  targeted  areas.    Exploration  will  extend  along 
strike  from  drilled  out  areas  and  mapping  will  be  carried  out  on  areas  of  interest.  Estimated 
Cost:USD:$500,000;
•  Detailed Ground Magnetic and Dipole-Dipole Induced Polarization surveys will be completed over the 
Smarts  –  Hicks  Trend  in  attempt  to  characterize  the  mineralisation  and  develop  a  geophysical 
“thumbprint” for gold mineralisation that is outcropping and/or under shallow sand cover. Estimated 
Cost: USD$350,000
September 2014
Page 218
•  Detail soil auger sampling of both the Smarts and Hicks Deposits is planned with samples analysed 
for a multi-element suite of elements in an attempt to identify pathfinder elements associated with the 
gold mineralisation. Estimated Cost: USD$30,000
•  Scout drilling using  Diamond Core (DC) or possibly Aircore (AC) and Reverse Circulation (RC) rigs 
aimed  at  targets  within  the  Karouni  Gold  Project  area  that  have  been  identified  through  ground 
investigations (mapping and geochemical sampling) and geophysical techniques (airborne Magnetics 
/ Radiometrics) has been conducted simultaneously with the infill drilling at Smarts and Hicks.  Further 
scout  drilling  will  focus  on  identifying  new  structures  and  mineralised  corridors  as  well  as  targeting 
extensions to known mineralised zones. Estimated Cost: USD$7,500,000
•  Key elements to be considered in planning and execution of on-going exploration work include;
•  All samples are collected by a properly maintained riffle splitter or cone splitter (including
field duplicates).
•  Zones of mineralisation intercept drill holes at intervals  without assay  values.   Twinned 
holes are required to confirm the position of the zones.  Twinned holes will also aid in the 
validation of assay results, specifically at the Hicks Deposit.
•  The  frequency  of  any  faulting  and  fault  geometry  has  not  been  defined  in  the  Mineral 
Resource  estimate.    This  may  create  potential  for  tonnage  and  overall  geometry 
variations in the model.
•  A  small,  close-space  “Grade  Control”  program  should  be  carried  out  as  the  project 
develops.  The drill program would investigate short-range grade continuity as a part of 
estimation studies and would ideally be located in areas with potential for open-pit mining.  
•  Additional drilling in the resource area may define new zones of mineralisation both down
dip and along strike.
•  Sparse  drilling  downdip has been  interpreted into continuous  zones of mineralisation in
some areas.  Infill drilling may modify this interpretation.
•  Comprehensive drilling and QA/QC protocols have been employed, however the authors 
strongly  recommend  consistent  monitoring  of  QA/QC  data  and  the  implementation  of 
inter-laboratory testing to further enhance the confidence in assay data quality.
26.3  Recommendation - Development
The positive results of the PFS warrant the commencement of mine development of the Karouni Gold 
Project.
