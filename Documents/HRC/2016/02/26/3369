<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that priority should 
be given to national and international action aimed at their promotion and strengthening, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to 
determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full 
participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its nineteenth session (A/HRC/19/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>that each State has the responsibility for the promotion of all human 
rights, including the right to development, and the elimination of poverty and extreme 
poverty, all of which can contribute substantially to the promotion and consolidation of 
democracy and constitute a common and shared responsibility of States, and that good 
governance, including through transparency and accountability, is indispensable for 
building peaceful, prosperous and democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the adoption by various regional, subregional and other organizations and 
initiatives of institutional rules and structures that recognize the interdependent relationship 
between democracy and the protection of human rights, and the adoption of mechanisms 
designed to promote it, to prevent situations which affect or threaten democratic institutions 
or to implement measures for the collective defence of democracy in the event of a serious 
disturbance or disruption of the democratic system, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human rights, democracy and the rule of law are strengthened 
when States work to eliminate discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or 
other status and when they strive to ensure equality between men and women in decision-
making, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraged</i> by the wish of an increasing number of countries all over the world to 
devote their energy, means and political will to the building of democratic societies where 
individuals have the opportunity to shape their own destiny,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the democratization processes taking place in various countries and 
regions of the world, which are motivated by the aspirations of peoples for dignity, peace, 
justice, democracy, respect for human rights and development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/32 of 6 December 2010, in which the 
Assembly decided to convene a high-level meeting on the rule of law at the national and 
international levels during the high-level segment of its sixty-seventh session, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that, while democracies share common features, there is no single 
model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region, and 
reaffirming also the necessity of due respect for sovereignty and the right to self-
determination, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Stresses</i> that democracy includes respect for all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, freedom 
of expression and opinion, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, the right to be 
recognized everywhere as a person before the law and the right to take part in the conduct 
of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, to vote in a pluralistic 
system of political parties and organizations and to be elected at genuine, periodic, free and 
fair elections by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot guaranteeing the free 
expression of the will of the people, as well as respect for the rule of law, the separation of 
powers, the independence of the judiciary, transparency and accountability in public 
administration and decision-making and free, independent and pluralistic media;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of every citizen to vote and be elected at genuine periodic 
elections without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or 
belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
and stresses that persons entitled to vote must be free to vote for any candidate of party for 
election and free to support or to oppose government, without undue influence or coercion 
of any kind that may distort or inhibit the free expression of the elector&#8217;s will, and that the 
</p>
<p>results of genuine, periodic, free and fair elections representing the choice of the people for 
their representatives should be respected by the international community, as well as by all 
parties and stakeholders;  </p>


<p>3. <i>Stresses</i> therefore that everyone must be able to express their grievances or 
aspirations in a peaceful manner, including through public protests, without fear of being 
injured, beaten, arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured, killed or subjected to enforced 
disappearance;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that democracy is vital for the promotion and protection of all 
human rights;  
</p>
<p>5.  <i>Recalls</i> that the interdependence between a functioning democracy, strong 
and accountable institutions, transparent and inclusive decision-making and effective rule 
of law is essential for a legitimate and effective Government that is respectful of human 
rights;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> the crucial role played by the political opposition and civil 
society in the proper functioning of a democracy;

rights defenders to the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
create a safe and enabling environment for their work;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the international community to assist and support 
countries, upon their request, that are emerging from conflict or undergoing 
democratization, as they may face special challenges in addressing legacies of human rights 
violations during their transition and in moving towards democratic governance and the 
rule of law;  
</p>
<p> 10.  <i>Welcomes</i> the encouraging developments in countries on all continents where 
free elections have taken place for the first time, positive constitutional changes have been 
enacted and democratic institutions have been strengthened, thus building confidence in 
representational governance and contributing to greater national and regional peace and 
stability;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> that democratization can be a fragile process and that the respect of 
human rights and the rule of law are essential for the stability of democratic societies, 
including in the context of using information and communication technologies such as the 
Internet, mobile networks and social media tools; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also recalls</i> that States are guarantors of democracy, human rights, good 
governance and the rule of law, and bear responsibility for their full implementation;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Reaffirms</i> that democracy and racism are incompatible and that any form of 
impunity condoned by public authorities for crimes motivated by racist, xenophobic or 
other discriminatory attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and 
tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts, and condemns political platforms and 
organizations based on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related 
discrimination, as well as legislation and practices based on racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
