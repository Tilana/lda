Isramco Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
 
Note 1 - Financial Statement Presentation
Isramco, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (together referred to as "We", "Our",
"Isramco" or the "Company") is predominately an independent oil and natural gas company
engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties located
onshore in the United States and ownership of various royalty interests in oil and gas
concessions located offshore Israel. The Company also operates a production services company
that provides well maintenance and workover services, well completion, and recompletion
services.
 
The accompanying unaudited financial statements and notes of Isramco have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission"). Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America have been omitted. The accompanying financial
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements
and notes included in Isramco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to the current period
presentation.
 
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements furnished in this report reflect all
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present Isramco's results
of operations and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and
Isramco's financial position as of June 30, 2016.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and
related assumptions regularly, including those related to the value of properties and equipment;
proved reserves; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation reserves;
environmental liabilities; liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts
and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results
may differ from these estimates.
 
Consolidated interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash
flows for the full year and accordingly, certain information normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States has been condensed or omitted. The Company has evaluated events or transactions
through the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially expose Isramco to concentrations of credit risk, consist
primarily of interest rate swaps, cash equivalents, trade and joint interest accounts receivable.
Isramco's customer base includes several of the major United States oil and gas operating and
production companies as well as major power companies in Israel. Although Isramco is directly
affected by the well-being of the oil and gas production industry, management does not believe a
significant credit risk existed as of June 30, 2016. Isramco continues to monitor and review credit
exposure of its marketing counter-parties.
 
Isramco entered into certain swap and cap agreements with Deutsche Bank AG London Branch
to hedge the risk of interest rate volatility loan balances. See Note 3 for details.
 
Our production services segment customers include major oil and natural gas production
companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. We perform ongoing
credit evaluations of our customers and usually do not require material collateral. We maintain
reserves for potential credit losses when necessary. Our results of operations and financial
position should be considered in light of the fluctuations in demand experienced by oilfield
service companies as changes in oil and gas producers' expenditures and budgets occur. These
fluctuations can impact our results of operations and financial position as supply and demand
factors directly affect utilization and hours which are the primary determinants of our net cash
provided by operating activities.
 
Isramco maintains deposits in banks, which may exceed the amount of federal deposit insurance
available. Management periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and
believes that any possible deposit loss is minimal.
 
8
Risk Management Activities
 
The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
From time to time, the Company may hedge a portion of its forecasted oil and natural gas
production or may hedge interest rates on variable interest rate loans. Derivative contracts
entered into by the Company have consisted of transactions in which the Company hedges the
variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction. The Company has elected not to
designate any of its positions for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the Company records the net
change in the mark-to-market valuation of these positions, as well as payments and receipts on
settled contracts, in "Net loss (gain) on derivative contracts" in the consolidated statements of
operations. Currently, the Company has no derivative contracts in place to hedge against
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.
  
Fair Value
Fair value accounting applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured
at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements. Fair value measurements are
determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements,
these accounting requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and
the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable
inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that we have the ability to access.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs might include quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield
curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and are typically based on an
entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.
In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the
asset or liability. We utilize the fair value hierarchy in our accounting for interest rate swaps
(Level 2).
Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Isramco and its subsidiaries. Inter-
company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Impairment
We review our property and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). ASC 360 requires us to evaluate property
and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying
amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we
would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the
current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at
each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the
remaining depreciation periods. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company
recognized impairment on the oil and gas properties in the amount of $583,000.
 
9
Asset Retirement Obligation
 
ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ASC 410) requires that the fair value
of an asset retirement cost, and corresponding liability, should be recorded as part of the cost of
the related long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and
rational method. The Company records asset retirement obligations to reflect the Company's
legal obligations related to future plugging and abandonment of its oil and natural gas wells and
gas gathering systems. The Company estimates the expected cash flow associated with the
obligation and discounts the amounts using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate. At least
annually, the Company reassesses the obligation to determine whether a change in the
estimated obligation is necessary. The Company evaluates whether there are indicators that
suggest the estimated cash flows underlying the obligation have materially changed. Should
those indicators suggest the estimated obligation may have materially changed on an interim
basis (quarterly), the Company will accordingly update its assessment.
 
Commitments and Contingencies
As is common within the oil and natural gas industry, we have entered into various commitments
and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from
proved oil and natural gas properties. It is our belief that such commitments will be met without a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Aggregate maturities of contractual obligations at June 30, 2016 are due in future years as
follows (in thousands):
 
Principal Payments on Long-term debt:

Note 3 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value
Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) the Company's
determination of fair value incorporates not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved
in transactions with the Company resulting in receivables on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets, but also the impact of the Company's non-performance risk on its own liabilities.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit
price). The Company believes that it utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent
in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market
corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on
the observability of those inputs.
 
On June 16, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ("Tamar Royalties"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, engaged in an interest rate swap agreement ("IRS Agreement") with the Deutsche
Bank AG London Branch ("DBAG"). An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties
(known as counterparties) where one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another
based on a specified notional principal amount. Interest rate swaps often exchange fixed interest
payments for floating interest payments that are linked to interest rates.
 
As previously disclosed on the Company's Form 8-K filed May 22, 2015, Tamar Royalties
entered into a $120,000,000 credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which facility is discussed further
in Note 4 "Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense". Under the terms of this facility, Tamar
Royalties, is required to hedge at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding balance
under this Facility against fluctuations in LIBOR, with at least thirty seven and one-half percent
(37.5%) of the outstanding balance being hedged through swaps. The notional value of these
hedges corresponds to the amortization schedule covering the facility and previously disclosed
in the aforementioned Form 8-K. Accordingly, on June 16, 2015, Tamar Royalties and DBAG
entered into the IRS agreement whereby the company hedged $119,250,000 of the
$120,000,000 initial borrowing as follows:
 
(a)    Tamar Royalties hedged 37.5% of the perpetual outstanding balance under the facility,
being an initial notional amount of $45,000,000, with a fixed rate swap whereby the Company
will pay DBAG a fixed interest rate of 4.63%, and DBAG will pay the Company a monthly floating
interest rate of USD-LIBOR-BBA plus a spread of 2.75%.
 
(b)   Tamar Royalties hedged the remaining 62.5% of the perpetual outstanding balance less
$750,000, being an initial notional amount of $74,250,000, against fluctuations in LIBOR by
capping the fluctuations in LIBOR at 1.50%. Pursuant to the IRS agreement, the Company will
pay DBAG a fixed interest rate of 0.91%, and the Bank will pay the Company the greater of (i)
USD-LIBOR-BBA minus a cap strike of 1.5% and (ii) zero.
 
As a result of these financial instruments, the Company recorded a net loss from derivative
contracts in the amount of $2,351,000 consisting of $1,701,000 of unrealized loss and $650,000
in cash settlements for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

The Deutsche Bank Facility
On May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties, a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of
the Company, entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "DB Facility") with Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank"), as facility agent for the lenders and as collateral
agent for the secured parties, and with the lenders party thereto. The DB Facility provides for
borrowings in the amount of $120,000,000 on a committed basis and is secured by, among other
things, an overriding royalty interest in the Tamar Field, a natural gas field in the Mediterranean
Sea, equal to 1.5375%, but is subject to increase to 2.7375% upon the Tamar project payout (the
"Royalty Interest"). In connection with the DB Facility, and pursuant to a royalties sale and
contribution agreement, the Company contributed the Royalty Interest to Tamar Royalties in
exchange for all of the ownership units of Tamar Royalties. Pursuant to the terms of its governing
documents, Tamar Royalties will be managed by N.M.A. Energy Resources Ltd, a related party
of the Company, and an independent manager, Donald J. Puglisi.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties borrowed $120,000,000 in its initial
borrowing under this facility. The initial borrowing under the DB Facility bears annual interest
based on the LIBOR for a three-month interest period plus a spread of 2.75%. The $120,000,000
initial borrowing under the DB Facility will be repaid over eight (8) years commencing July 1,
2015, in accordance with an amortization profile based on projected cash flows from the Royalty
Interest. Tamar Royalties' obligations under the Facility are secured by a first ranking pledge of
the shares of Tamar Royalties, first ranking pledge of all rights under the agreements creating the
Royalty Interest, and a first priority security interest over the accounts created under the DB
Facility.
 
So long as any amounts remain outstanding to the Lenders under the DB Facility, Tamar
Royalties must, from and after the end of the Availability Period (as defined in the DB Facility),
have a Historical Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of not less than
1.00:1.00, a Loan Life Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of at least 1.1:1.00, and
maintain a Required Reserve Amount (as defined in the DB Facility). The initial Required
Reserve Amount was $4,680,000. In addition, Tamar Royalties is required under the DB Facility
to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR as reflected in Note 3 "Financial Instruments and Fair
Value".
On January 1, 2016 the Company made a payment in the amount of $2,750,000 consisting of
$1,800,000 and $950,000 in principal and interest respectively.
On April 1, 2016 the Company made a payment in the amount of $3,347,000 consisting of
$2,400,000 and $947,000 in principal and interest respectively.
On July 1, 2016 the Company made a payment in the amount of $3,362,000 consisting of
$2,400,000 and $962,000 in principal and interest respectively.
 
The Company incurred debt costs in obtaining the DB Facility in the amount of $2,011,000 and
$2,959,000 in fees that were retained by the lenders. These costs totaling $4,970,000 are
recorded as a reduction of the principal loan balance and are being amortized over the life of the
loan using the effective interest method. Amortization of these costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 totaled $411,000.
As of June 30, 2016, Tamar Royalties was in compliance with the financial covenants required
under the DB Facility.

The Sociйtй Gйnйrale Facility
 
On June 30, 2015, Isramco Onshore LLC ("Isramco Onshore"), a newly formed, wholly-owned,
subsidiary of Isramco, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a secured Credit Agreement (the "SG
Facility") with The Sociйtй Gйnйrale, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender, SG Americas
Securities LLC, as Sole Bookrunner, Lead Arranger and Documentation Agent, and the lenders
party thereto from time to time, as Lenders. The SG Facility provides for a commitment by The
Sociйtй Gйnйrale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The term
of the SG Facility is four (4) years and the SG Facility is secured by certain onshore United
States oil and gas properties. Pricing under the SG Facility is as follows: (i) EuroDollar Rate (as
defined in the SG Facility) loans range from the EuroDollar rate plus 1.75% to the EuroDollar rate
plus 2.75% depending on borrowing base utilization; and (ii) for Reference Rate (as defined in
the SG Facility) loans range from the Reference Rate plus 0.75% to the Reference Rate Spread
plus 1.75% based on borrowing base utilization; (iii) a quarterly commitment fee (as defined in
the SG Facility) ranging from an annual rate of 0.38% to 0.5% of the undrawn borrowing base.
 
The SG Facility requires that Isramco Onshore hedge at least seventy-five percent (75%) of its
crude oil production before borrowing under the SG Facility. As of June 30, 2016 and as of the
date of issuance Isramco Onshore has not entered into such hedge agreements nor has it made
a draw under the SG Facility. The Company has incurred $478,000 of financing costs in relation
to this credit facility which have been capitalized as a long-term asset and is being amortized
over the term on the agreement on a straight-line basis. Amortization of these costs for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $60,000.
 
Isramco Onshore has various financial and operating covenants required by the SG Facility,
including, among other things, the requirement that, during the term of the SG Facility, Isramco
Onshore must have a Minimum Current Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than
1.00:1.00, a Maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than 4.00:1.00
and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of at least 2.50:1.00. In
addition, the SG Facility provides for customary events of default, including, but not limited to,
payment defaults, breach of representations or covenants, bankruptcy events and change of
control.
As of June 30, 2016, Isramco Onshore was in compliance with the financial covenants required
under the SG Facility.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aforementioned Borrowing Base is subject to redetermination
pursuant to the terms of the SG facility, including automatic semi-annual redetermination. The
semi-annual Borrowing Base redetermination process is underway, but not yet final.  
Accordingly, the Company expects that its Borrowing Base under the SG Facility will be
redetermined in the near future.
Short-Term Debt
 
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 outstanding debt from short-term insurance
financing agreements totaled $690,000 and $1,422,000 respectively. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company made cash payments totaling $733,000. The Company also
decreased its bank overdraft by $50,000.

Note 5 - Tamar Field Proceeds
 
We own an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% in the Tamar Field, which will increase to
2.7375% after payout (collectively the "Tamar Royalty").  An overriding royalty interest is an
ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of
production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of
the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs.  An
overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and,
accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales,
or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field. For additional information,
please see the disclosure related to the Tamar Royalty set forth in the ITEM 1. BUSINESS
section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
which disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto.
 
In 2009, two natural gas discoveries, known as "Tamar" and "Dalit", were made within the area
covered by the Michal and Matan Licenses, respectively. In December 2009, the Israeli
Petroleum Commissioner granted Noble Energy, Inc. ("Noble") and its partners, Isramco Negev
2-LP, Delek Drilling, Avner Oil & Gas, and Dor Gas (the "Tamar Consortium"), two leases (the
"Leases"). The Leases are scheduled to expire in December 2038 and cover the Tamar and Dalit
gas fields (collectively the "Tamar Field"). The Tamar Field is approximately 95 kilometers off the
coast of the Israel, in the Israel exclusive economic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean, with a
water depth of approximately 1,700 meters. On March 31, 2013 the Tamar Field commenced its
initial production of the natural gas.
Since Isramco's interest in the Tamar Field is an overriding royalty interest, there are no amounts
capitalized with respect to Tamar Field.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Tamar Field net sales attributable to Isramco
amounted to 2,421,011 Mcf of natural gas and 3,288 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.38 per
Mcf and $33.34 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportations
expenses were $13,108,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $3,277,000 of this revenue which
is recognized as a future tax credit, an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, Tamar Field net sales attributable to Isramco
amounted to 2,023,169 Mcf of natural gas and 2,743 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.60 per
Mcf and $55.66 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportations
expenses were $11,444,000. Israeli Tax Authorities withheld $3,033,000 of this revenue which is
recognized as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Note 6 - Segment Information
 
Isramco's primary business segments are vertically integrated within the oil and gas industry.
These segments are separately managed due to distinct operational differences, unique
technology, distribution and marketing requirements. The Company's two reporting segments are
oil and gas exploration and production and production services. The oil and gas exploration and
production segment explores for and produces natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural
gas liquids ("NGLs"). The production services segment is engaged in rig-based and workover
services, well completion and recompletion services, plugging and abandonment of wells and
other ancillary oilfield services.
 
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Segment
 
Our Oil and Gas segment is engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and
natural gas properties located onshore in the United States and ownership of various royalty
interests in oil and gas concessions located offshore Israel. We own varying working interests in
oil and gas wells in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado
and currently serve as operator of approximately 515 producing wells located mainly in Texas in
New Mexico.
 
Production Services Segment
 
The Company began production services operations in October 2011. Our production servicing
rig and truck fleet provides a range of production services, including the completion of newly-
drilled wells, maintenance and workover of existing wells, fluid transportation, related oilfield
services and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives to a diverse
group of oil and gas exploration and production companies.
●
Completion Service. Newly drilled wells require completion services to prepare the well for
production. Production servicing rigs are frequently used to complete newly drilled wells to
minimize the use of higher cost drilling rigs in the completion process. The completion process
may involve selectively perforating the well casing in the productive zones to allow oil or gas
to flow into the well bore, stimulating and testing these zones, and installing the production
string and other downhole equipment. The completion process typically ranges from a few
days to several weeks, depending on the nature and type of the completion, and generally
requires additional auxiliary equipment in addition to a production services rigs. The demand
for completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels, which are sensitive to
fluctuations in oil and gas prices.
●
Well-servicing/Maintenance Services. We provide maintenance services on the mechanical
apparatus used to pump or lift oil from producing wells. These services include, among other
activities, repairing and replacing pumps, sucker rods and tubing. We provide the rigs,
equipment and crews for these tasks, which are performed on both oil and natural gas wells,
but which are more commonly required on oil wells. Maintenance services typically take less
than 48 hours to complete. Rigs generally are provided to customers on a call-out basis.
●
Workover Services. Producing oil and natural gas wells occasionally require major repairs or
modifications, called "workovers." Workovers may be required to remedy failures, modify well
depth and formation penetration to capture hydrocarbons from alternative formations, clean out
and recomplete a well when production has declined, repair leaks or convert a depleted well
to an injection well for secondary or enhanced recovery projects. Workovers normally are
carried out with pumps and tanks for drilling fluids, blowout preventers, and other specialized
equipment for servicing rigs. A workover may last anywhere from a few days to several weeks.
●
Fluid Services.  We own and operate 12 fluid service trucks equipped with an average fluid
hauling capacity of up to 130 barrels a piece. Each fluid service truck is equipped to pump
fluids from or into wells, pits, tanks and other storage facilities. The majority of our fluid service
trucks are also used to transport water to fill frac tanks on well locations, to transport produced
salt water to disposal wells, and to transport drilling and completion fluids to and from well
locations.
●
Plugging Services. Production servicing rigs are also used in the process of permanently
closing oil and gas wells no longer capable of producing in economic quantities. Many well
operators bid for this work on a "turnkey" basis, requiring the service company to perform the
entire job, including the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the
compensation received, and complying with state regulatory requirements. Plugging and
abandonment work can provide favorable operating margins and is less sensitive to oil and
gas pricing than drilling and workover activity since well operators must plug a well in
accordance with state regulations when it is no longer productive. We perform plugging and
abandonment work throughout our core areas of operation in conjunction with equipment
provided by us or by other service companies.
15
We typically bill clients for our production servicing on an hourly basis for the period that the rig is
actively working. As of June 30, 2016, our fleet of production servicing rigs totaled 33 rigs, which
we operate through 5 locations in Texas and New Mexico.

Overview
 
Isramco is predominately an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the
exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the
United States and ownership of various royalty interests in oil and gas concessions located
offshore Israel. The Company also operates a production services company that provides well
maintenance, workover services, well completion and recompletion services. Our properties are
primarily located in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also act as the operator of a certain
number of these properties. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, with a focus on
properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and
exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of
scale to increase production and proved reserves, while lowering lease operating costs.
 
We own an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% in the Tamar Field, which will increase to
2.7375% after payout (collectively the "Tamar Royalty").  An overriding royalty interest is an
ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of
production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of
the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs.  An
overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and,
accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales,
or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field. For additional information,
please see the disclosure related to the Tamar Royalty set forth in the ITEM 1. BUSINESS
section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
which is incorporated by reference herein.
 
As noted above in Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, in 2009 two
natural gas discoveries known as "Tamar" and "Dalit" were made within the area covered by the
Michal and Matan Licenses respectively and are known as the Tamar Field. In December 2009
the Israeli Petroleum Commissioner granted Noble Energy, Inc. ("Noble") and its partners,
Isramco Negev 2-LP, Delek Drilling, Avner Oil & Gas, and Dor Gas (the "Tamar Consortium"),
two leases (the "Leases"). The Leases are scheduled to expire in December 2038. The Tamar
Field is approximately 95 kilometers off the coast of the Israel in the Israel exclusive economic
zone of the Eastern Mediterranean with a water depth of approximately 1,700 meters. On March
31, 2013, the Tamar Field began its initial production of the natural gas.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Tamar Field net sales attributable to Isramco
amounted to 2,421,011 Mcf of natural gas and 3,288 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.38 per
Mcf and $33.34 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportations
expenses were $13,108,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $3,277,000 of this revenue which
is recognized as a future tax credit, an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
 
Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil
and natural gas production and the prices received for that production. Our production volumes
will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and
exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production. The amount we
realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices, which are affected by
changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather,
pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors, and
secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities. Accordingly, finding and developing oil
and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Our future
drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our
control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital,
drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system
and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. To the extent these factors lead
to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods, our financial
position, cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted. 
 
18
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Our production services segment customers include major oil and natural gas production
companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. We perform ongoing
credit evaluations of our customers and usually do not require material collateral. We maintain
reserves for potential credit losses when necessary. Our results of operations and financial
position should be considered in light of the fluctuations in demand experienced by oilfield
service companies as changes in oil and gas producers' expenditures and budgets occur. These
fluctuations can impact our results of operations and financial position as supply and demand
factors directly affect utilization and hours which are the primary determinants of our net cash
provided by operating activities.
 
Isramco maintains deposits in banks, which may exceed the amount of federal deposit insurance
available. Management periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions and
believes that any possible deposit loss is minimal.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
  
Our primary source of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was cash flow from
operating activities. We continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in
light of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our cash flows, capital resources and
drilling success.
 
Our future capital resources and liquidity may depend, in part, on our success in developing the
leasehold interests that we have acquired. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures
necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the
capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be
highly dependent on the capital resources available and our success in finding and acquiring
additional reserves. Our production services subsidiary also requires capital resources to acquire
and maintain equipment and continue growth. We expect to fund our future capital requirements
through internally generated cash flows, borrowings under loans from related parties, and a
future credit facility. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level
of production, prices, amount of work orders received, and our commodity price hedging
activities, as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and
natural gas industry.
On May 18, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank") in the amount of $120,000,000 secured by the
Company's interest in the Tamar field. Interest on the borrowing is variable. The Company
entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this borrowing. The terms of the
agreement and swaps are disclosed in Notes 3 and 4.
 
On June 30, 2015, the Company obtained a credit facility with The Societe Generale. The facility
provides for a commitment by Societe Generale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing
base of $40,000,000. The tenor of the SG Facility is four (4) years and it is secured by certain
onshore United States oil and gas properties. Interest on borrowing is variable as disclosed in
Note 4.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our cash increased by $1.7 million. Specifically, the
net cash provided by operating activities of $7.3 million and $0.6 million cash proceeds from
divestiture were offset by an investment of $1.1 million in production services equipment and oil
and gas properties and restricted cash deposits, a $0.1 million investment in Apache Flats, $4.2
million in repayments of long term debt, $0.7 million in repayments of short-term debt and $0.1
million in repayments of bank overdraft.

Cash Flow
 
Our primary source of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was cash flow from
operating activities. In 2016, cash received from operations was primarily used for investments in
production services equipment, oil and gas properties, increase of restricted cash deposit and
repayment of short term and long term loans. In 2015, cash received from financing activities and
operations was primarily used to repay related party loans, to invest in production services
equipment and oil and gas properties and increase restricted cash.
Operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and
changes in our production volumes. Working capital was substantially influenced by these
variables. Fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or
decrease in our future capital expenditures. Prices for oil and natural gas have historically been
subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter
heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices
throughout recent years. See Results of Operations below for a review of the impact of prices and
volumes on sales.

in 2015, net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $3,963,000 to $7,288,000.
The increase was primarily attributable to changes in our working capital components which was
offset by lower commodity prices and volumes received for our United States Oil, Natural Gas,
and NGL sales and a decrease in revenues from our production services segment.
 
Investing Activities.  Net cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 were $610,000 and $7,956,000, respectively. During the first six months of 2016,
the Company invested $1,210,000, consisting of $156,000 for oil and gas properties, $322,000 in
production services equipment, a $85,000 investment in Apache Flats and a $647,000 increase
in restricted cash. The Company received cash proceeds of $600,000 from divestiture. During the
first six months of 2015, the Company invested $4,221,000, consisting of $1,806,000 for oil and
gas properties and $2,415,000 in production services equipment. The Company also funded
$4,780,000 of restricted cash and sold properties for net proceeds of $1,045,000 during the 2015
period.
 
Financing Activities.  Net cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities were ($4,983,000)
and $19,397,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the first
six months of 2016 the Company made payments on long term debt of $4,200,000, made
payments on short term debt and bank overdraft in the amount of $783,000. During the first six
months of 2015, the Company acquired $115,030,000 in net proceeds from loan financing and
repaid related party loans in the amount of $94,250,000, repaid short-term insurance financing of
$959,000, and paid for deferred financing costs of $513,000.

Financial Results
Net income in the second quarter of 2016 was $2,432,000 or $0.89 per share. This compares to
net income in the second quarter of 2015 of $1,304,000 or $0.48 per share.
 
This increase was primarily due to a decrease in costs such as impairment, DD&A, lease
operating expenses and production costs. This increase was offset by lower revenues from our
United States oil and gas assets and production services.

General and administrative
 
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, our operating expenses decreased by 51% when
compared to the same period of 2015 due to the following factors:
 
Lease operating expense, transportation cost and taxes decreased by 38%, or $1,421,000, in
2016 when compared to 2015 due to fewer workovers, more favorable pricing with vendors,
decreased severance taxes and marketing expenses as a result of the decline in oil and natural
·
gas prices and decrease in payroll expenses associated with field personnel.  On a per unit
basis, lease operating expenses (excluding transportation and taxes) decreased by $3.85 per
MBOE to $13.84 per MBOE in 2016 from $17.69 per MBOE in 2015.
 
Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization ("DD&A") of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is
calculated using the unit-of-production method. Our DD&A rate and expense are the composite
of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact our
composite DD&A rate and expense including, but not limited to, field production profiles, drilling
or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, and reserve revisions (upward or
·
downward) primarily related to well performance and commodity prices, and impairments.
Changes in these factors may cause our composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from
period to period.  DD&A decreased by 54%, or $853,000 in 2016 when compared to 2015
primarily due to a 2015 impairment of $33,138,000 on the depletable base used to calculate
DD&A and decrease in production. On a per unit basis, depletion expense decreased by $4.01
per MBOE to $5.29 per MBOE in 2016 from $9.30 per MBOE in 2015.
 
Impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of $1,838,000 occurred in the second quarter
·
of 2015 as a result of significant drops in commodity futures prices. No such triggering event
occurred in the same period of 2016.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decrease and payroll
·
and professional fees.

Interest expense.  Isramco's interest expense decreased by 19%, or $278,000, for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  This decrease was primarily
due to a lower interest rates during the second quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.
Unrealized loss on interest rate swaps. For the second quarter of 2016 we recorded a loss as a
result of changes in fair value of the derivative in the amount of $386,000 and a cash settlement
of $294,000. In 2015 we recorded a loss as a result of changes in fair value of the Company's
interest rate swaps in the amount of $672,000.
 
Adjusted EBITDAX.  
 
To assess the operating results of Isramco, management analyzes income from operations
before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, unrealized gain (loss) on derivative
contracts and DD&A expense and impairments ("Adjusted EBITDAX"). Adjusted EBITDAX is not
a GAAP measure. Isramco's definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes exploration expense
because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting
period, but rather is monitored by management as a part of the costs incurred in exploration and
development activities. Similarly, Isramco excludes DD&A expense and impairments from
Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital
expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Company's definition of
Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating
results without regard to Isramco's financing methods or capital structure. The company believes
that adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to incur
and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make payments on its long term loans.
Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in
assessing the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
 
However, Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Isramco, may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Therefore, Isramco's consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX
should be considered in conjunction with income (loss) from operations and other performance
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from
operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it
excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by
operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for an analysis of Isramco's results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of
consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from operations before income taxes.

Financial Results
Net income in the six months ended June 2016 was $2,016,000 or $1.08 per share. This
compares to net income of $2,576,000, or $1.14 per share, for the same period of 2015.
 
This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in oil, natural gas and NGLs prices and
volumes, and a resulting decrease in both the revenues from production service activities, and oil
and gas operations in United States. This decrease was offset by lower lease operating
expenses, production services expenses and increase in revenues from Tamar Field royalties.
Revenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - Israel
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Tamar Field net sales applicable to Isramco
amounted to 2,421,011 Mcf of natural gas and 3,288 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.38 per
Mcf and $33.34 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportations
expenses were $13,108,000. 
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2015 the Tamar Field net sales applicable to Isramco
amounted to 2,023,169 Mcf of natural gas and 2,743 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.60 per

During six months ended June 30, 2016, our operating expenses decreased by 41% when
compared to the same period of 2015 due to the following factors:
 
Lease operating expense, transportation cost and taxes decreased by 41%, or $3,237, in 2016
when compared to 2015 due to fewer workovers, more favorable pricing with vendors,
decreased severance taxes and marketing expenses as a result of decline in oil and natural gas
·
prices and decrease in payroll expenses associated with field personnel.  On a per unit basis,
lease operating expenses (excluding transportation and taxes) decreased by $6.52 per MBOE to
$13.71 per MBOE in 2016 from $20.23 per MBOE in 2015.
 
Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization ("DD&A") of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is
calculated using the unit-of-production method. Our DD&A rate and expense are the composite
of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact our
composite DD&A rate and expense including, but not limited to, field production profiles, drilling
or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, and reserve revisions (upward or
·
downward) primarily related to well performance and commodity prices, and impairments.
Changes in these factors may cause our composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from
period to period.  DD&A decreased by 49%, or $1,426,000 in 2016 when compared to 2015
primarily due to a 2015 impairment of $33,138,000 on the depletable base used to calculate
DD&A and decrease in production. On a per unit basis, depletion expense decreased by $3.62
per MBOE to $5.38 per MBOE in 2016 from $9.00 per MBOE in 2015.
 
Impairment  of oil and gas properties in the amount of $583,000 occurred in the six months of
·
2016 as a result of drops in commodity futures prices. For the same period of 2015 the
impairment recorded was $1,838,000 due to significant drops in commodity prices.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decrease and payroll
·
and professional fees.

Interest expense.  Isramco's interest expense decreased by 20%, or $586,000, for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to
a lower interest rates during the first six months of 2016 compared to 2015.
Loss on interest rate swap. During the first six months of 2016 we recorded a loss as a result of
changes in fair value of the derivative in the amount of $1,701,000 and cash settlements of
$650,000. In 2015 we recorded a loss as a result of changes in fair value of the derivative in the
amount of $672,000.
 
Adjusted EBITDAX.  
 
To assess the operating results of Isramco, management analyzes income from operations
before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, unrealized gain (loss) on derivative
contracts and DD&A expense and impairments ("Adjusted EBITDAX"). Adjusted EBITDAX is not

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity
 
We are exposed to various risks, including risks associated with energy commodity price. If oil
and natural gas prices decline significantly, our ability to finance our capital budget and
operations could be adversely impacted. We expect energy prices to remain volatile and
unpredictable, therefore we have adopted a risk management policy which allows for the use of
derivative instruments to provide partial protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices
by reducing the risk of price volatility and the affect it could have on our operations. The type of
derivative instrument that we typically utilize is swaps. The total volumes which we hedge
through the use of our derivative instruments vary from period to period.  Currently, we have no
open positions or contracts in place in relation to commodity prices.
 
When such contracts are in place, we are exposed to market risk on our open derivative contracts
and counterparty performance risk with respect to our counterparties. However, we usually do not
expect such non-performance because our contracts are usually with major financial institutions
with investment grade credit ratings.
 
We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our variable interest rate debt. If interest rates
increase, our interest expense would increase and our available cash flow would decrease. We
continue to monitor our risk exposure as we incur future indebtedness at variable interest rates
and will look to continue our risk management policy as situations present themselves.
Periodically, we look to utilize interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to market rate
fluctuations by converting variable interest rates to fixed interest rates.
 
We account for our derivative activities under the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and
Hedging (ASC 815). ASC 815 establishes accounting and reporting that every derivative
instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value.
The Company has elected not to designate any of its positions for hedge accounting. See Item 1.
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
 
In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - Other Information
 
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
 
On or about September 21, 2011, the Company's former Vice President and General Counsel,
Dennis Holifield resigned. Mr. Holifield had been hired in March 2011. On or about October 12,
2011, Mr. Holifield submitted a "Summary Report" to the SEC (the "Summary Report"), in which
made numerous factual allegations regarding Haim Tsuff, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chairman, and President; Edy Francis, the Company's Chief Financial Officer; Amir
Sanker, the Company's Asset Manager; and other Company personnel. In the Summary Report,
Mr. Holifield characterized the alleged conduct as illegal or criminal. On November 3, 2011, the
Company's Board of Directors constituted a committee of independent directors consisting of
Max Pridgeon and Asaf Yarkoni, referred to as the Special Investigative Committee of the Board
of Directors ("SIC") which was directed to investigate all of the Holifield allegations and report
back to the full board and make any recommendations, if any, for corrective action. On January 7,
2013, SIC made their final report to the Board of Directors of the conclusions and results of the
fourteen-month investigation into the allegations made by Mr. Holifield. The SIC determined that
Mr. Holifield's allegations were not supported by any available documentary evidence or by any
statements made by former or current Isramco, Inc., directors, management, or employees
interviewed by the SIC or its counsel. The SIC also determined that the Company had not
engaged in wrongdoing of any sort including any unlawful or unethical business practices, any
lapses in financial controls, or any governance issues that require redress or reform.
 
On September 10, 2013, the Company filed suit against Mr. Holifield in Cause No. 201352927 of
the 270th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, to collect damages estimated in the
amount of $1,000,000.00 owing to the Company by virtue of Mr. Holifield's actions, which are
alleged in the suit to include, but are not limited to, negligence, negligence per se, gross
negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Company. In response, in December 2013,
Mr. Holifield filed a pro se answer which included counterclaims and a summary judgment
motion. In his counterclaims. Mr. Holifield seeks to recover from the Company the following
damages, inter alia: (i) over $2,000,000 for loss of income and failure to secure gainful
employment arising from his constructive discharge or termination by the Company; (ii) over
$2,000,000 for loss of earnings due to his alleged inability to obtain gainful employment by virtue
of the damage caused to his professional reputation by alleged willful and deliberate acts of
Haim Tsuff, Edy Francis, and Amir Sanker, (iii) over $2,000,000 due to the intentional infliction of
emotional distress to Mr. Holifield; (iv) an amount estimated at $5,000,000 arising from Mr.
Holifield's claim that the Company violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act,
by engaging in racketeering and conspiracy; (v) over $5,000,000 arising from the Company's
alleged fraudulent misrepresentation regarding Isramco's purpose in hiring Mr. Holifield and (vi)
other relief. The Company believes Mr. Holifield's counter claims have no merit. The Company
intends to vigorously (i) pursue its case against Mr. Holifield and (ii) defend against Mr. Holifield's
counterclaims.
