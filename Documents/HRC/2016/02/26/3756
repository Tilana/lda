</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> all relevant resolutions that, inter alia, condemn any State that permits 
or tolerates the recruitment, financing, training, assembly, transit or use of mercenaries with 
the objective of overthrowing the Governments of States Members of the United Nations, 
especially those of developing countries, or of fighting against national liberation

adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, 
the African Union and the Organization of African Unity, inter alia, the Organization of 
African Unity Convention for the elimination of mercenarism in Africa,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
Nations concerning the strict observance of the principles of sovereign equality, political 
independence, the territorial integrity of States, the self-determination of peoples, the non-
use of force or threat of use of force in international relations and non-interference in affairs 
within the domestic jurisdiction of States, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all peoples 
have the right to determine freely their political status and to pursue freely their economic, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>social and cultural development, and that every State has the duty to respect this right in 
accordance with the provisions of the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further</i> the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 
Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the 
United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Alarmed and concerned</i> about the threat posed by the activities of mercenaries to 
peace and security in developing countries in various parts of the world, in particular in 
areas of conflict,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the 
negative effects on the policy and economies of affected countries resulting from 
international criminal mercenary activities,  
</p>
<p><i> Extremely alarmed and concerned</i> about recent mercenary activities in developing 
countries in various parts of the world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they 
pose to the integrity of and respect for the constitutional order of the affected countries,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the holding of regional consultations in all five regions from 2007 to 2010, 
in which participants noted that the enjoyment and exercise of human rights were 
increasingly impeded by the emergence of several new challenges and trends relating to 
mercenaries or their activities and by the role played by private military and security 
companies registered, operating or recruiting personnel in each region, and expressing its 
appreciation to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
its support for the holding of those consultations, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or mercenary-related 
activities are used or the form they take to acquire a semblance of legitimacy, they are a 
threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples and an obstacle to the 
enjoyment of human rights by peoples,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the use of mercenaries and their recruitment, financing, 
protection and training are causes for grave concern to all States and violate the purposes 
and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that armed conflicts, terrorism, arms trafficking and covert 
operations by third Powers, inter alia, encourage the demand for mercenaries on the global 
market;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> <i>once again</i> all States to take the necessary steps and to exercise the 
utmost vigilance against the menace posed by the activities of mercenaries, and to take 
legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under their control, 
as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly, financing, training, 
protection and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed to impede the 
right to self-determination, to overthrow the Government of any State or to dismember or 
impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and 
independent States conducting themselves in compliance with the right of peoples to self-
determination;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> all States to exercise the utmost vigilance against any kind of 
recruitment, training, hiring or financing of mercenaries by private companies offering 
international military consultancy and security services, and to impose a specific ban on 
such companies intervening in armed conflicts or actions to destabilize constitutional 
regimes;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States that import the military assistance, consultancy and 
security services provided by private companies to establish regulatory national 
mechanisms for the registering and licensing of those companies in order to ensure that </p>


<p>imported services provided by those private companies neither impede the enjoyment of 
human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> its utmost concern about the impact of the activities of private 
military and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular when 
operating in armed conflicts, and notes that private military and security companies and 
their personnel are rarely held accountable for violations of human rights;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet become parties to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries to 
consider taking the necessary action to do so;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the cooperation extended by those countries that received a visit by 
the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, and the adoption by 
some States of national legislation that restricts the recruitment, assembly, financing, 
training and transit of mercenaries; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Invites</i> States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement 
whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Condemns</i> mercenary activities in developing countries in various parts of the 
world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they pose to the integrity of and 
respect for the constitutional order of these countries and the exercise of the right to self-
determination of their peoples, and stresses the importance for the Working Group of 
looking into sources and root causes, as well as the political motivations of mercenaries and 
for mercenary-related activities;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community and all States, in accordance with 
their obligations under international law, to cooperate with and assist the judicial 
prosecution of those accused of mercenary activities in transparent, open and fair trials;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Acknowledges</i> with appreciation the work and contributions made by the 
Working Group, and takes note of its latest report;1  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Takes note </i>of the summary of the first session of the open-ended 
intergovernmental working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an international 
regulatory framework on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of 
private military and security companies, and expresses satisfaction at the participation of 
experts, including of the members of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries, as 
resource persons at the above-mentioned session, and requests the Working Group and 
other experts to continue to do so; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recommends</i> that all Member States, including those confronted with the 
phenomenon of private military and security companies, as contracting States, States of 
operations, home States or States whose nationals are employed to work for a private 
military or security company contribute to the work of the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an international regulatory 
framework on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military 
and security companies, taking into account the work done by the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to continue the work already done by previous 
special rapporteurs on the strengthening of the international legal framework for the 
prevention and sanction of the recruitment, use, financing and training of mercenaries, 
</p>

<p>taking into account the proposal for a new legal definition of a mercenary drafted by the 
Special Rapporteur in his report submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its 
sixtieth session;<footnote name="2">See E/CN.4/2004/15. </footnote> 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Reiterates</i> its requests to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, as a matter of priority, to publicize the adverse effects of 
the activities of mercenaries and private companies offering military assistance, 
consultancy and other military and security-related services on the international market on 
the right of peoples to self-determination and, when requested and where necessary, to 
render advisory services to States that are affected by those activities;  
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to continue to monitor mercenaries and 
mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations, including private military 
and security companies, in different parts of the world, including instances of protection 
provided by Governments to individuals involved in mercenary activities;   
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Also requests</i> the Working Group to continue to study and identify sources 
and causes, emerging issues, manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or 
mercenary-related activities and their impact on human rights, particularly on the right of 
peoples to self-determination;   
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Urges</i> all States to cooperate fully with the Working Group in the fulfilment 
of its mandate; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide the 
Working Group with all the assistance and support necessary for the fulfilment of its 
mandate, both professional and financial, including through the promotion of cooperation 
between the Working Group and other components of the United Nations system that deal 
with countering mercenary-related activities, in order to meet the demands of its current 
and future activities;  
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to consult States, intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations and other relevant actors of civil society in the implementation 
of the present resolution, and to report its findings on the use of mercenaries as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination to the General Assembly at its sixty-seven session and to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-first session;
