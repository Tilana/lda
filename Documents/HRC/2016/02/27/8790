<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred 
Nowak</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment gives an overview of the mandate and his activities, and 
the main observations he has made over five years of fact-finding and research. His global 
assessment is based on a detailed study of the phenomena of torture, cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including an assessment of conditions of detention, in 
the world today, contained in document A/HRC/13/39/Add.5. Based on the study, he 
observes that torture remains a global phenomenon and is practised widely in many 
countries, the major structural reason being the malfunctioning of the administration of 
justice and, consequently the lack of respect for safeguards. Moreover, he maintains that, in 
practice, most States parties to the Convention against Torture have failed to fulfil their 
obligations, such as criminalizing torture, investigating allegations, prosecuting 
perpetrators and providing redress for victims of torture. He further holds that, in many 
countries, conditions of detention in police custody, pretrial detention, other detention 
facilities and sometimes correctional institutions for convicted prisoners, amount to 
inhuman or degrading treatment: detainees, whether deprived of their liberty for justified or 
less justified reasons, belong to the most vulnerable and forgotten sectors of our societies. 
He also recalls that other forms of widespread cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment include corporal punishment and excessive police violence during arrest, in 
reacting to demonstrations and political gatherings, combating riots and similar law 
enforcement activities. States also do not live up to the standard of due diligence required 
by the obligation not to commit torture by acquiescence when combating torture and ill-
treatment by private actors, including harmful traditional practices, such as female genital 
mutilation, domestic violence and trafficking in human beings, notably of women and 
children.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report, the fourth by the current mandate holder, is submitted in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 8/8. 
</p>
<p>2. The summary of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 15 December 
2008 to 18 December 2009 and the replies received thereto from Governments by 31 
December 2009 are contained in document A/HRC/13/39/Add.1. Document 
A/HRC/13/39/Add.6 contains a summary of the information provided by Governments and 
non-governmental sources on implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur and his predecessors following country visits. Documents A/HRC/13/39/Add.2, 
3 and 4 are reports of country visits to Uruguay, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea, 
respectively. Document A/HRC/13/39/Add.7 is a preliminary note on the visit to Jamaica, 
while document A/HRC/13/39/Add.5 contains a study of the phenomena of torture, cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including an assessment of conditions of 
detention, in the world today. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>3. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Council to his fifth interim report 
to the General Assembly (A/64/215), in which he described his activities for the period 
January to July 2009.1 He also informs the Council of the key activities undertaken since 
the submission of that report to the General Assembly on 3 August 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications concerning human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the period from 15 December 2008 to 18 December 2009, the Special 
Rapporteur sent 70 letters of allegations of torture to 38 Governments and 175 urgent 
appeals to 59 Governments on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other 
forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur undertook visits to Uruguay and Kazakhstan. In the 
period since the submission of his report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur 
has received invitations from Papua New Guinea and Jamaica. He had been scheduled to 
conduct a visit to Zimbabwe from 28 October to 4 November 2009; however, the mission 
was postponed by the Government on 26 October 2009. Cuba had also issued an invitation 
to the Special Rapporteur for 2009, but the visit was postponed at a very late stage, 
meaning that the Special Rapporteur could not undertake any country visits during the 
second half of the year. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pending requests 
</b></p>
<p>6. In November 2009, the Special Rapporteur renewed requests for invitations from the 
following States: Algeria (request first made in 1997); Afghanistan (2005); Belarus (2005); 
Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (2005); C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (2005); Egypt (1996); Eritrea (2005); 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

 Since the submission of his report to the seventh session of the Human Rights Council (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/44 and addenda). </p>

and Yemen (2005). He regrets that some of these requests are long-standing. Another 
outstanding request is with Iraq (2005). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Highlights of key presentations and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 4 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur gave a lecture on the prevention and 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in 
Belgrade, organized by the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights, together with the 
Ombudsperson and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Mission to 
Serbia. 
</p>
<p>8. On 14&#8211;16 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur conducted a workshop in 
Chisinau for the country&#8217;s national preventive mechanism, organized by the United Nations 
Development Programme and the European Union. On 15 September 2009, he gave the 
keynote speech on &#8220;Domestic Violence, a serious breach of human rights&#8221;, during a 
training session for judges and attorneys organized by the Ministry of Justice of the 
Republic of Moldova. On 16 September 2009, as part of a round table organized by the 
United Nations Development Programme, the European Union and the Government of 
Moldova entitled &#8220;Towards an adequate remedy framework for torture and other extreme 
abuses of human rights in Moldova&#8221;, he made a presentation on his 2009 report on 
Moldova, which examined issues, follow-up and remedy for torture and torture-related 
violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. On 5 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote speech at the &#8220;The War 
on Words&#8221; Conference on terrorism, media and the law, organized by the International 
Press Institute and the Center for International Legal Studies in Vienna. 
</p>
<p>10. From 29 to 30 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur, along with the other special 
procedures mandate holders involved in the joint global study on secret detention, 
participated in informal consultations in Geneva (A/HRC/13/42). 
</p><p>11. On 8 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur met with a delegation from the 
Armenian national preventive mechanism in Vienna. 
</p>
<p>12. On 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion on 
&#8220;A united front against torture: Challenges and the way forward&#8221;, organized by the 
Permanent Mission of Denmark and the Association for the Prevention of Torture in New 
York, and met with the Deputy Head of the Permanent Mission of Zimbabwe to the United 
Nations. 
</p>
<p>13. On 6 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur acted as general rapporteur at the joint 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Association for the Prevention of 
Torture conference on new partnerships for the prevention of torture in Europe, in 
Strasbourg, France. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur gave a speech during the conference on the theme &#8220;Beyond 
torture: Establishing an acceptable framework for the fight against international terrorism&#8221;, 
held on 12 and 13 November 2009 and organized by Reprieve and the Institute for Strategic 
Dialogue in London. 
</p>
<p>15. On 30 November and 1 December, the Special Rapporteur participated in round-
table discussions and workshops on the prevention of torture and ill-treatment in Port 
Moresby. He also met with Government officials in order to discuss the future visit to 
Papua New Guinea. </p>


<p>GE.10-10042 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>16. From 14 to 17 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur travelled to Hong Kong, 
China, where he gave two lectures on the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the principle of non-refoulement, as 
part of the training programme for lawyers on Convention against Torture claims and 
refugee law organized by the Academy of Law and the Law Society of Hong Kong. He also 
gave a lecture on &#8220;The odyssey of a Special Rapporteur: Impact of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on domestic administration of justice in the Asia-
Pacific region&#8221; at the Department of Justice and a presentation on the Convention against 
Torture and the Covenant, as part of a training workshop for decision makers that was 
organized by the Security Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Press statements 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 13 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with three other mandate 
holders, issued a statement expressing serious concern over reports of detainees being 
subjected to torture and harsh interrogations to obtain confessions, which were later used in 
a trial in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>18. On 2 October 2009, jointly with other special procedures mandate holders, the 
Special Rapporteur issued a statement expressing serious concern about the human rights 
violations in Honduras resulting from the events that took place in the country since the 
return of deposed President Jos&#233; Manuel Zelaya. 
</p>
<p>19. On 28 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur issued a statement in Johannesburg on 
the last-minute postponement of his visit to Zimbabwe. He welcomed the Southern African 
Development Community initiative and efforts to resolve the political crisis in the country 
and called upon the Government to allow the visit to go ahead, albeit in a modified form. 
On the explicit invitation of the Prime Minister, he travelled to Zimbabwe but was denied 
entry and held at Harare Airport overnight. Upon returning to Johannesburg, he issued 
another press statement, expressing his regret over his treatment by the Government. 
Despite recent, credible allegations of torture and ill-treatment, the visit unfortunately could 
not take place. 
</p>
<p>20. On 10 December 2008, on the occasion of the anniversary of the adoption of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and together with other special procedures mandate 
holders, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint statement calling for stronger global 
commitments and more determined action to defeat discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture and State cooperation 
</b>21. Within the United Nations, human rights have been promoted and protected through 
cooperation between four main types of actors: States, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), independent experts and the United Nations Secretariat. 
22. Formally speaking, States are the most important actors. Only States are members of 
the United Nations and its decision-making bodies. They also bear the primary 
responsibility for implementing international human rights standards and, at the same time, 
are the main perpetrators of human rights violations; no State is immune from violating 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>23. Civil society is one of the main sources of information about the factual situation of 
human rights implementation in all countries. By allowing international NGOs to actively 
participate, speak and distribute written reports in the former Commission on Human </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10042 
</p>
<p>Rights and present Human Rights Council, the United Nations has significantly enhanced 
the objectivity of the international human rights discourse. 
</p><p>24. Independent experts have played an increasingly active role within the human rights 
system of the United Nations since the late 1960s. They make up the human rights treaty 
bodies entrusted with the monitoring of States parties&#8217; compliance with their respective 
treaty obligations. In parallel, on the basis of Economic and Social Council Resolution 1235 
(XLII) of 1967, the former Commission on Human Rights entrusted working groups and 
later individual experts to investigate the overall human rights situation in those States 
particularly criticized for gross and systematic violations of human rights (country-specific 
mandates). The Special Rapporteur on Torture was established in 1985 as the third thematic 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>25. The tasks of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture are manifold and, 
besides the key areas outlined below, include a variety of awareness-raising activities done, 
for example, via the media. 
</p>
<p>26. Despite the considerable constraints in terms of time and resources, the Special 
Rapporteur feels that he is able to provide a fairly comprehensive study of the phenomena 
of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including an assessment of 
conditions of detention, in the world today (contained in A/HRC/13/40/Add. 5). Although 
in total he has visited less than 10 per cent of all Member States, many problems found in 
the countries visited are similar and follow a certain pattern, which allows the Special 
Rapporteur to draw general conclusions. 
</p>
<p>27. The present report builds on the analysis contained in the study, which is primarily 
based on the experience gained during country visits. The Special Rapporteur would 
therefore like to thank all the Governments that had invited him to carry out fact-finding 
missions and facilitated them by providing information and support. Secondly, he is 
grateful to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva for 
supporting his mandate most effectively and providing him with highly motivated and 
professional staff. Thirdly, without the effective support and cooperation of a considerable 
number of international and domestic NGOs, as well as courageous human rights defenders 
in many countries, it would have been impossible either to regularly send allegation letters 
and urgent appeals to Governments or carry out highly difficult and complex fact-finding 
missions in all regions. Fourthly, he wishes to thank the Governments of Austria, 
Switzerland, Liechtenstein and other donors for their support of a remarkable team of 
highly professional and dedicated human rights experts at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute 
of Human Rights at the University of Vienna. Lastly, he is impressed by the courage of so 
many victims and witnesses, both inside and outside detention, who provided him with 
information about prison conditions and detailed accounts of their own suffering at the 
hands of ruthless torturers and their superiors in too many countries. Many of these 
courageous individuals, despite the major concern that the protection that the Special 
Rapporteur &#8212; and the United Nations &#8212; could give is regrettably very limited, took the 
risk to provide him with the information necessary to carry out his mandate and inform the 
United Nations about the reality of torture and ill-treatment around the world. 
</p>
<p>28. The reality is alarming. Despite the fact that torture constitutes one of the most 
brutal attacks on human dignity and one of the most serious human rights crimes &#8212; and 
notwithstanding the absolute prohibition of torture and ill-treatment even in the most 
exceptional circumstances, such as war, internal disturbances and terrorism &#8212; torture and 
ill-treatment are widespread practices in the majority of the countries. No society is 
immune from torture, but, in many societies, torture is practised on a daily basis, both as a 
means to fight ordinary crime and in combating terrorism, extremism or similar politically 
motivated offences. In addition, conditions of detention are appalling in the vast majority of 
countries and must often be qualified as cruel, inhuman or degrading. Whether convicted </p>


<p>GE.10-10042 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>criminals, suspects in police custody or accused in pretrial detention, illegal migrants and 
asylum-seekers in detention pending deportation, patients in psychiatric hospitals or 
children in closed institutions, detainees are among the most vulnerable and forgotten 
human beings in our societies. As soon as people are locked up, whether for justified or less 
justified reasons, society loses interest in their fate. One of the oldest stereotypes of modern 
societies is that those who are in detention must have done something wrong: an attitude 
which totally overlooks the fact that the criminal justice systems in most countries do not 
function properly, and detainees often have no effective access to any independent judicial 
review of their detention (habeas corpus) and similar complaints and control mechanisms. 
Prison walls and fences lock people up and society out. Because of punitive justice systems, 
detainees have very little contact with the outside world, and society has no interest in the 
fate of detainees. Prison conditions seem to be one of the last taboos, even in so-called 
&#8220;open societies&#8221;. Another challenge that accompanied the Special Rapporteur throughout 
his tenure was the manifold attempts by a number of States to undermine or weaken the 
absolute prohibition of torture with reference to the need to counter terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the last five years, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken 15 fact-finding 
missions to Georgia (including Abkhazia and South Ossetia), Mongolia, Nepal, China 
(including the autonomous regions of Tibet and Qinjang), Jordan, Paraguay, Nigeria, Togo, 
Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Denmark (including Greenland), Moldova (including Transnistria), 
Equatorial Guinea, Uruguay and Kazakhstan. Together with other special procedures 
mandate holders, the Special Rapporteur has prepared studies of the situation of detainees 
in the United States detention centre at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba, on the human rights 
situation in Darfur, Sudan, and on the global phenomenon of secret detention in the fight 
against terrorism. He also visited a considerable number of countries to hold meetings with 
and advise Governments, NGOs, victims and witnesses, and give lectures and training 
seminars. He also met with international and regional human rights bodies of the African 
Union, the Organization of American States, the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the European Union. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to States with standing invitations to special 
procedures and all Governments that responded positively to his requests for invitations to 
visit their countries. At the same time, he regrets that certain Governments have not 
responded to his requests or denied him access to their territories (see above, paragraph 6). 
Some Governments issued an invitation but refused to comply with the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s terms of reference, which meant that the mission had to be cancelled or 
postponed at the last minute. These include the United States of America (in respect of 
Guant&#225;namo Bay) and the Russian Federation. Others, including Sri Lanka, Equatorial 
Guinea and Cuba, invited the Special Rapporteur and then postponed the mission. 
Zimbabwe postponed the mission on the day that the Special Rapporteur travelled to 
Johannesburg and denied him access to its territory despite the explicit wish of the Prime 
Minister to meet him. Postponements of visits at the last minute are a considerable waste of 
scarce resources. Much time and effort had been invested by the Special Rapporteur and his 
staff in preparing missions to the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Equatorial Guinea, Cuba 
and Zimbabwe to the best of their abilities. In the case of Zimbabwe, considerable travel 
expenses were even paid. Nevertheless, the visits to Sri Lanka and Equatorial Guinea 
actually took place in late 2007 and 2008, respectively, whereas no new dates have ever 
been proposed by the Russian Federation. In the case of Cuba and Zimbabwe, these visits 
might be undertaken in 2010, but only at the expense of other missions which the Special 
Rapporteur intended to conduct during his last year as mandate holder, and only if he 
receives convincing assurances that his terms of references will be respected.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10042 
</p>
<p>31. The purpose of country missions is very simple. The Special Rapporteur tries to 
assist Governments in their efforts to eradicate torture and to improve prison conditions. 
Such assistance is only possible on the basis of thorough and objective fact-finding and 
assessment of the respective needs for reform. In order to evaluate the legal and factual 
situation of torture and ill-treatment in the countries concerned, the Special Rapporteur 
must enjoy all diplomatic privileges and immunities of experts on mission as specified in 
the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, as well as freedom 
of inquiry in the territory of the respective countries, the right to speak with all 
stakeholders, including high-level Government officials, members of parliament, judges, 
prosecutors, police and prison officials, representatives of national human rights 
institutions, academia and NGOs and other civil society actors. Most important, of course, 
are unrestricted and confidential interviews with victims and witnesses and full access to 
relevant documents. Since torture usually takes places behind closed doors, his terms of 
reference also include unannounced visits to all place of detention and confidential 
interviews with detainees and prison staff.  
</p>
<p>32. Furthermore, he is accompanied on visits by highly professional teams of human 
rights experts, doctors (in particular forensic experts), interpreters, security officers and 
other United Nations staff who must enjoy the same rights, diplomatic privileges and 
immunities. In order to document cases of torture and ill-treatment in accordance with the 
respective provisions of the Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and professional 
rules of experts in the field of human rights and forensic science, the team also uses 
electronic devices, photo, audio and video equipment inside detention facilities. These 
terms of reference are commonsense requirements for any effective and objective fact-
finding efforts. 
</p>
<p>33. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur was often confronted with substantial efforts 
by Governments to obstruct his fact-finding activities by subjecting him to extensive 
surveillance and bureaucratic hurdles, demanding that he inform them in advance which 
facilities he wished to inspect and granting unannounced visits only after long and difficult 
negotiations; denying him access to certain detention facilities; preventing him from 
speaking in private with detainees, victims and witnesses; extensively preparing detention 
facilities and instructing detainees about the way they should interact (or not) with him, etc. 
His task is to independently assess, to the best of his abilities, conditions of detention and 
instances of torture as they are in reality. All efforts of the authorities aimed at falsifying 
the situation make his task of objective fact-finding much more difficult and may even be 
counterproductive, as they naturally raise suspicions that the Government has something to 
hide. There is no country where there is no risk of torture and ill-treatment or prison 
conditions that could not be improved.  
</p>
<p>34. If Governments wish to use the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings and reports as a solid 
basis for a comprehensive needs assessment aimed at improving the situation, it is in their 
own interest to allow him to carry out his work as smoothly and effectively as possible. In 
practice, only relatively few countries, notably Denmark and Uruguay, enabled him to 
conduct his fact-finding without any particular interference or obstruction. The lessons 
seem clear: as an independent expert, the Special Rapporteur has no interest other than to 
objectively assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment in countries that invite him, with 
the aim of assisting the respective Governments in their efforts to improve the situation. 
This aim can only be achieved if Governments are genuinely interested in soliciting an 
objective assessment from an external expert by engaging in an open and frank dialogue 
based on mutual trust and respect. Governments have no obligation to invite the Special 
Rapporteur. Nevertheless, it seems that several Governments invited him for other reasons, 
such as earlier pledges to the Human Rights Council in order to be elected and a general 
political desire to show to the international community that they actively cooperate with </p>


<p>GE.10-10042 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>special procedures. Sometimes, certain parts of a Government are genuinely interested in 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, while others are not. Such half-hearted invitations 
create a difficult situation for all actors involved, since they put pressure on the authorities 
to hide the real situation and to make fact-finding as difficult as possible. Sometimes, it 
needed considerable efforts from the Special Rapporteur to break through a &#8220;wall of 
silence&#8221; or a &#8220;wall of lies&#8221; which had been erected by the authorities when instructing 
detainees about how to interact with him.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Follow-up to country visits 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has a particular interest in the development of the situation 
of torture and ill-treatment in countries that he or his predecessors have visited. In order to 
be kept informed about more recent developments, he annually compiles follow-up reports, 
which contain information from Governments about how they endeavour to implement 
recommendations. If he has the impression that Governments have a genuine interest in 
improving the situation by implementing at least some of his key recommendations, but 
lack the necessary financial means, he usually appeals to the United Nations Development 
Programme and other donors for assistance. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur fully recognizes that the follow-up to his country missions 
would benefit from improvement. However, follow-up to country visits is not primarily the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s task but that of the bodies to which he reports, i.e., the Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly. Special procedure mandate holders are independent 
experts appointed by the Human Rights Council and mandated to objectively investigate 
the legal and factual situation and report their findings. Strictly speaking, their task is 
fulfilled when they deliver reports and present them during the interactive dialogue in the 
respective political decision-making bodies of the United Nations. These bodies have the 
mandate to urge the respective Governments to implement recommendations and the 
political leverage for effective follow-up. Unfortunately, apart from discussing reports 
during interactive dialogue and using some of the recommendations in the universal 
periodic review, not much attention has been paid to mandate holders&#8217; mission reports by 
the political bodies of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Individual communications 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur receives and sends communications concerning individual 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment to a considerable number of countries on an almost 
daily basis. Communications are based on allegations received from alleged victims and 
their families or lawyers, or via domestic and international NGOs and other channels. 
Whereas the Special Rapporteur is unable to assess from afar whether the allegations are 
true or not, he carefully checks the reliability of the sources and the consistency of the 
information provided. In his letters, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that he does not 
prejudge the accuracy of the allegations. Consequently, communications forwarded by the 
Special Rapporteur to any Government must not be interpreted as an accusation from him. 
Nevertheless, since he only forwards allegations or risks of torture and ill-treatment which 
at first sight seem credible to him, he also stresses the obligations arising under 
international human rights law for the respective Government to carry out, notably, a 
thorough and independent investigation, and asks the Governments concerned to inform 
him of the type of investigations conducted and their results.  
</p>
<p>38. Over five years, the Special Rapporteur has sent a total of 431 allegation letters to 
107 Governments and a total of 891 urgent appeals to a total of 104 Governments. While 
many Governments send responses, serious investigations into the allegations of torture and </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10042 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment which actually lead to sanctions against the officials responsible appear to be 
conducted in exceptional cases only. Often, Governments simply explain the reasons for the 
arrest and detention of the alleged victims, i.e., they refer to the crimes which these 
individuals have committed or are suspected of having committed and fail to respond to the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment to which these individuals may have been subjected. 
Thirty-six Governments failed to react to any of his allegation letters or urgent appeals.2 
</p>
<p>39. Whereas it is difficult to assess the impact of the individual communication 
procedure, the effect of such communications should not be underestimated. During 
country visits, the Special Rapporteur often met former victims, whether still detained or at 
liberty, who assured him that individual communications sent on their behalf by him, his 
predecessors or other special procedures had had a positive effect and had saved them from 
further torture or similar human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>40. In the thematic parts of his annual reports to the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur has reported on a wide range of topics. 
Interactive dialogue with Governments, NGOs and other stakeholders is usually interesting 
and sometimes leads to highly controversial discussions. He had been particularly 
challenged in relation to his reports concerning corporal and capital punishment. Other 
controversial discussions were stimulated by reports on torture-related issues in the context 
of the fight against terrorism, such as extraordinary renditions, diplomatic assurances to 
circumvent the principle of non-refoulement or the use of evidence extracted by torture. 
</p>
<p>41. Some of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations have been included or 
confirmed in general resolutions on the issue of torture and ill-treatment, but his country-
specific conclusions and recommendations have never led to any resolutions or 
recommendations by the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly; although some 
of these recommendations have been taken up again as part of the universal periodic 
review. Nevertheless, better use could be made of the extensive research and investigation 
by the Special Rapporteur and his distinguished predecessors in order to eradicate torture 
and ill-treatment, improve conditions of detention and guarantee the human right of dignity 
and personal integrity to detainees and other vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>42. All the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work on the mandate, but in particular his visits to 
countries in all regions of the world, have enabled him to make the observations set out 
below, on which his general conclusions and recommendations are based (see the full 
assessment in the document A/HRC/13/39/Add.5). 
</p>
<p><b> A. What is torture? 
</b></p>
<p>43. The term &#8220;torture&#8221; should not be used in an inflammatory manner. It is reserved for 
one of the worst possible human rights violations and abuses human beings can inflict upon 
each other, and therefore carries a special stigma. It therefore holds a special position in 
international law: it is absolutely prohibited and this prohibition is non-derogable. Where

</b></p>
<p>torture has been inflicted, it is a very serious crime against a human being, who most likely 
will suffer from its consequences for the rest of his or her life, either physically or mentally. 
According to the definition contained in the Convention against Torture, four elements are 
needed in order for an act to be qualified as torture: firstly, an act inflicting severe pain or 
suffering, whether physical or mental; secondly, the element of intent; thirdly, the specific 
purpose; and lastly, the involvement of a State official, at least by acquiescence.  
</p>
<p>44. Only acts which cause severe pain or suffering qualify as torture. Severity does not 
have to be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as 
organ failure, impairment of bodily functions or even death.3 Another element which 
distinguishes torture from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is the 
powerlessness of the victim. Torture is predominantly inflicted on persons deprived of their 
liberty in any context and therefore rendered particularly vulnerable to abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Context that allows torture to happen </b></p>
<p><b> 1. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>45. The magnitude of impunity has been one of &#8212; if not the most &#8212; disappointing 
findings of his tenure as Special Rapporteur. Impunity is almost total in most countries he 
has visited, despite undeniable, sometimes routine, widespread or even systematic practices 
of torture and in contravention of the clear obligation under the Convention against Torture 
to hold perpetrators of torture accountable under criminal law. As soon as there is a 
suspicion of torture or an explicit allegation, a thorough investigation should be initiated 
immediately or without any delay.4 It therefore has to be ensured that all public officials, in 
particular prison doctors, prison officials and magistrates who have reasons to suspect an 
act of torture or ill-treatment do report ex officio to the relevant authorities for proper 
investigation in accordance with article 12 of the Convention against Torture.5 Moreover, 
whereas the decision on whether to conduct an investigation should not be discretionary, 
but rather an obligation irrespective of the filing of a complaint,6 this is too often not the 
case. In addition, the lack of criminalization of torture and the mostly inadequate sanctions 
are the main factors contributing to impunity.  
</p>
<p>46. Very frequently, national criminal codes contain provisions outlawing several 
offences which are similar to torture, such as the infliction of bodily injuries, battery, 
duress, or wilful violence, etc. While all these offences may be part of a form of torture, 
none covers all elements contained in the definition of article 1 and all therefore fall short 
of providing comprehensive protection of physical and psychological integrity. This 
highlights the prevalence of fundamental misconceptions about the elements and the nature 
of torture and a lack of sensitivity to the overall issue. Often the definition of torture relates

</p>
<p>to the infliction of injuries.7 However, the definition does not require any bodily injuries, let 
alone any lasting impairment. Injuries can be an aggravating factor, but torture should never 
be reduced to its consequences. With good reason, the drafters of the Convention against 
Torture included &#8220;whether physical or mental&#8221; into the definition of torture. Psychological 
ill-treatment is by no means less severe than physical abuse. Definitions of torture that 
leave out its psychological dimension encourage the use of mental ill-treatment and provide 
a loophole resulting in impunity. Furthermore, the insistence on injuries is particularly 
worrying, since more and more torture methods are designed not to leave any traces.  
</p>
<p>47. It is disappointing to see that the few perpetrators who are held accountable are 
punished with sentences far below what is required by international law. While the 
Committee against Torture, in its State reporting procedure, has interpreted the obligation 
for an adequate punishment as a long-term prison sentence with a penalty of up to 20 
years,8 the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fact-finding missions have shown that perpetrators, if held 
accountable at all, were predominantly punished with disciplinary sanctions and light or 
suspended prison sentences. The forms of discipline do not normally go beyond demotion, 
delayed promotion or pay freeze. These sanctions are an affront to the victims, lack any 
meaningful acknowledgment of their suffering, are devoid of any deterrent effect and, 
therefore, put further persons at risk.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Lack of effective complaints mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is unable to think of any other mechanism where the gap 
between the protection required by international instruments and the actual situation is as 
glaring. One of the most vivid, indicative and telling situations he encountered during one 
of his missions was where he found more than 70 detainees crammed into a small, badly lit 
and filthy cell, who had been there up to more than two years, and who had not once left the 
cell since their arrival. They were held incommunicado, some secretly, and many reported 
how they were most seriously tortured by the police during arrest and interrogation. None 
of them had received any medical treatment. This was just a few metres behind a human 
rights desk, which had been set up to receive complaints by detainees. Several officers were 
on duty at the desk, their workplace was adorned with a complaints box and posters on the 
rights of detainees. They had never received a single complaint from a detainee.9 These 
human rights desks are only one example of numerous utterly ineffective complaints 
mechanisms. Whenever the Special Rapporteur receives information from officials that 
torture is not an issue in their country because no complaint has ever been filed, that has, in 
practice, been a clear signal that the opposite is the case &#8211; that torture is routine and that 
detainees are too afraid or simply unable to complain.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur has ample grounds to believe that the vast majority of 
violations are never reported by detainees, including because they are often not aware of 
their right to complain. In a context of detention frequently characterized by violence and 
other abuse, it seems beyond imagination for many detainees that someone could listen to 
their allegations. If detainees know about their right to complain and the actual existence of 
a complaints mechanism, the fear of reprisals and lack of confidence in the overall 
functioning of the system may silence them. Normally, there is no complaints body 
sufficiently independent from the authority which is in charge of holding the detainees.

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Lack of prevention 
</b></p>
<p>50. All too often, the safeguards required by international human rights law are either 
not foreseen or not effective.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Notification and detention records  
</i>51. The rationale behind the notification and proper recording of arrest and custody is 
that open knowledge about the arrest and the place of detention provides some protection 
against abuse. By way of notification, it is established that the person is under the authority 
of the State, which assumes the duty of care. Unrecorded places of detention are not 
permissible. Proper record-keeping is a crucial contribution to establishing accountability in 
case of allegations of abuse.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Length of police custody 
</i>52. Detainees are at a high risk of being ill-treated during the first hours of deprivation 
of liberty. Suspects mostly find themselves in the hands of the officers in charge of 
investigating the crime of which they are accused. The officers therefore have an interest in 
obtaining a confession or other relevant information. In order to keep this critical phase as 
short as possible, international human rights law requires the minimization of the period 
before a person is brought before a judge or another officer authorized by law to exercise 
judicial powers. However, suspects are frequently held in police custody for much longer 
than international human rights law allows, sometimes for weeks or months, and find 
themselves in a situation which is generally dominated by a feeling of vulnerability and 
fear. In many of the police stations the Special Rapporteur has visited, there was a palpable 
level of fear which manifested itself inter alia in the strong reluctance of detainees to speak 
with him.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Inadmissibility of evidence obtained under torture 
</i>53. The inadmissibility of evidence obtained under torture is one of the most crucial 
safeguards in the criminal justice system. Its purpose is twofold: firstly, given that the vast 
majority of torture is inflicted in the course of criminal investigations with the purpose to 
extract a confession, the safeguard intends to remove a prime incentive for torture; 
secondly, evidence obtained under torture is highly unreliable. Declaring such evidence 
inadmissible will help to ensure that no innocent person is convicted. Whereas, legally, 
most States visited seem to comply with this provision by and large, confessions and other 
evidence obtained under torture are more frequently admitted in legal proceedings. In most 
of the countries visited, the Special Rapporteur received a very high number of related 
allegations, which were convincingly corroborated by representatives of civil society, 
lawyers, local human rights experts and others. Apart from the procedural weaknesses 
mentioned in this section, one of the main reasons for this phenomenon appears to be the 
almost insurmountable credibility deficit with which suspects are confronted. In sharp 
contrast to the presumption of innocence, they are a priori believed to be guilty and raising 
torture allegations only in order to evade justice.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Access to a lawyer and legal assistance 
</i>54. Given that most cases of abuse take place during the very early stages of detention, 
immediate access to an independent lawyer is crucial. In many countries, however, 
detainees are arrested, interrogated and indicted without having been able to access counsel. 
Even access to a lawyer at a later stage remains a hypothetical option for most detainees 
since they lack the financial resources to pay for it. Since persons from poorer social strata 
make up the majority of detainees, the inability to effectively access legal aid affects the 
majority of persons deprived of their liberty. The lack of legal counsel is in sharp contrast </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10042 
</p>
<p>to the basic principles of equality before the law and fairness. Detainees are often not aware 
of their rights, even when it comes to which treatment is actually permissible during 
interrogations. However, even in States with legal aid schemes, many detainees voiced 
doubts regarding the independence of their State-appointed lawyers or reported that they 
requested additional payment, since State-provided remuneration did not meet the lawyers&#8217; 
fees. 
</p>
<p><i> (e) Lack of forensic examinations 
</i>55. One of the major challenges when it comes to proving cases of torture and ill-
treatment is the gathering of evidence. Since abuses are mainly inflicted behind closed 
doors, victims most often have an uphill struggle to make their cases heard and get their 
complaints properly considered. This is particularly the case for persons who are accused of 
having committed a crime and carry the stigma of not being credible and trying to avoid 
justice by complaining about their treatment.10 Forensic medical science is a crucial tool in 
addressing this problem, since it can establish the degree of correlation of the medical 
findings with the allegations brought forward and therefore provide evidence on which 
prosecutions can be based.11 Modern medical examinations can help to detect injuries 
which are otherwise not visible, such as soft tissue or nerve trauma &#8211; essential in light of 
the ever increasing sophistication of torture methods. 
</p>
<p>56. As the Special Rapporteur has previously stated, the most effective way of 
preventing torture therefore is to expose all places of detention to public scrutiny.12 
However, in too many countries, no public monitoring exists or external monitors rarely 
have access to all places of deprivation of liberty, and the preconditions for effective 
monitoring, such as unannounced visits and confidential interviews with detainees, are 
often not granted. Moreover, a recurring problem faced by public monitoring is a lack of 
human and financial resources. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Remedies and reparation 
</b></p>
<p>57. As torture often leaves indelible traces on the body &#8212; or in the minds &#8212; of the 
victims, reparation can almost never be complete. However, article 14 of the Convention 
against Torture requires each State party to ensure in its legal system that the victim of an 
act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate 
compensation, including the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible. This is a specific 
manifestation of the general right of victims of human rights violations to a remedy and 
adequate reparation, as laid down in various international and regional human rights treaties 
and should also apply to victims of other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. Consequently, reparation has to encompass several aspects. What victims 
perceive as fair and adequate reparation for the ordeals they had to endure may differ from 
case to case. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, victims of torture are not primarily 
interested in monetary compensation, but in having their dignity restored. Public 
acknowledgment of the harm and humiliation caused and the establishment of the truth 
together with a public apology may often provide greater satisfaction than monetary 
compensation. For many torture survivors, justice is only perceived as such when criminal 
prosecution has lead to an appropriate punishment of the perpetrators. Most victims of 
torture are in urgent need of long-term medical and psychological rehabilitation in

</b></p>
<p>specialized treatment centres where they feel secure. The amount of monetary 
compensation must therefore include any economically assessable damage, such as the 
costs of long-term rehabilitation measures and compensation for lost opportunities, 
including employment, education and social benefits. In addition to reparation tailored to 
the needs of the individual victim, States are also obliged to adopt more general guarantees 
of non-repetition, such as taking resolute steps to fight impunity through, for example, the 
revision of amnesty laws, the establishment of independent investigation units or promotion 
of the observance of codes of conducts for law enforcement officials. 
</p>
<p>58. In practice, the right to a remedy and adequate reparation for victims of torture is 
either non-existent or severely limited, and adequate reparation is almost never provided. In 
addition, a common problem is that victims and relatives of victims often do not enjoy legal 
standing in relation to allegations of torture and are therefore prevented from claiming 
reparation. If at all, medical, psychological and social rehabilitation is usually not provided 
by Governments responsible for the torture inflicted but by private organizations, usually in 
the countries that granted asylum to the victims.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b>59. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is not only about torture, but also includes cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. During the tenure of his mandate, much of 
his attention &#8212; and many of his thematic reports &#8212; has been devoted to issues relating to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including privately inflicted violence, corporal 
punishment and conditions of detention. The following are some brief remarks in relation to 
the most salient questions arising in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Distinguishing cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
from torture 
</b></p>
<p>60. Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and relevant 
provisions of regional human rights treaties prohibit not only torture, but also cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which is separately proscribed in article 16 
of the Convention against Torture. As is the case of the prohibition of torture, the 
prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is non-derogable. 
While the Convention against Torture expressly defines torture, there is no such definition 
of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in international treaties. 
Consequently, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is commonly 
distinguished from torture with reference to article 1 of the Convention against Torture. 
However, as the Special Rapporteur has argued before,13 the distinguishing factor is not the 
intensity of the suffering inflicted, but rather the purpose of the conduct, the intention of the 
perpetrator and the powerlessness of the victim. Torture constitutes such a horrible assault 
on the dignity of a human being because the torturer deliberately inflicts severe pain or 
suffering on a powerless victim for a specific purpose, such as extracting a confession or 
information from the victim. Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, on the 
other hand, means the infliction of pain or suffering without purpose or intention and 
outside a situation where a person is under the de facto control of another. It follows that 
one may distinguish between justifiable and non-justifiable treatment causing severe 
suffering. Examples where causing severe suffering may be justifiable are the lawful use of 
force by the police in the exercise of law enforcement policies (e.g. arrest of a criminal 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>13
 </b>See E/CN.4/2006/6. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10042 
</p>
<p>suspect, dissolution of a violent demonstration) and of the military in an armed conflict. In 
such situations, the principle of proportionality has to be strictly observed. If the use of 
force is not necessary and, in the particular circumstances of the case, disproportional to the 
purpose achieved, it amounts to cruel or inhuman treatment. In a situation where one person 
is under the de facto control of another and thus powerless, the test of proportionality is no 
longer applicable. Other situations which may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment are particularly severe conditions of detention, domestic violence, 
female genital mutilation and trafficking in human beings.14 This means that, in principle, 
all forms of cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment, including torture, require the 
infliction of severe pain or suffering. This is different for the qualification of degrading 
treatment or punishment only in the sense of article 16 of the Convention against Torture, 
which arises from humiliation of the victim even if the pain or suffering is not severe.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive use of force by law enforcement bodies 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur has received many allegations of excessive violence, during 
apprehension of a suspect and during demonstrations or public turmoil, including in pre-
election and election periods. In many of those cases, people have been peacefully 
exercising their right to assembly when police or security officers violently dispersed the 
demonstration by beatings, the use of pepper and tear gas, sound bombs, water cannons, 
rubber bullets or firearms indiscriminately used on the masses. This all too often has led to 
persons being injured or killed. Of particular concern are reports of police brutality against 
vulnerable, disadvantaged groups and minorities. The Special Rapporteur has therefore 
repeatedly stated that the use of force must be exercised with restraint and only once non-
violent means have been exhausted. Law enforcement bodies shall refrain from the use of 
firearms, except in self-defence or defence of others from an imminent threat of death or 
serious injury. In this regard, strict rules on the use of force for police and security forces 
should be applied. Furthermore ways to improve the recording and monitoring of arrests 
and the control of demonstrations should be explored. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Privately inflicted harm 
</b></p>
<p>62. Domestic violence, in particular against women and children, is a widespread 
practice in most countries, and not enough action is taken by States to protect women and 
children against ill-treatment by their husbands, partners or parents. Although female 
genital mutilation inflicts most severe pain and long-term suffering on girls, it continues to 
be practised in too many African and other countries without adequate laws prohibiting it 
and without law enforcement bodies implementing existing laws. Trafficking in human 
beings, notably women and girls, is one of the most widespread and lucrative activities of 
organized crime. Most Governments seem to be more interested in returning victims of 
trafficking to their countries of origin than providing protection and reparation for them. By 
not acting with due diligence to protect victims of domestic violence, trafficking, female 
genital mutilation and similar practices, States may commit torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment by acquiescence.15

</b></p>
<p><b> D. Corporal punishment 
</b></p>
<p>63. In its pervasiveness, impact on the victim and justifications put forward by its 
proponents, corporal punishment of children in the home and in educational settings differs 
from corporal punishment that is administered as part of a judicial sentence in a number of 
States. A separate problem is the corporal chastisement of detainees as a disciplinary 
sanction that the Special Rapporteur has witnessed in many countries. What is common to 
all these forms of corporal punishment, however, is that physical force is used intentionally 
against a person in order to cause severe pain. Furthermore, without exception, corporal 
punishment has a degrading and humiliating component. Corporal punishment must 
therefore without exception be considered to amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
punishment or torture in violation of international treaty and customary law. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>64. Deprivation of personal liberty, which is one of the most precious human rights, is 
an indispensible tool of criminal justice. However, what is often forgotten, is that detainees 
should continue to enjoy all other liberties and human rights, unless further restrictions are 
absolutely necessary for upholding prison discipline or for similar justified reasons. As the 
Special Rapporteur described in his most recent report to the General Assembly,16 the 
reality in most countries is totally different. Since it is an essential element of fact-finding 
during country missions to visit prisons, police lock-ups, closed psychiatric institutions and 
other places of detention, the Special Rapporteur had a fairly comprehensive insight into 
the conditions of detention around the world. In many countries, he was shocked by the 
way human beings are treated in detention. In this regard, he is most concerned about the 
structural deprivation of most human rights, notably the rights to food, water, clothing, 
health care and a minimum of space, hygiene, privacy and security necessary for a humane 
and dignified existence. It is the combined deprivation and non-fulfilment of these 
existential rights which amounts to a systematic practice of inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment and, around the world, there is an urgent need to ensure more respect for 
detainees and improve conditions of detention: the respect shown for the detainees is a 
mirror of a country&#8217;s general human rights culture.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Non-refoulement 
</b></p>
<p>65. The principle of non-refoulement is an important principle codified in several 
international instruments, considered part of international customary law and reflected in 
international jurisprudence prohibiting the return or extradition of a person to another State 
where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would face the risk of being 
tortured.17 States are thus not only prohibited from subjecting persons to torture but also 
from sending them to States where they face that risk, or through indirect or &#8220;chain&#8221;

<p>refoulement. The sending State is therefore responsible for undertaking a proper risk 
assessment of the situation in the receiving State.  
</p>
<p>66. Although there are similarities between the two, the refoulement procedure is not to 
be equated with the asylum procedure. While there are limitations to asylum in terms of the 
Refugee Convention, article 3 of the Convention against Torture and article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights apply to every person and are not 
subject to any limitation or exclusion clauses. Consequently, the non-refoulement principle 
is absolute. While doubts about the credibility of the facts provided by the applicant can 
result in the refusal of asylum, the State has to ensure that the security of the applicant is 
not endangered, as continuously upheld by the Committee against Torture.18 
</p>
<p>67. The principle of non-refoulement has come under fire during the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s tenure both from the ever increasing tightening of immigration laws and 
domestic procedures that often only provide for superficial examinations by the authorities 
and the several attempts at undermining the principle in the context of the fight against 
terrorism (including through the so-called &#8220;test of reasonableness&#8221;, which balances the risk 
of torture against the threat to national security and the increased use of diplomatic 
assurances), where there were fears that States may use torture on persons suspected of 
terrorist acts. As the Special Rapporteur has stated repeatedly, diplomatic assurances related 
to torture are nothing but an attempt to circumvent the absolute nature of the principle of 
non-refoulement.19 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>68.<b> Torture is a global phenomenon. Only a very small number of countries have 
managed to eradicate torture in practice. In the vast majority of States, torture not 
only occurs in isolated cases, but is practised in a more regular, widespread or even 
systematic manner. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Most victims of torture are not political prisoners or suspected of having 
committed political crimes, but ordinary persons suspected of having committed 
criminal offences. They usually belong to disadvantaged, discriminated and 
vulnerable groups, in particular those suffering from poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The most frequent purpose of torture is to extract a confession. Since 
confessions in many contexts are still regarded as the crown of evidence, considerable 
pressure is exerted by politicians, the media, prosecutors and judges on law 
enforcement bodies to &#8220;solve criminal cases&#8221; by means of extracting confessions that 
are later used in courts to convict the suspects. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The major structural reason for the widespread practice of torture in many 
countries is the malfunctioning of the administration of justice and, consequently the 
lack of respect for safeguards. States are not investing sufficient resources in the 
administration of justice. Judges, prosecutors, police and prison officials are often 
undereducated, overworked, underpaid and, therefore, corrupt.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Another often-used reason for the widespread use of torture, particularly 
during the last decade, is the extraction of intelligence information in the context of

<p><b>the global fight against terrorism and the deliberate undermining of the absolute 
prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Although 146 States are party to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, most Governments have 
failed to effectively implement its provisions. Despite the obligation to criminalize 
torture and prosecute perpetrators of torture under different types of jurisdiction, 
only very few torturers have been brought to justice worldwide. Impunity continues to 
be one of the main factors in widespread torture. Despite the obligation to provide 
victims of torture with an effective remedy and adequate reparation for the harm 
suffered, only a very small number of victims of torture are able to enjoy this right in 
the country responsible for inflicting the torture. If victims manage to access medical, 
psychological and other forms of rehabilitation, this important form of reparation is 
usually provided by private organizations in countries in which torture victims are 
granted asylum. Despite the obligation to effectively investigate every allegation or 
suspicion of torture and ill-treatment, almost no country has established bodies with 
effective powers of criminal investigation which are also fully independent from the 
law enforcement officers subject to their investigations. Despite the obligation to take 
all legislative, administrative, political and other measures necessary to prevent 
torture, including prompt access of detainees to lawyers, judges, doctors and families, 
audio- or videotaping of interrogations, the prohibition of using confessions extracted 
by torture before courts and regular inspections of all places of detention and 
interrogation by independent bodies, most of the some 10 million detainees around the 
world can only dream of enjoying such measures.  
</b>74. <b>In most countries, conditions of detention in police custody, pretrial detention, 
other detention facilities and sometimes in correctional institutions for convicted 
prisoners, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. Detainees, whether deprived 
of their liberty for justified or less justified reasons, belong to the most vulnerable and 
forgotten sectors of our societies. In practice, they are deprived of most of their 
liberties and human rights, including the right to an adequate standard of living, food, 
water, health, education and privacy. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Among detainees, certain groups are subject to double discrimination and 
vulnerability, including aliens and members of minorities, women, children, the 
elderly, the sick, persons with disabilities, drug addicts and gay, lesbian and 
transgender persons. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Other forms of widespread cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment include corporal punishment and excessive police violence during arrest 
and in reacting to demonstrations and political gatherings, combating riots and 
similar law enforcement activities. States also do not live up to the standard of due 
diligence required by the obligation not to commit torture by acquiescence when 
combating torture and ill-treatment by private actors, including harmful traditional 
practices, such as female genital mutilation and honour crimes, domestic violence and 
trafficking in human beings, above all of women and children. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> In building upon the general recommendations elaborated by his distinguished 
predecessor, Theo van Boven, in 2003,</b>20<b> the Special Rapporteur wishes to particularly 
stress the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) All States should ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture 
and fully implement its provisions. In particular, they must criminalize torture, as 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>defined in article 1, with appropriate sanctions taking into account the gravity of the 
crime of torture; investigate all allegations and suspicions of torture by independent 
and effective &#8220;police-police&#8221; bodies; bring perpetrators of torture to justice under the 
various forms of criminal jurisdiction mentioned in article 5 of the Convention; 
provide victims of torture with an effective remedy and adequate reparation for the 
harm suffered &#8211; in particular medical, psychological and other forms of 
rehabilitation; and take all measures necessary to prevent torture, including prompt 
access of all detainees to lawyers, judges, doctors and their families; 
 (b) All States should ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and establish effective national preventive mechanisms to carry out 
preventive visits to all places of detention. Those mechanisms should be fully 
independent bodies with a pluralistic composition and equipped with the financial and 
human resources necessary to conduct regular and ad hoc visits to all places of 
detention (police lock-ups, prisons, pretrial detention facilities, psychiatric hospitals 
and special detention facilities for women, children, migrants, drug addicts, etc.); 
 (c) All States and the international community are requested to provide the 
resources necessary to develop national systems for the administration of justice that 
provide all human beings with equal access to justice and the right to a fair trial at all 
stages of criminal proceedings. In particular, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and 
prison officials shall be selected, educated and paid properly and in sufficient number. 
Effective measures for combating corruption in the administration of justice shall be 
taken. Judges shall be fully independent from the executive and legislative branches of 
Government and shall exercise judicial functions with impartiality and 
professionalism. Pretrial detention of criminal suspects shall be the exception, not the 
rule, and shall last for as little time as possible. Pretrial detainees shall be separated 
from convicted prisoners, children from adults, women from men. The main aim of 
correctional institutions shall be the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration 
into society. Punitive policies of criminal justice shall be brought in line with this 
important aim, provided for in article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, by means of structural reforms of the administration of justice; 
 (d) The international community should establish a global fund for national 
human rights protection systems which will assist States in their efforts to improve 
and reform national criminal justice systems, including the judiciary, prosecutors, 
police and prisons. That fund shall be financed by States, non-governmental 
organizations and the corporate sector and shall contribute to the legal empowerment 
of the poor; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Human Rights Council should consider drafting a United Nations 
convention on the rights of detainees to codify all human rights of persons deprived of 
liberty, as laid down in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners 
and similar soft law instruments, in a legally binding human rights treaty with 
effective monitoring and implementation mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) In the fight against terrorism and other forms of organized crime, States 
should keep in mind the absolute and non-derogable nature of the prohibition of 
torture. In particular, detention in secret places of detention, the expulsion or 
&#8220;rendition&#8221; of terrorist suspects to countries known for their practice of torture, the 
use of diplomatic assurances from these Governments not to torture as a means of 
circumventing the principle of non-refoulement, &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; 
aimed at inflicting severe physical or mental pain or suffering on detainees for the 
purpose of extracting intelligence information and similar practices in the global fight 
against terrorism are absolutely prohibited under international law and shall 
immediately be terminated. After all, torture, as the ultimate form of power exercised </b></p>

attack on the personal integrity, dignity and humanity of human beings and is, 
therefore, for sound philosophical and historical reasons, absolutely prohibited under 
international law even in the most extreme and exceptional circumstances, such as 
war or terrorism.
