<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Sexual violence has been a defining feature of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#8217;s 
recent armed conflicts. Women, in areas of armed conflict, still suffer sexual violence committed 
by the Forces arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC), the Police nationale 
congolaise (PNC), armed groups and, increasingly, civilians. The situation is particularly 
dramatic in South Kivu, where non-State armed groups, including foreign militia, commit sexual 
atrocities that aim at the complete physical and psychological destruction of women with 
implications for the entire society. Given the multitude of actors involved in the conflict and the 
continuation of these crimes, the international community, in cooperation with the Congolese 
authorities, has a responsibility to take all necessary measures to ensure that women in 
South Kivu are protected. 
</p>
<p> Sexual violence extends beyond eastern Congo. In Equateur Province, PNC and FARDC 
have carried out systematic reprisals against the civilian population, including mass rape. 
Soldiers and police who commit these acts amounting to crimes against humanity are rarely held 
accountable by the commanding officers. Some of the perpetrators have been given commanding 
positions in the State security forces, which further aggravates the situation. 
</p>
<p> Impunity for rape is massive. Due to political interference and corruption, perpetrators, 
especially those who belong to the State security forces, go unpunished. The limited support 
made available to the overburdened justice system raises questions as to whether there is 
political will to end impunity. 
</p>
<p> Women survivors of rape have suffered severe physical and psychological injuries, but still 
lack sufficient care. Survivors are often rejected by their families, stigmatized and systematically 
denied justice and the compensation to which they are entitled under international and Congolese 
law.  
</p>
<p> Extreme sexual violence used during the armed conflicts seems to have eroded all 
protective social mechanisms, unleashing the exercise of brutal fantasies on women&#8217;s bodies. 
Civilians are increasingly among the perpetrators of rape, which adds another layer of oppression 
for women. If the sexual violence associated with war is addressed in isolation, gender-based 
discrimination and violence endured by women in &#8220;peace&#8221; will be grossly neglected and the war 
on women reinforced. 
</p>
<p> In view of the challenges, the report makes recommendations to the Government, the 
International Criminal Court, the international community, the United Nations and the 
United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and 
troop-contributing countries. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 16 to 27 July 2007, I carried out an official visit to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo at the invitation of the Government. During my mission, I held consultations with 
government officials, including the Minister of Justice, the Minister on the Status of Women and 
the Family, the Minister of Human Rights, the Vice-Minister of Defence, the Vice-President of 
the National Assembly and members of the Parliamentary Gender Parity Network. I also met 
with local authorities, representatives of civil society, United Nations officials and women 
survivors of violence. I visited the Kinshasa Central Prison in Makala, Bukavu Prison, 
Mbandaka Central Prison and the Groupe Litho Moboti (GLM) Military Prison in Mbandaka, 
where I spoke with female and male detainees. 
</p>
<p>2. This report focuses on sexual violence used as an instrument of war in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. Given the vastness of the country, I was able to get first-hand 
impressions only in Kinshasa, South Kivu Province, Equateur Province and the Ituri District. 
While my findings concentrate mainly on the situation in these localities, reports received from 
the United Nations and other independent monitors indicate that violence against women is dire 
in the other provinces as well. 
</p>
<p>3. I would like to thank the Government for its cooperation in the preparation and conduct of 
my mission. I am looking forward to an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders on the 
implementation of the recommendations made in this report.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  RECENT HISTORY AND POLITICS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The recent history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is marked by two major armed 
conflicts, involving a multitude of actors.<b>1</b> An estimated 4 million people died as a result of the 
direct and indirect consequences of these wars.  
</p>
<p>5. The first Congolese war was an aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. When the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) took control of the country, many perpetrators of the genocide, 
along with about 1 million refugees, fled from Rwanda to the East of the country (then called 
Zaire). Fearing cross-border attacks, Rwanda, supported by Uganda, invaded the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in 1996. Rwandan troops supported a rebel alliance led by Laurent Kabila 
that took Kinshasa, ousted then President Mobutu and installed Laurent Kabila as President 
in 1997.  
</p>
<p>6. In 1998, the second Congolese war erupted, this time pitting Laurent Kabila&#8217;s forces, 
supported by several African countries, including Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, against an 
alliance of armed groups supported by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been termed the &#8220;seven-nation war&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>indicating the number of actors involved at the State level alone. See E. Newman and 
O. Richmond (eds.), 2006,<i> Challenges to peacebuilding</i>. Tokyo, United Nations University 
Press, p. 145. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>7. In January 2001, Laurent Kabila was assassinated and his son Joseph Kabila assumed the 
Presidency. In 2002, President Joseph Kabila and the main rebel leaders signed a power-sharing 
agreement and a transitional Government was formed in 2005. A constitution was approved by 
public referendum, followed in 2006 by presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections. 
Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President on 6 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>8. The successful conclusion of the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo has been considered an important step towards stability. However, since the elections 
there have been troubling developments.<b>2</b> At the time of my visit, armed hostilities involving the 
State security forces, dissident factions of the Congolese Army (Forces arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique 
d&#233;mocratique du Congo, or FARDC) and various non-State armed groups were ongoing in parts 
of eastern Congo (North Katanga, South Kivu, North Kivu and the Ituri District). The situation is 
complicated by the continued presence of estimated 6,000 to 7,000 members of foreign non-State 
armed groups, including the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda (FDLR), an armed 
group dominated by Rwandan Hutu extremists. This situation has exacerbated racism and 
hostility towards the Kinyarwanda-speaking population in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. During my visit, ethnic tensions in the Kivus reached a new peak.  
</p>
<p>9. Control over the country&#8217;s natural resources is central to the conflicts. In 2001, the 
United Nations Panel of Experts (see S/2001/357) found that mass-scale looting had taken place 
in territories conquered by the armies of Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda during the second 
Congolese war.<b>3</b> This was followed by systematic exploitation of natural resources organized by 
top army commanders, businessmen and government structures. Non-State armed groups in 
eastern Congo continue to use the networks and structures that emerged during this period to 
finance themselves. In July 2007, a Group of Experts appointed by the Security Council, which 
investigated the illicit transfer of embargoed materials in South Kivu, North Kivu and Ituri, 
confirmed that the most profitable financing source for armed groups remained the exploitation, 
trade and transportation of natural resources.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  According to reports, at the end of January 2007 at least 105 people were killed and 
</p>
<p>over 100 injured in Bas Congo Province. FARDC and the national police (PNC) reacted 
indiscriminately, using disproportionate force, in some cases, summary executions to violent 
protests by members of Bundu Dia Kongo.  
</p>
<p> Between 22 and 25 March 2007, forces loyal to opposition leader Jean Pierre Bemba and 
FARDC violently clashed in Kinshasa and Bemba went into exile. Over 300 deaths, including an 
alleged 40 summary executions (mostly committed by the Republican Guards), more than 
200 arbitrary arrests and scores of cases of intimidation and threats against persons perceived to 
be affiliated to Bemba or natives of Equateur Province have been documented.

</p>
<p>10. During the transitional period, Congolese leaders mortgaged the country&#8217;s future revenues 
by awarding mining concessions in areas controlled by the Government. In a report published in 
June 2005, a National Assembly Commission, headed by current Assembly Vice-President 
Christophe Lutundula, declared that a number of mining and other contracts signed by 
government authorities between 1996 and 2003 were either illegal or of limited value to the 
country&#8217;s development and recommended their termination or renegotiation.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>11. The magnitude and<b> </b>nature of the sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
must be assessed against this historical and political background. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  MAGNITUDE AND NATURE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p>12. Sexual violence has been a defining feature of the Congolese armed conflicts. Extreme 
levels of sexual violence, perpetrated by non-State armed groups, State security forces and 
civilians persist in those areas of Eastern Congo that are still experiencing hostilities. However, 
sexual violence is not restricted to zones of armed conflict; it is rampant in the whole country. 
</p>
<p>13. The perpetrators often belong to State security forces, including the FARDC, FARDC 
Naval Forces and the PNC. MONUC Human Rights Division found that 54 per cent of all sexual 
violence cases documented in the first six months of 2007 were committed by the FARDC 
and 43 per cent by the PNC. Members of the Republican Guard, the Police Special Services 
(<i>Kin Mazi&#232;re</i>) and the National Intelligence Agency (ANR) have also been cited as perpetrators 
of rape.  
</p>
<p>14. Human rights observers also note an increasing number of rapes of women in detention. 
During the first six months of 2007, MONUC documented 16 cases of sexual violence against 
women in prisons, police stations or other detention facilities. Reports from prisons, including 
Kinshasa Central Prison in Makala, also indicate that prison guards have forced female detainees 
into prostitution. 
</p>
<p>15. The number of rapes committed by civilians is on the rise. Some of these civilian 
perpetrators are said to be demobilized militiamen, who were reintegrated without any 
rehabilitation measures and continue their wartime conduct. Even more worrisome, the atrocities 
seem to have eroded all protective social mechanisms that would constrain the extensive use of 
sexual violence. As one woman&#8217;s rights activist explained: &#8220;In the past, burglars would rob a 
house and then leave. Today, they will first rape all the women in the house and then steal&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. A number of observers also noted that the victims are increasingly young girls. The 
Hospital of M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res in Bunia (Ituri), for example, reported that one in six 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The Government committed itself in a &#8220;Governance Contract&#8221; presented to the Congolese 
</p>
<p>people in February 2007 to analyse existing mining contracts, renegotiate them where necessary 
and create structures to improve transparency. In April 2007, the Minister for Mining created an 
Interministerial Commission to revisit Mining Contracts. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>patients (17 per cent) who was treated at the hospital for rape-related injuries in the first half 
of 2007 were younger than 12 years. The belief that HIV and AIDS can be cured by raping a 
virgin girl is one myth motivating the rapist. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  South Kivu 
</b></p>
<p>17. The situation in South Kivu is the worst crisis of violence against women that I have so far 
encountered in my work as Special Rapporteur. The Provincial Synergy to Combat Sexual 
Violence in South Kivu, an action committee bringing together dedicated governmental, civil 
society and United Nations representatives, has recorded 4,500 new cases in the first six months 
of 2007. According to figures obtained through MONUC, an estimated 14,000 new rapes were 
recorded in 2005 and 13,000 in 2006. The real number of cases is certainly many times higher, 
as most victims live in inaccessible areas and are afraid to report. Furthermore, there are 
inconsistencies in the methodologies used in recording reported cases. 
</p>
<p>18. An analysis of the cases recorded by the Provincial Synergy in 2007 shows that 70 per cent 
of all rapes in South Kivu are committed by non-State groups, 16 per cent by the FARDC and 
PNC and 14 per cent by civilians; 13 per cent of the victims are girls younger than 18 years old. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Sexual atrocities by non-State groups 
</b></p>
<p>19. FDLR and its various factions are major perpetrators of rape in South Kivu. One of these 
factions, known as &#8220;Rasta&#8221;, has proven to be particularly violent. The Panzi Hospital in Bukavu 
treats about 3,500 women every year for severe genital injuries caused by rape and other forms 
of sexual assault. According to hospital staff, 90 per cent of the victims report that the 
perpetrators spoke Kinyarwanda. Certain renegade factions of FARDC as well as armed groups 
claiming allegiance to the Mayi Mayi movement have also engaged in systematic looting, rape 
and sexual enslavement. 
</p>
<p>20. Operating from dense forest areas situated around Burhale, Izige, Kanyola (all Walungu 
territory), Bunyakiri, Kalonge (Kalehe), Nindja (Kabare), Mwega and Shabunda territories, 
FDLR terrorizes the local population by raiding settlements, looting, murdering and gang-raping. 
Women and girls are abducted and taken to the forest, where they are sexually abused and 
enslaved. Between December 2006 and March 2007, MONUC recorded 89 such attacks. The 
situation is so grave that many families leave their homes at nightfall and go to better-protected 
areas. 
</p>
<p>21. A number of FDLR/Rasta fighters are Rwandan nationals, some of whom are thought to be 
implicated in the Rwandan genocide. The sexual atrocities committed in South Kivu are indeed 
reminiscent of those perpetrated by Interahamwe militia during the Rwandan genocide. The 
atrocities are structured around rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage. They aim at the 
complete physical and psychological destruction of women with implications for the entire 
society. Women are brutally gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In 
numerous cases, men are forced at gunpoint to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters. In 
some cases women were shot or stabbed in their genital organs after they were raped. Women, 
who survived months of enslavement, told me that their tormentors had forced them to eat 
excrement or the human flesh of murdered relatives. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>22. One woman from Nindja Village described how she and other villagers fled their homes 
every night to seek protection in the bush. One day in 2005, a group of Kinyarwanda-speaking 
men, whom she described as &#8220;Interahamwe&#8221;, tracked them down. They first executed the leader 
of the villagers and later the woman&#8217;s brother, when he refused to rape her. The woman, her 
two children and about 50 others were marched off into the forest. When one of her children fell, 
the perpetrators forced her to kill her child. In captivity she was raped by 19 different men. On 
one occasion, the commander of the group forced her to fry and eat the hands and feet of her 
murdered sisters-in-law. At regular intervals, the militia would execute abducted women and 
men, after forcing them to first dig their own graves. 
</p>
<p>23. These atrocities are ongoing. On the night of 21 July - while I visited South Kivu - 
FDLR/Rasta attacked the village of Nybishaka (60 km south-west of Bukavu), looted several 
houses and abducted two women. Six nights later, 10 armed men in uniform, believed to be 
FDLR, attacked Bulwe (50 km south-west of Bukavu) and abducted four women. The following 
day, one woman was found murdered, another was seriously wounded. 
</p>
<p>24. The FARDC has carried out military operations against the FDLR and the Rasta faction in 
the Walungu area, but has been unable to neutralize the armed groups. MONUC troops provided 
support for these efforts, mainly by cutting off retreat paths for the militia. Since August 2007, 
the FARDC has reportedly suspended military operations. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Sexual violence by State security forces 
</b></p>
<p>25. FARDC, the FARDC Naval Forces, PNC and the Presidential Guard continue to perpetrate 
sexual violence. In some areas, rapes seem to be systematically employed to intimidate the local 
population. FARDC soldiers of the 109th Brigade based in Uvira were repeatedly accused of 
rape. On 22 March 2007, for instance, soldiers of the 109th Brigade reportedly raped 
a 13-year-old girl at Katongo (15 km south of Uvira, South Kivu). 
</p>
<p>26. According to reports, individual soldiers and police also routinely extort money and other 
goods from the local population. Such extortion may be accompanied by rape. On 
11 March 2007, for instance, an 11-year-old girl was reportedly raped by two FARDC soldiers of 
the 14th Integrated Brigade in the locality of Nyamukubi (95 km north of Bukavu) when her 
parents resisted the illegal occupation of their home by soldiers. 
</p>
<p>27. Individual perpetrators are usually not held to account by their commanders, who 
themselves may be among the perpetrators. In July 2007, for instance, an officer of the 
3rd Company of the 102nd Brigade based in Maturale (42 km north of Uvira) reportedly raped a 
14-year-old girl and then attempted to settle the matter privately by giving the family of the 
victim US$ 50 and a goat. 
</p>
<p>28. A colonel reportedly raped a 14-year old girl in Sange (95 km South of Bukavu) in 2005, 
when he was commander of the 110th Brigade in Uvira. Despite an arrest warrant issued against 
him in February 2006, he remained the commander of the First Mixed Brigade at the time of my 
visit.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>29. A major of the 116th Brigade of the FARDC in Ziralo (210 km north of Bukavu) was 
reportedly implicated in acts of pillage and rape committed in Lulamba, Mudona and Mutuvo, 
but retained his position in the FARDC. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ituri District 
</b></p>
<p>30. The local dynamics in Ituri have been heavily affected by the Congolese wars and the 
politics surrounding them. Long-standing tensions between Lendu and Hema ethnic groups, 
rooted in colonial divide-and-rule strategies, were transformed into a local armed conflict 
involving several ethnically based militia groups. Thousands of civilians became internally 
displaced or were killed. 
</p>
<p>31. The militia groups involved, claiming to fight in defence of their own ethnic group, 
targeted the civilian populations indiscriminately.<b>6</b> Women in particular were treated as war 
booty and sexually abused. One Lendu woman from a village 40 km west of Bunia, whose 
village was attacked by Lendu militia in January 2004, described to me how her husband and 
four children were executed in front of her eyes. She and 30 other women of Lendu, Hema and 
Bira ethnic groups were abducted, sexually enslaved and subjected to additional forms of 
humiliation and torture. When Hema fighters from the Union des patriotes congolais (UPC) 
attacked the Lendu militia and took control of the camp, the fighters subjected the women to the 
same sexual atrocities as the previous group of men had done.  
</p>
<p>32. Efforts to demobilize non-State militia or integrate them into the FARDC have improved 
the overall security situation in Ituri. However, sexual violence continues, especially since more 
and more civilians commit rape. Cooperazione Internazionale, which runs a programme for 
survivors of sexual violence, identified more than 6,000 victims of rape in accessible areas of 
Irumu, Mambasa, Mahagi and Aru Territory between April 2006 and June 2007. Another 
1,000 victims were identified between December 2006 and June 2007 in Djugu territory that had 
previously not been accessible due to the security situation. The M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) 
Hospital in Bunia has treated almost 2,000 rape victims in 2006. As high as these figures may 
appear, they almost certainly represent only a tiny proportion of the total. 
</p>
<p>33. Data provided by various sources indicates that one in five rapes is committed by the State 
security forces. On 28 April 2007, for instance, FARDC Major Komboko, responsible for the 
FARDC training camp of Rwampara (Bunia), raped the 12-year-old daughter of another FARDC 
officer. He was arrested on 8 May 2007 and on 28 July he was sentenced in first instance to 
10 years in prison by the Kisangani military court.<b>7</b> During June 2007, MONUC documented

<p><b>6
</b>  On 17 October 2007, the Congolese authorities surrendered and transferred Germain &#8220;Simba&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Katanga, a commander of the Force de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri (FRPI) to the International 
Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC&#8217;s arrest warrant accused Katanga, among other things, of sexual 
enslavement. 
<b>7
</b>  The decision has been appealed. </p>

</p>
<p>that a woman was allegedly abducted and raped by a FARDC member of the 2nd Battalion of the 
1st Integrated Brigade in Rimba, Mahagi territory. On 4 June, the chief of police in Nyakunde, 
Ituri, allegedly arbitrarily arrested a 19-year-old woman and subsequently raped her.<b>8</b> On 
8 June 2007, in Alibha (22 km south of Aru), a pregnant woman was allegedly raped by a 
FARDC member of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Integrated Brigade, resulting in a miscarriage. 
Another woman was allegedly raped by a Police d&#8217;intervention rapide (PIR) agent on 
16 June 2007 in Kolokoto (7 km from Mahagi port), when she went to follow up on a complaint 
that she had previously filed.<b>9</b>  
</p>
<p>34. FARDC has also used rape systematically in operations against the civilian population. I 
received reports that a company of the 6th Brigade had engaged in systematic reprisals against 
the local population of Jiba village (60 km east of Bunia), following armed clashes between the 
FARDC and non-State militia in the area. Between February and May 2007, at least 17 women 
were raped by FARDC soldiers. Other civilians had been subjected to torture, ill-treatment and 
looting. The military prosecutor was aware of the case, but claimed that since the 6th Brigade 
was redeployed to North Kivu, the perpetuators were no longer in Ituri and his request for 
permission to arrest alleged perpetrators had not been answered by the Commander of 
the 9th Military District. 
</p>
<p>35. In September 2006, FARDC soldiers of the Intervention Battalion of the 1st Integrated 
Brigade in Bavi (50 km south of Bunia) summarily executed at least 32 civilians. At the order of 
the commander of the Intervention Battalion, Captain Francois Mulesa, at least five women were 
raped before they were murdered. On 19 February 2007, the Bunia Military Tribunal sentenced 
13 soldiers to life imprisonment in connection with the atrocities. Captain Mulesa was convicted 
of rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. The life sentence was confirmed on appeal by the 
Kisangani Military Court. 
</p>
<p>36. Another major incident involving rape occurred between 11-12 January 2007, when 
around 250 soldiers of the FARDC Integrated Brigades stationed in Bunia reacted violently to a 
rumour that FARDC officials had misappropriated part of the soldiers&#8217; annual bonus payments. 
The soldiers looted private homes and raped at least five women. On 18 June 2007, 17 soldiers 
were convicted for looting, failure to observe military regulations and squandering of 
ammunitions. The Court also ordered the perpetrators and the State to pay a total of US$ 98,000 
in compensation to the victims. None of the men were prosecuted for rape, since the Military 
Prosecutor considered that the available evidence did not suffice to secure a conviction.

<p><b>C.  Equateur Province 
</b></p>
<p>37. Armed conflict in Equateur (situated in the North-West of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo) ended several years ago. However, sexual violence continues in the province. From

</p>
<p>June 2005 to June 2007 the Provincial Synergy to Combat Sexual Violence identified more than 
2,500 victims of sexual violence. The real number is probably many times higher, not least since 
large parts of this vast, densely forested province are hardly accessible. 
</p>
<p>38. PNC, FARDC and the FARDC Naval Forces are major perpetrators of rape in Equateur. 
Relationships between the local population and the central authorities remain volatile since a 
large part of the local population reportedly supports the opposition Movement of Jean Pierre 
Bemba. The local population is very sensitive to actual or perceived governmental injustices, 
especially if they involve State security forces. Acts of violent self-justice occur frequently. On 
several occasions, State security forces have responded with armed and organized reprisals that 
indiscriminately targeted the civilian population, involving looting, torture, ill-treatment and 
rape, and carried out in public. 
</p>
<p>39. In December 2006, a mob of 250 villagers in Karawa (630 km north-east of Mbandaka) 
reportedly attacked a police station and lynched a man held at the station whom the villagers 
accused of witchcraft. In response, PNC assembled about 70 police officers from other duty 
stations (Businga, Bobadi and Inera) and pillaged Karawa, tortured civilians and raped at least 
30 women, including a pregnant woman and four minor girls. According to the latest information 
received, the Military Prosecutor has launched an official investigation, but no police officer has 
been arrested or prosecuted in relation to this case. Several have been redeployed to other duty 
stations in an apparent attempt to shield them from investigation and prosecution. 
</p>
<p>40. In March 2006, a local mob in Lifumba Waka (515 km north-east of Mbandaka) took the 
local PNC Commander hostage to protest against police abuses. Policemen from Basankusu 
police station reportedly responded with an indiscriminate reprisal against the entire civilian 
population. Thirty-seven women were raped, including three minors and two pregnant women. 
Fifty other persons were subjected to torture or ill-treatment and 120 houses were looted. 
Allegedly, 2 of the 12 alleged perpetrators were in pretrial detention awaiting trial. 
</p>
<p>41. In April 2006, FARDC soldiers reportedly launched an armed reprisal in Gemena, 
South Ubangui District, responding to a rumour that a FARDC soldier had been killed by 
members of the local population. Ninety-seven civilians were subjected to gross human rights 
violations, including three women who were raped. All of the 22 soldiers initially arrested in 
connection with the case have reportedly escaped or disappeared from prison. 
</p>
<p>42. In August 2006, several tax collectors were violently attacked in Bolongo-Loka (512 km 
north-east of Mbandaka). Police from Botewa Police Station reportedly organized indiscriminate 
reprisals against the civilian population and raped at least 60 women, including 1 pregnant 
woman. Subsequently, nine alleged perpetrators were arrested and committed to pretrial 
detention. According to the latest information received, five of the nine men are no longer in 
prison and their whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>43. Allegedly, similar armed reprisals by the State security forces also took place in May 2007 
in Bongulu (90 km north of Bumba), in April 2007 in Bonyanga (120 km south-west of Gemena) 
and in March 2007 in Mbelo. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.4

</p>
<p>44. Equateur Province was also the site of several mutinies of FARDC soldiers that involved 
mass rape. In November 2005, FARDC soldiers who were in the process of being demobilized in 
Bokala (8 km north-west of Mbandaka) reportedly carried out a reprisal against the local 
population, after one soldier was found dead as a result of electrocution. At least 16 women were 
raped. 
</p>
<p>45. In July 2005, soldiers of the 39th Brigade in Bokala attacked the civilian population, when 
the body of a FARDC soldier was discovered. At least 64 women were raped, including 3 minor 
girls. In addition, more than 1,500 persons were subjected to torture, ill-treatment and/or looting. 
In June 2006, 40 perpetrators were sentenced. Applying the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court for the first time in the history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
Court of First Instance sentenced eight ringleaders to life imprisonment on counts of crimes 
against humanity. On appeal, the life sentences against three of the eight accused were 
confirmed.  
</p>
<p>46. In December 2003, soldiers from the 9th Battalion stationed in Songo Mboyo (600 km 
north-east of Mbandaka) mutinied after rumours that the commanders had stolen their salaries. 
They looted the village and brutally raped at least 200 women. One victim described to me how 
she was gang-raped by 17 soldiers, before the men forced her father at gunpoint to rape her. 
During the course of the investigation, victims and witnesses received death threats and had to be 
relocated to other areas. Six soldiers were eventually convicted for crimes against humanity and 
sentenced to life imprisonment. All six men have since escaped from prison under dubious 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers 
</b></p>
<p>47. In 2004, media reports alleged that MONUC peacekeepers had engaged in large-scale 
sexual exploitation of Congolese women and girls. An investigation conducted by the 
United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in Bunia (Ituri District) between 
May and September 2004 confirmed that sexual contact between Congolese women and girls 
and peacekeepers occurred frequently, usually in exchange for food or small sums of money, 
often involving girls under the age of 18, with some as young as 13.<b>10</b> The investigation revealed 
a &#8220;pattern of sexual exploitation&#8221;, contrary to the standards set by the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat, which prohibit any solicitation of prostitution, 
regardless of the age or consent of the person solicited.  
</p>
<p>48. Against this backdrop, the Secretary-General appointed Prince Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Zeid 
Al-Hussein, Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations, to develop a 
comprehensive strategy on sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations. The 
strategy was debated in the General Assembly in April 2005 and a number of Prince Zeid&#8217;s

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>recommendations have since been adopted. In July 2007, the General Assembly recommended 
that standards of conduct, including standards on sexual exploitation, be included in the revised 
draft model memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and troop-contributing 
countries.  
</p>
<p>49. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations also established a Conduct and Discipline 
Team within MONUC to provide advice on disciplinary issues, raise awareness and channel 
reported cases of serious misconduct to OIOS. In addition, a night curfew was imposed and 
certain localities were declared out of bounds for peacekeepers.  
</p>
<p>50. Despite these positive measures, sexual exploitation and abuse within MONUC remains a 
serious concern. The United Nations recorded 176 allegations in 2006 in which MONUC 
personnel were accused of having engaged in sexual exploitation or abuse.<b>11</b> While a number of 
these allegations may eventually prove to be unsubstantiated, reports received from Congolese 
non-governmental organizations, United Nations staff members and individual victims indicate 
that cases of sexual abuse of minor girls and solicitation for prostitution continue to occur. 
</p>
<p>51. Some troop contingents still fail to address allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse 
with due diligence. In some instances, they even attempt to cover up cases. In February 2007, 
OIOS reported that it had substantiated allegations that a military contingent member of 
MONUC had sexually abused an under-age girl, which resulted in the birth of a child.<b>12</b> OIOS 
also investigated similar allegations involving another girl and a member of the same military 
contingent; this allegation could not be substantiated because the alleged victim could not be 
located. In both cases the Commander of the respective military contingent had provided 
subsistence support to the families of the girls for more than seven months, presumably to 
prevent them from complaining.  
</p>
<p>52. Shortcomings in the legal and procedural framework still allow perpetrators to escape 
criminal accountability, even where allegations can be substantiated and the perpetrator is 
removed from the mission. In cases involving civilian peacekeepers, impunity may ensue, 
because the perpetrator&#8217;s country of nationality does not exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
crimes of sexual exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p>53. These jurisdictional problems do not apply to military personnel, because military penal 
codes generally provide for their extraterritorial application. However, cumbersome procedures 
often prevent the successful prosecution of soldiers. Troop-contributing countries will usually 
first repatriate the offender and then carry out a criminal investigation into the case. At this point, 
witnesses may be inaccessible and important forensic evidence may be lost, especially since 
OIOS and the Conduct and Discipline Team still lack the capacity to compile and preserve such

</p>
<p>forensic evidence. Prince Zeid&#8217;s report recommends that troop-contributing countries conduct 
on-site courts martial. I was encouraged to hear that the South African contingent in MONUC 
has followed this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>54. The United Nations still lacks a mechanism to provide victims of sexual exploitation and 
abuse with adequate compensation. At the time of my visit, victims of MONUC abuse could 
obtain no more than emergency assistance within current mission budgets from the 
United Nations.<b>13</b> In addition, there are no mechanisms to ensure that fathers of babies born from 
relationships between MONUC personnel and Congolese women pay child support, nor are there 
any means to compel a father to do so. The mother would therefore have to sue for child support 
in the dysfunctional Congolese system, which is unrealistic even if one assumes that the 
United Nations would waive the father&#8217;s immunity from judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Care and treatment 
</b></p>
<p>55. Many survivors of sexual violence are severely injured, since most rapes are collective and 
carried out with an extraordinary brutality. Medical data collected by the Provincial Synergy for 
South Kivu showed that more than 26,000 women in the province sought medical assistance for 
rape-related injuries in 2006.  
</p><p>56. In some cases, the perpetrators deliberately seek to destroy the victim&#8217;s genital and 
reproductive organs. At the Panzi Hospital, I interviewed a 10-year old girl, who had been 
abducted by armed men she described as &#8220;Interahamwe&#8221;. The perpetrators rammed a stick into 
her vagina, damaging her genital organs. The Provincial Synergy in South Kivu estimates 
that 20 per cent of all rape victims have suffered irreparable damage to their genital organs.  
</p>
<p>57. Many rape victims also suffer vaginal fistula, i.e. the tearing of a hole (fistula) in the tissue 
between the vagina and the rectum or the vagina and the bladder. A woman suffering from 
fistula can no longer hold her urine or faeces. The smell is constant and humiliating to the 
woman. Left untreated, fistula can lead to chronic medical problems, including ulcerations, 
kidney disease, and nerve damage in the legs. Most fistulas could be treated with a surgical 
operation. However, local health centres lack the necessary equipment and trained medical staff. 
The few existing specialized medical hospitals, such as the Panzi Hospital (Bukavu, South Kivu) 
or the DOCS Clinic (Goma, North Kivu), are overwhelmed and geographically inaccessible for 
many women. 
</p>
<p>58. The rapists often infect women with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The 
Provincial Synergy for South Kivu estimates that 22 per cent of rape victims in the province are 
HIV-positive. Few victims have access to post-exposure prophylaxis, which could significantly 
reduce the risk of infection, if taken within 24 to 72 hours of the rape.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  See note 11 above, para. 21. A draft United Nations policy statement and draft comprehensive 
</p>
<p>strategy on assistance and support to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations 
staff or related personnel (A/60/877) is currently being considered. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>59. Women survivors of rape are often ostracized and rejected by their own families and 
communities. Husbands often desert women who have been raped or eject them from their home. 
The fact that State security forces and armed groups often deliberately rape women in front of 
their husband or families increases the social consequences of rape.  
</p>
<p>60. There are also thousands of babies born from rape, who are often rejected by society and 
sometimes even by their own mothers. Children born from rape committed by foreign armed 
groups are often persecuted by the local population. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Livelihood security 
</b></p>
<p>61. Victims of sexual violence often end up destitute and struggle for their mere survival, 
because they lose their family support networks. A 60-year-old woman from the village of 
Babuna Batuti (Ituri) told me that she was gang-raped by three militiamen in front of her whole 
family in 2004. The militia executed her entire family, leaving only herself and her infant 
grandson alive. Today, she and her grandson live on the street with the help of the local women&#8217;s 
association SOFEPADI. Other rape victims with whom I spoke faced similar hardships, 
especially those who had been rejected by their families. Economic assistance to women 
survivors of sexual violence to re-establish their livelihoods has so far been largely neglected by 
the donor community. 
</p>
<p>62. In the course of armed conflict, armed groups forcefully recruited thousands of women and 
girls as porters, cooks, etc. and many were also sexually exploited or raped. The National 
Commission for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (CONADER) has demobilized 
101,000 militia fighters, including 2,600 women. Demobilized fighters were given a small 
demobilization grant, job training and equipment to begin a civilian livelihood. However, women 
who were associated with armed groups but did not actively take part in hostilities did not 
qualify for assistance.  
</p>
<p>63. One girl from a village near Bunia, told me that she was 14 years old when Lendu militia 
of the Front nationaliste int&#233;graliste (FNI) abducted her. For three years, she and 20 other women 
were kept as forced labourers in the camp and were expected to sleep with the militiamen at their 
behest. She was repeatedly raped, became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she returned to 
her community with her baby, her family rejected her. Unlike the men who abducted and 
exploited her, the girl did not receive any State assistance and she struggles to survive. 
</p>
<p>64. The Executive Unit of the National Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration 
Programme (UEPNDDR), which replaced CONADER in July 2007, plans to launch a 
programme for women who were associated with armed groups, many of whom have 
reintegrated into communities. Since providing women with individual benefits would mean 
identifying them as being associated with armed groups and thereby stigmatizing them, 
UEPNDDR plans instead to launch targeted community support programmes in localities, where 
such women live. </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  PERPETUATION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>65. International law requires the authorities to exercise due diligence and to investigate, 
prosecute and adequately punish perpetrators of sexual violence, in particular when the violence 
amounts to crimes against humanity, war crimes and/or torture. 
</p>
<p>66. On 20 July 2006, the President signed the Law on Sexual Violence, which introduced 
major improvements to the Congolese Penal Code and the Congolese Code of Penal Procedure. 
However, the law enforcement and justice authorities have been unable and, in many instances, 
apparently also unwilling, to implement the law. Massive impunity prevails. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>67. The justice system is in a deplorable state and lacks the capacity to handle even the 
relatively small number of rape cases that reach it. The MONUC Human Rights Division in 
South Kivu analysed the 287 cases of sexual violence that were reported to the military and 
civilian justice authorities during the period 2005-2007. At the time of my visit, 162 of 
the 287 reported cases were still under investigation; 60 per cent of these cases had been 
under investigation for more than one year. Only 64 cases have been tried, resulting 
in 58 convictions.  
</p>
<p>68. The non-governmental organization LIZADELL, which provides legal assistance to 
women and children in Kinshasa, followed 720 cases of violence against women that were 
referred to the justice system between 2004 and 2006. At the time of my visit, only 75 cases had 
resulted in a judgement; only two judgements had actually been executed. 
</p><p>69. The Law on Sexual Violence requires the courts to conclude a case within three months 
after the case is brought to the justice system. Senior justice officials in provinces visited 
considered this norm to be of a purely aspirational nature in light of the realities on the ground. 
The justice sector is severely under-resourced and understaffed. I was informed, for instance, 
that there were only two civilian judges in Mbandaka (Equateur), a city with almost 1 million 
inhabitants. These two judges were also expected to cover cases referred from the territories of 
Basankusu and Bongadanga, hundreds of kilometres away.  
</p>
<p>70. The lack of resources also affects the military justice system, which has jurisdiction over 
most cases involving gross human rights violations. The few investigations and prosecutions that 
have been carried out in relation to such cases have virtually all relied on the technical and 
logistical support of MONUC. 
</p>
<p>71. The Government seems unwilling to provide the justice sector with the necessary budget to 
function effectively. While most countries dedicate 2-6 per cent of their national budget to the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>justice sector, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo this was only 0.6 per cent of the 2005 
and 2006 national budgets.<b>14</b> The latest budget presented by the executive to Parliament would 
reduce the portion even further, to 0.3 per cent. 
</p>
<p>72. In the absence of an accessible and functioning justice system, the local population often 
refers rape cases to traditional authorities, local administrators or armed actors. Amicable 
settlements brokered by such figures typically disregard the victims&#8217; interests. Cases are often 
resolved by the perpetrator paying a small sum to the victim&#8217;s family. In some cases, the victim 
is even forced to marry the perpetrator, a practice that provides men with a perverse incentive to 
rape women who have rejected their advances. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Corruption and interference 
</b></p>
<p>73. Extremely low salaries and job insecurity for public officials (a judge may earn as little as 
US$ 20-30 per month) provide numerous entry points for corruption at all levels. 
</p>
<p>74. Courts routinely release alleged rapists on bail, often under dubious circumstances and in 
violation of applicable rules of penal procedures. MONUC estimates that 80 per cent of alleged 
rapists in South Kivu are released on bail and never reappear in court. Lawyers in other 
provinces made similar observations. In Kinshasa, for instance, I met the lawyers of a 
10-year-old girl who was gang-raped by four teenagers. Police arrested the perpetrators, but the 
Tribunal de Paix of Assossa ordered their release without giving any reasons for its decision. The 
perpetrators have since disappeared. 
</p>
<p>75. Political interference during all stages of the criminal process is very common, especially 
in high-profile cases involving crimes committed by State security forces.  
</p>
<p>76. Commanding officers of FARDC and PNC often deliberately obstruct investigations by 
quickly redeploying soldiers and policemen under investigation to other duty stations without 
informing the judicial authorities. FARDC officers have also shielded soldiers under their 
command from arrest, by abusing a military regulation, which stipulates that soldiers stationed in 
zones of military operations may only be arrested with the prior consent of their commanding 
officer.  
</p>
<p>77. In addition, FARDC and PNC frequently use intimidation against victims, witnesses and 
human rights defenders to ensure impunity. On the night of 8 March 2007, the Commander 
a.i. of the FARDC Naval Forces in Lukolela (200 km south-west of Mbandaka) reportedly raped 
a woman and a girl. The perpetrator reportedly threatened the Administrateur de Territoire with a 
firearm when he denounced these crimes to the perpetrator&#8217;s superiors.

lawyers (A/HRC/4/25/Add.3, para. 7 (a) (i)). </p>

</p>
<p>78. Prosecutors and judges are also vulnerable to pressure by political or military authorities. 
In October 2004, for instance, 73 civilians were killed in Kilwa (Katanga province). A MONUC 
investigation into the killings documented cases of summary executions, rape, arbitrary arrest 
and detention, torture and looting by FARDC forces led by Colonel Ad&#233;mar, then Commander 
of the 62nd Brigade. Twelve FARDC soldiers, including commanding officers, and three foreign 
employees of a multinational company were prosecuted. On 28 June 2007, the Military Court of 
Katanga delivered its verdict on the case, acquitting all defendants. Whereas the MONUC 
investigation had concluded that virtually no fighting had taken place when the FARDC regained 
control of Kilwa, the court held that all civilians killed were casualties of fighting between 
FARDC and rebel forces and that no crimes had taken place. While the trial was ongoing, the 
Military Prosecutor, who had prepared the indictment and led the prosecution, was reassigned to 
Kananga. MONUC human rights observers also noted several other serious irregularities.<b>15</b> 
When I finalized this report, an appeal against the decision was pending. 
</p>
<p>79. Article 152 of the Constitution foresees the creation of a Higher Council of the Judiciary, 
composed of judges and prosecutors. The Council would be responsible for the appointment, 
promotion and removal of judges and prosecutors. Its creation would help to protect those judges 
and prosecutors who want to end impunity and who have demonstrated this will through 
courageous convictions in cases involving high-ranking military officers. At the time of my visit, 
however, Parliament had still not passed the necessary implementing legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>80. In the course of my discussions with the Minister of Justice, I was relieved to hear that the 
Minister planned to launch a major reform of the penitentiary system. None of the prisons 
I visited even complied remotely with basic international standards on the humane and dignified 
treatment of prisoners.<b>16</b> Buildings were dilapidated and facilities run-down. Hygienic conditions 
were abhorrent. Many inmates were seriously ill, but medical care was scarcely available. 
During the first six months of 2007, MONUC documented at least 30 deaths of detainees.  
</p>
<p>81. Contrary to international standards, pretrial detainees and convicted persons are kept 
together. Children as old as 8 years of age are kept in prison with their mothers, without access 
to education, adequate medical care or food. In several localities, there are no separate sections 
for women or minors. 
</p>
<p>82. The appalling prison conditions have immediate ramifications for prison security.<b>17</b> With 
the exception of Makala Central Prison in Kinshasa, none of the prisons received a budget for

escape is &#8220;the prisoner&#8217;s only chance of survival&#8221; (A/HRC/4/7, para. 37). </p>

<p>food from the central authorities. Some prisons even lack drinkable water. Some prison directors 
have no other choice but to allow prisoners to leave prison during the day to search for food and 
water. While many prisoners are said to return in the evening, others do not. According to the 
registers of Mbandaka Central Prison, which has adopted this practice, 77 prisoners have 
disappeared or escaped during the first six months of 2007. 
</p>
<p>83. In many cases, perpetrators of gross human rights violations seem to have simply walked 
out of prison with the connivance of the authorities. MONUC considers that 23 of the 33 prison 
escapes documented in the first half of 2007, involved corrupt prison wardens and police 
officers. 
</p>
<p>84. On 30 June 2007, for instance, 24 detainees &#8220;escaped&#8221; from the GLM Military Prison 
in Mbandaka, including three soldiers sentenced to life imprisonment in connection to 
Songo Mboyo mass rape, three soldiers convicted in relation to the July 2005 Bokala mutiny 
and three soldiers awaiting trial for murder and rape in connection with the Lifumba-Waka 
atrocities of March 2006. The escapes occurred just before 14 detainees were scheduled to be 
transferred to Kinshasa for security reasons. Twelve out of the 14 scheduled for transfer escaped, 
though 2 were later recaptured. 
</p>
<p>85. The prison commander provided me with an incredible account of the escape: the three 
guards on duty during the night of the escape had sent a detainee to buy food for the other 
inmates. When the man did not return, they went to search for him, leaving their rifles behind 
and the prison door open. Subsequently, 24 inmates escaped. The guards have since disappeared. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>86. International law requires the State to ensure that women victims of violence can obtain 
fair and adequate compensation. If the violence is committed by a State actor or otherwise 
attributable to the Government, the State itself must pay compensation.<b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>87. Under Congolese law, criminal courts can order perpetrators of crimes, including the State, 
to pay compensation. Yet, victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
are systematically denied compensation, which discourages women from pursuing justice.  
</p><p>88. Courts have handed down several judgements ordering the State to pay compensation to 
victims of sexual violence committed by State agents. The Minister of Justice also informed me 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  The right to compensation forms part of the right to reparation, as set out by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in resolution 60/147, &#8220;Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law&#8221;. See also the Nairobi Declaration on Women&#8217;s 
and Girl&#8217;s Right to a Remedy and Reparation, elaborated in 2007 by a coalition of women&#8217;s 
rights activists and survivors of sexual violence (www.womensrightscoalition.org/site/ 
reparation/signature_en.php). </p>

<p>that the Government had established a fund, from which compensation for criminal or other 
wrongful acts could be paid. However, at the time of my visit, not a single woman who had been 
awarded compensation had received any payment from the Congolese State. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Security-sector reform 
</b></p>
<p>89.  The security-sector reform gives militia and soldiers the choice to either demobilize and 
reintegrate into civilian life or join a unified national army. Those who choose to join the army 
will be sent to training centres (centres de brassage), where they are to receive training before 
being redeployed in integrated units. The programme has been marred by inefficiency and 
insufficient funding. According to Government estimates, more than 100,000 fighters are still 
awaiting to be processed.<b>19</b>  
</p>
<p>90. While in principle perpetrators of human rights violations can be excluded from joining the 
army, in practice, this has not happened.  
</p>
<p>91. Lieutenant Colonel Bebimobuli Engagela, known as &#8220;Colonel 106&#8221;, a former commander 
of a renegade FARDC faction, stands accused of at least eight cases of rape, sexual enslavement 
and forced recruitment of girls and women. He was reintegrated into the FARDC in March 2007 
and was reportedly at a training centre in Luberisi (South Kivu) at the time of my visit. 
</p>
<p>92. Colonel Safari, former commander of the 120th Brigade in Shabunda, stands accused of 
murder and implication in a gang rape. Another commander from the same brigade also faces 
accusations of gang rape. At the end of March 2007, both perpetrators remained at Luberisi. 
</p>
<p>93. Men known to have committed serious crimes have even been given command positions. 
The Mayi-Mayi Commander in Moba (320 km south of Kalemie, Katanga), where 45 women 
and girls were allegedly raped by Mayi-Mayi combatants during the period 2002-2004, has since 
been integrated into the FARDC with a command position at the Headquarters of the Naval 
Force in Kalemie. 
</p>
<p>94. In Ituri, former militia leaders Peter Karim Ugada (FNI), Mathieu Ngudjolo of the 
Mouvement r&#233;volutionnaire congolais (MRC), and Justin &#8220;Cobra&#8221; Matata (FRPI) - all accused of 
gross human rights violations - have been awarded the rank of colonel in the FARDC. 
</p>
<p>95. Politicians and senior FARDC officers acknowledged that major perpetrators had been 
integrated into the FARDC, but assured me that they would be brought to justice once 
disarmament is completed and peace restored. It is encouraging that the highest levels of 
Government, including the President, have promised to support a United Nations mapping of the 
major human rights violations committed during the period between 1993 and 2003.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Women&#8217;s status 
</b></p>
<p>96. Sexual violence in armed conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is fuelled by 
gender-based discrimination in the society at large. Women face discrimination and oppression 
in virtually every sphere of life. The country ranks 130th among 136 countries in the UNDP 
gender-related development index (GDI).  
</p>
<p>97. The Family Code recognizes equality between the spouses (art. 330), but effectively 
renders a married woman a minor under the guardianship of her husband. Article 444 stipulates 
that the wife must obey her husband; article 448 requires a woman to obtain her husband&#8217;s 
authorization to effect any legal act for which she must present herself in person. The law also 
endorses double standards on marital fidelity: all cases of adultery committed by a married 
woman are punishable by six months to one year of imprisonment, whereas male adultery is only 
punishable if it is of an &#8220;injurious quality&#8221;. In almost all ethnic groups, bride price is practised, 
which leads some men to believe that they have &#8220;bought&#8221; their wife. Punishment of women&#8217;s 
&#8220;disobedience&#8221; enjoys considerable social acceptance, whereas the concept of marital rape is 
often not understood.  
</p>
<p>98. On a positive note, I was told that a comprehensive reform of the Family Code was high on 
the agendas of Parliament&#8217;s Gender Parity Network and the Minister on the Status of Women.  
</p>
<p>99. Women also face discrimination and violence in places of work and education. Girls are 
often denied access to education, as families privilege boys&#8217; attendance to school. This is 
evidenced by the 63.1 per cent literacy rate for young women (15-24 years), which is far lower 
than the literacy rate of 78 per cent for men in the same age range.<b>20</b> Interlocutors also pointed 
out that the sexual coercion of women and girls, committed by supervisors, professors and 
teachers, is a long-standing phenomenon that existed before the armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p>100. Article 14 of the Constitution stipulates that women have a right to equitable representation 
in national, provincial and local institutions and mandates the State to guarantee this. Article 13 
of the Electoral Law requires political parties to give consideration to equal representation of 
women and men on its lists of candidates. Yet the same provision states that lists of candidates 
that violate this requirement remain admissible. Consequently, women are grossly 
underrepresented in the country&#8217;s newly established democratic institutions. Women 
comprise 42 out of 550 members in the National Assembly, 5 out of 108 in the Senate and 9 
of 60 ministers and vice-ministers in the Cabinet. Not a single Governor or Vice Governor is 
female. A Gender Parity Law that would implement article 14 has yet to be drafted and passed. 
</p>
<p>101. The normalization and banalization of war-related rape is adding to the inequality and 
oppression women endure in public and private. The rape crisis associated with war, therefore, 
cannot be addressed in isolation from gender-based discrimination and violence women 
</p>

<p>encounter in &#8220;peace&#8221;. The war has further reduced women to mere objects that can be raped, 
tortured and mutilated. Without fundamentally altering gender relations and supporting women&#8217;s 
empowerment, high levels of rape will persist, even if stability, the rule of law and democratic, 
civilian control over the armed forces are established.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> Sexual violence has been a defining feature of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo&#8217;s armed conflicts. Women living in areas of conflict still suffer extreme levels of 
violence, committed by FARDC, PNC, armed groups and increasingly also civilians.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The situation is particularly dramatic in South Kivu, where non-State armed groups, 
including foreign militia, commit sexual atrocities that are of an unimaginable brutality 
and aim at the complete physical and psychological destruction of women with implications 
for the entire society. Given the multitude of actors involved in the conflict and the 
continuation of these crimes, the international community, in cooperation with the 
Congolese authorities, has a responsibility to take all necessary measures to ensure that 
women in South Kivu are protected. Without strong international backing, the Congolese 
authorities will not be able to resolve this major human rights crisis which is, after all, 
rooted in the international community&#8217;s failure to effectively react to, let alone prevent, the 
Rwandan genocide. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>While war has ended in many other parts of the country, women are not at peace. 
Sexual violence remains rampant throughout the country. In Equateur Province, PNC and 
FARDC have carried out systematic reprisals against the civilians, including mass rape. 
Soldiers and police who commit these acts amounting to crimes against humanity and war 
crimes are rarely held to account by the commanding officers. Many of the perpetrators 
have been given commanding positions in the State security forces, which further 
aggravates the situation. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Impunity for rape is massive, especially if the perpetrator belongs to the State 
security forces. Due to political interference and widespread corruption, a perpetrator with 
a minimum of influence or affluence goes unpunished. It is questionable whether there is 
political will to end this impunity, given that the justice system is denied the budget and 
support to effectively deal with its caseload. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The scale and the brutality of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo seem to have eroded all protective social mechanisms, unleashing brutal fantasies 
carried out on women&#8217;s bodies. Civilians are increasingly among the perpetrators of rape, 
which indicates a normalization of the war-related violence. This intensifies existing 
inequalities and oppression of women in society. If the sexual violence associated with war 
is addressed in isolation, gender-based discrimination and violence endured by women in 
&#8220;peace&#8221; will be grossly neglected and the war on women reinforced. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Women survivors of rape have suffered severe physical and psychological injuries, 
but lack sufficient care. Survivors are often socially stigmatized and many are so destitute 
that they have to struggle for their mere survival. Women are also systematically denied 
the compensation to which they are entitled under international and Congolese law.  </b></p>

</p>
<p>108. <b>In view of my findings, I would like to make the following recommendations to the 
Congolese State institutions: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) End impunity, in particular with regard to members of the security forces: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Demonstrate a zero-tolerance policy on sexual violence and other gross 
human rights violations; publicly condemn all acts of rape committed by 
security forces. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Issue, disseminate and enforce orders to the FARDC, FARDC Naval Forces, 
PNC, ANR, Police Special Services (Kin Mazi&#232;re) and Republican Guard 
prohibiting rape and other forms of sexual violence, which may amount to 
war crimes and crimes against humanity. Investigate suspects, including 
bearers of command responsibility, prosecute and severely sanction any 
member of the security forces who committed, ordered or condoned rape or 
other human rights violations. Prosecute and punish officers bearing 
command responsibility for grave violations. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Disseminate, raise awareness and implement the Law on Sexual Violence of 
20 July 2006. Train judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officials and all the 
security forces on the law. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Enhance the independence and capacity of the justice system: 
</b>&#8226; <b>Instruct authorities at all levels, including commanding officers of all security 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces, to fully cooperate with judicial investigations and desist from 
interfering in the administration of justice. Instruct commanding officers to 
surrender alleged perpetrators immediately to the justice system, even in 
zones of military operations. Fully cooperate with any investigation carried 
out by the International Criminal Court. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Increase the budget designated for the functioning of justice to at least 
2 per cent of the national budget. Deploy more justice personnel, including 
high-ranking military judges and prosecutors, to the provinces. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop, in cooperation with the United Nations and civil society, a 
standardized national medical certificate to be used in judicial processes. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Sanction any person who usurps judicial functions by encouraging or forcing 
victims of sexual violence to accept out-of-court settlements. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reform the penitentiary system. Address the security gaps and the inhumane 
conditions in prisons. Diligently investigate all escapes and take disciplinary 
and penal measures against officials, including commanding officers, who are 
implicated in such escapes. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt a law to establish the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, with the 
composition and functions as foreseen by article 152 of the Constitution. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Amend existing legislation to ensure that civilian courts have jurisdiction 
over all crimes against humanity, regardless of the perpetrator&#8217;s function. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt a law on the implementation of the Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, which will transfer the jurisdiction to hear international 
crimes from the military to the civilian courts. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Reform the security sector: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement a systematic vetting process for all branches of the security forces 
to ensure that officers accused of having committed human rights violations 
are discharged and prosecuted accordingly.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Suspend and prosecute, including in military operation zones, any member of 
the security forces suspected of committing rape or other gross human rights 
violations as well as any officer interfering in the administration of justice.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Instruct authorities at all levels to support and collaborate with the 
United Nations team designated to map human rights violations committed 
between 1993 and 2003.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Compensate, support and protect women survivors of violence: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Compensate all victims of sexual violence committed by State agents, 
beginning with those cases where courts have already ordered the payment of 
compensation. Allocate adequate funds for that purpose in the national 
budget. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that all women survivors of sexual violence have access to medical 
and psychosocial care. Support and participate in existing Provincial 
Synergies to combat sexual violence. Initiate the creation of similar action 
committees, involving Government representatives, civil society and the 
United Nations in all provinces of the country.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Deploy security forces to protect civilian populations at risk of attacks, with 
regular patrols in these areas. Resume, with the full support of MONUC, 
military operations against the FDLR/Rasta armed group in South Kivu. 
Involve the local population in setting up protection mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) End discrimination and all forms of violence against women: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Elaborate jointly with the Presidency, concerned ministries, civil society and 
the United Nations, an action plan on women, peace and security, with clear 
objectives and benchmarks and a particular focus on sexual violence. 
Allocate adequate resources for its implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt a gender parity law in line with article 14 of the Constitution.  </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/6/Add.4 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Abolish all legal provisions that discriminate against women, beginning with 
a comprehensive reform of the Family Code. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt a law on the establishment of a national human rights commission, 
with an adequate budget and in line with the Paris Principles relating to the 
Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights, including women&#8217;s rights.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Denounce publicly and unequivocally all forms of violence against women, 
including spousal abuse, marital rape and sexual harassment without 
invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to justify or excuse 
such violence. Investigate and prosecute with due diligence all cases of 
violence against women in the family or community. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>I would like to recommend to the International Criminal Court that it: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Investigate war crimes or crimes against humanity - including sexual violence 
committed after 1 July 2002 - that the Congolese authorities are genuinely unable 
or unwilling to investigate or prosecute. Prosecute high-ranking officers of FARDC 
and PNC and leaders of armed groups that have committed such crimes and 
award compensation to victims.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take appropriate measures to protect witnesses and victims collaborating with the 
Court. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>I recommend to the United Nations and particularly to MONUC troop-contributing 
countries that they: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Fully support the Congolese security forces in all military operations that would 
genuinely improve the protection of the civilian population. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Include vetting mechanisms in the Disarmament, Repatriation, Reinstallation, and 
Reintegration Programme to prevent impunity for foreign perpetrators of gross 
human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Provide OIOS and the Conduct and Discipline Team with the capacity to 
investigate all allegations of sexual exploitation and misconduct of peacekeeping 
forces, collect forensic evidence that can be used in a court of law. Where 
allegations are found to be substantiated, ensure that the victim receives 
compensation from MONUC or the relevant troop-contributing country. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adopt and fund a comprehensive strategy on assistance and support to victims of 
sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff or related personnel.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Amend existing norms of conduct: failure to support children fathered in areas of 
deployment should be considered misconduct that is harmful to the interests of the 
organization. </b></p>

this report. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Finally, I recommend that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Launch a comprehensive international initiative to improve peace and security of 
women and the civilian population in the Kivus, focusing particularly on the role
