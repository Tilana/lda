Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), of
changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forum Energy Technologies,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its annual goodwill impairment testing date from
December 31 to October 1. The Company also changed the manner in which it accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the
early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes in 2015.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
1. Nature of operations
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, is a global oilfield products company, serving the subsea, drilling,
completion, production and infrastructure sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. The Company designs, manufactures and distributes
products, and engages in aftermarket services, parts supply and related services that complement the Company’s product offering.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP").
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany balances and transactions. Noncontrolling interest principally represents ownership by others of the equity in our consolidated
majority owned South African subsidiary.
The Company's investment in an operating entity where the Company has the ability to exert significant influence, but does not control
operating and financial policies, is accounted for using the equity method. The Company's share of the net income of this entity is recorded as
"Earnings from equity investment" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The investment in this entity is included in
"Investment in unconsolidated subsidiary" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports its share of equity earnings within
operating income as the investee's operations are similar in nature to the operations of the Company.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications, such as the one related to debt issuance cost, have been made in prior period financial statements to conform with
the current period presentation. Reclassifications have no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management including, among
others, costs to complete contracts, an assessment of percentage of completion of projects, the selection of useful lives of tangible and
intangible assets, fair value of reporting units used for goodwill impairment testing, expected future cash flows from long lived assets to support
impairment tests, provisions necessary for trade receivables, amounts of deferred taxes and income tax contingencies. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.
The financial reporting of contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of those contracts. Recognized
revenues and income are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and changes in estimates are reflected in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. Additional information that enhances and refines the estimating process that is
obtained after the balance sheet date, but before issuance of the financial statements is reflected in the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and high quality, short term money market instruments with an original maturity of three
months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.

Accounts receivable-trade
Trade accounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis; thus
receivables do not bear interest, although a finance charge may be applied to amounts past due. The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Such allowances are
based upon several factors including, but not limited to, credit approval practices, industry and customer historical experience as well as the
current and projected financial condition of the specific customer. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than contractual terms are
considered past due. The Company writes off accounts receivable to the allowance for doubtful accounts when they become uncollectible.
Any payments subsequently received on receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.
The change in amounts of the allowance for doubtful accounts during the three year period ended December 31, 2015 is as follows (in
thousands):
Period ended

Inventories
Inventory consisting of finished goods and materials and supplies held for resale is carried at the lower of cost or market. For certain
operations, cost, which includes the cost of raw materials and labor for finished goods, is determined on a first-in first-out basis. For other
operations, this cost is determined on an average cost basis. Market means current replacement cost except that (1) market should not exceed
net realizable value and (2) market should not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for a normal profit margin. The

Company continuously evaluates inventories, based on an analysis of inventory levels, historical sales experience and future sales forecasts,
to determine obsolete, slow-moving and excess inventory. Adjustments to reduce such inventory to its estimated recoverable value have been
recorded by management.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under capital leases are stated at the present value
of minimum lease payments. Expenditures for property and equipment and for items which substantially increase the useful lives of existing
assets are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life utilizing the straight-line method. Routine expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of
assets, generally three to thirty years. Property and equipment held under capital leases are amortized straight-line over the shorter of the
lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Gains or losses resulting from the disposition of assets are recognized in income, and the
related asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Assets acquired in connection with business combinations
are recorded at fair value.
Rental equipment consists of equipment leased to customers under operating leases. Rental equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three to ten years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for impairment, future cash flows expected to result from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposal are estimated. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, there
is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and
the estimated fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined either through the use of an external valuation, or by means of an analysis of
discounted future cash flows based on expected utilization. The impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the assets carrying value
as compared to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no impairments were recorded.
To the extent that asset retirement obligations are incurred, the Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in
the period in which the associated legal obligation is incurred. The fair values of these
8
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related
assets and depreciated. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for any change in their present value.
Goodwill and intangible assets
For goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, an assessment for impairment is performed annually or when there is an indication an
impairment may have occurred. The Company completes its annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles using an
assessment date of October 1. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each of our six reporting unit’s net
assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted
cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and
assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, and future market
conditions, among others. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. If the
reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, a second step is performed whereby the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated
by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation analysis. The Company recognizes a goodwill
impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Any impairment losses are reflected in
operating income. Due to the further deterioration of market conditions for our products, the Company performed the impairment test on all six
reporting units, and recorded $123.2 million of impairment losses for its Subsea reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2015. If these
market conditions continue to exist, the Company may have additional impairment charges in its reporting units in the future. In 2014 and 2013,
no goodwill impairment losses were recorded.
Intangible assets with definite lives comprised of customer and distributor relationships, non-compete agreements, and patents are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the life of the intangible asset, generally three to seventeen years. These assets are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2015, $1.9
million of intangible assets were written off related to trade names no longer in use. No impairments to intangible assets were recorded in 2014
and 2013. Refer to Note 7, Goodwill and intangible assets, for further discussion.
Recognition of provisions for contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various claims, suits and complaints. The Company, in consultation with internal
and external advisors, will provide for a contingent loss in the consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been
incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is determined that the
reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and that there is no best estimate within the range, provision will be made for the lower amount of
the range. Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
An assessment is made of the areas where potential claims may arise under the contract warranty clauses. Where a specific risk is identified
and the potential for a claim is assessed as probable and can be reasonably estimated, an appropriate warranty provision is recorded.
Warranty provisions are eliminated at the end of the warranty period except where warranty claims are still outstanding. The liability for product
warranty is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Changes in the Company’s warranty liability were as follows (in thousands):

equipment has occurred or services have been rendered, (c) the price of the product or service

is fixed and determinable and (d) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from product sales, including shipping costs, is recognized as
title passes to the customer, which generally occurs when items are shipped from the Company’s facilities. Revenue from services is
recognized when the service is completed to the customer’s specifications.
Customers are sometimes billed in advance of services performed or products manufactured, and the Company recognizes the associated
liability as deferred revenue.
Revenue generated from long-term contracts typically longer than six months in duration are recognized on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. The Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold each period based upon the advancement of the work-in-
progress unless the stage of completion is insufficient to enable a reasonably certain forecast of profit to be established. In such cases, no
profit is recognized during the period. The percentage-of-completion is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to-date to total estimated
costs, taking into account the level of completion. The percentage-of-completion method requires management to calculate reasonably
dependable estimates of progress toward completion of contract revenues and contract costs. Whenever revisions of estimated contract costs
and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues, thus creating a loss, a provision for the total estimated loss
is recorded in that period.
Primarily related to the remotely operated vehicles ("ROVs"), which may take longer to manufacture, accounting estimates during the course of
the project may change. The effect of such a change, which can be upward as well as downward, is accounted for in the period of change and
the cumulative income recognized to date is adjusted to reflect the latest estimates. These revisions to estimates are accounted for on a
prospective basis.
On a contract by contract basis, cost and profit in excess of billings represents the cumulative revenue recognized less the cumulative billings
to the customer. Similarly, billings in excess of costs and profits represent the cumulative billings to the customer less the cumulative revenue
recognized.
Revenue from the rental of equipment or providing of services is recognized over the period when the asset is rented or services are rendered
and collectability is reasonably assured. Rates for asset rental and service provision are priced on a per day, per man hour, or similar basis.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk include trade accounts receivable. Trade accounts receivable
consist of uncollateralized receivables from domestic and internationally based customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and
2013, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of the total revenue or 10% more of the total accounts receivable balance at the end of the
respective period.
Share-based compensation
The Company measures all share-based compensation awards at fair value on the date they are granted to employees and directors, and
recognizes compensation cost, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period for awards with only a service condition, and over a graded
vesting period for awards with service and performance or market conditions.
The fair value of share-based compensation awards with market conditions is measured using a lattice model and in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718, is not adjusted based on actual achievement of the performance goals. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model is used to measure the fair value of options. The following sections address the assumptions used related to the Black-
Scholes option pricing model:
Expected life
The expected term of stock options represents the period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is based on the simplified
method, which is the weighted average vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two. The Company uses the simplified
method due to a lack of sufficient historical share option exercise experience upon which to estimate an expected term.
Expected volatility
Expected volatility measures the amount that a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period and is estimated based on
a weighted average of the Company's historical stock price.
Dividend yield
The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, a
zero expected dividend yield was used in the valuation model.
10
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
Risk-free interest rate
The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the
options.
Forfeitures
The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for
those awards that are expected to vest. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, the stock-based
compensation expense could be different from what the Company has recorded in the current period. Historically, estimated forfeitures have
been in line with actual forfeitures.
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities at the
balance sheet date, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs.
The Company records a valuation allowance in each reporting period when management believes that it is more likely than not that any
deferred tax asset created will not be realized.
Accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after
determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. If a tax position meets the "more
likely than not" recognition criteria, accounting guidance requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than
50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for all periods presented equals net income divided by the weighted average number of the shares of the Company’s
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding during the period as adjusted for the dilutive effect of the Company’s stock options,
restricted share plans and warrants.
The exercise price of each option is based on the Company’s stock price at the date of grant. There is no dilutive effect for the year 2015 since
the Company is in a net loss position. The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes approximately 0.5 million stock options, and 0.3
million stock options and warrants for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because they were anti-dilutive as the
option exercise price or warrant conversion price was greater than the average market price of the common stock.
The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares used for the basic and diluted earnings per share computations (shares in thousands):

Non-U.S. local currency translation
The Company operates globally and its primary functional currency is the U.S. dollar ($). The majority of the Company’s non-U.S. operations
have designated the local currency as their functional currency. Financial statements of these non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the current rate method whereby assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet rate and income and expenses are
translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.

•
Noncontrolling interest
Noncontrolling interests are classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Net earnings include the net earnings for both controlling
and noncontrolling interests, with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statements of earnings.
Fair value
The carrying amounts for financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to the short
maturity of such instruments. The book values of other financial instruments, such as the Company’s debt related to the Credit Facility,
approximates fair value because interest rates charged are similar to other financial instruments with similar terms and maturities and the rates
vary in accordance with a market index.
For the financial assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value, fair value is determined as the exit price, or the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The established fair
value hierarchy divides fair value measurement into three broad levels:
Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to
access at the measurement date;
•Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•Level 3 - inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, which reflect the best judgment of management.
The financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed at fair value for disclosure purposes are categorized in one of the above three levels
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair
value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment.
Recent accounting pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), which are adopted by
the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued
standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.2016-02, Leases.  Under this new guidance, lessees will be
required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than
twelve months. The standard will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
Dec. 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Simplifying the Presentation of Deferred Income Tax, which requires deferred tax
liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all
entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying
component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The new standard will be
effective for public companies for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company has early adopted the guidance prospectively as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in the reclassification of its current deferred
tax assets and liabilities into non-current in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively
adjusted. Refer to Note 9 Income taxes for further information related to the early adoption of this guidance.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This new standard
specifies that an acquirer in a business combination should recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the
measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, eliminating the current requirement to
retrospectively account for these adjustments. Additionally, the full effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income
effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts should be recognized in the same period as the adjustments to the
provisional amounts. The new standard will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 and interim periods
thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
12
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Cost Associated with Line
of Credit Arrangements, which confirms that fees related to line of credit arrangements are not addressed in ASU 2015-03, and the SEC staff
would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance
costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit
arrangement. The new standard will be effective for us for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The
Company has elected to continue to present the debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements as assets.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires companies to measure inventory
at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new standard will be effective
for the Company for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is
currently evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this guidance.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires deferred financing
costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. The new standard will
be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has early adopted the guidance retrospectively for the debt issuance
costs related to its Senior Notes as of December 31, 2015 and has adjusted financial statements of prior years.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The new standard requires
management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going
concern for both annual and interim reporting periods. The guidance is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016
and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The comprehensive new standard will
supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to
customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation
approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective
application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The new standard is to be effective for the fiscal year beginning
after December 15, 2017. Companies are able to early adopt the pronouncement, however not before fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the adoption and the implementation approach to be used.

3. Acquisitions
2015 Acquisition
Effectively February 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of J-Mac Tool, Inc. (“J-Mac”) for aggregate consideration of approximately
$61.9 million. J-Mac is a Fort Worth, Texas based manufacturer of high quality hydraulic fracturing pumps, power ends, fluid ends and other
pump accessories. J-Mac is included in the Completions segment. As the value of certain assets and liabilities are preliminary in nature, they
are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, including
any post-closing purchase price adjustments. When the valuation is final, any changes to the preliminary valuation of acquired assets and
liabilities could result in adjustments to identified intangibles and goodwill. The following table summarizes the current fair values of the assets

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment annually or whenever an event indicating impairment may
have occurred. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company elected to change the date of the Company's annual assessments of
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment from December 31 to October 1. This is a change in method of applying an
accounting principle, which management believes is a preferable alternative as it better aligns the timing of the assessment with our planning
and forecasting process and alleviates constraints on accounting resources during our annual reporting process. The change in the
assessment date does not delay, accelerate, or avoid a potential impairment charge.

At October 1, 2015, the Company performed its annual impairment test on each of the reporting units and concluded that there had been no
impairment because the estimated fair values of each of those reporting units exceeded its carrying value. Relevant events and circumstances
which could have a negative impact on goodwill include: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market conditions, such as commodity
prices; operating cost factors; overall financial performance; the impact of dispositions and acquisitions; and other entity-specific events.
Further declines in commodity prices or sustained lower valuation for the Company's common stock could indicate a reduction in the estimate
of reporting unit fair value which, in turn, could lead to an impairment of reporting unit goodwill.
After October 1, 2015, the Company continued to monitor events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on estimates of
reporting unit fair value. Commodity prices have remained at low levels and the active rig count has continued to decline resulting in a
significant decline in the Company’s market capitalization. While the Company incorporated a downturn into its forecasts in this October 1
annual test, several factors occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2015 that indicated an occurrence of further declines in market activity.  These
factors include: 1) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed that its members would not reduce production even in the face
of low commodity prices and excess global oil supply; 2) oil prices declined further; 3) a consensus expectation developed that oil prices
would stay lower for longer than previously expected; 4) exploration and production companies significantly decreased their budgets as the
demand for oil and gas was lower and production was significantly less economical for them; and 5) macroeconomic concerns developed
regarding a slowdown in the global economy. Due to this further deterioration of market conditions for our products, the Company performed
an impairment test on all six reporting units. The Company identified and recorded an impairment charge of $123.2 million for its Subsea
reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2015. If these market conditions continue to exist, the Company may have additional
impairment charges in its reporting units in the future. Following the impairment charge, at December 31, 2015, our Subsea reporting unit has
a remaining balance of $73 million in goodwill. Further declines in commodity prices or sustained lower valuation for the Company's common
stock could indicate a reduction in the estimate of reporting unit fair value which, in turn, could lead to an additional impairment charges
associated with goodwill.
The fair values were determined using the net present value of the expected future cash flows for each reporting unit. During the Company’s
goodwill impairment analysis, the Company determines the fair value of each of its reporting units as a whole using a discounted cash flow
analysis, which requires significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit. The assumptions about
future cash flows and growth rates are based on our current budget for 2016 and for future periods, as well as our strategic plans and
management’s beliefs about future activity levels. The discount rate we used for future periods could change substantially if the cost of debt or
equity were to significantly increase or decrease, or if we were to choose different comparable companies in determining the appropriate
discount rate for our reporting units. Forecasted cash flows in future periods were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which
considered long-term earnings growth rates. Accumulated impairment losses on goodwill were $168.8 million and $45.6 million as of
December 31, 2015, and 2014. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount
may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an impairment loss of $1.9 million was recorded on certain intangible
assets within the Drilling and Subsea segment. The impaired intangible assets included trade names that were no longer in use and is
recorded under "Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill" in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). No indicators of
intangible asset impairment occurred during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
Amortization expense was $27.3 million, $27.7 million and $24.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Senior Notes Due 2021
In October 2013, the Company issued $300.0 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021 at par, and in November 2013, the Company
issued an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes at a price of 103.25% of par, plus accrued interest from October 2,
2013 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum, payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, and
mature on October 1, 2021. Net proceeds from the issuance of approximately $394.0 million, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and
offering expenses and excluding accrued interest paid by the purchasers, were used for the repayment of the then-outstanding term loan
balance and a portion of the revolving Credit Facility balance.
The terms of the Senior Notes are governed by the indenture, dated October 2, 2013 (the “Indenture”), between the Company, the guarantors
named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations,
and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Amended Facility and rank junior to,
among other indebtedness, the Amended Facility to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Amended Facility. The Senior Notes
contain customary covenants including some limitations and restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends on, purchase or redeem its
common stock or purchase or redeem its subordinated debt; make certain investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue
certain types of equity securities; create certain liens, sell assets, including equity interests in its restricted subsidiaries; redeem or prepay
subordinated debt; restrict dividends or other payments of its restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; and create unrestricted subsidiaries. Many of these restrictions will terminate if the Senior Notes
become rated investment grade. The Indenture also contains customary events of default, including nonpayment, breach of covenants in the
Indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy and
insolvency. The Company is required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes in connection with specified change in control events or with
excess proceeds of asset sales not applied for permitted purposes.
The Company may redeem the Senior Notes due 2021:
beginning on October 1, 2016 at a redemption price of 104.688% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any; then
at a redemption price of 103.125% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, for the twelve-
•
•
•month period beginning October 1, 2017; then
at a redemption price of 101.563% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, for the twelve-
month period beginning October 1, 2018; and then
at a redemption price of 100.000% of their principal amount plus accrued interest and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, beginning
on October 1, 2019.
We may also redeem some or all of the Senior Notes due 2021 before October 1, 2016 at a redemption price of 100.000% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus an applicable premium.

In addition, before October 1, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount with the proceeds of certain equity offerings
at 106.250% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any; we may make such redemption only if,
after any such redemption, at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount originally issued remains outstanding.
Credit Facility
The Company had a Credit Facility, with a maturity date of November 2018, with several financial institutions as lenders, which provides for a
$600.0 million credit facility with up to $75.0 million available for letters of credit and up to $25.0 million in swingline loans. As of December 31,
2015, we had no of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, $12.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and the capacity to borrow an
additional $323.7 million under the Credit Facility. Weighted average interest rates under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2015 and 2014
were approximately 2.00%
On February 25, 2016, the Company amended its senior secured Credit Facility to reduce commitment fees and provide borrowing capacity for
general corporate purposes. The Amended Facility provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit line, including up to $25.0 million available for
letters of credit and up to $10.0 million in swingline loans. Availability under the Amended Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated by
reference to eligible accounts receivable in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, eligible inventory in the United States, and cash
on hand.
The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2015 and through the effective date of
the Amended Facility. The Company anticipates that it will continue to be in compliance with the Amended Facility throughout 2016.
Subject to terms of the Amended Facility, the Company has the ability to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $150.0 million.
The Amended Facility contains covenants which require the Company, on a consolidated basis, to maintain specified financial ratios or
conditions summarized as follows:
Senior secured debt to adjusted EBITDA of not more than 4.50 to 1.0 for the period from February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2016, not
more than 4.0 to 1.0 for the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and not more than 3.50 to 1.0 for the period from January
1, 2018 through the termination of the facility; and
A fixed charge coverage ratio of not more than 1.25 to 1.0. This ratio is measured as EBITDA minus maintenance capital expenditures minus
taxes paid in cash divided by scheduled principal and interest payments.The fixed charge coverage ratio is tested only if availability under the
Amended Facility falls below certain levels.
Other debt
Other debt consists primarily of various capital leases of equipment.
Debt issue costs
The Company has incurred loan costs that have been capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Senior Notes and
the Credit Facility. As a result, approximately $2.6 million, $2.6 million and $2.2 million were amortized to interest expense for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The estimated term over which debt issue costs related to the term loan were being
amortized was revised in connection with the repayment of the term loan from the issuance of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, debt issue costs
of $2.1 million that had been previously capitalized were charged to expense in 2013.
The Company reclassified $6.4 million and $7.5 million of deferred loan costs related to the Senior Notes to Long term Debt as of
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1.9 million U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and $0.7 million state net operating losses. The
losses will expire no later than 2035 if they are not utilized prior to that date. The Company had $3.5 million of non-U.S. net operating loss
carryforwards with indefinite expiration dates. The Company anticipates being able to fully utilize the losses prior to their expiration.
At December 31, 2015, the Company had no foreign tax credit carryforwards.
Goodwill from certain acquisitions is tax deductible due to the acquisition structure as an asset purchase or due to tax elections made by the
Company and the respective sellers at the time of acquisition.
The Company believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 will be utilized to offset future
taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Consequently, no valuation allowance has been recorded in the financial
statements.
As discussed in Note 2, "Recent Accounting Pronouncements", during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected to early adopt the
recently issued guidance requiring all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be presented as non-current on the consolidated
balance sheet. Adoption of this guidance resulted in the reclassification of the current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current in our
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

Taxes are provided as necessary with respect to non-U.S. earnings that are not permanently reinvested. For all other non-U.S. earnings, no
U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely to finance non-U.S. activities. The determination of
the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in non-US subsidiaries is not practicable.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. as well as in various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is
no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in these jurisdictions prior to 2009.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with guidance in FASB ASC 740, which prescribes the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions is as follows (in thousands):

Deferred tax benefits on uncertain tax position related to U.S. and non-U.S. income tax —
Net balance at December 31, 2015
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 was $8.4 million, of which it is reasonably possible that $2.2 million could
be settled during the next twelve-month period as a result of the conclusion of various tax audits or due to the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 would impact the Company’s future effective
income tax rate, if recognized.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated
statement of income. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accrued approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in interest
and penalties. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized no material change in the interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions.
10. Fair value measurements
At December 31, 2015, the Company had no debt outstanding under the Credit Facility and all of the debt under this facility incurs interest at a
variable interest rate and therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of the debt is classified as a Level 2
measurement because interest rates charged are similar to other financial instruments with similar terms and maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and is based on quoted prices for
those or similar instruments. At December 31, 2015, the fair value and the carrying value of the Company’s unsecured Senior Notes
approximated $334.1 million and $402.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the fair value and the carrying value of the Company’s
Senior Notes approximated $378.1 million and $402.8 million, respectively.
There were no other outstanding financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 that required measuring the amounts at fair value
on a recurring basis. The Company did not change its valuation techniques associated with recurring fair value measurements from prior
periods and there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2015.

11. Commitments and contingencies
Litigation
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is, and in the future, could be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions, some of
which may or may not be covered by insurance. Management has reviewed such pending judicial and legal proceedings, the reasonably
anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings, and the availability and limits of insurance coverage, and has
established reserves that are believed to be appropriate in light of those outcomes that are believed to be probable and can be estimated. The
reserves accrued at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are immaterial. In the opinion of management, the Company's ultimate liability, if any, with
respect to these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
Asbestos litigation
One of our subsidiaries has been named as one of many defendants in a number of product liability claims for alleged exposure to asbestos.
These lawsuits are typically filed on behalf of plaintiffs who allege exposure to asbestos, against numerous defendants, often 40 or more, who
may have manufactured or distributed products containing asbestos. The injuries alleged by plaintiffs in these cases range from mesothelioma
and other cancers to asbestosis. The earliest claims against our subsidiary were filed in New Jersey in 1998, and our subsidiary currently has
active cases in Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and Illinois. These complaints do not typically include requests for a specific amount of
damages. The trademark for the product line with asbestos exposure was acquired in 1985. Our subsidiary has been successful in obtaining
dismissals in many lawsuits where the exposure is alleged to have occurred prior to our acquisition of the trademark. The law in some states
does not find purchasers of product lines to have tort liability for incidents occurring prior to the acquisition date unless they assumed the
responsibility or in certain other circumstances. The law in certain other states on so called “successor liability” may be different or ambiguous
in this regard. Most claimants alleging illnesses due to asbestos sue on the basis of exposure prior to 1985, as by that date the hazards of
asbestos exposure were well known and asbestos had begun to fall into disuse in industrial settings. To date, asbestos claims have not had a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow, as our annual out-of-pocket costs over the last
five years has been less than $200,000. There are typically fewer than 100 cases filed against our subsidiary each year, and a similar number
of cases are dismissed, settled or otherwise disposed of each year. We currently have fewer than 200 lawsuits pending against this subsidiary.
Our subsidiary has over $17 million in face amount of insurance per occurrence and over $23 million of aggregate primary insurance
coverage; a portion of the coverage has been eroded by payments made by insurers. In addition, our subsidiary has over $950 million in face
amount of excess coverage applicable to the claims. There can be no guarantee that all of this can be collected due to policy terms and
conditions and insurer insolvencies in the past or in the future. In January 2011, we entered into an agreement with seven of our primary
insurers under which they have agreed to pay 80% of the costs of handling and settling each asbestos claim against the affected subsidiary.
After an initial period, and under certain circumstances, our subsidiary and the subscribing insurers may withdraw from this agreement.
Portland Harbor Superfund litigation
In May 2009, one of the Company's subsidiaries (which is presently a dormant company with nominal assets except for rights under insurance
policies) was named along with many defendants in a suit filed by the Port of Portland, Oregon seeking reimbursement of costs related to a
five-year study of contaminated sediments at the port. In March 2010, the subsidiary also received a notice letter from the Environmental
Protection Agency indicating that it had been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to environmental contamination in the
"study area" for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. Under a 1997 indemnity agreement, the subsidiary is indemnified by a third party with
respect to losses relating to environmental contamination. As required under the indemnity agreement, the subsidiary provided notice of these
claims, and the indemnitor has assumed responsibility and is providing a defense of the claims. Although the Company believes that it is
unlikely that the subsidiary contributed to the contamination at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, the potential liability of the subsidiary and
the ability of the indemnitor to fulfill its indemnity obligations cannot be quantified at this time.
Flow Valve litigation
On March 28, 2013 Flow Valve, LLC filed suit against the Company and others in the Eastern District of Oklahoma alleging patent
infringement and requesting an injunction against continued infringement, accounting for damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. The case was
transferred to the Western District of Oklahoma by agreement on November 27, 2013.  The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 4,
2014 that added a request for trebling of
24
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
damages on the patent infringement claim.  The amended complaint also added a count for violation of Oklahoma’s Uniform Trade Secrets
Act, and requested actual and punitive damages in addition to their existing requests for relief.  Subsequent to the filing of the amended
complaint, the plaintiff provided an expert damages report stating that their damages amounted to approximately $61 million.  The Company
believes that this action is without merit and intends to vigorously defend this litigation.
Operating leases
The Company has operating leases for warehouse, office space, manufacturing facilities and equipment. The leases generally require the
Company to pay certain expenses including taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities. The minimum future lease commitments under
noncancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2015 are as follows:
$18,153

Total rent expense was $20.9 million, $20.8 million and $19.0 million under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively.
Letters of credit and guarantees
The Company executes letters of credit in the normal course of business to secure the delivery of product from specific vendors and also to
guarantee the Company fulfilling certain performance obligations relating to certain large contracts. At December 31, 2015, the Company had
$12.7 million in letters of credit.
12. Stockholders' equity and employee benefit plans
Warrants
The warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2013 were recorded to stockholders’ equity at their fair value at the time of issuance. During the
year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's largest shareholder converted all of its 6,366,072 warrants pursuant to the terms of a warrant
agreement and received 4,227,358 shares of the Company's common stock. All outstanding warrants expired on October 11, 2014 and were
converted into shares of the Company's common stock. There were no outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2015.
Employee benefit plans
The Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan for US employees and related savings plans for certain non-US employees. These plans
benefit eligible employees by allowing them the opportunity to make contributions up to certain limits. The Company contributes by matching a
percentage of each employee's contributions. In 2015, for certain plans, the Company suspended the matching of contributions. Subsequent to
the closing of all acquisitions, employees of those acquired entities will generally be eligible to participate in the Company's 401(k) savings
plan. The Company also has the discretion to provide a profit sharing contribution to each participant depending on the Company’s
performance for the applicable year. The expense under the Company's plan was $2.2 million, $10.8 million and $8.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock
at six-month intervals through periodic payroll deductions at a price per share equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the
beginning and ending of the six-month intervals.
Stock repurchases
In October 2014, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of outstanding shares of the Company's
common stock with an aggregate purchase price of up to $150.0 million. Shares may be repurchased under the program from time to time, in
amounts and at prices that are deemed appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, credit facility restrictions, applicable legal
requirements and other considerations. The
25
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
Company has purchased approximately 4.5 million shares under this program for aggregate consideration of approximately $100.2 million.
13. Stock based compensation
FET share-based compensation plan
In August 2010, the Company created the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to allow for employees, directors and consultants of the
Company and its subsidiaries to maintain stock ownership in the Company through the award of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units or any combination thereof. Under the terms of the Plan, 18.5 million shares have been authorized for awards and approximately 9.1
million shares remained available for future grants as of December 31, 2015.
The total amount of share-based compensation expense recorded was approximately $21.7 million, $18.8 million and $19.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the Company expects to record share-based
compensation expense of approximately $34.8 million over the remaining term of the restricted stock and options of approximately 2 years.
Future stock option grants will result in additional compensation expense.
Stock options
The exercise price of each option is based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. Options generally have a ten-
year life and vest annually in equal increments over three or four years. The Company’s policy for issuing stock upon a stock option exercise is
to issue new shares. Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. The following tables
provide additional information related to the options:

2014 and 2013 .
Performance share awards
During 2015, the Company granted 161,660 performance share awards with service-vesting and market-vesting conditions. These awards
may settle between zero and two shares of the Company's common stock. The number of shares issued pursuant to the performance share
awards will be determined based on the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock as compared to a group of peer companies,
measured annually over a one year, two year, and three-year performance period.
14. Related party transactions
The Company entered into lease agreements for office and warehouse space and has sold and purchased inventory, services and fixed
assets to and from various affiliates of certain directors. The dollar amounts related to these related party activities are not significant to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

15. Business segments
Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments. Completions was designated as a separate segment in
recognition of its expanded operations and its significant growth potential. The Company is reporting its results of operations in the following
three reportable segments: Drilling & Subsea ("D&S"), Completions and Production & Infrastructure ("P&I"), instead of the original two
reportable segments. Management’s change in the composition of the Company’s reporting segments was made in order to align with activity
drivers and the customers of our product group, and how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. This change is reflected
on a retrospective basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The D&S segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related services to the drilling and subsea construction and
services markets. The Completions segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and provides related services to the well
construction, completion, stimulation, and intervention markets. The P&I segment designs, manufactures and supplies products, and provides
related equipment and services for production and infrastructure markets.
The Company’s reportable segments are strategic units that offer distinct products and services. They are managed separately since each
business segment requires different marketing strategies. Operating segments have not been aggregated as part of a reportable segment. The
Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income. This segmentation is representative of the
manner in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") and our Board of Directors view the business. We consider the CODM to be
the Chief Executive Officer.
