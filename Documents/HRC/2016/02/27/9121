<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This note is intended to provide some background information pertaining to the work 
accomplished by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action during the first part of its sixth session 
(21 January to 1 February 2008). 
</p>
<p><b>Change in mandate of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>2. Following the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action at the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in 
Durban in 2001, the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2002/68, created the 
Intergovernmental Working Group. Pursuant to this resolution, its mandate was: &#8220;(a) To make 
recommendations with a view to the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action;&#8221; and &#8220;(b) To prepare complementary international standards to strengthen 
and update international instruments against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance in all their aspects&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. Regarding the preparation of complementary international standards, the 
Intergovernmental Working Group has devoted an important part of its agenda to discussions on 
the following questions: (a) Are there gaps in the legal framework for countering racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; (b) If so, how are they to be filled? Answers 
to these questions should contribute to strengthen and update international instruments against 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all their aspects in 
accordance to recommendation 199 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>4. The fifth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group (3-7 September 2007) marked 
the conclusion and closure of its debates and deliberations on the issue of complementary 
international standards, as the Human Rights Council, in its decision 3/103, entrusted this task to 
the Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of complementary international standards. The present 
Intergovernmental Working Group mandate consists in making recommendations with a view to 
the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>5. The former Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Intergovernmental Working Group, 
Juan Martabit (Chile), transmitted its report to the sixth session of the Human Rights Council 
on 25 September 2007 and, in a letter dated 25 October 2007, informed the Council of his 
resignation as Chairperson-Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p><b>The first part of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Intergovernmental Working Group held the first part of its sixth session 
from 21 January to 1 February 2008. Following the opening of the session, Dayan Jayatilleka 
(Sri Lanka) was elected Chairperson-Rapporteur and it adopted its agenda. Thereafter, the 
session was postponed to the following week to allow sufficient time to develop its programme 
of work. </p>

</p>
<p>7. Following a series of informal consultations with regional groups and individual 
delegations toward the preparation of a draft programme of work, the Intergovernmental 
Working Group resumed its session on 28 January 2008. With the view to achieve consensus as 
to the contents of the programme of work, additional discussions were held in plenary and the 
programme of work for the first part of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental<b> </b>Working 
Group was adopted by consensus on 29 January. The meeting of 30 January marked the 
beginning of its substantive work. 
</p>
<p>8. Consistent with its agenda and programme of work, the Intergovernmental<b> </b>Working Group 
proceeded to examine agenda item 3, entitled &#8220;Overview of recommendations as part of 
contribution to the Durban Review Conference&#8221;. This item of the agenda and programme of 
work reflects the request from the Preparatory Committee of the Durban Review Conference 
under decision PC.1/10 of the Preparatory Committee at its first session (see A/62/375) and 
Human Rights Council resolution 3/2 of 8 December 2006, in which it requested that the 
Intergovernmental Working Group and other mechanisms &#8220;assist the Preparatory Committee 
by undertaking review and submitting recommendations, through the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, as contributions to the outcome of the Review 
Conference&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>9. The preparation of the contribution of the Intergovernmental Working Group was 
undertaken on the basis of a document (A/CONF.211/PC.2/7) entitled &#8220;Compilations of 
conclusions and recommendations&#8221; containing the recommendations and conclusions adopted by 
consensus through its five sessions. The Intergovernmental<b> </b>Working Group agreed not to engage 
in a process of renegotiation of its conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>10. The review of previous recommendations began with the first session of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group in 2003 through its fifth session in 2007. In its contribution, 
the recommendations and conclusions have been either updated, deleted or italicized to indicate 
their non-relevance. The Intergovernmental Working Group removed references to 
complementary standards from its contribution as its mandate in this regard had been altered. Its 
review resulted in the adoption of the document entitled: &#8220;Compilation of conclusions and 
recommendations adopted by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action&#8221; (A/CONF.211/PC.2/7),<b> 
</b>which was submitted to the Preparatory Committee of the Durban Review Conference as part of 
the Intergovernmental Working Group&#8217;s contribution. The first part of the sixth session ended 
with the adoption of the narrative part of the report on its future work. 
</p>
<p><b>The second part of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>11. The second part of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group is 
scheduled to be held from 3 to 7 November 2008. It has held consultations to decide on the 
programme of work of the second part of its session. At the consultation with regional </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/WG.3/2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>coordinators held on 22 September 2008, the Chairperson-Rapporteur suggested that the 
Intergovernmental Working Group could organize its work on the basis of the document it 
submitted to the Preparatory Committee as its contribution. The suggested programme of work 
benefited from support by consensus on the part of the regional coordinators. 
</p>
<p>12. Hence, at the second part of its session, the Intergovernmental Working Group will hold 
discussions on the identification of best practices regarding the implementation of the 
recommendations it has issued in the course of its five sessions (omitting those on 
complementary standards, which fall under the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee)
