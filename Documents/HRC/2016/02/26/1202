<p><b>26/&#8230;  Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all previous General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions 
on the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, </p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol 
thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and recalling the 
Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the 
Prostitution of Others, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182), the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 
189) and the Domestic Workers Recommendation, 2011 (No. 201) of the International 
Labour Organization, and recalling the adoption by the Organization in 2014 of the 
Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention and  the Recommendation on Supplementary 
Measures for the Effective Suppression of Forced Labour, 2014 (No. 203), 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the decision of the General Assembly to declare 30 July World Day 
against Trafficking in Persons,1 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note also </i>of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights 
and Human Trafficking2 and the commentary thereon developed by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons and Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 20/3 of 15 
April 2011, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the 
vulnerability of trafficked persons to human rights violations and abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that trafficking in persons violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, continues to pose a serious challenge to 
humanity and requires a concerted international assessment and response and genuine 
multilateral, regional and bilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and 
destination for its eradication, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that victims of human trafficking are exposed to multiple forms of 
discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of gender, age, race, disability, 
ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as national or social origin or other status, and that 
these forms of discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that persons without nationality or birth registration are 
particularly vulnerable to trafficking, </p>
<p><i>Noting with concern</i> that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, 
exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, </p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to 
prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate instances of trafficking and punish 
perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection and access to remedies, 
and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of the work of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, in the prevention and promotion of and global
