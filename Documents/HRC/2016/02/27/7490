<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first United 
Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. The 
original mandate derives from Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 
February 1980. The mandate was most recently extended by the Human Rights Council in 
its resolution 16/16 of 24 March 2011 and decision 25/116.  
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In that 
humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
family members of victims of enforced disappearance and other sources reporting cases of 
disappearances, and the Governments concerned. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 47/133 and of the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (hereinafter &#8220;the 
Declaration&#8221;), the Working Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in 
fulfilling their obligations derived from the Declaration. The Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 7/12, encouraged the Working Group to provide assistance in the implementation 
by States of the Declaration and of existing international rules.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report reflects the activities of and communications and cases examined 
by the Working Group covering the period from 10 November 2012 to 16 May 2014.1 A 
summary of the decisions on individual cases taken by the Working Group and 
communications transmitted to the States concerned during the reporting period is 
presented in a table (see sect. III).  
</p><p>5. Since its inception, the Working Group has transmitted a total of 54,405 cases to 
Governments. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet been 
clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 43,250 in a total of 88 States. The Working 
Group has been able to clarify 254 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group is concerned that many communications from Governments are 
not still translated in time, thus delaying their consideration by the Working Group and 
limiting its humanitarian mandate.  
</p>
<p>7. Information on the website of the Working Group remains inadequate. The majority 
of the content is in English only. The Working Group once again calls on the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide adequate resources to 
bring it up to date and render it more accessible.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group is grateful for the voluntary contributions provided by donor 
States, notably Argentina and France. It notes, however, that, despite the efforts made, 
almost 600 cases reporting allegations of enforced disappearances still need to be reviewed. 
The Working Group considers reducing the backlog of cases as one of its priorities. Given 
that the Working Group continues to regularly receive a high number of newly reported 
cases and taking into account all its other activities, it is essential that additional and 
sustained support be provided by the United Nations under its regular budget to fulfil the 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 As of 2014, the Working Group will report to the Human Rights Council at its September sessions. </p>


<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 10 November 2012 to 16 May 2014 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>9. During the period under review, the Working Group held five sessions: the ninety-
ninth session, from 11 to 15 March 2013;2 the 100th session, from 15 to 19 July 2013;3 the 
101st session, from 4 to 13 November 2013;4 the 102nd session, from 3 to 7 February 
2014;5 and the 103rd session, from 7 to 16 May 2014.6 The 100th session was held in New 
York and the other sessions were held in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>10. Further to its comments in its last annual report (A/HRC/22/45 and Corr.1, para. 5) 
the Working Group has adopted the practice of producing post-sessional documents to 
allow the translation of information on and timely reporting on its activities. It commenced 
the practice at its ninety-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>11. Post-sessional documents were adopted and published after the ninety-ninth 
(A/HRC/WGEID/99/1); 100th (A/HRC/WGEID/100/1); 101st (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1); 
102nd (A/HRC/WGEID/102/1); and 103rd (A/HRC/WGEID/103/1) sessions. Those post-
sessional documents should be considered complements to the present annual report.  
</p>
<p>12. The post of Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group was held by Olivier de 
Frouville until 30 September 2013. As from 1 October 2013, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group is Ariel Dulitzky. Osman El-Hajj&#233; was elected Vice-Chairperson 
during the ninety-ninth session of the Working Group. Jeremy Sarkin completed his 
appointment as a member of the Working Group on 31 May 2014. A new member, Houria 
Es Slami, was appointed in May 2014 to replace Mr. Sarkin. The other member of the 
Working Group is Jasminka Dzumhur. 
</p>
<p>13. On 5 March 2013, the Chairperson-Rapporteur presented the annual report of the 
Working Group for 2012 to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session, and 
participated in the interactive dialogue with Member States.7 
</p>
<p>14. On 24 October 2013, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group addressed 
the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and participated in the interactive dialogue 
with Member States.8 That was the second consecutive time that the Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group addressed the General Assembly, which was highly 
valued and appreciated.

<p>15. On 15 July 2013, the Working Group held a commemorative event marking its 
100th session,9 which provided an opportunity to reflect on the achievements made during

enforced disappearance.  
</p>
<p>16. On 8 November 2013, an expert consultation on enforced disappearance and

cultural rights. The Working Group is currently preparing a study on the linkages between 
enforced disappearance and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>17. During the reporting period, all the members of the Working Group carried out a

<p><b>  Referral of claims of crimes against humanity to other bodies  
</b></p>
<p>32. As highlighted in its methods of work (A/HRC/WGEID/102/2, para. 48) and its 
general comment on enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity (A/HRC/13/31 
and Corr.1, para. 39), when there are claims of practices of enforced disappearances which 
may amount to crimes against humanity, the Working Group evaluates those claims and, if 
appropriate, may refer them to the competent authorities, be they international, regional or 
domestic. In the light of the seriousness of the situation in relation to enforced 
disappearances in the Syrian Arab Republic (A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, paras. 156 and 157), 
and in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, paras. 67 and 
68), the Working Group wrote to the President of the Human Rights Council, the President 
of the General Assembly, the President of the Security Council and the Secretary-General 
to request the adoption of any appropriate action that they may deem appropriate. In 
particular, the Working Group requested the President of the Security Council to bring the 
matters to the attention of the Council for any appropriate action, including a possible 
referral to the International Criminal Court. The Working Group informed the respective 
Governments of that step in letters dated 5 March 2014 and 12 June 2014, respectively.

<p>52. On 11 March 2014, the Working Group issued a press release calling on the 
Government of Thailand to establish the truth and hold criminally responsible the 
perpetrators of the disappearance of human rights defender Somchai Neelaphaijit, 10 years 
after his disappearance.30  
</p>
<p>53. On 18 March 2014, the Working Group issued a press release expressing dismay at 
the death of Shunli Cao, a prominent human rights lawyer in China, who had tirelessly 
campaigned since 2008 for transparency and greater participation of civil society in the 
second universal periodic review of China.31 
</p>
<p>54. On 20 March 2014, the Working Group issued a press release calling for action by 
the highest United Nations bodies to tackle enforced disappearances as crimes against 
humanity in the Syrian Arab Republic.32  
</p>
<p><b> G. Methods of work  
</b></p>
<p>55. During its 102nd session, on 7 February 2014, the Working Group adopted the 
revised methods of work (A/HRC/WGEID/102/2), which, taking into account the evolving 
nature and new dimensions of the crime of enforced disappearance, render the Working 
Group more efficient and enable it to respond more swiftly to urgent matters, including 
transmitting information received on outstanding cases and other communications more 
promptly.

<p><b> IV. Observations 
</b>56. In addition to the observations formulated in its post-sessional documents (see para. 
11 above), the Working Group makes the following country-specific observations based on 
the cooperation received and on significant developments regarding its mandate during the 
whole reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government for the invitation 
extended to it to undertake a visit to the country during the second semester of 2014 and 
looks forward to the confirmation of dates for the visit, based on the three options provided 
by the Working Group in its note verbale dated 13 May 2014.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group notes with concern that it has transmitted three prompt 
intervention letters during the reporting period concerning the alleged excessive use of 
force and arrest of relatives of victims of enforced disappearances participating in peaceful 
protests (see A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, para. 9, and A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 9&#8211;10). 
While thanking the Government for its responses to two of the communications, the 
Working Group recalls article 13, paragraph 3, of the Declaration, which provides that steps 
shall be taken to ensure that all involved in the investigation of an enforced disappearance, 
including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting the investigation, are 
protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. It would also like to recall Human 
Rights Council resolution 21/4, in which the Council urged States to take steps to provide 
adequate protection to, among others, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
disappearances and families of disappeared persons against any intimidation, persecution, 
reprisals or ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group thanks the Government for the reply to the general allegation 
sent on 30 December 2013, concerning the discovery of a mass grave near Ras El-Ma, 
Azzaba in the Wilaya of Skikda (A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, para. 30). The Working Group 
encourages the Government to continue the investigations, identify the remains and keep 
the relatives and the Working Group informed of the results. In that respect, the Working 
Group recalls article 13, paragraph 4, of the Declaration which provides that the findings of 
investigation into cases of enforced disappearances shall be made available upon request to 
all persons concerned, unless doing so would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group is concerned that, during the reporting period, it transmitted to 
the Government six cases under its urgent action procedure (A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, paras. 
33&#8211;35, and A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, paras. 36&#8211;37) and two urgent appeals 
(A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, para. 20, and A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, para. 38). While the 
Working Group appreciates that the Government has replied to most communications and 
notes that four cases have been clarified, it is concerned at what seems to be a recent pattern 
of short-term disappearances. The Working Group recalls articles 7 (&#8220;no circumstances 
whatsoever &#8230; may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances&#8221;) and 10 (&#8220;accurate 
information on the detention of such persons and their place or places of detention, 
including transfers, shall be made promptly available to their family members, their counsel 
or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in the information&#8221;) of the Declaration. </p>


<p><b>  Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Working Group regrets that no reply has been received to three urgent appeals 
and one prompt intervention letter transmitted during the reporting period 
(A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, para. 17; A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, paras. 16&#8211;17; and 
A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, para. 42). It also regrets that no information has been received from 
the Government in connection with a general allegation transmitted on 4 May 2011, 
concerning the alleged frequent use of enforced disappearance as a tool by law enforcement 
agencies, paramilitary and armed forces to detain and even extrajudicially execute 
individuals (see A/HRC/22/45, para. 33). The Working Group is concerned about the 
reported harassment against and detention of Adilur Rahman Khan, the Secretary of 
Odhikar, a human rights non-governmental organization which reports on cases of enforced 
disappearances and works with the families of disappeared persons 
(A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, para. 42).  
</p><p>62. On 12 March 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
to the country. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply can be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Belarus 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group regrets that, during the reporting period, the Government of 
Belarus reported that it will no longer be able to take part in the consideration of three 
specific cases. The Working Group hopes that the Government will resume its cooperation 
with the mechanism and recalls in that respect Human Rights Council resolution 21/4,in 
which the Council urged States to cooperate with the Working Group to help it to carry out 
its mandate effectively.  
</p>
<p>64. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. Despite a reminder sent in 2013, no response yet has been received from the 
Government. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group thanks the Government for its substantive responses to the 
general allegations transmitted on 15 May 2009 and 4 May 2011. Concerning the response 
to the general allegation dated 4 May 2011 (A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, paras. 25&#8211;26), regarding 
the Government&#8217;s alleged failure to clarify the fate and whereabouts of the victims of the 
Kori&#263;anske Stijene massacre, the Working Group reiterates its request to be informed of the 
results of the pending criminal proceedings of those accused of committing the crime of 
enforced disappearance.  
</p>
<p>66. With respect to the general allegation sent on 1 April 2014 (A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, 
para. 43), concerning the effect of the decision of the Constitutional Court in 2013 to order 
the quashing of the verdicts in the cases of 10 individuals convicted of war crimes against 
civilians and genocide as a result of an automatic application of a European Court of 
Human Rights decision, the Working Group reiterates that enforced disappearance is a 
continuous crime and thus can be punished on the basis of an ex post legislation without 
violating the principle of non-retroactivity, for as long as the fate or the whereabouts of the 
disappeared person has not been clarified (A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 57; see also the 
Working Group&#8217;s general comment on enforced disappearance as a continuous crime, 
A/HRC/16/48, para. 39).  
</p><p>67. The follow-up report on the implementation of the recommendations made by the 
Working Group after its visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2010 (A/HRC/16/48/Add.1) </p>


<p>can be found in document A/HRC/27/49/Add.3. The Working Group thanks the 
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for its cooperation throughout the process.  
</p>
<p><b>  Central African Republic  
</b></p>
<p>68. The Working Group is deeply concerned at the situation in the Central African 
Republic, as reflected by a general allegation transmitted and a press release issued, 
respectively, on 16 July and 5 August 2013 (A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, para. 21, and 
A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, para. 23), highlighting the numerous human rights violations 
occurring in the country, including enforced disappearances. Although the Working Group 
has not received many allegations of enforced disappearance under its different procedures, 
it is concerned that the situation has continued to deteriorate towards a total breakdown of 
law and order, which may facilitate the occurrence of multiple human rights violations, 
including enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  China 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Working Group thanks the Government for the high number of replies 
transmitted to the Working Group. Nonetheless, the Working Group is concerned that 
during the reporting period it has transmitted seven cases under its urgent action procedure 
(A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, paras. 29&#8211;30, and A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, para. 46), eight urgent 
appeals (A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, para. 31; A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, paras. 23&#8211;24; 
A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 26&#8211;28; and A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, para. 43) and has issued 
two press releases in relation to the crackdown against human rights defenders prior to the 
presentation to the Human Rights Council made during its universal periodic review and 
the death of Shunli Cao (see paras. 49 and 53 above). The Working Group is also 
concerned about the case of human rights lawyer Zhisheng Gao who has been repeatedly 
disappeared since 2006, and is now reportedly being held incommunicado since 12 January 
</p><p>2013. The Working Group recalls articles 2 (&#8220;no State shall practise, permit or tolerate 
enforced disappearances&#8221;), 7 (&#8220;No circumstances whatsoever &#8230; may be invoked to justify 
enforced disappearances&#8221;) and 10 (&#8220;accurate information on the detention of such persons 
and their place or places of detention, including transfers, shall be made promptly available 
to their family members, their counsel or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in 
the information&#8221;) of the Declaration.  
70. On 19 February 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply can be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group thanks the Government for the substantive replies dated 4 April 
and 9 April 2014 to the general allegation transmitted by the Working Group after its 101st 
session concerning, inter alia, the alarming figures of enforced disappearances, the 
worrying number of human rights defenders victim to that practice in recent years and 
shortcomings regarding the search of the disappeared, the protection of the relatives and 
accountability for that crime (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 33&#8211;41). In that respect, the 
Working Group, while recognizing the measures adopted to address those issues, 
encourages the Government to strengthen the measures adopted, intensify the dialogue with 
the families, speed up the process for the identification of remains and strengthen its efforts 
to combat impunity. </p>


<p><b>  Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group is particularly concerned about the extent and scale of enforced 
disappearance in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, as also highlighted by the 
work of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea (A/HRC/25/63, paras. 75&#8211;76), which has revealed the nature of crime against 
humanity of enforced disappearances that have been committed and are ongoing in the 
country. Consequently, the Working Group has decided to call for action by the highest 
United Nations bodies to tackle the issue and, in particular, has requested the Security 
Council to consider referring the matter to the International Criminal Court (see para. 32 
above). 
</p><p>73. The Working Group regrets that no reply has been received to the general allegation 
dated 3 October 2012 concerning reports of serious human rights violations, including 
enforced disappearances, in the context of an extensive labour camp system for political 
prisoners.38 In that respect, and in relation to the nature of the replies received from the 
Government concerning the cases outstanding before it, the Working Group recalls Human 
Rights Council resolution 21/4, which urges States to cooperate with the Working Group to 
help it to carry out its mandate effectively.  
</p>
<p><b>  Egypt 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Working Group is concerned that during the reporting period, it transmitted 
three cases under the urgent action procedure (A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, paras. 72&#8211;75). The 
Working Group is concerned that the situation continues to deteriorate in Egypt, which may 
facilitate the occurrence of multiple human rights violations, including enforced 
disappearance, and recognizes the need for the Government to adopt measures to secure 
truth, justice and reconciliation.  
</p><p>75. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of reminders 
sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Working Group thanks the Government for the substantive reply dated 12 
March 2014 to the general allegation transmitted after its 101st session concerning, inter 
alia, the risk of jeopardizing the progress on the investigation of cases of enforced 
disappearances owing to the Government&#8217;s stance that it is not possible to investigate 
enforced disappearances committed during the armed conflict, given that the crime of 
enforced disappearance was not punishable by law at the time and because such cases 
would be subject to a statute of limitations (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 55&#8211;64). In that 
respect, the Working Group recalls article 13, paragraph 6 (&#8220;an investigation &#8230; should be 
able to be conducted for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains 
unclarified&#8221;); article 17, paragraph 1 (&#8220;acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be 
considered a continuing offence as long as perpetrators continue to conceal the fate and the 
whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remain unclarified&#8221;); and 
article 18, paragraph 1 (&#8220;persons who have or are alleged to have committed [acts of 
enforced disappearance] shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures

 A press release followed, dated 27 February 2013. </p>


<p>that might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction&#8221;) 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group also reiterates that the establishment of truth and justice are 
fundamental elements both for reparation for the victims and to ensure the non-recurrence 
of the heinous crimes that characterized the civil war, including enforced disappearances. In 
that respect, it expresses concern about the developments in the trial for genocide and 
crimes against humanity of the former head of State, Jos&#233; Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt, and the 
uncertainty caused regarding the right to truth and justice of victims. It is also concerned 
about possible acts of intimidation and interference in the work of the judiciary in that case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Working Group regrets that no reply has been received to the general allegation 
dated 19 December 2013 concerning the lack of implementation of the Parliament&#8217;s 
recommendations to the President and the Government in relation to the issue of enforced 
disappearances between 1997 and 1998 (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 71&#8211;74). The 
Working Group urges the Government to adopt measures to ensure the rights to truth, 
justice and reparations for victims of enforced disappearances.  
</p><p>79. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. No positive response yet has been received from the Government in 
spite of reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received 
soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>80. While thanking the Government for the information it submitted on 3 January 2014 
regarding the case of seven residents of Camp Ashraf (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, para. 76), 
including six women, allegedly abducted in September 2013 after an attack in which 52 
persons were killed, the Working Group reiterates that the information is not sufficient to 
clarify the cases and urges the Government of Iraq to continue its investigations, establish 
the fate and whereabouts of the individuals concerned, ensure that the perpetrators are held 
accountable and publish the results of relevant investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Islamic Republic of Iran  
</b></p>
<p>81. The Working Group reiterates its hope that a final date will be agreed in the near 
future for the visit which was agreed to in 2004 and recalls Human Rights Council 
resolution 21/4, which urges States to cooperate with the Working Group to help it to carry 
out its mandate effectively and, in that framework, to give serious consideration to 
responding favourably to its requests for visits to their countries.  
</p>
<p><b>  Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
</b></p>
<p>82. While thanking the Government for its replies to the communications concerning 
Sombath Somphone, the Working Group reiterates its deep concern about his safety and 
integrity and encourages the Government to continue its investigations into the case and 
keep the Working Group informed thereof. </p>


<p><b>  Libya  
</b></p>
<p>83. The Working Group regrets that its planned visit in 2013 did not transpire because 
of the security situation in the country. The Working Group hopes to be able to visit the 
country in not too distant future.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya  
</b></p>
<p>84. The Working Group is concerned at the lack of replies from the Government to its 
communications. It recalls Human Rights Council resolution 21/4, in which the Council 
urges States to cooperate with the Working Group to help it to carry out its mandate 
effectively. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted to the Government 
one case under its urgent action procedure and two prompt intervention letters in which it 
expressed deep concern about the alleged killing of a human rights lawyer and the 
harassment and intimidation of families of victims of enforced disappearance 
(A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, para. 68, and A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 80&#8211;81). 
</p><p>85. On 19 February 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Morocco 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Working Group thanks the Government for the reply dated 20 February 2014 to 
the general allegation transmitted by the Working Group after its 101st session concerning 
the discovery of the remains of eight persons who had seemingly been buried in a mass 
grave in Fadret Leguiaa (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 96&#8211;103). In that respect, the 
Working Group emphasizes that the families of victims have a right to the truth as 
delineated in the general comment of the Working Group on the right to the truth in relation 
to enforced disappearance (A/HRC/16/48, para. 39), as well as the importance of a full and 
independent investigation into the allegations of enforced disappearances. It also recalls 
article 13, paragraph 4, of the Declaration, which provides that the findings of investigation 
on cases of enforced disappearances shall be made available upon request to all persons 
concerned, unless doing so would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Working Group continues to monitor the situation in Nepal concerning the 
establishment of a truth commission and a commission on enforced disappearance and it 
recalls that amnesties should not be granted for mass violations of human rights. The 
Working Group had already expressed its concern on the issue in the follow-up report to the 
recommendations made in the report of its visit to Nepal in 2004 (A/HRC/19/58/Add.4) and 
a letter sent to the Government of Nepal on 21 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>88. On 12 May 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a follow-
up visit to the country. No positive response yet has been received from the Government in 
spite of reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received 
soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Working Group is concerned that, during the reporting period, it transmitted to 
the Government 24 cases under its urgent action procedure. It reiterates that, as provided in </p>


<p>article 7 of the Declaration, no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify 
enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Working Group welcomes the enactment of the Anti-Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearance Act in December of 2012, which makes the Philippines the first country in 
Asia to criminalize enforced and involuntary disappearances. At the same time, the 
Working Group encourages the Government to ensure effective implementation of the Act 
by taking all necessary measures, including, but not limited to, legal, policy and 
institutional reforms. 
</p>
<p>91. On 3 April 2008, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of reminders 
sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Working Group is concerned that it transmitted three urgent appeals during the 
reporting period (A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, para. 127; A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, para. 104; and 
A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, para. 131) and reminds the Government of its obligations to 
prevent and eradicate enforced disappearance and that, as provided in article 7 of the 
Declaration, no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify enforced 
disappearances. 
</p>
<p>93. On 2 November 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. No positive response has been received yet in spite of reminders. The 
Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Working Group notes with concern that it has transmitted four prompt 
intervention letters during the reporting period concerning the alleged intimidation of and 
reprisals against human rights defenders who work on the issue of enforced disappearances 
(A/HRC/WGEID/99/1, para. 123; A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, para. 94; A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, 
paras. 154&#8211;155). While thanking the Government for its responses to two of those 
communications, the Working Group recalls article 13 of the Declaration which provides 
that steps shall be taken to ensure that all involved in the investigation, including the 
complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting the investigation, are protected 
against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
</p>
<p>95. The Working Group appreciates the replies on a high number of cases from the 
Government of Sri Lanka and hopes that a visit will contribute to the clarification of many 
of the outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group thanks the Government for its response to the general allegation 
sent on the process and methodology of the Presidential Commission on Enforced 
Disappearances and hopes that the challenges identified are addressed in a way that secures 
the right to truth and justice.  
</p><p>97. The Working Group notes resolution 25/1 of the Human Rights Council of 26 
March 2014, which calls for advice and technical assistance by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and special procedures mandate holders, 
urges the Government to cooperate and offers any assistance necessary in that regard.  </p>


<p>98. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit 
to the country. No positive response yet has been received from the Government in spite of 
reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Working Group is particularly concerned about the extent and scale of enforced 
disappearance in the Syrian Arab Republic, as also highlighted by the work of the 
independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, which has 
revealed the nature of crime against humanity of enforced disappearances in the country. 
Consequently, the Working Group has decided to call for action by the highest United 
Nations bodies to tackle that issue and in particular has requested the Security Council to 
consider referring the matter to the International Criminal Court (see para. 32 above). 
</p><p>100. On 19 September 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government in spite of a 
reminder sent in 2013. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply can be received 
soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Thailand 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Working Group reiterates its concern that, 10 years after the disappearance of 
Somchai Neelaphaijit, his fate and whereabouts remain unknown. It urges the Government 
of Thailand to continue the investigations into the case, establish the truth and hold 
criminally responsible the perpetrators of the disappearance. 
</p>
<p>102. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a visit to 
the country. No positive response yet has been received from the Government in spite of 
reminders sent. The Working Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Working Group is concerned about the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, which 
may facilitate the occurrence of enforced disappearances. It reiterates article 7 of the 
Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify 
enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>104. The Working Group is concerned that, during the reporting period, it transmitted to 
the Government 12 cases under its urgent action procedure and 2 urgent appeals 
(A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, paras. 121&#8211;128, A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, paras. 167&#8211;168; 
A/HRC/WGEID/102/1, para. 163; and A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, paras. 181&#8211;185, 189). While 
thanking the Government for replying to most communications and noting that 16 cases 
have been clarified during the reporting period, it is concerned at what seems to be a recent 
pattern of short-term disappearances.  
</p>
<p>105. The Working Group recalls articles 2 (&#8220;no State shall practise, permit or tolerate 
enforced disappearances&#8221;), 7 (&#8220;no circumstances whatsoever ... may be invoked to justify 
enforced disappearances&#8221;) and 10 (&#8220;accurate information on the detention of such persons 
and their place or places of detention, including transfers, shall be made promptly available </p>


<p>to their family members, their counsel or to any other persons having a legitimate interest in 
the information&#8221;) of the Declaration. 
</p><p>106. On 13 September 2013, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
visit to the country. No response yet has been received from the Government. The Working 
Group hopes that a positive reply will be received soon.  
</p>
<p><b>  Uruguay 
</b></p>
<p>107. The Working Group thanks the Government for its response dated 25 July 2013 to 
the general allegation sent on 14 May 2013, concerning the closure, and potential closure, 
of certain judicial cases relating to enforced disappearance, as a consequence of rulings of 
the Supreme Court of Justice, which considered articles 2 and 3 of Law No. 18.831 
(entitled &#8220;Punitive Powers of the State&#8221;) unconstitutional. The concerns expressed in the 
general allegation were reiterated in a press release in June 2013 (see para. 46 above).  
</p><p>108. In that respect, the Working Group recalls that there shall not be special amnesties 
granted for enforced disappearances. It would also like to reiterate that the application of 
statutory limitations when the crime of enforced disappearance is still ongoing or when the 
practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity should be 
considered contrary to the Declaration. In its general comment No. 10 (2010) on the right to 
the truth in relation to enforced disappearance, the Working Group emphasized that the 
State has &#8220;the obligation to investigate until the fate and the whereabouts of the person have 
been clarified&#8221; (para. 5). 
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Working Group notes with concern that it has transmitted six cases under its 
urgent action procedure during the reporting period (A/HRC/WGEID/100/1, para. 144; 
A/HRC/WGEID/101/1, para. 187; and A/HRC/WGEID/103/1, paras. 197&#8211;199). The 
Working Group reminds the Government that, under article 2 of the Declaration, no State 
shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>110. <b>During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 418 newly 
reported cases of disappearance to 42 States. It used the urgent action procedure in 93 
of those cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the receipt 
of the report by the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The number of cases transmitted during the reporting period under the urgent 
action procedure demonstrates that enforced disappearance is not a crime of the past 
but continues to be used across the world with the false and pernicious belief that it is 
a useful tool to preserve national security and combat terrorism or organized crime.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>During the reporting period, the Working Group was able to clarify 47 cases of 
enforced disappearance. More than 43,000 cases still remain unclarified, many dating 
back decades. Cases remain outstanding with the Working Group for a number of 
reasons, notably for the lack of sufficient efforts to establish the fate and whereabouts 
of the disappeared. States should urgently take into account the sufferings of the 
families and strengthen their efforts in searching for the disappeared persons. The 
Working Group emphasized in that respect the importance of expanding the use of 
forensic expertise and DNA testing.  </b></p>


<p>113. <b>In spite of that large number of cases, underreporting remains a major 
problem, and is due to various reasons, including fear of reprisals, weak 
administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems of 
impunity, poverty, illiteracy, language barriers, a practice of silence and restrictions 
on the work of civil society. More assistance should be provided to family members 
and members of civil society to enable them to report cases to the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received from a number of 
States; such cooperation is indispensable for discovering the fate or whereabouts of 
disappeared persons around the globe. Nevertheless, the Working Group remains 
concerned that, of the 88 States with outstanding cases, some have never replied to the 
Working Group and some provide responses that do not contain relevant information. 
The Working Group urges all States to fulfil their obligations under the Declaration 
and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Working Group is concerned that many communications from 
Governments are not translated in time, thus delaying their consideration by the 
Working Group and limiting its humanitarian mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The Working Group is particularly concerned about the extent and scale of 
enforced disappearances in certain countries; these include the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and the Syrian Arab Republic. The Working Group welcomes the 
work of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic and the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, which have revealed the nature of crime against humanity of 
enforced disappearances in those countries. In both cases, the Working Group has 
called for action by the highest United Nations bodies to tackle the issue of enforced 
disappearance and has requested the Security Council to consider referring those 
matters to the International Criminal Court.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>During the reporting period, the Working Group observed a pattern of short-
term enforced disappearances being used in a number of countries, including Bahrain 
and the United Arab Emirates. The Working Group expresses its deep concern at the 
phenomenon. It stresses that there is no time limit, no matter how short, for an 
enforced disappearance to occur and that accurate information on the detention of 
any person deprived of liberty and their place of detention shall be made promptly 
available to their family members.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Working Group is also concerned about the deteriorating situation in the 
Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ukraine. It reiterates article 7 of the 
Declaration, which provides that no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of 
war, a state of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may 
be invoked to justify enforced disappearances.  
</b>119. <b>The Working Group continues to note a pattern of threats, intimidation and 
reprisals against victims of enforced disappearance, including family members, 
witnesses and human rights defenders working on such cases. It calls upon States to 
take specific measures to prevent such acts, protect those working on cases of enforced 
disappearances and punish the perpetrators, in accordance with article 13, 
paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Declaration. The Working Group supports the 
establishment of a United Nations-wide senior focal point to engage with all 
stakeholders, in particular Member States, to promote the prevention of, protection 
against and accountability for reprisals and intimidation related to cooperation with 
the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Country visits are an integral part of the mandate fulfilled the Working Group. 
They allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing enforced </b></p>


<p><b>disappearance, to assist States in reducing obstacles to implement the Declaration, 
and to ensure direct contact with the family members of victims. There are, however, 
a number of States from which the Working Group has requested invitations to visit, 
which have not been forthcoming. Those States include Bangladesh, Belarus, Burundi, 
China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Russian 
Federation, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, 
Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe. There are others that 
have informally invited the Working Group to visit and/or confirmed invitations, but 
for which specific dates to visit have not been agreed, such as Algeria and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. The Working Group therefore calls upon all States with pending 
requests for visits to respond favourably to them in the light of Human Rights Council 
resolution 21/4, and those that have agreed to visits to respond as soon as possible with 
specific dates.

<p>121. <b>The Working Group once again calls upon States that have not signed and/or 
ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance to do so as soon as possible and to accept the competence of the 
Committee on Enforced Disappearances to receive individual cases under article 31, 
and inter-State complaints under article 32 of the Convention.  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Working Group carries out a wide range of activities and receives an 
increasing number of demands from various stakeholders. The resources that have 
been provided to the Working Group under the regular budget are unfortunately not 
sufficient for it to respond to all requests. That also prevents the Working Group from 
properly planning its activities. The Working Group continues to periodically receive 
newly reported cases of enforced disappearance from across the globe while dealing 
with a backlog standing at around 600 cases. The Working Group is grateful to the 
Governments of Argentina and France for their financial contributions, which 
allowed the Working Group to have enhanced support, but emphasizes the need to 
provide additional support to the mandate under the regular budget of the United 
Nations. At the same time, it calls on all States for greater assistance to allow it to 
accomplish its mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Working Group concludes by emphasizing how the changing situation of 
enforced disappearance requires new strategies to counter that crime and urges States 
to strengthen measures to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearance and to 
secure the rights to truth, justice and reparations of victims.  </b></p>
