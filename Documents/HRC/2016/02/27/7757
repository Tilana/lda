<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In its resolution 23/18, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the Council, at its twenty-fourth session, an 
interim report on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic. In response to 
that request, the High Commissioner deployed, from 20 June to 11 July 2013, a fact-finding 
mission to the Central African Republic to collect information on human rights violations 
committed in Bangui and other localities between December 2012 and 11 July 2013.  
</p>
<p> The fact-finding mission collected credible, reliable and corroborated information 
from victims, their families, witnesses, as well as various reliable sources in Bangui and 
several localities in Lobaye, K&#233;mo, Ombella M&#8217;Poko and Nana-Gribizi prefectures where 
human rights violations had been reported. The mission faced considerable challenges and 
limitations owing not only to the constraints imposed by security requirements and logistics 
but also to the reluctance of victims and witnesses to testify due to their fear of reprisals, 
and was sometimes only able to obtain estimates on the number of violations reported. 
</p>
<p> The mission examined allegations of violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law committed by the former Boziz&#233; regime and the non-State armed group, 
the S&#233;l&#233;ka coalition, during the armed conflict from 10 December 2012 to 23 March 2013. 
It also reviewed allegations of human rights violations committed after the S&#233;l&#233;ka seized 
power on 24 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> The mission concluded that, during the conflict, both parties had engaged in 
summary executions and extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture and looting 
of private and public property. The S&#233;l&#233;ka also engaged in sexual violence and grave 
violations against children. On the basis of the information collected by the mission, those 
acts constitute gross human rights violations and may amount to war crimes. 
</p>
<p> After 24 March 2013, gross violations of international human rights law, such as 
summary executions, sexual violence, recruitment of children and looting of property, 
including hospitals, schools and churches, committed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka continued unabated. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of the findings of the mission and on the current situation in the Central 
African Republic, the High Commissioner is gravely concerned at the gravity and intensity 
of human rights violations in the country and at the persistent and prevailing legal and 
security vacuum in which these crimes are committed. The High Commissioner addresses 
recommendations to the transitional government, the international community and the 
Human Rights Council to resolve the crisis, address insecurity, protect human rights, fight 
impunity and promote national reconciliation.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 23/18, the Human Rights Council condemned the serious human 
rights violations perpetrated against the civilian population in the Central African Republic, 
and requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the 
Council, at its twenty-fourth session, an interim report on the situation of human rights in 
the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to resolution 23/18, the High Commissioner deployed a fact-finding 
mission to the Central African Republic to collect information on the human rights 
violations committed in Bangui and other localities from 10 December 2012, when the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka offensive was launched, to 11 July 2013, when the mission left the country. It 
should be noted that the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights visited the Central 
African Republic from 29 July to 2 August 2013 in an effort to support efforts led by the 
United Nations to promote and protect human rights in the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>3. From 20 June to 11 July 2013, the mission visited Bangui and undertook visits to 
Damara (Ombella M&#8217;Poko Prefecture), Mba&#239;ki (Lobaye Prefecture), Kaga-Bandoro (Nana-
Gribizi Prefecture) and Sibut (K&#233;mo Prefecture). These localities were identified on the 
basis of reports of alleged human rights violations, as well as logistics and security 
constraints. Although the mission had planned to visit Bria (Haute-Kotto Prefecture) and 
Bambari (Ouaka Prefecture), it was unable to do so for security reasons.  
</p>
<p>4. The mission carried out its activities in an extremely challenging environment, 
which included tight security and logistics constraints. In addition, owing to the fact that 
many victims and witnesses feared reprisals and were reluctant to testify, the mission was 
sometimes only able to obtain estimates of the number of violations reported. 
</p>
<p>5. The mission interviewed more than 235 people, including victims, their families and 
witnesses, as well as representatives of the National Transitional Council, the interim 
Government, the military, the judiciary, civil society, international protection partners, the 
United Nations system, the diplomatic community and the Mission for the Consolidation of 
Peace in the Central African Republic (MICOPAX).1 
</p>
<p>6. The mission also analysed numerous documents, such as reports of the Human 
Rights and Justice Section of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the 
Central African Republic (BINUCA) and of the Joint Investigation Mission, comprising the 
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (MONUSCO) and BINUCA, deployed in the Equateur Province of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo between May and June 2013. 
</p>
<p>7. In the present report, the mission summarizes its findings with regard to the situation 
of human rights in the Central African Republic and the nature and extent of human rights 
violations committed by all parties from December 2012 to 11 July 2013. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Established by the Economic Community of Central African States in 2008, MICOPAX has been 
</p>
<p>deployed in the Central African Republic since 2009. </p>


<p><b> III. Context  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political situation  
</b></p>
<p>8. In December 2012, the S&#233;l&#233;ka, a coalition of rebel groups,2 launched an offensive in 
the north of the Central African Republic. The groups claimed that President Fran&#231;ois 
Boziz&#233; had failed to uphold the terms of the peace agreements signed in 2007, 2008 and 
</p><p>2011. Peace talks between the S&#233;l&#233;ka and the Boziz&#233; Government, held in Libreville under 
the auspices of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), resulted in 
the signing, on 11 January 2013, of the Libreville Agreements, which provided for 
transitional and power-sharing measures. 
</p>
<p>9. In March 2013, the S&#233;l&#233;ka, claiming that the Government had not fulfilled its 
obligations under the Libreville Agreements, resumed fighting and, on 24 March 2013, 
seized the capital, Bangui, forcing President Boziz&#233; to flee the country. The leader of the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka, Michel Djotodia &#8211; who had been appointed in February 2013 by President Boziz&#233; 
as first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for National Defence of the Government of 
National Unity established following the Libreville Agreements of January 2013 &#8211; 
proclaimed himself President, suspended the Constitution, dissolved the Government of 
National Unity, the National Assembly and the Constitutional Court, and commenced to 
rule by decree. Mr. Djotodia reappointed Nicolas Tiangaye as interim Prime Minister of the 
transitional arrangement put in place.  
</p>
<p>10. On 13 April, the National Transitional Council was established, electing Mr. 
Djotodia, the only candidate, as Head of the transition. The National Transitional Council 
was expanded on 12 May to comprise 135 members, and a new 34-member Government of 
National Unity was formed on 13 June 2013. Mr. Djotodia became Minister for Defence in 
the interim Government, while remaining President of the National Transitional Council. 
Mr. Djotodia was officially sworn in as Head of State of the Transition on 18 August 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Response of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>11. The United Nations Security Council, on 25 March 2013, and the African Union 
Peace and Security Council, on 16 April 2013, condemned the unconstitutional seizure of 
power by the S&#233;l&#233;ka.  
</p>
<p>12. ECCAS took the lead in defining new transitional arrangements and increased the 
size of its peace mission, MICOPAX, to 2,000 troops. On 19 July 2013, the African Union 
Peace and Security Council established the African-led International Support Mission for 
the Central African Republic,3 comprising the contingents serving under MICOPAX4 and 
reinforced by those provided by other Member States.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 Comprising the Union des forces d&#233;mocratiques pour le rassemblement (UFDR), the Convention 
</p>
<p>patriotique du salut du Kodro (CPSK), the Convention des patriotes pour la justice et la paix (CPJP &#8211; 
Fondamentale) and the Union des forces r&#233;publicaines (UFR).  
</p>
<p> 3 The Mission has an authorized total strength of 3,652, including 3,500 uniformed personnel (2,475 for 
the military component and 1,025 for the police component) and 152 civilians.  
</p>
<p> 4 The transition from MICOPAX to the International Support Mission for the Central African Republic 
took effect on 1 August 2013.  </p>


<p><b> C. Breakdown in law and order 
</b></p>
<p>13. Following the beginning of the S&#233;l&#233;ka offensive and the subsequent fall of Bangui, 
the Central African Republic witnessed a rapid breakdown in law and order resulting from 
the absence of civilian administration and of defence and police forces across the country. 
Between 24 March and 24 April 2013, at least 835 individuals were reportedly admitted to 
a Bangui hospital, including some 403 persons with bullet wounds. Despite the cantonment 
of S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers and the collection of weapons, which began on 1 July 2013, insecurity 
continues to prevail throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>14. The breakdown in law and order has favoured a rise in cross-border criminal 
activities, the circulation of small arms, rampant criminality the illegal exploitation of 
minerals and poaching for ivory. In addition, the power vacuum has allowed the Ugandan 
rebel group, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA), to spread to new areas in Haut Mbomou 
Prefecture. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Rule of law and administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>15. Following the S&#233;l&#233;ka offensive of 10 December 2012, judicial personnel fled their 
jurisdictions, after which S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers reportedly looted and occupied courts, taking the 
place of judges and prosecutors in a number of prefectures. In Bangui, the mission received 
reports of attacks against magistrates and lawyers by the S&#233;l&#233;ka in retaliation for past 
verdicts and lawsuits.  
</p>
<p>16. As a result of the collapse of the judiciary, the administration of justice is ineffective 
and perpetrators of human rights violations enjoy impunity. In most of the cases of gross 
human rights violations reported to the mission, no investigations or prosecutions have 
ensued.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Humanitarian situation  
</b></p>
<p>17. The current crisis in the Central African Republic has worsened an already 
precarious economic and humanitarian situation. As at June 2013, there were 206,000 
internally displaced persons living in extremely precarious conditions, often in the bush, 
where they are exposed to health hazards, including epidemic diseases. In addition, 
according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, since the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka offensive in December 2012, more than 58,000 people have fled to neighbouring 
countries, including more than 40,000 to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.5  
</p>
<p>18. The collapse of the State since December 2012 has had a disastrous impact on the 
already weak social services. Access to health and education facilities has been hindered by 
looting and the destruction or occupation by armed forces of health centres and schools. 
Access to health services outside Bangui essentially depends on the presence of 
international humanitarian actors, even though the prevailing insecurity limits access to the 
populations in need. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
</p>

</p>
<p>the Central African Republic, 30 June 2013. Available from 
http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNHCR_Factsheet_30_June_2013.pdf. </p>


<p>in August 2013, some 484,000 people were vulnerable to food insecurity in the country, in 
particular internally displaced persons.6  
</p>
<p><b> IV. International legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>19. In legal terms, the mission differentiated two distinct periods since December 2012: 
(a) from the offensive of the S&#233;l&#233;ka coalition on 10 December 2012 to the takeover of 
Bangui on 24 March 2013; and (b) from the seizure of power of the S&#233;l&#233;ka on 24 March 
2013 and the self-declaration of Mr. Djotodia as President of the National Transitional 
Council until the end of the period under review. 
</p>
<p>20. The mission noted the existence of a non-international armed conflict during the 
initial period.7 This implies that international humanitarian law was applicable from 10 
December 2012 until the takeover by the S&#233;l&#233;ka of Bangui, on 24 March 2013. The Central 
African Republic is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and to Additional 
Protocol II, on the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. Both the State 
armed forces and the S&#233;l&#233;ka, as parties to the conflict, were thus bound by the provisions of 
the treaties as well as by customary international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>21. International human rights law is applicable in peacetime and in armed conflict 
situations. The Central African Republic is a party to six major United Nations human 
rights treaties8 and two optional protocols thereto,9 as well as to the core human rights 
instruments of the African Union. It is, therefore, under a clear obligation to respect 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, it is increasingly accepted that a non-State armed group, such as the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka before taking power in the Central African Republic, must respect and ensure 
respect for human rights in the territory it controls.10  
</p>
<p>23. The Central African Republic became a party to the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court in 2001. As a consequence, allegations of international crimes 
(war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide) committed in the territory of the 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Situation Report No. 25, 23 August 2013. 
</p>
<p>Available from http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Situation%20Report%2025_EN.pdf. 
 7 In its annual report for 2012 (available from www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/annual-report/icrc-annual-
</p>
<p>report-2012.pdf), the International Committee of the Red Cross stated that, in December, &#8220;the S&#233;l&#233;ka, 
an alliance of armed groups, took control of the north and centre of the country. The non-international 
armed conflict led to casualties, looting, further displacement and the temporary evacuation of most 
humanitarian workers&#8221; (p. 111).  
</p>
<p> 8 The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ratified in 1981), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified in 1981), the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ratified in 1971), the Convention on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women (ratified in 1991) and the Convention on the Rights of 
Child (ratified in 1992). 
</p>
<p> 9 The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ratified in 1981), 
and the Optional Protocol to the convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography ( ratified in 2012). 
</p>
<p> 10 In the context of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Security Council affirmed 
that all parties, including non-State armed groups, must abide by the international humanitarian 
standards and ensure respect for human rights in the sectors they control (S/PRST/2002/27). In her 
report on the situation of human rights in Mali (A/HRC/22/33), the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights also made extensive reference to human rights violations by non-
State armed groups, including violations of the right to health, culture, education and freedom of 
religion.  </p>


<p>Central African Republic may fall under the jurisdiction of the Court. Indeed, on 22 May 
2007, the Court prosecutor opened an investigation into serious crimes allegedly committed 
in the Central African Republic, in particular during the armed conflict of 2002-2003.11  
</p>
<p>24. International human rights law was still applicable when the S&#233;l&#233;ka seized power on 
24 March 2013. The interim Government therefore has full responsibility for the protection 
of human rights contained in the treaties ratified by the Central African Republic.  
</p>
<p>25. In addition, in accordance with article 10 of the draft articles on Responsibility of 
States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,12 the S&#233;l&#233;ka, after it seized power, engaged the 
State responsibility of the Central African Republic for all violations committed by S&#233;l&#233;ka 
members in the country during the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>26. Given the complexity of the legal implications during the period under review, the 
events that occurred from 10 December 2012 to 23 March 2013, when both international 
human rights law and international humanitarian law were applicable for the former 
governmental authorities and the non-State armed group, the S&#233;l&#233;ka, will be examined first. 
The alleged violations of international human rights law committed by the interim 
Government formed after the seizure of power by the S&#233;l&#233;ka, on 24 March, until the end of 
the period under review will then be assessed. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Violations of international law committed from 
10 December 2012 to 23 March 2013 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations by the former governmental authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Summary executions and extrajudicial killings 
</b></p>
<p>27. The mission collected credible information regarding the killing of several people 
perceived to be supporters of the S&#233;l&#233;ka between January and February 2013 by the 
Presidential Guard and the Forces arm&#233;es centrafricaines (FACA), as well as by militias 
referred to as the Young Patriots (the Comit&#233; d'organisation des actions citoyennes and the 
Coalition citoyenne contre les r&#233;bellions arm&#233;es). Mass graves of opponents to the former 
Boziz&#233; regime in Bossemb&#233;l&#233; (Ombella M&#8217;Poko) were reported to the mission, which 
</p>
<p>however was not given access to these locations to verify the information for security 
reasons.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Enforced and involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>28. The mission received corroborated information concerning dozens of cases of 
enforced disappearances of rebels, their families or suspected supporters committed by 
former regime forces from 10 December 2012 to 23 March 2013. Cases included civilians 
arrested by the FACA in the eighth District of Bangui, including family members of the 
President of the National Transitional Council. These persons subsequently disappeared.  
</p>
<p>  
 11 The former Vice-President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, 
</p>
<p>who has been charged with crimes against humanity (rape and murder) and war crimes (rape, murder 
and pillaging), is the first person to face trial for alleged crimes committed in the Central African 
Republic.  
</p>
<p> 12 <i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10</i> (A/56/10).  </p>


<p><b> 3. Torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary arrest and detention  
</b></p>
<p>29. The mission received testimonies and reports of torture and ill-treatment perpetrated 
by former regime forces against detainees suspected of being supporters of the S&#233;l&#233;ka, from 
December 2012 until the fall of the Boziz&#233; regime.  
</p>
<p>30. The mission received extensive information that, until 23 March 2013, armed forces, 
including the FACA, the Presidential Guard and the Young Patriots, carried out arbitrary 
arrests and detentions of political opponents and perceived supporters of the rebellion, 
including from specific ethnic communities.13 In Bangui, dozens of arbitrary arrests and 
detentions were reportedly carried out targeting individuals presumed to be supportive of 
the rebellion. Some were released during the seizure of the capital, while others remain 
unaccounted for. The mission received reliable information that at least 200 political 
opponents of Boziz&#233; were unlawfully detained in Bossemb&#233;l&#233; Prison.  
</p>
<p>31. In several provinces, the mission received reports that, while the S&#233;l&#233;ka was 
advancing, forces of the former regime arbitrarily arrested and detained dozens of 
individuals when retreating to Bangui, subjecting them to ill-treatment and summary 
executions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Looting of public and private property  
</b></p>
<p>32. The mission received consistent reports of looting by members of the former regime 
forces in Lobaye, Sangha-Mba&#233;r&#233; and Mamb&#233;r&#233;-Kad&#233;&#239; prefectures before the fall of the 
regime. In addition, it was informed that the premises of a number of humanitarian 
organizations, including hospitals and medical facilities, and warehouses where the 
organizations had stored food supplies and non-food items, were reportedly looted by the 
FACA and Presidential Guard soldiers.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedom of expression and freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>33. Under the Boziz&#233; regime, freedom of expression was curtailed by the use of threats, 
including death threats, against journalists and others critical of the regime. Some media 
outlets were attacked by pro-government militias. In addition, control was exercised over 
the media through denial of funding, as subsidies to media outlets were not disbursed by the 
executive, despite having been approved by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>34. Following the S&#233;l&#233;ka offensive of December 2012, President Boziz&#233; and members 
of his party, the National Convergence Kwa Na Kwa party, delivered hate speeches 
targeting rebel groups and associated ethnic groups from northern-central African Republic. 
Pro-government militias roamed the city of Bangui and set up numerous checkpoints to 
identify those aligned with the rebellion, severely restricting freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violations by the non-State armed group S&#233;l&#233;ka 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Summary executions and attacks on civilians 
</b></p>
<p>35. Reports indicate that S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers were involved in summary executions of 
members of the security forces of the former Government since the beginning of the rebel 
offensive on 10 December 2012. In addition, civilians were reportedly targeted and killed, 
some of them because of their known or suspected support for former President Boziz&#233;. 
Other civilians were killed while resisting looting of their property.  
</p>
<p>  
 13 Including the Goula, Rounga, Youlou, Kara, Sara and Hausa communities.  </p>


<p>36. During its visits to Sibut, Damara, Mbaiki and Kaga-Bandoro, the mission was 
unable to collect testimonies on cases of summary executions perpetrated by the S&#233;l&#233;ka 
owing to the atmosphere of fear among the population, most of whom were still in hiding in 
the bush. For security reasons, the mission was unable to visit Bambari and Bria to conduct 
further investigations on the existence of mass graves in these areas and to establish 
responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>37. The S&#233;l&#233;ka reportedly tortured and ill-treated civilians at checkpoints, in illegal 
detention centres and in other places, in order to obtain information on the location of 
weapons, money and belongings. In Kaga-Bandoro, the mission interviewed a woman who 
had been victim of severe torture committed by S&#233;l&#233;ka members on 7 March 2013. The 
victim reported that she had been arrested by at least 16 S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers. She was tortured 
for hours, beaten with weapons, kicked with boots, dragged and slapped. She was also 
subjected to mock executions. She was evacuated to Bangui, where she was admitted to a 
hospital for two months.  
</p>
<p>38. In many reported cases, torture and ill-treatment led to the death of the victim. On 13 
March 2013, one person died in the village of Vangu&#233;, near Damara, after being tied up and 
beaten severely by S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers a few days before their withdrawal to Sibut.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>39. Information collected from protection actors suggests that sexual violence was 
committed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka in the country, including against children, from 10 December 
2012 to 23 March 2013. It was, however, difficult for the mission to obtain testimonies 
from victims of sexual and gender-based violence or witnesses mainly because of their fear 
of stigmatization.  
</p>
<p>40. The city of Bangui registered the largest number of rape cases, as many victims left 
the provinces for the capital, where they reported the cases allegedly committed by the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka. The mission received credible and corroborated information of hundreds of cases of 
rape, including at least 250 registered in Bangui alone between January and June 2013, of 
which 140 were perpetrated by armed men reportedly belonging to the S&#233;l&#233;ka. One credible 
non-governmental organization documented 106 cases of rape committed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka in 
Bangui from December 2012 to April 2013. 
</p>
<p>41. Dozens of cases committed between 10 December 2012 and March 2013 were 
reported to the mission in Basse Kotto and Haute Kotto prefectures, and during field visits 
to Damara, Sibut and Kaga-Bandoro. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Grave violations committed against children 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Sexual violence involving children 
</i></p>
<p>42. The majority of counterparts interviewed reported cases of sexual violence against 
children and the use of girls as sexual slaves. The mission itself received isolated 
information on alleged cases of sexual slavery.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Recruitment of children 
</i></p>
<p>43. Interviews conducted with children formerly associated with the S&#233;l&#233;ka coalition 
also confirmed allegations on the recruitment of children by the coalition between 10 </p>


<p>December 2012 and 23 March 2013, in particular by the Convention des patriotes pour la 
justice et la paix, in breach of their commitment to the action plan14 signed with the United 
Nations in November 2011. The recruitment of children was reported during the 
progression of S&#233;l&#233;ka forces to Kaga-Bandoro, Sibut and Damara, from where the attack on 
Bangui was launched. Some of the children recruited were reported to be from Chad and 
the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>44. The mission also received reliable information that the S&#233;l&#233;ka had used recruited 
children as human shields, more particularly during the battle opposing them in Damara to 
the South African contingent in their progression to take Bangui, on 23 and 24 March 2013.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Attacks on hospitals and schools 
</i></p>
<p>45. The already limited provision of basic services was severely affected by the conflict. 
Schools and hospitals were systematically looted or occupied for military purposes across 
the country as the S&#233;l&#233;ka took control of such major cities as Ndel&#233; (Bamingui-Bangoran 
Prefecture) and Kaga-Bandoro, in December 2012, and progressed towards Bangui. 
</p>
<p>46. In Kanga-Bandoro, for instance, the mission was informed that the S&#233;l&#233;ka had 
occupied the primary school between December 2012 and January 2013, and had removed 
all the doors, windows and roofing metal sheets before leaving. Primary schools in Sibut 
were similarly occupied by the S&#233;l&#233;ka.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Looting of public and private property 
</b></p>
<p>47. The mission received information on hundreds of cases of looting of public and 
private property committed in a systematic or widespread manner across the country. It was 
informed of hundreds of cases of houses being burned down, including at least 900 houses 
when the S&#233;l&#233;ka entered Bangassou (Mbomou Prefecture) on 11 March. A large number of 
interviewees spoke of livestock looting and crops being destroyed by cattle herders 
believed to support the S&#233;l&#233;ka. The mission also received reports of three radio stations &#8211; 
two in Bangui and one in Ouaka Prefecture &#8211; that were looted by the S&#233;l&#233;ka after 24 March 
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>48. The mission also received credible reports, supported by photographs, that a 
significant number of churches were damaged and looted by S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers. Among the 
many incidents documented was the targeting of the Catholic church of Basse Kotto 
Prefecture, in late January 2013, reportedly in reprisal for reporting on S&#233;l&#233;ka activities. On 
9 February 2013, the Catholic church of Mobaye was significantly damaged and looted by 
S&#233;l&#233;ka rebels when they invaded the city.  
</p>
<p>49. Between January and April 2013, a significant number of offices and warehouses of 
non-governmental organizations were looted in the localities of Ndel&#233; (Bamingui-Bangoran 
Prefecture), Batangafo (Ouham Prefecture), Paoua (Ouham-Pend&#233; Prefecture), Kaga-
Bandoro (Nana-Gribizi Prefecture), Bambari (Ouaka Prefecture) and Bria (Haute-Kotto). In 
some instances, the security and access of personnel had to be negotiated with the S&#233;l&#233;ka to 
allow them to continue their activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>50. From 10 December 2012 to 23 March 2013, while taking control of the territory on 
its way to Bangui, the S&#233;l&#233;ka established illegal checkpoints to collect funds from the 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Framework established by the Security Council in its resolution 1612 (2005) to oversee the separation 
</p>
<p>of children associated with armed groups </p>


<p>population. These checkpoints constituted a serious impediment to the free movement of 
goods and persons.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Violations of international law committed from 24 March to 
11 July 2013 
</b></p>
<p>51. During the period under review, the former regime&#8217;s armed forces, the FACA, had 
not been dismantled, and S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers had not yet participated in a disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration process (which explains why they are still referred to in 
the present report as &#8220;the FACA&#8221; and &#8220;the S&#233;l&#233;ka&#8221;). Since 24 March 2013, however, S&#233;l&#233;ka 
</p>
<p>soldiers have taken on the role of a national defence and security force under the command 
of the President and the Minister for Defence of the Central African Republic, Mr. 
Djotodia. All acts and decisions of civil authorities and of the S&#233;l&#233;ka therefore engage the 
responsibility of the State.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Summary executions and extrajudicial killings 
</b></p>
<p>52. Several witnesses accused the S&#233;l&#233;ka of committing summary executions and 
extrajudicial killings. Some killings targeted soldiers from the FACA and the Presidential 
Guard, while others were committed in retaliation against perceived resistance from 
civilians. On 13 April 2013, in Ngaragba vicinity (7th district of Bangui), a S&#233;l&#233;ka vehicle 
struck and injured three individuals during a funeral procession, prompting residents to 
stage a protest. Soldiers surrounded the area and shot at protesters, killing two. On 15 April, 
the S&#233;l&#233;ka shot and killed, in the 4th district of Bangui, two motorcycle taxi drivers who 
had refused to surrender their vehicles. Some killings were committed without motive, such 
as the killing, in April 2013, in Ngouma (80 km from Mba&#239;ki) of a pygmy father and his 
two young sons, and of three other pygmies in Ndongo and Mangongi regions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Enforced and involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>53. The mission received information on a number of cases involving the disappearance 
of soldiers of the FACA and the Presidential Guard, as well as individuals in many towns 
and villages across the country, after they were arrested in streets, at their homes or at 
random checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>54. Consistent and corroborated information received by the mission indicates that 
persons were arrested on the basis of information on the victims&#8217; financial situation or 
</p>
<p>political and ethnic affiliation provided to the S&#233;l&#233;ka by informants. The S&#233;l&#233;ka reportedly 
targeted neighbourhoods viewed as pro-Boziz&#233;, particularly Boy-Rabe and Fouh 
neighbourhoods in Bangui, where a significant number of disappearances were reported.  
</p>
<p>55. The S&#233;l&#233;ka reportedly orchestrated scenarios to arrest people. Family members of 
victims interviewed by the mission stated that victims would usually receive a telephone 
call from a friend or acquaintance that they went to meet before disappearing.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest and detention  
</b></p>
<p>56. The mission conducted dozens of interviews, including with detainees, their families 
and witnesses in Bangui and several prefectures who reported cases of arbitrary arrest and 
detention by the S&#233;l&#233;ka during the seizure of Bangui, which escalated in the following 
weeks and continued. Victims included judges, lawyers, members of the FACA, former </p>


<p>regime officials and persons associated with (or perceived to be part of) the Boziz&#233; regime 
in what appears to have been retaliatory operations. A prominent case of arbitrary arrest and 
detention was that of Mohamed Moussa Dhaffan, former Minister for Forestry, Water, 
Hunting and Fishing and his brother, Colonel Ahmed Dhaffan, who have been arbitrarily 
detained since 29 June 2013.  
</p>
<p>57. The mission received reports indicating that people had been sentenced by S&#233;l&#233;ka 
soldiers, even though they are not authorized by law to exercise judicial power. Reported 
forms of punishment varied from imprisonment to fines. 
</p>
<p>58. Some detainees were reportedly kept in homes, on governmental premises or in 
military camps. In one reported case, several people arrested by the S&#233;l&#233;ka were put in an 
empty petrol container in Bambari, resulting in at least one man dying due to gas inhalation. 
Despite repeated requests, the mission was not granted access to military camps where 
conflict-related detainees were believed to be held. 
</p>
<p>59. The mission was, however, allowed to visit two detention facilities, where it 
interviewed at least 50 detainees, including three children, in the Office central de 
r&#233;pression contre le banditisme and in the Section recherche et investigation. On the 
premises of both places, penitentiary authorities failed to provide the mission with 
registration records for persons deprived of their liberty or to respond to basic due process 
enquiries. The detainees interviewed told the mission that they had not been informed at the 
time of their arrest of charges against them, or brought promptly before a judge or any other 
officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Torture and ill-treatment  
</b></p>
<p>60. The mission interviewed, in the course of its field visits, victims of torture and ill-
treatment, including detainees, witnesses and family members. In many reported cases, 
torture led to the death of victims. In one reported case, the victim, a 32-year-old man from 
Gbangoro was kidnapped on 2 June 2013, when the S&#233;l&#233;ka targeted the axis Tale-Nana 
Markounda (Ouham Prefecture). S&#233;l&#233;ka members beat the man to death, then dumped his 
body on the side of the road later that day. 
</p>
<p>61. The mission received reports of cases of torture and ill-treatment committed by the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka of former regime officials, including prominent public figures, civil servants and 
members of their families. In May 2013, the S&#233;l&#233;ka raided the houses of a former member 
of the National Assembly and of the former Vice-President and his wife, and ill-treated 
them while trying to obtain information.  
</p>
<p>62. Cases of reprisals against FACA members, including those who responded to the 
call of the interim President to report for duty, were reported to the mission. Reprisals 
consisted of torture and ill-treatment with a view to extort information. Following the 
seizure of Bangui, at least 400 people, including FACA officials and their families, took 
refuge with MICOPAX and BINUCA for fear of arrest and reprisals. Some 100 were still 
with MICOPAX at the end of the period under review. 
</p>
<p>63. Armed personnel in uniform believed to belong to the S&#233;l&#233;ka also reportedly 
practiced torture and ill-treatment in night raids involving robbing, looting and terrorizing 
the population, including the pygmy minority. Such cases were documented in Bangui on 
11 April, in Lobaye Prefecture on 17 April and 20 April, prompting a large number of 
people, including pygmies, to flee to the bush. </p>


<p><b> E. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>64. The mission heard accounts from victims, witnesses and family members and 
received reports from reliable non-governmental organizations and medical sources that 
indicated that the S&#233;l&#233;ka committed sexual violence, both in Bangui and in some provinces, 
after they seized power.  
</p>
<p>65. The mission had the opportunity to meet with two medical sources in Bangui. One 
of them had registered 79 cases of rape mainly by the S&#233;l&#233;ka after 24 March 2013, 
including children between 5 and 8 years of age. Around 60 per cent of victims were raped 
in Bangui and 40 per cent around the village of Damara and on the axis Damara-Boali. 
According to another medical source in Bangui, 38 women treated in the health centre, 
including three children, had allegedly been raped by members of the S&#233;l&#233;ka between 
February and the beginning of July 2013. 
</p>
<p>66. In Bangui alone, the mission received 29 testimonies and reports of rape by the 
S&#233;l&#233;ka committed in eight different neighbourhoods. Different sources reported that, 
between 13 and 16 April 2013, several women, including girls aged between 12 and 14 
years, were raped in the neighbourhood of Boy-Rabe known to be pro-Boziz&#233;. One source 
referred to the alleged rape of seven women, while another reported a case of rape of four 
women, on 14 April, and of a 12-year old girl, on 15 April. The mission interviewed a 
woman raped in the same neighbourhood on 17 April. It also received information on cases 
of rape during its field visits to the villages of Mba&#239;ki, Damara, Kaga-Bandoro and Sibut. 
</p>
<p>67. The mission was aware that the cases reported represented only a fraction of actual 
cases of sexual violence, since many victims do not report these crimes for fear of 
retaliation or stigmatization. Many victims of sexual or gender-based violence who 
consequently sought medical treatment required surgery. Several of them became pregnant, 
suffered a miscarriage or contracted sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, as 
a result of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Grave violations committed against children 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Killings involving children 
</b></p>
<p>68. Information received by the mission suggested that many children had been killed or 
maimed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka. The mission documented several cases of summary execution. In 
one particular case, the victim, a 14-year old boy arrested on 22 June 2013 and tortured at 
the Bataillon de soutien et de service, was found dead among other victims in the M&#8217;Poko 
River two days later.  
</p>
<p>69. In Bangui alone, the mission was informed by medical sources that about 84 injured 
children had been admitted to hospital from March to June 2013,. The causes of injuries 
varied from road accidents caused by the S&#233;l&#233;ka, stray bullets, shelling, grenades or, in 
most cases, deliberate attempts to kill the children. Some victims were forced to undergo 
amputation as a result of their injuries. 
</p>
<p>70. The events in Boy-Rabe on 14 April 2013, when two rockets hit the Eglise 
&#233;vang&#233;lique des Fr&#232;res de Cit&#233; Jean XXIII, killing seven people and injuring 35 others, 
were documented by BINUCA. The mission was able to collect additional testimonies from 
medical sources and victims. Of the 35 injured, four children aged 5 or 6 years had to 
undergo amputation; three of one leg, and one of both legs. </p>


<p><b> 2. Sexual violence involving children 
</b></p>
<p>71. Protection partners caring for girls who had separated from the S&#233;l&#233;ka reported that 
a large number of victims of sexual violence committed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka are children, ranging 
from 2 to 17 years of age. In addition, findings from interviews conducted by the Joint 
MONUSCO/BINUCA Investigation Mission with Central African refugees in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, between 22 May and 5 June 2013, revealed that many 
reported cases of rape of women and girls had been committed by the S&#233;l&#233;ka. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Recruitment of children 
</b></p>
<p>72. During the period under review, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) 
assisted 149 children (134 boys and 15 girls) aged between 12 and 17 years who had been 
recruited by the S&#233;l&#233;ka. Fifty five of the children were personally handed over to UNICEF 
by the President of the National Transitional Council between 27 and 30 June. Access to 
military camps and barracks, including camp B&#233;al, the largest in Bangui, and Camp de 
Roux, which also serves as the presidential office, is restricted and protection actors could 
not undertake systematic screening activities.  
</p>
<p>73. The mission witnessed the presence of many children among the S&#233;l&#233;ka in pick-up 
vehicles during patrols, at the Office central de r&#233;pression contre le banditisme and the 
Section recherche et investigation in Bangui, as well as in Damara, Sibut, Mba&#239;ki and 
Kaga-Bandoro. At the Office central de r&#233;pression, the team observed the presence of five 
children, including two girls, among the guards; at the Section recherche et investigation, 
four children were sighted among the S&#233;l&#233;ka, and had visibly been instructed to claim to be 
adults.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Attacks on hospitals and schools 
</b></p>
<p>74. Hospitals have been looted, ransacked or occupied by the S&#233;l&#233;ka throughout the 
country since 24 March 2013, seriously affecting access to health, with particularly grave 
consequences for children and pregnant women. In Bangui, the maternity hospital of the 
gendarmerie was looted and destroyed on 25 March. The national laboratory, the only 
facility carrying out specific biomedical analysis, was also looted on 25 and 26 March. 
Hospitals across the country are thought to be functioning at 20 per cent of their usual 
capacity, and only with the assistance of international relief agencies.  
</p>
<p>75. Only very few private schools are currently open. Public schools remain closed, 
which affects more than 800,000 children from elementary to secondary school. Teachers 
and civil servants who sought refuge in Bangui at the outbreak of hostilities are unlikely to 
return to the provinces in the near future owing to the volatile security situation. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Violations of property rights and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>76. During and following the capture of Bangui, S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers engaged in organized 
and systematic looting of hundreds of private homes and shops, such as in the town of Rafa&#239; 
or in the Fouh neighbourhood of Bangui, where former regime officials reside.  
</p>
<p>77. S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers also ransacked public buildings. The mission was informed that, of 
the cases reported, S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers had looted on 31 March 2013 the premises of the 
gendarmerie, the police, the Customs Office and other administrative buildings in 
Berb&#233;rati. On 5 April, S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers also looted the offices of the Public Prosecutor at the 
Court of First Instance of Bangui, taking away documents, computers and hard drives 
before setting fire to the archives.  </p>


<p>78. In addition, the S&#233;l&#233;ka attacked and looted numerous places of worship, mostly 
churches, including in Bambari, Markounda, Bangui and Boali. The mission interviewed 
Muslim leaders who confirmed that mosques had not been attacked. In an attempt to 
contain religious tensions emanating from deliberate attacks against churches, a platform 
for dialogue was established in December 2012 by Catholic, Protestant and Muslim leaders 
across the Central African Republic.  
</p>
<p>79. Nearly all offices and warehouses of the United Nations and international 
humanitarian organizations were found to have been either looted or robbed. Humanitarian 
workers also suffered from road ambushes and vehicle hijacking perpetrated by the S&#233;l&#233;ka.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Freedom of expression and freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>80. The mission received alarming reports regarding the rights and safety of human 
rights defenders, journalists and members of civil society organizations under the current 
regime. Several leaders of human rights organizations have gone into hiding and others 
have fled the country after they received death threats from S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers. Human rights 
defenders have been issuing press releases under the Human Rights Network in an attempt 
to prevent the identification of their authors.  
</p>
<p>81. Journalists, editors-in-chief and media directors who expose human rights violations 
or criticize the new Government have been threatened by the S&#233;l&#233;ka, despite reassurances 
by the President of the National Transitional Council that freedom of expression would be 
respected. On 29 April 2013, journalists and media workers observed a &#8220;day without the 
</p>
<p>media&#8221; to protest against the threats and intimidation to which they are subjected by the 
</p>
<p>S&#233;l&#233;ka. The State media boycotted the initiative. 
</p>
<p>82. Following the capture on 24 March 2013 of Bangui, S&#233;l&#233;ka members continued to 
set up checkpoints across the country where they collect fees, impeding the free movement 
of citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Measures taken by the new authorities 
</b></p>
<p>83. The transitional Government acknowledged that the collapse of the State had led to a 
security vacuum resulting in lawlessness, including widespread violence and serious human 
rights violations committed by uncontrolled S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers and unidentified armed 
groups.<b>15</b> Several ministers, in discussions with the mission, blamed &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; 
militia members for such violations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Joint National Commission of Inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>84. On 20 May 2013, the interim Government issued a decree establishing the Joint 
National Commission of Inquiry (Commission nationale mixte d&#8217;enqu&#234;te) with a mandate 
to investigate human rights violations committed in the Central African Republic since 
2004, to establish facts and circumstances of violations, and to identify perpetrators, 
collaborators, accomplices and victims. The Commission comprises 10 members: a 
chairperson, who is a magistrate; two vice-presidents; and seven police and gendarmerie 
officers. Civil society is represented by one of the vice-presidents, who is the head of a 
local non-governmental organization. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Statement made by the Prime Minister of the Central African Republic, Nicolas Tiangaye, to the 
</p>
<p>Security Council on 15 May 2013.  </p>


<p>85. While the establishment of such a commission is encouraging, its current mandate, 
composition and functioning are not compliant with international standards, which 
compromises its independence, credibility, impartiality and transparency. The mission was 
informed that the findings of the Commission would not be followed up on by the 
judiciary; instead, the Commission is expected to report to the President of the National 
Transitional Council. The mission also found that its members do not have the required 
expertise in international human rights law, international humanitarian law, sexual and 
gender-based violence, and investigation techniques. Also, several members had been 
designated by the President of the National Transitional Council.  
</p>
<p>86. For the above reasons, the Commission, unless its mandate and functioning are 
strengthened in compliance with relevant international standards, will not be able to address 
impunity by ensuring that perpetrators of human rights abuses are brought to justice.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National commission for human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>87. The bill establishing a national commission for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms (Commission nationale des droits de l&#180;homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales) was 
pending before Parliament in December 2012, when the conflict started. The commission 
has yet to be established. 
</p>
<p>88. While the Ministry for Human Rights and the Coordination of Humanitarian Action 
was established in June 2013, it does not have the human and financial resources necessary 
to be operational.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Collection of weapons and cantonment of armed persons 
</b></p>
<p>89. On 1 July 2013, the transitional Government, with the support of MICOPAX, 
launched the disarmament and cantonment of S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers with a view to re-establishing 
security and public order in the country. While a number of camps in Bangui, including the 
B&#233;al and Berengoto camps, served for the cantonment of S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers, the mission was 
not given access to the camps and was unable to obtain from the authorities information on 
the exact number of S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers disarmed and cantoned in these camps. In parallel to 
the cantonment of S&#233;l&#233;ka soldiers, the transitional Government is proceeding with the so-
