<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, visited Australia from 17 to 30 November 2011. The Special Rapporteur 
highlights the country&#8217;s strong commitment to combating trafficking in persons, as 
evidenced by the high level of government engagement and effective partnership developed 
with civil society organizations. She recognizes, however, that statistics on trafficking do 
not appear to account for the true nature and scale of the problem. Acknowledging the 
important support programme for trafficked persons, she expresses concerns regarding gaps 
in some services offered. The Special Rapporteur welcomes a draft Bill that goes a 
considerable way towards remedying many of the legislative shortcomings under the 
current legislative framework, and welcomes the imminent passage of this into law. She 
makes a number of recommendations to the Government with regard to, inter alia, 
developing a new framework for collecting data on trafficked persons, increasing capacity-
building activities for government officials, addressing key gaps in the support programme, 
and ensuring ongoing regional engagement to strengthen national responses and address the 
root causes of trafficking in sending countries, including the creation of more opportunities 
for safe labour migration.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 17 to 30 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, conducted an official visit to Australia at 
the invitation of the Government.   
</p>
<p>2.  During her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Sydney, Canberra and 
Melbourne. At the Commonwealth level, she met with representatives of the following: 
Attorney General&#8217;s Department, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of 
Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC), Australian Federal Police (AFP), Australian Agency 
for International Development (AusAID), Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public 
Prosecutions (CDPP), Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of 
Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman, 
Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Australian 
Customs and Border Protection Services, Australian Crime Commission and Australian 
Institute of Criminology (AIC). She also met with the Governor General. She further 
attended two important national events on trafficking: the National Roundtable on People 
Trafficking and the AIC Research Forum on Trafficking. She also conducted a briefing for 
foreign diplomats on trafficking in persons in Australia. 
</p>
<p>3.  In Victoria she met with representatives of the Victoria Police and the Department of 
Justice, as well as with Members of Parliament. She also met with a range of legal 
professionals, including judges of the County Court and the Supreme Court of Victoria, and 
barristers and lawyers who have represented victims of trafficking. She also consulted with 
members of a local council. In New South Wales, she met with representatives of the 
Australian Human Rights Commission, the New South Wales Police Force and the New 
South Wales Victims Compensation Tribunal, as well as with the Mayor of Sydney. She 
also visited Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, where she met with detainees. In all 
states and territories visited she met with victims of trafficking, and liaised with a diverse 
range of civil society organizations (CSOs) and academics.   
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses her sincere appreciation to the Government of 
Australia, and in particular the Attorney General&#8217;s Department, for the indispensable 
support it provided in planning and coordinating the visit. She further thanks the CSOs and 
the United Nations Information Centre for their support and assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons in Australia 
</b></p>
<p>5. Australia is a destination country for victims of trafficking. Available information 
indicates that identified victims of trafficking are mainly women from South-East Asia, in 
particular from Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea. Recent data 
indicates a growing number of victims from other parts of Asia, including India and China. 
Incidences of human trafficking have primarily been detected in Melbourne and Sydney, 
with a small number in Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. 
Since Australia began its anti-trafficking programme (January 2004&#8211;March 2012), the AFP 
has undertaken 325 investigations and assessments of allegations of trafficking-related 
offences. In the large majority of cases, victims were found to be working in the sex 
industry. However, a growing number of cases of other forms of trafficking, including for 
forced and exploitative labour, are emerging.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Identified victims of trafficking in Australia appear to be controlled less through 
direct force than through more subtle means, such as illegal debt, fear of violence, 
psychological coercion and threats to themselves or their family members. The means by 
which persons become victims of trafficking appear varied: some are actively recruited 
abroad, whereas others are recruited once in Australia. Many victims seek the assistance of 
an agent to find them work in Australia, but are deceived as to the nature and conditions of 
that work.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>7. In 2010 approximately 70 per cent of the investigations undertaken by the AFP were 
related to trafficking for sexual exploitation. In the majority of cases, victims were women 
from South-East Asia, who reportedly knew that they would be working in the sex industry, 
but were deceived as to their conditions of work, namely, the existence of physical and 
sexual violence and intimidation in the workplace, being forced to engage in unsafe sexual 
practices, being unable to refuse clients or certain services or being grossly underpaid. 
Control is typically exercised through intimidation and threats, as well as through contracts 
obliging trafficked women to work off their &#8213;debt&#8214;, which is invariably a grossly inflated 
sum purportedly representing the cost of arranging travel to Australia and related expenses.  
</p><p>8. The Special Rapporteur also observed a very strong focus, particularly by the media, 
on trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This focus is understandable given 
the profile of persons in Australia typically identified as having been trafficked. Yet she 
notes that there are dangers in associating trafficking in persons exclusively with sex 
trafficking, not least of these being the stereotyping of victims of trafficking as only women 
forced into prostitution or working in the sex industry. She learned of an increasing number 
of cases of trafficking for reasons other than sexual exploitation, which remain largely 
overlooked to date. She notes however that since 2009 the Government of Australia has put 
in place a significant range of measures to detect and investigate other forms of trafficking, 
in particular labour exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>9. Australian authorities are becoming increasingly aware of trafficking for the 
purposes of labour exploitation. In particular, concern has been raised regarding the 
agriculture, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and domestic service industries. In 
2011, approximately 30 per cent of the 45 investigations carried out by the AFP related to 
trafficking for labour exploitation. The cases reported indicate that foreign workers can be 
exposed to instances of poor work conditions, substandard accommodations, overwork and 
low or no pay. While these circumstances alone do not conclusively point to the existence 
of labour trafficking, they are examples of conduct that may indicate trafficking-related 
exploitation. In 2010 the first comprehensive research into labour trafficking was 
undertaken by the AIC.   
</p><p>10. Australia, as a highly developed country, relies strongly on migrant labour, with 
approximately 600,000 migrant workers at any one time. Considerable concern has been 
raised about labour exploitation in relation to subclass 457 visas, designed for employers 
wishing to employ overseas workers to fill nominated positions in Australia. Migrants on 
such visas (particularly low- or semi-skilled migrants) are reportedly especially vulnerable 
to exploitation due to their dependence on their sponsor for continued migration status, 
their typically low English language skills, lack of knowledge about their rights, and fear of 
losing the employment on which they rely to service debts or financial obligations. A recent 
review of this system resulted in a number of important reforms, including the introduction 
of a market-based minimum salary, and the removal of lower-skilled occupations within the 
construction and hospitality industry sectors. Nonetheless, 457 visa holders still need a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>sponsor, and the visa remains a pathway to permanent residency, contributing to the 
ongoing dependence of this class of visa holders on employers, thereby making them 
potentially more vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Marriage 
</b></p>
<p>11. The use of marriage as a mechanism to traffic young women both into and out of 
Australia is of growing concern.1 In 2010 the AFP received three separate reports of cases 
of forced and servile marriage. Preliminary research indicates that victims are often 
trafficked through marriage for the purposes of domestic servitude. They are at a 
heightened risk of sexual abuse, and are often first identified as victims of domestic 
violence, with welfare officers not always aware that these women are victims of the 
specific crime of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s swift reaction to the issue of forced 
and servile marriage; it commissioned a public discussion paper on the phenomenon in 
November 2010. Submissions received from a wide range of stakeholders suggested that 
forced marriage is likely to be more prevalent than the small number of reported cases, 
which may be attributed to the familial nature of forced or servile marriages, or because 
victims may not actually identify their marriage to have been forced.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is a lack of data on child trafficking within 
Australia. Strict immigration and other controls certainly mean it is difficult for children to 
be brought into the country without their parents or legal guardian. However, two high-
profile cases suggest that child trafficking has indeed taken place within Australia and may 
be a potential issue of concern.2 Trafficking of children via marriage also occur if brides are 
under 18 years old.   
</p>
<p><b> 5. Domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>14. There are few migrant domestic workers in Australia, due to the lack of a culture of 
domestic service and a narrow visa class (Subclass 426 Domestic Worker Visa) open only 
to specific categories of foreign domestic workers (for example, those attached to 
diplomatic households). Nevertheless, cases of persons trafficked for domestic work have 
been documented, and the Special Rapporteur herself met with persons who experienced 
trafficking as domestic workers in Australia, indicating that this class of persons continues 
to be at risk. The protection of domestic workers working for diplomats is further 
complicated by rules relating to privileges and immunities. Domestic workers also appear 
to be under the impression that there is a live-in requirement attached to the visa, which 
adds to their vulnerability. The Government however insists there is no such requirement. 
The Special Rapporteur thus urges the Government to make this manifestly clear both to 
those arriving on such a visa and employers.

</p>
<p><b> 6. Emerging forms of human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur learned that in 2011, the first alleged case of trafficking for 
the purposes of removal of organs was referred to the CDPP. In this instance, established 
medical transplant integrity procedures ensured that the situation was discovered before the 
removal of the organ was carried out. The resulting referral to a social worker revealed the 
true situation of the potential donor as a victim of trafficking. While this appears to be an 
isolated incident, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to remain alert to such 
practices, and to establish adequate safeguards to protect victims. 
</p>
<p>16. She has also observed that certain visas appear to increase vulnerability to 
trafficking-related exploitation. Specifically, the large number of foreign student visas 
issued (approximately 310,000 at any given time) has been highlighted as presenting a 
potential avenue for trafficking. The Government noted that the student visa system has a 
low risk of being exploited due to the safeguards in place to ensure that visa holders are 
genuine students, including an 80 per cent mandatory class attendance rate and a limit of 20 
hours of employment per week. Yet reports from CSOs and the media indicate that 
individuals on student visas, typically from Asia, have been victims of forced labour and 
forced prostitution in Australia. It is also noteworthy that in 2010/11, 18 foreign students 
were participating in the Support for Trafficked People programme, confirming that some 
persons holding student visas are indeed trafficked. Moreover, genuine foreign students can 
become vulnerable to trafficking once in Australia, particularly for labour exploitation, due 
to high costs of studying and living. In October 2011 the Minister for Immigration and 
Citizenship announced a targeted analysis of the student visa programme. The Special 
Rapporteur looks forward to the results of this review, and reminds the Government of the 
need to adopt a human rights framework in any appraisal of the student visa system.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Criminalization of irregular migration and the impact on trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons  
</b></p>
<p>17. Australian legislation distinguishes between the crimes of people smuggling and 
trafficking in persons.3 However, the Special Rapporteur observed that the focused political 
and public attention directed towards all issues pertaining to migration has led to an all-
encompassing discourse of criminalization that, when not carefully articulated, has failed to 
distinguish trafficking from other forms of migration. This contributes to confusion in 
public understanding between the broader class of irregular migrants and those who have 
been trafficked.  
</p><p>18. Furthermore, the strong political commitment to criminalizing and prosecuting 
people smuggling may have unintended negative consequences for victims of trafficking. In 
the past three years, new laws against people smuggling, with mandatory minimum 
sentences, resulted in the arrests of over 493 persons.4 However, of those charged, only six 
persons were actual organizers or facilitators of the smuggling operations. Many of those 
arrested are reportedly deceptively recruited to work on ships as crew members, with false 
promises about the nature of their work and their payment, and thus may themselves have

</p>
<p>25 November 2011, retrospectively defines &#8213;no lawful right to come to Australia&#8214; to mean no lawful 
right under domestic law, notwithstanding that a person may have a clear and lawful right under 
international law (for example, a right to seek and claim asylum from prosecution) to seek to enter 
Australia. </p>

</b></p>
<p>been victims of trafficking. Nonetheless, they are treated as accused criminals and placed in 
jail. This is a clear violation of the international legal obligation of Australia to correctly 
identify victims of trafficking, to provide immediate protection and support to such persons, 
and to ensure that they are not criminalized for offences relating to the fact of their having 
been trafficked.5 The situation is particularly worrying given that some crew members of 
vessels involved in migrant smuggling appear to be children. The processes used to 
determine their age are such that, to date, all are nonetheless held in adult prisons.6 
</p>
<p>19. Finally, for those migrants arriving without any visa, including by boat, the 
detention scheme in Australia requires their detention for processing. It has been signalled 
that there are some detainees who may in fact be victims of trafficking. There are also 
concerns that some child detainees, lacking proper documentation to ascertain their age, are 
not being identified as children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The legal and policy framework for combating trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Federal legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. Australia is a constitutional democracy with a parliamentary system of government. 
Its Constitution established a federal system in which legislative, executive and judicial 
powers are shared or distributed between federal institutions, six states and three self-
governing territories. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth does not have a general 
power to make criminal laws, meaning responsibility for criminal laws and enforcement 
action rests primarily with the states and territories. Despite this, the Commonwealth has 
the power to legislate with respect to trafficking in persons by virtue of its constitutional 
power to ratify international treaties.  
</p><p>21. Since 2004 Australia is party to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and, since 2005, to its supplementary Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (the 
Trafficking Protocol). Moreover, Australia has ratified seven out of the nine core human 
rights instruments, a number of which have particular relevance to combatting trafficking, 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Australia acceded to the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in 1954, and to its 1967 Protocol on 13 
December 1973. It has also ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and 
Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, and has developed a protocol for 
responding to allegations of child trafficking in intercountry adoption.   
22. Australian law requires treaty obligations to be incorporated into federal law to 
make them directly justiciable. Thus, the country&#8217;s first people-trafficking offences were 
created in 2005 as amendments to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Division 270 of the 
Criminal Code includes offences and maximum sentences for slavery, sexual servitude and 
deceptive recruitment for sexual servitude. Division 271 includes offences and maximum 
sentences for trafficking in persons, trafficking in children, domestic trafficking in persons 
and debt bondage, with higher penalties for aggravated offences, such as when children are 
involved.

</p>
<p>23. Although the Government insists that these laws discharge the obligations of 
Australia under the Trafficking Protocol, a number of shortcomings should be mentioned, 
most notably that the trafficking in persons offence (sect. 271.2) cannot be used against a 
person who recruited or maintained another person in a situation of forced labour or non-
sexual servitude but was not involved in his or her transportation. Moreover, servitude and 
exploitation offences are restricted to instances of purely sexual servitude. Additionally, 
under the current laws, there is a lack of a separate federal offence which criminalizes 
forced labour. While the Government has noted that cases of labour exploitation could 
technically be prosecuted under slavery offences, only the most extreme forms of labour 
exploitation would fall into that category. Moreover, slavery offences set a high threshold 
under which the exercise of &#8213;any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership&#8214; 
</p>
<p>must be made out.7 This difficulty is highlighted by the fact that, to date, only two cases of 
labour trafficking have been prosecuted, despite indications that labour exploitation is a 
growing issue.  
</p><p>24. The Government has acknowledged legislative shortcomings and, in November 
2010, commenced a public consultation that prompted the development of the Exposure 
Draft of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People 
Trafficking) Bill 2012. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the publication of the Bill, tabled 
during the course of her mission, and was pleased to learn that it was developed after wide 
consultation with CSOs and that it receives bipartisan support.   
25. Importantly, the Bill amends the existing definitions applying to trafficking, slavery 
and slavery-like offences to ensure that a broad range of exploitative conduct is 
criminalized. It also creates new offences of forced labour and forced and servile marriage, 
which were difficult to prove under the former legislative framework. Other important 
changes include ensuring that the slavery offence applies to conduct which renders a person 
a slave, as well as to conduct involving a person who is already a slave; extending the 
application of the existing offences of deceptive recruiting and sexual servitude so they 
apply to non-sexual servitude and all forms of deceptive recruiting, and improving 
reparations to victims. The Bill further recognizes that servitude may exist whether or not 
escape is possible or an attempt at escape has been made.   
26. The Special Rapporteur notes that while the Bill should be commended as 
remedying some of the major gaps in the former legislative framework, it does not fully 
address all of the concerns raised by stakeholders. In particular, she observes some 
ambiguity around the elements of the new offences, including the failure to address victim 
and witness protection, and the retention of the problematic requirement of some form of 
entry to or exit from Australia to constitute a trafficking in persons offence (although 
notably, now not required for trafficking-related offences such as slavery, servitude, forced 
labour, forced marriage and deceptive recruiting). She urges the Government to consider all 
submissions on the Bill in order to ensure that the new legislative framework around 
trafficking fully meets the international legal obligations of Australia and provides a strong 
and workable foundation for the country&#8217;s response.  
27. Australia also has a number of other relevant legislative arrangements that can 
contribute to combating trafficking in persons. For example, under the Migration Act 1958 
(Cth) it is an offence for an employer, labour-hire company, employment agency or other 
person to knowingly or recklessly allow a non-citizen without work rights to work, or to 
refer them for work. For aggravated offences&#8212;where such a person is exploited through 
forced labour, sexual servitude or slavery&#8212;maximum penalties rise. The Special 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur notes, however, that only one case of knowingly or recklessly allowing a person 
to work in breach of their visa conditions was successfully prosecuted in 2010. 
</p><p>28. The Fair Work Act 2009 sets out 10 National Employment Standards, including 
minimum entitlements for all employees, such as leave, notice of termination and 
redundancy pay. Also, it is an offence in Australia for Australians to engage in child sex 
tourism offences overseas.8 Other relevant laws include those that implement the country&#8217;s 
non-discrimination obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination9 and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women.10 Australia does not have a bill of rights, and human rights 
are not specifically protected in its Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. State and territory criminal offences 
</b></p>
<p>29. Commonwealth legislation operates concurrently with state and territory laws unless 
otherwise specified or in the event of inconsistency, in which case Commonwealth laws 
prevail. Thus, although the key anti-trafficking legislation is contained in the 
Commonwealth Criminal Code, most states and territories have enacted legislation relating 
to sexual servitude and deceptive recruitment which would allow them to prosecute some 
cases of trafficking.11   
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes however that these laws focus exclusively on 
trafficking for sexual exploitation. All state and territory jurisdictions have a range of 
provisions for crimes commonly associated with incidences of trafficking, such as 
exploitative or forced prostitution, kidnapping, assault (against the victim or family 
members), rape, theft, intimidation, kidnapping and deprivation of liberty. However, it is 
increasingly common for state and territory law enforcement authorities to refer trafficking-
related matters to the federal authorities. 
</p><p>31. Other state and territory laws further complement the anti-trafficking framework. 
For example, in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Victoria, a 
person who is convicted of trafficking in children under the Criminal Code becomes a 
registered sex offender or registered child sex offender,12 and may be subject to further 
detention, supervision and/or monitoring orders.13 Victoria also has a number of laws that 
refer back to the trafficking offences under the Criminal Code, relating to transport

</p>
<p><b> 3. Local laws 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur also learned of local laws that provide further protection for 
trafficked persons. For example, the cities of Yarra and Maribyrnong, both in Victoria, 
require signs in multiple languages to be hung inside each room of a brothel to alert sex 
workers to their rights, provide them with information about trafficking and inform them 
about support services available. She encourages local and State authorities to learn from 
such local initiatives, which are a practical response to specific knowledge on the ground 
and can be valuable tools in empowering victims.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>33. In 2003 the Government established its first National Action Plan to Eradicate 
Trafficking in Persons. In 2009 the plan was transformed into the Anti-People Trafficking 
Strategy, which is based on four pillars: prevention; detection and investigation; criminal 
prosecution; and victim support and rehabilitation. While this is a commendable 
overarching framework and the Government does report annually to the Australian 
Parliament on measures taken to combat trafficking, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
strategy is very general and lacks clear, measurable indicators for assessing outcomes and 
impact.  
</p>
<p>34. The Government should be highly commended for establishing the Anti-People 
Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee, which is a forum where federal agencies come 
together to develop a &#8213;whole of government&#8214; approach to tackle people trafficking. The 
Attorney General&#8217;s Department is the lead government agency coordinating the national 
response; it chairs the Committee, facilitates and reports on the National Roundtable on 
People Trafficking, and administers federal legislation on trafficking, including the current 
draft trafficking bill.  
</p><p>35. As trafficking is a federal crime, the AFP has primary responsibility for 
investigating trafficking cases and maintains dedicated Human Trafficking Teams (HTTs) 
that focus on the investigation of trafficking cases. The HTT National Coordinator is based 
in Canberra, with HTTs in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The Special Rapporteur has 
learned that, in accordance with the Australian Policing Strategy to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons 2011-2013, HTTs are increasingly focusing their attention on states and territories 
where they do not have a presence, and with a renewed focus on labour trafficking. While 
all AFP officers are alerted to the crime of trafficking during their basic training, those who 
work in HTTs are provided with specific training on trafficking in persons, conducted with 
the assistance of international legal experts and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  
36. DIAC also has a human trafficking contact officer in every state and territory and 
compliance officers specifically trained to identify specific indicators of trafficking. DIAC 
maintains three offshore specialized trafficking integrity officers in Manila, Bangkok and 
Guangzhou, China, who examine visa applications for evidence of fraud that may indicate

</b></p>
<p>potential trafficking and analyse trends in visa processing. These officers work in close 
collaboration with the AFP and share intelligence. 
</p>
<p>37. Specific anti-trafficking initiatives have also been established at the state level. For 
example, in Victoria, the Parliamentary Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee requested 
an official inquiry into the trafficking of people for sex work. The report of the inquiry, 
including detailed recommendations, was published in 2010.19 
</p>
<p><b> E. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>38. Between 2004 and March 2012, 191 victims of trafficking were identified. In the 
previous year alone, 45 suspected victims of trafficking were identified. To date, victims 
have been predominately identified in Sydney and Melbourne, with the AFP reporting that 
victims tend to be moved between mainland capitals.   
</p>
<p>39. The majority of trafficked persons are first identified by DIAC. Identification by 
DIAC usually takes place during compliance visits (immigration raids of workplaces and 
homes), which the Government submits are planned field operations to locate identified 
persons of interest who may have overstayed their visa or are reported to be working in 
breach of visa conditions. Interviews are conducted by compliance officers who are trained 
in identifying indicators of trafficking. Any suspect case is referred to the AFP for further 
assessment, regardless of the immigration status of the concerned individual. DIAC noted 
that another comprehensive screening process is conducted for persons who are detained, 
and any indication of trafficking results in a referral to the AFP and the release of the 
individual from detention. DIAC stated that no identified victim of trafficking has ever 
been placed in immigration detention.   
</p><p>40. State and territory police, which are also often the front-line officers encountering 
victims, collaborate with AFP on trafficking cases. In Australian airports, this function is 
carried out by Customs and Border Protection officers, who, upon any suspicion, refer 
cases directly to the DIAC airport migration officer. To date, no victims of trafficking have 
been identified at an airport; however, this may be attributed to the fact that persons often 
only become aware of their exploitation and trafficking once within the country.   
41. The Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman is a new federal agency mandated to 
protect the rights of workers, irrespective of their migration status, and thus may potentially 
play an important role in identifying trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation. The 
Ombudsman, with 416 labour inspectors nationwide, has the power to enter workplaces, 
make inspections, seize documents and carry out auditing in suspect cases and can make 
referrals to the AFP in situations of concern. A further 182 Fair Work Inspectors have been 
engaged through state partner agencies in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and 
South Australia, to carry out compliance activities. Very few cases investigated by the 
Ombudsman involve exploitation that would amount to forced labour, and the Ombudsman 
reported difficulties in being able to identify trafficked persons through the inspections. The 
Special Rapporteur is pleased to note however, that the Office of the Ombudsman did 
indicate its awareness of trafficking as an issue of growing concern, and is forging closer 
relationships with the AFP and DIAC on this point, including trafficking-specific trainings 
for labour inspectors, and is working closely with migrant communities to improve the 
identification of trafficking in workplaces.

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The number of victim identifications referred to the AFP by CSOs had been 
increasing, reaching 13 per cent in 2009/10. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
that number has decreased of late, with only 5.7 per cent of referrals from CSOs in 2010/11. 
Identifications have also been made by members of the community, and anyone with 
information on a potential case of trafficking is encouraged to report it to the police. For 
example, the Attorney General&#8217;s Department published up to 95 advertisements in 
newspapers to alert potential clients of sex workers of the possibility of encountering 
victims of trafficking. A number of victims have also contacted their home embassy in 
Australia. The Government asserts that foreign diplomats and consuls are trained to identify 
victims of trafficking. 
</p><p>43. Despite these diverse methods, the Special Rapporteur notes that only a relatively 
low number of victims of trafficking have been identified. The Government asserts that this 
reflects the low level of trafficking into Australia, citing its remote location, the absence of 
any shared land borders, and robust immigration and visa requirements as dissuasive 
factors. However, the Special Rapporteur observes that the official numbers of identified 
victims may not be indicative of the true extent of the problem of trafficking. For a variety 
of valid reasons, victims of trafficking may not make their cases known to the authorities, 
as highlighted by the trafficked persons with whom the Special Rapporteur met. This may 
explain why official government statistics regarding the numbers of identified trafficked 
persons within Australia often diverge considerably from the case loads reported by CSOs. 
Furthermore, the hidden nature of the crime means that not all cases of trafficking are 
identified. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur concludes that official figures of identified 
victims may underrepresent the true number of trafficked persons in Australia. 
44. The Special Rapporteur has noted some shortcomings with the specific methods of 
identification. While it is commendable that DIAC has established a specialized anti-
trafficking capacity, she remains concerned about the use of immigration raids to identify 
victims of trafficking. In particular, raids are carried out with the specific purpose of 
locating and detaining foreign nationals who have breached their visa conditions or are 
otherwise unlawfully in Australia. Raids that may involve trafficked persons also appear to 
have focused primarily on brothels (although other industries where immigration laws are 
regularly breached are also targeted). This focus may contribute to a failure to identify 
trafficking in other sectors and may also lead to a stigmatization of those sex workers who 
do have the legal right to work. Moreover, while specially trained agents use checklists of 
indicators during these raids, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern regarding the 
interviewing process: suspected victims are interviewed solely by DIAC officials and no 
social worker or psychologist is present. Given the understandable fear of deportation or 
detention, she questions whether these raids are truly effective in identifying victims of 
trafficking. 
45. Furthermore, CSOs report that some persons who arrive without a visa, and who are 
mandatorily detained as a result, may be victims of trafficking. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government that persons interviewed in detention centres, and in particular 
trafficked persons, may be very fearful about speaking with authorities. Only after building 
relationships of trust will victims be willing to disclose their true situation. DIAC should 
therefore work in collaboration with CSOs that are skilled in this area and/or that have 
established such relationships. Any indicator of trafficking noted by these CSOs should be 
referred immediately to the AFP, and the individual concerned should be treated as a victim 
of trafficking while the situation is being clarified.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur further noted that many state and territory police do not 
receive trafficking-specific training, including on the identification or treatment of 
trafficked persons. In Victoria, for example, anti-trafficking work still falls to the sex-
crimes squad, which has limited knowledge of trafficking-specific indicators, particularly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>outside the sex industry. State police forces themselves have noted the need for increased 
training of front-line officers in the detection of trafficking. While the annual training 
course run by the AFP generally includes a small number of state police, this is clearly 
insufficient to establish a critical mass of trained officers. 
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, jurisdictional issues in states continue to present a problem in the 
identification of trafficked persons, particularly in the area of sexual exploitation. For 
example, in states where prostitution is not illegal, police do not actively regulate sex work; 
they only interact with the industry in the case of a complaint or the commission of an 
offence. Other arms of government, including local councils, manage the regulatory and 
licensing aspects of the sex industry. This fragmentation of responsibility has led to a gap in 
the proper regulation of legal sex work, resulting in agencies with little or no experience in 
trafficking overseeing the sex industry, with state and territory police limiting their role to 
the investigations of crimes. This has contributed to a potentially harmful vacuum in terms 
of responsibility for the proper identification of trafficking victims in the sex industry.    
</p>
<p>48. Identification of trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation also appears to be 
less than satisfactory. While the Fair Work Ombudsman does have 53 offices across 
Australia, including 43 offices located outside of metropolitan areas, CSOs working with 
victims of labour trafficking report that one of the main shortcomings is the lack of an 
effective nationwide labour inspections policy, particularly in remote rural areas. The 
Special Rapporteur appreciates that the limited number of labour inspectors from the Office 
of the Ombudsman cannot be expected to comprehensively monitor all Australian 
workplaces. She further notes the steps the Government of Australia has made in this 
regard, in particular the National Overseas Workers initiative, which is aimed at 
monitoring, promoting and ensuring compliance with labour laws in industries identified as 
employing high numbers of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Protection of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>49. In 2011/12 the Government provided 1,055,000 Australian dollars for the Support 
for Trafficked People programme. The programme is administered by the Office for 
Women within the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous 
Affairs and is delivered by the Australian Red Cross. A total of 191 persons have received 
support through the programme as of 15 March 2012. 
</p><p>50. In order to be eligible to access any trafficking-specific support services, a person 
must first be identified by the AFP as a suspected victim of trafficking. A Bridging Visa F 
may be granted to that person for period of up to 45 days, which provides an initial 
reflection period. It is notable that any person identified as a suspected victim of trafficking 
is entitled to this visa and support, regardless of their immigration status. Services include 
access to emergency accommodation; support funds, including a basic living allowance; 
access to medical services, including counselling; case manager contact; and access to legal 
assistance. As most persons on the programme require housing during this phase, most are 
accommodated in hotels or serviced apartments. A second Bridging Visa F may be granted 
in cases where the person is willing but unable to assist police, which allows an additional 
45 days of intense casework and access to financial and social support services.   
</p>
<p>51. In order to be eligible for the next stages of support, the AFP must be satisfied that 
the person concerned is willing and able to contribute to an investigation or prosecution of 
people-trafficking offences. Determinations of contribution are assessed on a case-by-case 
basis by the AFP, and are reportedly not set at a high threshold. Where a contribution to an 
investigation appears possible, victims will be granted a Criminal Justice Stay Visa. 
Support provided at this phase is less intensive than in the initial phase, and includes 
assistance finding long-term accommodation, rent assistance, access to certain medical </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>benefits, court support and legal assistance, employment and vocational training, and 
English classes. 
</p><p>52. Finally, victims who have contributed to an investigation may be granted a Witness 
Protection (Trafficking) (Permanent) Visa, which allows the holder permanent residence in 
Australia. The new visa scheme also entitles immediate family members both inside and 
outside Australia to apply for permanent residency.   
</p>
<p>53. While commending the programme for providing some fundamental services to 
victims of trafficking, the Special Rapporteur notes a number of shortcomings. First, to 
enter the programme and access any of the support services available, persons must be 
formally identified by the AFP as a suspected victim of trafficking: any person who does 
not engage with AFP will automatically be excluded from the programme. Moreover, 
beyond the initial assistance provided under the Bridging Visa F, all ongoing support 
services are dependent on a contribution to criminal justice process or investigation. The 
linking of ongoing support services to contribution to criminal processes should be 
removed, as it imposes an additional burden on victims of trafficking and does not represent 
an adequate acknowledgment of their status as victims.  
</p><p>54. Second, the Special Rapporteur observes that the initial reflection period of 45 days 
is very short. Although an extended period of reflection is possible, in reality it was 
reported that a second Bridging Visa F will only be granted in situations where victims can 
evidence extreme trauma. A 45-day reflection period may not be an adequate time period 
for persons who have been trafficked to reflect and make critical decisions. An initial 
automatic reflection period of 90 days for all persons would be more appropriate and in 
accordance with article 6 of the Trafficking Protocol.  
</p>
<p>55. Third, accessing appropriate accommodation is reportedly very difficult for 
trafficked persons. Most victims on the programme are initially placed in hotels, which 
reportedly is isolating and inappropriate for the needs of newly identified victims of 
trafficking. There are no dedicated government shelters for trafficked persons, and although 
some other supported accommodation is available, the possibility for this to be accessed is 
reportedly extremely limited. CSO-supported housing services are also in short supply. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that more funding should be designated to dedicated 
accommodation for victims of trafficking, including funds to assist CSOs to expand their 
housing and accommodation services for victims as envisaged in article 6 of the Trafficking 
Protocol and affirmed by other key international legal agreements, including article 12 of 
the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, it has also been reported that victims of trafficking on Criminal Justice 
Stay Visas are not entitled to certain government services, such as public housing or higher 
education. The Special Rapporteur notes that because of the long process of investigations, 
this can leave victims in a state of limbo, where, due to limited access to services, they are 
not able to move forward with their lives.    
</p><p>57. Fourth, the Special Rapporteur commends the improvement to the visa framework 
that enables dependents of victims of trafficking who have been granted permanent 
residency to migrate to Australia. Yet although visa costs are provided for, there is no 
financial support for relocation and travel costs to Australia or settlement support upon 
arrival, as provided under other humanitarian visas. The result is that many persons who are 
entitled to bring family members to Australia, and who often have already been separated 
from their family for an extended period, are compelled to postpone the reunification 
process for financial reasons. The Special Rapporteur urges Government to bridge this gap 
and ensure that funding be made available to facilitate this important family reunification 
initiative.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>58. Finally, the Special Rapporteur observed that visa titles, which specify the trafficked 
status of the holder, potentially stigmatize victims by affecting their ability to find 
employment and integrate into an Australian community. A human rights-based approach 
requires placing the needs of all victims at the core of any response, and visa titles should 
be adjusted accordingly so as not to inhibit victims&#8217; recovery and rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>59. In appropriate cases, the AFP refers matters to the CDPP, which evaluates and 
decides whether to pursue the case in court. Australian courts have seen a number of 
successful prosecutions for trafficking-related offences, including a landmark decision in 
the High Court, which affirmed that exploitative prostitution can, under certain 
circumstances, constitute slavery.20 To date, in the 39 cases referred to the CDPP for 
prosecution, 35 people have been charged with trafficking-related offences, resulting in 14 
convictions: nine were convicted for slavery offences, three for sexual-servitude offences, 
one for a trafficking in persons offence, and one for a labour trafficking offence. As of 15 
March 2012 there were seven defendants before Australian courts, three of whom were 
appellants. 
</p>
<p>60. Although prosecutions are widely publicized as a deterrent mechanism, the low 
numbers of prosecutions and convictions confirm what judges and other members of the 
legal profession reported: that the current legal framework makes it difficult to secure 
successful convictions of traffickers. Furthermore, there have been only three prosecutions 
for slavery outside the sex industry to date, indicating additional difficulties in using the 
current law to prosecute trafficking for purposes of forced and exploitative labour. Many of 
the problems with the current legal framework have been addressed in the Bill introduced 
during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit (see paras. 25-26 above). It is hoped that, once passed, 
the new legislation will provide a clearer and more workable framework for the effective 
prosecution of trafficking and related exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Redress for victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>61. Under Commonwealth law, victims of trafficking whose cases have been 
successfully prosecuted may be entitled to a special payment, known as a reparation order, 
which requires the offender, in addition to the penalty for the offence, to make reparation to 
the victim &#8213;in respect of any loss suffered by the person as a direct result of the offence&#8214;.21 
The Special Rapporteur observes that the provision requires a very high degree of 
proximity, which is not always possible for victims of trafficking to prove.  
</p>
<p>62. The Bill proposes to remedy this by amending section 21B(1)(d) so that the offender 
can be ordered &#8213;to make reparation to any person in respect of any loss suffered, or any 
</p>
<p>expense incurred, by the person by reason of the offence&#8214;.22 While the Special Rapporteur 
supports this proposed amendment, she would further recommend that the provision make 
explicit that it includes non-economic loss such as pain and suffering, which are very 
significant for trafficking victims.  
</p>

<p>Trafficking) Bill 2012.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>63. Even with such an improvement in place, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
reparation orders do not provide a significant remedy for many victims of trafficking, as 
very few cases result in successful convictions. Furthermore, the grant of a reparation order 
is discretionary, and defendants may not have assets. Significantly, no reparations orders 
have ever been made in relation to the trafficking in persons offences contained in 
Divisions 270 or 271 of the Criminal Code, further signalling their limited relevance for 
trafficking victims. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur notes that international law obligates Australia to provide 
victims of trafficking with access to effective remedies.23 The Special Rapporteur notes, 
however, that there is no comprehensive national framework for victim compensation. 
Although victims of crimes are able to access compensation under state and territory 
schemes, remedies vary from state to state, with different eligibility requirements, different 
time frames, different caps on the maximum compensation and different access to 
compensation for pain and suffering. Furthermore, some schemes require a psychological 
assessment to prove damage and loss, which many victims are reluctant to undergo given 
their fear of re-traumatization. The Special Rapporteur notes that the establishment of a 
comprehensive federal compensation scheme was an overarching recommendation of the 
public consultation, one that was echoed at the National Roundtable on People Trafficking. 
If implemented, this recommendation would be in accordance with the obligations of 
Australia with respect to remedies under the Trafficking Protocol and international human 
rights law.  
</p>
<p>65. Another important means of redress, specifically for victims of labour trafficking, is 
the recovery of unpaid wages under the Fair Work Act. Under this Act, civil penalties can 
be imposed on top of orders for the reimbursement of unpaid wages. The Fair Work 
Ombudsman has undertaken more than 585 investigations involving migrant workers to 
date, recovering more than $510,000 in unpaid entitlements.24 The Ombudsman noted that 
not all cases necessarily involve exploitation that would constitute forced labour. However, 
there have been a number of notable cases where the victims were trafficked and/or subject 
to forced labour. For example, Kentwood Industries was penalized $123,000 for the 
underpayment of $242,000 in unpaid wages to five Chinese construction works who were 
recruited and brought to Australian under subclass 457 visas. The victims were paid as little 
as $3 per hour and worked up to 21 hours a day, six to seven days a week, with no 
entitlements.25   
</p>
<p><b> I.  Repatriation and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>66. When victims of trafficking on the support programme wish to return home, Red 
Cross caseworkers make contact with the International Office for Migration (IOM). While 
IOM Australia does not have a formal programme in place to assist the return and 
reintegration of victims of trafficking, it does have the capacity to assist the safe return of 
victims of trafficking if requested to do so by a donor, the United Nations or a CSO on an 
ad hoc, cost-recovery basis. Clients so assisted are referred to IOM offices in the country of 
return which, in turn, facilitate the provision of assistance from NGOs or community-based 
organizations.

<p><b> J. Prevention  
</b></p>
<p>67. Community awareness of trafficking is widely recognized as a key prevention 
strategy. Trafficking in persons is generally a new issue for the Australian public, and the 
Australian media has played an important role in raising awareness about it. Yet despite 
increased attention to the issue, accurate reporting on the phenomenon of trafficking 
remains a challenge, with the focus predominately on trafficking in the sex industry. 
Moreover, it continues to be difficult to reach out to those most at risk of trafficking, 
including the migrant population. 
</p><p>68. With the financial support of the Government, a number of NGOs have been 
developing important initiatives to overcome these obstacles. In particular, in 2011, the 
Anti-Slavery Australia, a local NGO, produced three community service announcements, 
which were translated into seven languages and screened in cinemas and on television, that 
address trafficking into domestic servitude, agricultural work and the commercial 
hospitality industry. 
69. The Government of Australia has also funded a number of important projects to 
raise awareness about labour exploitation, and to provide advocacy and outreach for 
vulnerable industries and groups, including migrant workers and sectors that rely heavily on 
migrant labour.26 It has also developed factsheets for employers and employees on 
trafficking; and provided funds to raise community awareness. AIC issued an important 
report on labour trafficking (2010), and is undertaking research into trafficking and the sex 
industry. Future research will focus on the construction industry and trafficking in 
marriage, as well as the development of a framework for monitoring trafficking in persons 
in Australia and a related guide for collecting information and data on trafficking in 
persons. The Special Rapporteur notes that given the focus of the AIC on criminal law and 
practice, its research perspective may be restricted, and thus encourages the Government to 
also liaise with independent research institutions, including universities that are undertaking 
relevant research in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b>  Creating safe migration pathways 
</b></p>
<p>70. Australia operates a total visa system, which the Government claims prevents 
trafficking to Australia. Measures such as offshore intelligence gathering, including visa 
pre-screening, allegedly ensure that potential victims are not granted visas, thus preventing 
their victimization. Through the use of data processing programmes, a decision to deny 
entry can occur with limited assessment of the evidence of individual cases. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that such prevention measures may disproportionately impact on certain 
groups, including women and individuals from specific countries, ethnicities or geographic 
regions. Implementation of the State&#8217;s international legal obligation to take steps to prevent 
trafficking cannot be at the expense of its obligations under international human rights law, 
including the prohibition on racial and sex-based discrimination.   
</p><p>71. The Special Rapporteur has observed that the country&#8217;s restrictive migration policy 
severely limits the possibilities for unskilled migrants to enter Australia legally and safely, 
thereby creating a lucrative market for migrant smugglers and exacerbating the 
vulnerability that feeds trafficking and related exploitation. In this regard, she is encouraged 
by the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme, which enables unskilled or low-skilled 
</p>
<p>  
 26  Grantees include the Australian Council of Trade Unions, for a campaign to combat trafficking in the 
</p>
<p>hospitality, agriculture, manufacturing, construction, domestic work and mining industries, and the 
Australian Hotels Association, for a labour exploitation-awareness project regarding the legal 
employment of overseas workers in the hotel industry. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1

</p>
<p>Pacific Islanders to work in the Australian horticultural industry for up to 7 months in any 
12-month period. To date, the numbers of actual workers under the scheme have been low, 
with only 1,100 visas issued between 1 February 2009 and 16 March 2012. Currently, only 
375 workers are onshore. However, the Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Government 
is planning to expand the programme to additional Pacific Islands and to the hospitality, 
aquaculture and broadacre farming industries, and that it hopes to issue 10,000&#8211;12,000 
visas over the next four years. A small-scale trial is also planned with tourism employers in 
Broome and Western Australia for workers from East Timor. The Government assured the 
Special Rapporteur that the programme is tightly controlled, with integrity checks for 
employers, and minimum wage requirements enforced with payments made directly to 
workers. Where accommodation for workers is included in the package, inspectors approve 
the conditions, and ensure that any amount deducted from workers&#8217; pay for accommodation 
</p>
<p>is reasonable.  
</p><p>72. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for this initiative, which, if 
successfully implemented and monitored, deserves to be recognized as a good practice that 
provides safe migration options for unskilled workers, while ensuring that labour demands 
are met. She also observed that the programme could be extended to other industries, 
including construction, manufacturing, domestic work and home health care. However, she 
reminds the Government that any expansion of the programme must include regular 
inspection and monitoring, to ensure that the risk of exploitation is fully recognized and 
appropriately managed.  
</p>
<p><b> K. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>73. In the fight to combat trafficking, the Government has developed strong partnerships 
with CSOs, and has committed significant resources to CSOs working to combat 
trafficking. The Special Rapporteur commends these initiatives, and encourages the 
Government to expand this work, particularly to CSOs in rural regions, where awareness of 
trafficking may be limited and where exploitation may remain hidden. 
</p><p>74. In particular, since 2008 the Government has convened the annual National 
Roundtable on People Trafficking, which provides a forum for frank discussion of issues 
relating to trafficking in persons between government agencies and CSOs. The Special 
Rapporteur attended the 2011 Roundtable and notes that the Roundtable has helped 
cultivate a robust working relationship between the Government and civil society, where 
issues can be discussed, commitments made, and results achieved. The recent addition of 
the Building and Construction Commission and the Australian Hotels Association to the 
Roundtable will strengthen it as an inclusive and participatory forum. As of 2011, an annual 
meeting of the Senior Officials&#8217; Meeting of the Roundtable has been instituted, and the 
Government of Australia is also developing an online platform for Roundtable members.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>75. Australia is a co-founder and co-chair of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, 
Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, which is aimed at combating 
people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes in the Asia-
Pacific region. While many of the core objectives of the Bali Process reference trafficking 
in persons as well as migrant smuggling, the Special Rapporteur notes that in practice, the 
overwhelming focus of the initiative is on migrant smuggling. She considers that it is 
important that the Bali Process pay greater attention to the issue of trafficking, and is 
encouraged that in 2012 a technical experts meeting will consider practical measures to 
combat trafficking. Australia is also actively engaged in anti-trafficking initiatives through </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and its Working Groups, and through the United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime. 
</p>
<p>76. AusAID also facilitates several programmes relating to trafficking in persons. The 
Asia Regional Trafficking in Persons (ARTIP) Project (2006-2011) supported criminal 
justice systems of participating governments in the Asia region by strengthening national 
law enforcement and judicial and prosecutorial functions, encouraging bilateral and 
regional cooperation and enhancing regional and national legal, policy and research 
capacity. ARTIP has been widely applauded for its innovative and professional approach, 
and is considered to have made a substantial contribution to regional anti-trafficking efforts 
as well as to global understanding of effective criminal justice responses to trafficking. The 
project is currently in a one-year transition phase; the Special Rapporteur was assured, 
however, that the important initiative will be continued in a new form. Another AusAID 
project, Project Childhood, was established in 2010 to prevent and respond to child sex 
tourism in the Mekong subregion. AusAID also funds the International Labour 
Organization to implement the TRIANGLE project (2010-2015) to promote safe labour 
migration and prevent labour exploitation. AusAID further partners with USAID to support 
the MTV End Exploitation and Trafficking (EXIT) campaign (2010-2012) to raise 
awareness of human trafficking in South-East Asian countries. 
</p>
<p>77. The Government of Australia has also developed overseas legal projects to assist 
countries strengthen their legal frameworks to combat trafficking in persons. The Attorney 
General&#8217;s Department and DIAC work together with other Australian agencies to facilitate 
capacity-building activities and provide a number of countries with technical assistance to 
support their efforts to address irregular migration, with a strong focus on trafficking. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the development of stronger links between the various 
technical assistance initiatives undertaken by Australia as well as an explicit commitment to 
promoting international legal standards, including human rights standards in recipient 
countries.  
</p>
<p>78. Bilateral agreements made directly with source countries regarding the identification 
and repatriation of victims and perpetrators are also instrumental in providing a strong 
framework to deal with both victims of trafficking (for return and repatriation) and 
perpetrators (for prosecution and extradition) across borders. However, most of these 
agreements have been concluded with countries in the Asia-Pacific region; there are very 
few such agreements with countries in other important source regions for migrants, 
including Africa. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to expand its 
bilateral engagement on the issue of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Australia has demonstrated strong leadership in combating trafficking in 
persons regionally and domestically, as well as a willingness to learn from experience 
</b></p>
<p><b>and adapt its approach accordingly. However, there are some weaknesses that prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Australia from realizing a genuinely human rights- and victim-based response.   </b></p>

<p><b>(a) Ensure that proposed legislative revisions result in a legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>around trafficking that fully meets the international legal obligations of Australia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that provides a strong and workable foundation for </b>the country&#8217;s<b> response; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop a comprehensive national plan of action, together with 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, delineating responsibilities and including benchmarks and indicators 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>weaken investigatory or prosecutorial capacity.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>81.<b> Identification: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Support further collaborative research, with independent research 
</b></p>

<p><b>identification of victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that in all cases of mandatory detention, including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>involving persons arriving by boat, and in all cases of migrant smuggling, adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguards are put in place to ensure that victims of trafficking are promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>identified and protected;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Improve procedures and practices for the identification of victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking, including through ongoing training within front-line law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies, especially the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Australian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Federal Police and state/territory police, and the Office of the Fair Work

<p><b>the authorities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Establish, at the federal level, a comprehensive compensation scheme for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of trafficking;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Strengthen criminal justice capacity to identify and confiscate assets and

<p><b>enable assets and proceeds to be used for continuing support to victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p> 83.<i> <b></b></i><b>Training and capacity-building: </b></p>
<p><b>(a) Expand the provision of training for criminal justice agencies, paying 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular attention to the needs of front-line law enforcement officials, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and judges, and drawing on the wealth of excellent resources and 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches that have been developed in other parts of the world; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Work to bridge the capacity gap between the Australian Federal Police 
</b></p>
<p><b>and state/territory police, including by establishing specialist units in all states and 
</b></p>
<p><b>territories;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support the development of a stronger investigation and enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity with respect to forced and exploitative labour, targeting particularly the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman.  
</b></p>
<p> 84.<i> <b></b></i><b>Children: </b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that specialist services are available for any child identified as, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspected of, having been trafficked. Further ensure that all such services, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>decisions taken in respect of trafficked children, fully reflect and advance the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle of the best interests of the child; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Appoint an independent guardian for any child identified as, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspected of, having been trafficked in order promote the best interests principle and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to safeguard the rights of that child;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure, in respect of any trafficked person who may be a child, that that 
</b></p>
<p><b>person is presumed to be a child and is accorded the rights of a child unless and until 
</b></p>
<p><b>another determination is formally made.  
</b></p>
<p> 85.<b> Prevention: </b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take steps to raise community awareness of all forms of trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, including trafficking for labour exploitation; particularly, targeting migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, with information translated into their languages, including information 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the rights of migrant workers and avenues for protection and redress; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Continue and expand initiatives aimed at alerting potential clients of sex 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers to the existence of trafficking and exploitation, including their responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>in this regard to ensure that authorities are made aware of suspected cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Increase options for safe and legal migration by expanding initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as the Pacific Seasonal Workers Pilot Scheme; carefully monitor migration </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>programmes such as those administered via the 457 visa and the Pacific Worker 
</b></p>
<p><b>Seasonal Workers Pilot Scheme to ensure they do not become vehicles for trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Monitor and evaluate prevention programmes to ensure they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective and do not stigmatize or stereotype victims and their communities or infringe 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the rights of any person, including potential migrants or visitors to Australia.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. At the international level 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the State: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Labour Organization Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Domestic Workers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Continue to support stronger criminal justice responses to trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>South-East Asia and globally through a strong successor to the Asia Regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trafficking in Persons Project that builds on that p</b>roject&#8217;s achievements and 
</p>
<p><b>relationships;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Increase development assistance aimed at supporting less developed 
</b></p>
<p><b>economies in tackling the root causes of human trafficking. These efforts will help 
</b></p>
<p><b>Australia towards the realization of the Millennium Development Goal target for 
</b></p>
<p><b>development assistance of 0.7 per cent of its gross national product;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Leverage the leadership role of Australia in the Bali Process to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that trafficking in persons is fully integrated into all aspects of the Process while 
</b></p>
<p><b>taking care to guard against confusion between trafficking and migrant smuggling; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Consider appointing an ambassador for human trafficking to further 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen </b>the country&#8217;s<b> already high and positive international profile on this issue 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to complement the work of the Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Pacific region, South-East Asia and globally.
