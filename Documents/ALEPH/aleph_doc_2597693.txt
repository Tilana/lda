The ﬁnancial position of the Group is sound, with efforts focused to secure fundingto support the construction ofthe Boikarabelu coal Mine. The
Boikarabelo coal Mine in South Africa is the only segment ofthe Group. Further information on the operations and ﬁnancial position ofthe Group is set out
in this annual financial report
Review of Operations
Construction of some ofthe mine’s infrastructure continued duringthe period while proiect debt funding was being negotiated, Maior construction activrties
can commence after proiectfundihg ls finalised. The items that occurred during the period were:
7 EHL Energy (Pwi Limited completed the erection of power poles andtransrnission linesfor the 132w power supply The substation and switch room
were also completed during the periods The power supply infrastructure is funded by a deferred payment facility,
7 At the network stabilisation facility ["NSF”), the zotonne axle load switch and signalling system was installed and commissioned. In addition 400
metres of rail was installed to allow for construction access for the rest ofthe railway line system to the mine; and
e The Marapong effluent treatment facility in lephalale and the 53 kilometre pipeline to Boikarabelo Coal Mine are an integral part ofthe mine's
social and labour plan Earthworks were previously completed fora 13 kilometre section of the pipeline adiacent to a main road, installation of 13
kilometresof water pipeline was completed during the period.
The work ofthe Technical Committee, established by the Board in December 2015 to review all aspects ol the pioiect, has now been substantially
completed. The Technical Committee has overseen the deielopment ofa new execution strategy that WIH reducethe capital cost ofthe proiect and reduce
risktiirough the appointment of established EPC contractors with good track records and substantial balance sheets A new mining plan has also been
developed which will maximize recovery of the coal deposit by mining all seams and minimize out-of-pit dumping oiwaste, resulting in increased
productivity and reduced operating costs. All efforts at the mine are now being directed towards having the proiect ready for mobilization of the ﬁrst ofthe
sec contractors in «14 2016.
A Heads of Agreement was concluded with sedgman Limited (ASX/JSE Announcement: 6 May 2015i forthe procurement and construction of the coal
handling plant for a lump sum fixed price of USSlAlrrl This represents a substantial saying over the previously announced estimate of U55200m.

delivered to a short list of three candidates at the beginning oflune 2016 with the appointment ofthe mining contractor expected during Q3 2015
A concept feasibility study for a womw coal fired power station (“WP”) has been received and reviewed There is a very compelling economic case for a
mouth-of-mine IPP with sale ofthe electricity produced to the national utility or a private offtaker. The study does however indicate that soon IPP is not
optimal and lhdMSUMW or ouomw presents a more compelling economic case. This option is now being investigated.
Negotiations with Transnet Freight Rail concerning the Vail tariff, access to Richards Bay Coal Terminal and construction of the rail link are proceeding in a
very positive manner.

policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated, The financial statements are for the
consolidated entity consisting of Resource Generation Limited and its subsidiaries
z) Statementofcompliance

This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance With Australian Accounting Standards, other authoritative
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board including Interpretations and the Corporations Act 2001 Forthe
purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a forcproiit entity.

It is recommended that this ﬁnancial report is read in conjunction With any public announcements made by Resource Generation

Accounting Standards and with international Financial Reporting Standards.

The Financial statements were approved by the Board of directors on 30 August 2016.

Compliance with Wis

The financial report of Resource Generation Limited also complies With International Financial Reporting Standards ("iFRS") as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board l“lAsa"|

Going concern

As at 30 June 2015, the Group had net current assets of $1.2 million (20151518 0 million), made a loss oi $7 7 million (2015. $4 9
mllllOfil forthe year and recorded a net cash outflow lrorn operations oi $5.2mlllion [2015‘ $1.9 million) The Group has a cash
balance at 30 lune 201s of$12 0 million (1015. 528.6 million). The directors have prepared the financial report on a going concern
basis

in concluding that the going concern baSls is appropriate, a cash flow forecast was prepared for the 2017 financial year. The
forecast assumes the receipt of additional funding (allowing the agreement of commercial terms with a Financing Syndicate to
prayide R552 billion (A5515 million] to complete the construction of the Boikarabelo Coal Mine and meet ongoing working capital
requirements. Based on forecast minimum committed costs, the ability of the Company and the Consolidated Group to continue as
going concerns is dependent on securing additional funds before the end of the 30 June 2017 financial year.

The directors are confident that financial close iorthe iundingfrom the Financing Syndicate can be achieved although, given the
numerous conditions precedent contained in the commercial terms, precise time lines are impossible to predict with any certainty.
Management and the Lead Arranger are both targeting end October 2015 for financial close. Assuming financial close occurs on or
around the end of October 2016, construction of the mine would commence immediately thereafter and is scheduled for
completion in Septemher 2018 with first saleable coal production In the last quarter of 2018. The funding is subject to a number of
conditions precedent, including Financing Syndicate credit committee approval and also delivery of takecor-pav oiitake agreements
securing revenues no less than those forecast in the Base Case Financial Model. Although the Company is fully focussed on securing
the runding to be provided by the Financing Syndicate, as a contingency to cover any unioreseen delays in financial close, it has had
advanced discussions with a related party to provide interim funding if required

Notwithstandingthis, should the Group not receive the additional funding referred to above there are material uncertainties as to
whetherthe Company and the Consolidated Group will be able to continue as going concerns and therefore, whether it will realise
its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and atthe amounts stated in the annual financial report
The annual financial report does not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
norto the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company and the Consolidated Group not
continue as going concerns.

_ Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Basis ofprepardti‘on
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for certain properties and iinanciai
instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the
accounting policies below Historical cost Is generally based on the fair values oithe consideration given in exchange iorgoods and
services
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whetherthat price is directly observable or estimated usmg another valuation
technique. in estimatingthe fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics ofthe asset or
liability if market partiCipants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement
date Fair value (or measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a
basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of AASB 2, leasingtransactions that are within the
scope of AASB 117 and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in
AASB 102 or value in use in AASB 136
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1,2 or 3 based on the degree to
which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in
its entirety, which are described as follows:
» Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadiustedl in active markets for identical assets or liabilities thatthe entity can assess at
the measurement dale:
» Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable (or the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly; and
a Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
b) Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries including development partners
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Resource Generation Limited as at
30 lune 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. Resource Generation Limited and its subsidiaries together
are referred to in this financial report as the Group or the consolidated entity.
Control is achieved when the Company:
— has power over the investee;
— is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the lnvestee; and
- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or
more ofthe three elements of control listed above.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses
control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses ot a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and cthercomprehensive incomefrorn the date the Company gains control until the
date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component or other comprehensive income are
attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total Comprehensive income of subsidiaries is
attributed to the owners of the Company and to the nonccontrolling interests even ifthis results in the non-controlling interests
having a deficit balance when necessary, adiustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their
accounting policies into line with the Group‘s accounting policies. All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and
cash flows relating to transactions between members oi the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
c) Segment reporting
The Group has adopted a "management approach“ under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used
for internal reporting purposes, consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board

d] Foreign currency translation

ii) Functional and presentation currency
items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency) The consolidated financial statements are
presented in Australian Dollars, which is Resource Generation Limited's presentation and iunctionai currency.
(ll) Transactions and balances
in preparing the llrlaritial statements or each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity‘s
runctional currency are recognised at the exchange rates prevailing atthe dates or the transactions. At the end of each
reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at falrvalue are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was
determined, Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not restated.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:

» exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction forfuture productive
use, which are included in the cost oithose assets when they are regarded as an adiustment to interest costs on
those roreign currency borrowings;

- exchange dlflerences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks; and

- exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation ior which settlement is
neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation], which
are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit and loss on
repayment orthe monetary items.

Foreign exchange differences reflect the movement ml the exchange rate between the Australian Dollar and the South
African Rand. The exchange rate at 30 June 2015 was 1039312015 9 373i.

(ill) Group companies

The results and financial position of the Group entities (none of which has the currency oi a hyperinllationary ecunornyl
that have a functional currency diﬁerent from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as
follows:

7 Assets and liabilities foreach balance sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date ofthat balance sheet;

7 Income and expenses for each statement or comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates over
the period iunless this is not a reasonable approximation ofthe cumulative effect ofthe rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates ofthe transactions]; and

a All resulting exchange rate differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.

On consolidation, exchange rate differences arisingfrom the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of
borrowings and other finanmal instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other
comprehensive income. when a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part ofthe net investment are regard,
a proportionate share or such exchange dilierences are recognised in the profitor loss, as part ofthe galn or loss on sale
where applicable,
Goodwill and iair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities ofthe
foreign entities and translated at the closing rate
e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value or the consideration renewed or receivable. interest revenue Is recognised on a time
proportional basis using the effective interest method,
Annual Report ms 2o


Resource Generation Limited
_ Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016

Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits Will flow to the Group and the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably. interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding
and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is at the rate that exactly discounts future cash receipts through the expected life
ofthe financial asset to that asset‘s net carrying value on initial recognition,

f) income tax
no income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period‘s taxable income based on the applicable
income tax rate foreach iurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets arid liabilities attributable to temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carryingamounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax laws at the end of the accounting period in the countries where the
Group operates and generates taxable income Management periodically evaluates positions taken where the tax regulation is
subiect to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis ofarnounts expected to be paid to the tax
authorities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences atthe tax rates expected to apply when the assets are
recovered or liability settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantially enacted. rhe relevanttax rates are applied
to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An
exception is made for certain temporary differences arising on initial recognition oian asset or a liability, No deferred tax asset or
liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences it they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination,
that at the time ofthe transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future
taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offsetwhen there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the
entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, orto realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.
The Directors have not recognised any deferred tax assets in relation to carry forward unused tax losses. Given the history of
operating losses the Directors have determined that the most appropriate time to recognise deferred tax assets from carry forward
unused tax losses is when the mine commences production.

g) Cash and cash equivalents
For cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial
institutions, other shortrterm, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible
to known amounts of cash and which are sublect to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdraft; Bankoverdrafts
are shown wlthln borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet

h) impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently
iievents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. other assets such as mining
tenements and mining development are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable Ari impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset‘s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount, The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset‘s fairvalue less costs to sell and value in use. For
the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
which are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets (cash generating unitsl.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset [cashcgeneratlng unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cashcgeneratlng unit) in prior
years, A reversal ofan impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss immediately
The above principles of impairment also apply to miningtenements.

ii Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end or the financial period, which are
unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and usually paid wrthin 30 days of recognition
j) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be requlred to settle the obligation and the amount oi the outflow can be reliably
measured. Provtsidns are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate dithe expenditure required to settle the present
obligation at the reporting date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments orthe
time value of money and the risks spectfic to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as
an lnterest expense,
k] Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue or new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
I) Earnings per share
(it Basic earnings per share l"EPs"l is calculated by dividing the result attributable to equity holders oithe Group bytha
weighted average number ofshares outstanding during the year.
iii) Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used to determine EPS to take intci account:
- the after income tax effect of Interest and otherflnancing costs associated with dilutive potentlal ordinary shares;
and
a the weighted average number oiadditionai ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the
conversion olall dilutive potentlal ordinary shares.
in) Goods and services tax (GST) and Value added tax (VAT)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST Incurred is not
recoverable from the Australian Taxation office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part or the cost of acquisition oi
the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the balance sheet are shown inclusive of GST, The net
amount of GST recoverable from the taxatlon authority is shown as a receivable in the balance sheet
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are
recoverable lrorn, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flows.
The treatment for VAT, in relation to ollshore entities, is consistent with the treatment of GST.
n) Dividends
Provision is made iorthe amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion ofthe
entity, on or before the end ofthe financial year, but not distributed at balance date No dividends were paid or proposed to be
paid to members during the current year.
oi Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains/losses on quaiiiying cash flow
hedges or foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs capitalised during the construction ofa
qualifying asset,

Resource Generation Limited
_ Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
Farthe year ended 30 June 2016
The cost of improvements to or on leasehold properties is amortised over the unexpired period ofthe lease or the estimated useful
life of the improvements, whichever is shorter,
Depreciation on assets is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate their cost, net oftheir residual values, over their useful
estimated lives as follows
Plant and equipment 4-25 years, depending on the nature otthe asset
Computer equipment 2-5 years
Office equipment 1-10 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Leasehold improvements 5 years
The assets‘ residual valves and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted ifappropriate, at each reporting date. An asset's carrying
amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greaterthan its estimated
recoverable amount (Note 1 hl).
p) Employee benefits
(i) Short-term arid long-term employee benefits
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long serVice leave
and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of short»term employee benefits, are measured at their nominal values using the
remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.
Liabilities recognised in respect of long»term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated iuture
cash outflows to be made bythe Group ii’i respect of services provided by employees up to reporting date
{ill Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Contributions to superannuation tvnds by the consolidated entity are expensed in the year they are paid or become
payable,
q) share-based payments
share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Resource Generation Limited Employee share Plan,
The fairvalue of performance share rights granted underthe Resource Generation Limited Employee Share Plan is recognised as an
employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The assessed fair value at grant date of performance share
rights granted to individuals is allocated equally over the period from grant date to vesting date. The value attached to the
performance share rights is the share price on the day of issue,
For options issued and approved by shareholders, tair values at grantdate are determined using a binomial pricing model that takes
into account exercise price, the term oftlle option, the impact ofdilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility
of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option.
r) Leases
Leases oi property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classliied as finance leases, Finance leases are capitalised at the lease‘s inception atthe fair value ofthe leased property or, ii lower,
the present value oithe minimum lease payments, The corresponding rental obligations, net oi finance charges, are included in
other shortterm and longcterm payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The home cost
is charged to profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the asset's
useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion ofthe risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified
as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit
and loss on a straightcline basis over the period of the lease.
Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straightrline basis overthe lease term

5) investments and other ﬁnancial assets
(ii classmcorlon
The Group classihes its financial assets in the following categories. financial assets at fairvalue through profit and loss,
loans and receivables, heldctncmaturltv investments and availablecfnrcsale financial assets. The classification depends on
the purpose for which the investments were acquired Management determlnes the classification of its lnvestments at
initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held to maturity, recevaluates the designation at each reporting
date.
- Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with flxed or determinable payments that are not quoted
In an active market and are subsequently measured at amnrtised cost using the effective interest rate method
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables (Note 3)
(ii) Derecognirion
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual right to receipt of cash flows expires or the asset is transferred to
another party, whereby the entity no longer has any signiﬁcant continuing involvement in the risks and benefits associated
with the asset, Financial liabilities are derecognised where the related obligations are either discharged, cancelled or
expire The difference between the carrying value ofthe financial liability extinguished ortransferred to another party and
the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of nonvcash assets to liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit
or loss,
(iii) Impairment
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group ofrinancial
assets is impaired. in the case ofeqvity securities classified as availablerforcsale, significant or prolonged decline in the fair
value ofa security below its costs is considered as an indicator thatthe security is impaired if any such evidence exists for
availablerforcsale financial assets, the cumulative loss (measured as the difference between the acquisitlon costs and the
current falrvalue, less any impairment loss on that financlal asset preVlously recognised in profit or loss) ls removed from
equity and recognised in the profit and loss impairment losses recognised in the profit and loss on equity instruments
classified as available»for-sa|e are not reversed through the profit and loss
If there IS evidence of impairment for any of the Group's financial assets carried at amortlsed cost, the loss is measured as
the difference between the asset‘s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future
credit losses that have not been incurred. The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset‘s original effectlve interest
rate. The loss Is recognised in the profit and loss,
t) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production orqualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until
such time as the assets are substantially ready forthelr Intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

u) Comparative figures
when required by accounting standards, comparative hgures have been adiusted to conform to changes in presentation forthe
current financial year

v) New accounting standards and interpretations

In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and interpretations issued by the Australian

being deducted from the carrying amount ofthese investments.
y) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation costs are accumulated in respect oleach separate area of interest. Exploration and evaluation costs are
expensed as Incurred and only carried forward where there is certainty that the right of tenure otthe area of interest is current and
they are expected to be recouped through sale or successful development and exploitation of the area of interest.
Once the technical leasibllltyand commerCIal viability of the area of interest are demonstrable, all carrying costs In respect 0! that
area or interest are transferred to mining tenements and mining development
When an area of Interest is abandoned or the Directors decide that it is not commercially viable, any accumulated costs in respect
of that area are written off In the financial yearthe decision is made Each area of interest is also reviewed at the end at each
accounting year and accumulated costs impaired to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future.
1) Mining tenements and mining development
Mining tenement and mining development costs are accumulated in respect or each mine Carried costs include exploration and
evaluation costs which have been transferred once the technical reasibility and commercial viability of the related mine is
established lsee accounting policy y) Development costs and overhead costs that are directly attributable to the mine development
are also capitalised, together With borrowmg costs incurred during the construction of the mine (see accounting policy t).
Development costs related to a mine are carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped either through sale or
successful exploitation of the mine.
When a mine ls abandoned or the Directors decide that it is not commercially viable, any accumulated costs In respect of that area

1, Financial risk management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety offinancial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price
rlsk), credit risk and liquldltv risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability oifinancial
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance or the Group.
Risk management is carried out bythe Board of Directors and management under policies approved by the Board The Board and
management identify and evaluate financial risks and provide principles for overall risk management.
a) Market risk
(i; interest rate risk
The Group is not exposed to any material interest rate risk as the Noble uso borrowmg IS fixed at 10.75% per annum.
Interest on the EHL borrowing ‘is payable at the ABSA Bank prime lending rate plus 3%. A 10% movement in the interest
rate would result ‘in an increase/decrease in development costs of $0.1m 12015: $0.1ml.
{ii} Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and ‘is exposed to currency exposures in respect of the South African Rand ‘in relation to
the development and exploration activities in South Africa and the us Dollar in respect of borrowmgs. Foreign exchange
risk is managed through the holding of cash deposits in both South African Rand and US Dollarto match lorecast
expenditure over the near term, The foreign exchange exposure is not hedged,
If the South African Rand weakened/strengthened against the Australian Dollar by 10% since SOJune 2016 the impact on
the Group's net loss after tax would amount to $0.5m (2015 : $nill. lfthe South African Rand weakened/strengthened
against the US Dollar by 10% since 30Jurle 2015 the impact an the Group's net loss altartax due (0 retranslation of the US
Dollar borrowings would amount to $3.4m (2015 , $2.9m), Other components of equity would not have been aflected,
with the exception of the foreign currency translation reserve which would have been increased/decreased by $6.8m
(2015: $2.2ml with a 10% movement in the South African Rand against the Australian Dollar
The Group‘s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows:

(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk as it holds no investments in securities classified on the balance
sheet either as available-lorsaie or atfalr value through profit or loss. The Group is exposed to commodity price risk to the
extent it relates to funding activnies,
b) Credit risk
The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at balance date to recognised
financial assets, is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the balance
sheet and notes to the financial statements.
The Group has no material credlt risk exposure to any single receivable or receivables under financial instruments entered
into by the Group.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial
institutions only independently rated parties With a minimum rating by Standard Ki Fears of “A” are accepted.
cl Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash to meet commitments as and when they fall due.
Cash flow forecasting monitors liquidity requirements The Group has $7.0m (2015. $7 3m) in trade and other payable: as
at 30 June 2016, all cl which are due within 6 months.
i1) Cash llow and fair value interest rate risk
Asthe Group has no variable interestrbezring liabilities, its income and operating cash flows are not materially exposed to
changes in market interest rates The Group has $11,9m lzols: $28.4m) in interest bearing accounts which is subject to
movements in interest rates. At the current level of interest rates, any risk is considered minimal.
E) Fair value estimation
in estimating the fairvalue or an asset ora liability, the Group uses marketcobservable data to the extent it is available
Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party qualitied valuers to periorm the valuation.
a. Critical accounting estimates andjudgements
The preparation offinancial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise itsiudgement in the process ofapplyingthe Group's accounting
policies. The areas involVing a higher degree ofiudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant
to the financial statements, are disclosed below.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations or future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable underthe
circumstances The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adiustmentto the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
The accounting policies and methods oi computation adopted in the preparation of the tinancial report are consistent with those
adopted and disclosed in the company's ﬁnancial report for the year ended 30 June 2015 These accounting policies are consistent
wrth Australian Accounting Standards and with international Financial Reporting Standards.
Development expenditure
Development expenditure incurred by or on behali orthe consolidated entity is accumulated separately for each mine in which
economically recoverable reserves have been identified to the satisfaction of the Directors. Such expenditure comprises direct costs
plus overhead expenditure incurred which can be directly attributable to the development process, in accordance with AASB 115
‘Property, Plant& Equipment‘.
All expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of commercial levels of production ltom each area of interest ‘is carried
forward to the extent which recoupment out of revenue to be derived from the sale of production from the area of interest, or by
its sale, is reasonably assured. Once commercial levels of production commence, the development expenditure in respect or that
area of interestwlll be depreciated on a straight-line baSis, based upon an estimate of the life of the mine
Expenditure on the Boikarabelo Coal Mine has been fully capitalised as per Note 11. The Group is confident of the full recovery or
the expenditure on the Bolkarabelo Coal Mine on the basis of the financial modelling orthe mine incorporating forecast production,
sales levels and capital expenditure. This model is updated regularly and used to assess whether an impairment provision is
required. Based on the current critical estimates andjudgements, the Directors do not believe thatan impairment provision is
required.
Restatement of accounts
The accounts have been restated in respect of the accounting for loans to the Group‘s BEE partner and also accounting forforeign
exchange on acquisition adjustments

(i) Loan to BEE partner
In 2011, the Group loaned its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) partner, Fairy Wing Trading 13o (Pty) Limited (Fairy Wing), R80
million ($7.3 million) to facilitate its 26% acquisition of Ledjidja Coal (Pty) Limited (Ledyadya). In 2013, an additional R39 million
(33.5 million) was loaned to Fairy wing, to fund its 26% acquisition of Waterberg One Coal (Pty) Limited (Waterberg One). The loans
are secured over Fairy Wing's shares in Lediadya and Waterberg One and are repayablc out offuture dividends. interest on the loans
was deferred from 1 lanuary 2014 until commencement of coal production at the Bolkarabelo Coal Mine at which time interest will
be payable at the prime rate quoted by Standard Bank of South Africa plus 3%
Guidance from the South African Institute of chartered Accountants in respect of accounting for BEE transactions, which is
consistent with AASB 2 Share-based Payment, indicates that loans to BEE partners made on noncommercial terms should be
treated as share-based payments, in light of this guidance and having regard to the terms of the Fairy Wing loans, including the fact
that they are secured over Fairy Wing’s shares in the respective subsidiaries and are in substance only repayaple out offuture
dividends from coal production, the directors have concluded that instead of recognising loan receivables at inception, the financial
statements should have reflected a charge to profit and loss.
The restatement in relation to this reverses the prewously recorded loan carrying values, including accrued interest, against
retained earnings. It also includes the related impact on the foreign currency translation reserve.
(ii) Foreign exchange on acquisition adjustments
The Group previously acquired interests in South African subsidiaries that held exploration licences lurtne Balkarabelo Coal Mine
proiect. The difference between the net assets of the subsidiaries acquired and the purchase consideration was recorded as an
exploration asset, subsequently reclassified to mining tenements and mining development assets. Such differences should be
treated as assets ofthe foreign operation and therefore foreign exchange differences arising on translation of these assets for
consolidation purposes shall be recorded in the foreign currency translation reserve,
The restatement reflects this accounting. The reduction ofthe mining tenement and mining development asset balance reflects the
weakening of the South African Rand against the Australian dollar.
