<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION  
</b> 
1.  The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, and 
should also be read in the context of my report submitted to the General Assembly (A/63/36). It 
comes at the end of the institution-building and consolidation period of the Council.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II.  SUPPORT FOR THE WORK OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL  
AND THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF ITS MECHANISMS</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2.  Over the past year, Member States have expressed the need for greater interaction and 
consultations by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) with the Council. Since assuming the office as High Commissioner for Human Rights 
in September 2008, I have taken steps to acquaint myself with the relationship of the General 
Assembly and Council vis-&#224;-vis the Office. All three institutions have their respective authority 
and mandates, and their levels of autonomy and independence must be respected. I believe that 
transparency and cooperation should be the hallmarks of the support provided by OHCHR to the 
Council. I intend to continue to enhance periodic briefings with all delegations.   
</p>
<p> 
3.  As a part of the United Nations Secretariat, the Office is subject to the United Nations 
intergovernmental system of oversight for Secretariat programmes. In accordance with the 
United Nations Financial Regulations and Rules, OHCHR contributes to the Strategic 
Framework, which represents the Secretariat-wide biennium programme plan.  The Framework 
is prepared by the Secretariat under the overall authority of the Secretary-General, and reviewed 
by the Committee for Programme and Coordination, before being submitted for approval to the 
General Assembly. As such, it forms the basis for the approval of the OHCHR budget by the 
General Assembly. My predecessor, when presenting her annual report to the Council at its 
seventh session, committed herself, on a voluntary basis, to sharing with all Member States the 
contribution of OHCHR to the Strategic Framework, for comments to be conveyed to the New 
York-based governing bodies for their consideration. Although my predecessor stated that this 
should not serve as a precedent, I intend to follow this practice.  
 
4.  The Strategic Framework is not to be confused with the Strategic Management Plan, 
previously known as the Office Annual Appeal, which is a results-based management tool.  The 
Plan builds on the Strategic Framework and focuses its implementation to enhance office-wide 
coordination, thereby ensuring the best possible utilization of the available extra-budgetary and 
regular budget resources. To fully inform Member States of both elements of OHCHR funding 
and expenditure, regular and extra-budgetary, the Plan is made public. I am committed to 
pursuing a cooperative and transparent approach with all Member States. In this spirit, I intend to 
arrange periodic gatherings for the purpose of sharing information with all delegations. I also 
consider it appropriate for the High Commissioner to make suggestions or recommendations to 
the Council on issues of common concern. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
A.  Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>5.  The establishment of the universal periodic review has led to the reinforcing of the level 
of cooperation between States, the Human Rights Council and United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. As the experience of the review of the first 48 States in April, May and December </p>

 <p> 
2008 showed, States take on their responsibility very seriously, fully engaging in the preparation 
of national reports through broad consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and actively 
participating in the actual review at all levels. Indeed, various countries reviewed undertook firm 
commitments to strengthen their cooperation with special procedures, ratify human rights 
instruments to which they were not yet parties and take initiatives to better implement human 
rights at the national level.  
</p><p> 
6.  I find it particularly encouraging that the Council provides a forum for the review of the 
situation of human rights in all States, including those which had not come under the scrutiny of 
the Commission on Human Rights. The review reveals that all States face challenges in the 
implementation of their obligations and commitments in the human rights area. Good practices 
are emerging in various States. In the longer term, I believe that, for the second review cycle, it 
will be advisable to identify a shorter but more precisely defined list of Council 
recommendations to States under review.  
 
7.  In the same vein, in the conceptualization of the second cycle, a process in which my 
Office will continue to play an active role, it will be important to consider the injection of 
independent expertise in the review process so as to strengthen it into an effective 
implementation mechanism with targeted and prioritized recommendations to be addressed to 
States under review.  
</p>
<p> 
8.  Indeed, the new mechanism may also serve as a tool for strengthening the promotion and 
protection of all human rights for all on the ground. To this end, the field presences of my Office 
are an essential interface between the international human rights machinery and needs at the 
national level so that they can be reflected accurately in recommendations and conclusions, and 
their implementation facilitated, in particular, in relation to requests for capacity-building and 
technical assistance. My Office is working with other agencies, United Nations departments and 
international organizations with a view to organizing, at the regional and subregional levels, 
training sessions prior to the consideration of reports of States under review. The Office also 
supports the setting-up of an adequate system for the implementation of the recommendations for 
technical cooperation made in the context of the review process, to be funded by the Universal 
Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance. In this regard, I 
would urge Member States to contribute generously to the Fund.   
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Thematic panels and special sessions 
</b> 
9.  The consideration of thematic issues in the format of panels and general discussions has 
proved to be a practical and informal way to focus attention on a number of subjects that warrant 
an exchange of views in the framework of the Council. Such discussion forums seem to be 
particularly suited for deliberations on issues too circumscribed in scope and nature to merit the 
creation of permanent dedicated mandates, and for the consideration of cross-cutting topics.   
Urgent matters or emergency situations, however, such as the global food crisis or the impact of 
the financial crisis, are best being addressed through thematic special sessions. While I welcome, 
in principle, the proliferation of thematic forums, it is important to delineate more clearly the 
choice of topics and the working arrangements to ensure that discussions are substantive in 
nature and fully integrated into the Council&#8217;s activities in a meaningful and results-oriented 
manner.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>10.  It should be recalled that the reform of the Commission on Human Rights was initiated 
against the background of politicization and polarization that had led to its de facto paralysis. 
Since its inception in June 2006, the Council has witnessed a re-surfacing of confrontational 
terms, in particular when addressing country-specific issues. This is regrettable. I urge all actors, 
both governmental and non-governmental, to continue to uphold the spirit of the reform and 
dialogue.  In this respect, I wish to emphasize that the special sessions convened by the Council 
to respond to serious and urgent situations serve for the most part as very good examples, not 
only of the responsiveness of the intergovernmental body to emergencies, but most importantly, 
of the potential of a united Council to reach results-oriented outcomes and to put into practice its 
protection mandate.  
 
11.  It is of crucial importance that the Council is equipped with all appropriate and necessary 
tools and mechanisms to deal with urgent and chronic human rights country or thematic 
situations. In this regard, I believe it would be of use to analyse in the context of the 2011 review 
of the Council other formats that could be used to serve this purpose. For example, in addition to 
the special sessions framework, special briefings or events could be organized to deal with, for 
instance, the impact of the current global economic crisis on the protection of human rights. 
Similarly, the consideration of country or regional situations would be facilitated by a 
broadening of the possible outcomes of special sessions. Declarations, President&#8217;s statements or 
press statements may be envisaged as possible outcomes of any special session, meeting, briefing 
or event.   
</p>
<p> 
<b>C.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>12.  I wish to emphasize the effective work performed by the special procedures as the 
Council&#8217;s fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms with the ability to engage on thematic or 
country-specific issues consistently over a longer period of time. I encourage the Council to 
continue to engage actively with Member States and the special procedures in relation to the 
implementation of their recommendations.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>13.  In 2008, my Office assumed major responsibilities as a result of the outcomes of the 
review, rationalization and improvement of mandates and the appointment of 27 new mandate-
holders. While a number of country mandates have been discontinued by the Council over the 
past year, all thematic mandates have been renewed, and a new mandate was created on access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation. In addition, in 2008, a new mandate-holder was appointed for 
the mandate on contemporary forms of slavery, created in September 2007. The review of 
mandates has also expanded the activities or scope, or the reporting requirements, of a number of 
special procedures. 
 
14.  My Office continues to provide substantive support to individual mandate-holders.  
Dedicated support has also been provided to the system of the special procedures as a whole, as 
represented by the Coordination Committee. The Committee has been supported in its continuing 
efforts to harmonize the working methods of the system. I am pleased to note that, in the 
President&#8217;s statement adopted on 18 June 2008 (PRST/8/2), the Council acknowledged the role 
of the Committee. We have successfully ensured a smooth transition between outgoing and new </p>

 <p> 
mandate-holders, through the organization of information sessions for groups of mandate-
holders, as well as through individual inductions.   
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>15.  The special procedures are uniquely placed to act as an early warning system in relation 
to situations involving serious human rights violations, stemming from their ability to monitor 
the situation in any country of the world in the context of their specific mandates. I am 
encouraged by the fact that, in recent years, with the support of my Office, mandate-holders have 
developed consistent approaches to serious crisis situations and engaged in a reflection on the 
systematization of collective responses in cases where certain situations could spiral into grave 
human rights violations. There has been an increase in joint activities by mandate-holders in the 
form of joint communications, joint missions and joint statements. 
 
16.  I am pleased to note that the special procedures have contributed to the special sessions 
of the Council. One example was the special session held in May 2008 dedicated to &#8220;the negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food of the worsening of the world food crisis, caused 
inter alia by the soaring food prices&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food had called for 
this event, which constituted the first ever thematic session of the Council.    
 
17.  In the context of recent crisis situations, the Council has tasked several thematic 
mandate-holders with specific country reporting functions. For instance, the Council has 
requested on two occasions seven mandate-holders to examine, within their respective mandates, 
the current situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to report thereon to the 
Council. Most recently, the Council has mandated all relevant special procedures and other 
mandate-holders to urgently seek and gather information on the violation of the human rights of 
the Palestinian people and to report thereon to the Council. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>18.  I encourage the Council to take immediate, decisive and appropriate action on the 
recommendations submitted by the special procedures in response to crisis situations. I also 
encourage the Council to consider how it can provide mandate-holders and my Office with 
sufficient capacity and resources so that important activities in the context of emerging or actual 
crisis situations are not undertaken at the expense of the capacity and resources required to carry 
out the regular monitoring mandates of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> 
III. DEVELOPMENTS IN STRATEGIC THEMATIC AREAS 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
A.  Combating discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>19.  OHCHR provides leadership within the United Nations system in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and in promoting the principle of 
equality and non-discrimination. Combating all forms of discrimination is a standing priority of 
the Office. In addition to the dedicated Anti-Discrimination Unit, several other parts of the 
Office work on the promotion of the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as 
indigenous peoples and minorities, and focus on women and gender issues as well. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>20.  As part of the general anti-discrimination agenda outlined in the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, the Office has undertaken several key activities to implement the 
mandates set out in the agenda (further elaborated in chapter VI), among them providing </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>substantive and secretariat support to the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent, the Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, and for the first session of the Ad Hoc Committee on 
Complementary Standards, as well as contributing to the elaboration of guidelines on a good 
practices database and advancing the elaboration of the guidelines for the adoption of anti-
discrimination legislations, policies and mechanisms. In addition, the Office has continued to 
organize events to raise awareness in the fight against racial discrimination, including a high-
level panel discussion for the commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination (21 March), and holding consultations with regional and United Nations 
agencies to enhance cooperation in the fight against racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 
B.  Indigenous and minority issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>21.  I am happy to report the continuing attention given by the international community to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. My Office is providing full support to the work of the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, launched in 2008. We have also taken a leading 
role in the promotion of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
adopted in September 2007, including through inter-agency cooperation. This has led to 
substantial recommendations for the integration of the Declaration into United Nations policies 
and operational programmes. The incorporation of the Declaration into national normative and 
institutional frameworks is another crucial goal for OHCHR    
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>22.  Among the commitments assumed by States in the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action is that law enforcement agencies should be representative of, and responsive and 
accountable to, the community as a whole. In this regard, my Office has developed Guidelines 
and Good Practice on Diversity in Policing, in consultation with experts from all regions. In 
cooperation with the Inter-Agency Group on Minority Issues, my Office has also developed an 
information tool, entitled &#8220;Towards developing country engagement strategies on minorities&#8221;, to 
provide relevant expertise to United Nations country programmes. We have also launched a 
regional Andean project on the promotion of the human rights of Afro-descendants in Bolivia, 
Ecuador and Peru, to build the institutional capacity of Afro-descendant organizations and to 
enable them to better defend their human rights.  
 
23.  Enhancement of skills and expertise of the Office staff and of stakeholders is paramount 
in our efforts to promote and protect the human rights of minorities and indigenous peoples. To 
that end, the Office held a training workshop in Addis Ababa for OHCHR staff in Africa, and 
continued its capacity-building fellowships programmes for indigenous and minority 
representatives. The Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations funded the travel of more than 
70 indigenous representatives to the seventh session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues and the inaugural session of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
while the Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery funded over 30 projects 
providing aid to victims and addressing problems of contemporary forms of slavery. 
 </p>
<p><b>C.  Gender and women&#8217;s rights 
</b> 
24. Whether in conflict or in peace, deeply rooted gender inequality and far-reaching 
discrimination against women are a reality, resulting in the denial of basic human rights and </p>

 <p> 
contributing to various forms of violence. The Plan of Action for 2005 and the Strategic 
Management Plan for the period 2006&#8211;2007 put gender and women&#8217;s rights at the core of the 
work of the Office. While the Women&#8217;s Human Rights and Gender Unit established to this end 
in 2006 remains small, it has focused on legal analysis, advocacy and development of tools in 
selected key areas. As a contribution to the Secretary-General's campaign to eliminate violence 
against women, my Office sponsored and provided the main legal analytical contribution to the 
&#8220;Seeking justice&#8221; conference, held in September 2008 together with the non-governmental 
organization Medica Mondial, with participants from 26 mainly conflict and post conflict 
countries to examine the impact and appropriateness of transitional justice with respect to 
women. The legal analyses have also served as the basis for training sessions and briefings for 
several Governments on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 
1820 (2008). 
</p><p> 
25. My Office has provided guidance and assistance to intergovernmental, governmental and 
non-governmental stakeholders to facilitate the integration of women&#8217;s rights and a gender 
perspective. We organized two discussions on laws that discriminate against women, on 4 April 
and 9 June 2008, and contributed to a Government-led discussion on the subject together with 
members of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, on 24 October 
2008. We also facilitated three interactive discussion panels on gender and women&#8217;s rights 
during the eighth and ninth sessions of the Council, on the questions of violence against women, 
maternal mortality as a human rights issue, and the integration of a gender perspective into the 
Council&#8217;s work.  
 
26. OHCHR country offices have been systematically integrating gender into their work. In 
addition, an office-wide gender evaluation will be undertaken and a high-level OHCHR 
reference group has been created to guide the process of further mainstreaming activities.  
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Combating impunity and prevention of genocide 
 </b> 27. The issue of combating impunity is critical to the realization of human rights, as laid out 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. I 
believe that national and international measures must be taken to secure the right to the truth, the 
right to justice, the right to reparation and other guarantees of non-recurrence.  
 
28. There have been advances in addressing impunity through developments in international 
law and practice. In this respect, I would highlight the major prosecutions of sexual violence as 
war crimes; the recognition of the incompatibility of amnesties that lead to impunity with the 
duty of States to punish serious crimes under international law; the clarification of States&#8217; 
obligations to combat impunity for serious violations of economic, social and cultural rights; and 
the recognition of the need to ensure broad public consultations, including with victims, in the 
design and implementation of measures for combating impunity. However, much still remains to 
be done, particularly at the national level, to shore up accountability for serious violations.   
 
29. Courts, police, parliaments and inspection and oversight bodies, such as national human 
rights institutions, play an instrumental role in the fight against impunity. OHCHR has developed 
special tools for the training of judges, lawyers and prosecutors, and carried out several technical </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>assistance programmes in this area. The Office also expanded its support for legal system 
monitoring. This included training for staff of peace operations and an expert workshop to 
explore practices, lessons learned and further guidance.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>30. OHCHR has also continued to support the strengthening of accountability structures, 
with emphasis on mechanisms of investigations at the national and international levels. A tool 
recording best practices related to national commissions of inquires is being developed. 
Attention is also being given to the protection of witnesses.   
 
31. As requested by the Council in its resolution 7/25, OHCHR organized a seminar on the 
prevention of genocide, which was held on 21 January 2009, and included the participation of 
the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. The objective of the 
seminar was the discussion of preventive strategies, initiatives and mechanisms that currently 
exist within the United Nations human rights system, as well as the role of Member States, 
regional bodies and other entities in the prevention of genocide.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>32. When States are unwilling or unable to genuinely investigate and prosecute genocide, 
war crimes and crimes against humanity, international justice must be provided. To close the 
impunity gap, States should consider deepening their cooperation with the International Criminal 
Court. It is essential that the independence of the Court be preserved and that no measure be 
taken to undermine its ability to rule on matters before it. 
 
33. Restoring confidence in national justice systems in the aftermath of conflict remains a 
challenge. OHCHR has continued to lead the United Nations system on transitional justice 
issues. It developed nine policy tools and contributed to finalizing two sets of principles and 
guidelines, to assist the United Nations system, transitional administrations and civil society to 
better craft their responses to transitional justice needs. OHCHR tools are grounded in 
international standards and contain lessons learned from United Nations operations, including 
with regard to prosecutions, the legacy of hybrid courts, amnesties, truth commissions, 
reparations programmes, national consultations and vetting. An additional tool on archives is 
being developed.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>34.  To facilitate the operational use of existing standards and tools on transitional justice, in 
March 2008, the Office convened a regional expert workshop in Phnom Penh focusing on the 
tools and the legacy of hybrid courts and on reparations programmes, taking stock of transitional 
justice activities and further needs in the region. A similar regional workshop was convened in 
November 2008 in Burundi together with the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi.  
OHCHR also participated in the preparatory meeting on Justice and Reconciliation in Somalia, 
held in Djibouti on 22 and 23 November for the members of the high-level committee 
established in the framework of the Djibouti Agreement of June 2008 and civil society.   
 
35. The duty of States to respect human rights while countering terrorism remains a priority 
for the Office. In implementing the human rights pillar of the United Nations Global Counter-
Terrorism Strategy, OHCHR fed into the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and 
guided the activities of the working group on protecting human rights while countering 
terrorism. An expert meeting was organized to initiate discussion and provide recommendations </p>

 <p> 
for the promotion and enhancement of the protection of economic, social and cultural rights in 
the context of countering terrorism.  
</p><p> 
36. The working group on protecting human rights while countering terrorism selected 10 
areas of counter-terrorism measures or policies that are used by Member States, which require 
additional guidance to clarify their human rights obligations and ensure compliance therewith. 
The tools will be developed in early 2009.  
 
37. With the view that human rights protection must be enshrined in constitutions, a seminar 
to strengthen the capacity of OHCHR to provide constitutional assistance to States was 
organized in Geneva in December 2008.   
</p>
<p><b> E.  Migration 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b> 38. Migration offers great opportunities and benefits to receiving and sending countries as 
well as to migrants and their families, but there are also challenges that need to be addressed. As 
the financial crisis turns into an economic crisis, a rise in xenophobia, anti-migrant sentiments 
and discriminatory practices is likely to affect the rights of migrant workers and members of 
their families. Migrant workers will be, and already are, the first ones to lose their jobs, not only 
because their status is called into question but also because they are employed in sectors that are 
particularly affected by the crisis. In responding to the financial crisis, States need to ensure that 
domestic policy adjustments, particularly those in fiscal spending, are not made at the expense of 
the poor and the marginalized through cutbacks in spending in the health, education and social 
protection sectors, which would have a disproportionate impact on migrant workers and their 
families. Strengthening and maintaining social protection systems while ensuring access to basic 
services are crucial to support populations as a whole, as well as those especially vulnerable and 
marginalized.   
 
39. One worrisome trend being witnessed today is the increasing criminalization of irregular 
migration, with violations of migrants&#8217; rights during all phases of the migration process. This is 
linked in many countries to persistent anti-migrant sentiment, which is often reflected in policies 
and institutional frameworks designed to manage migratory flows, sometimes in a purely 
restrictive manner and involving mandatory detention. There are many criminal justice practices 
used by States to combat irregular migration, including greater criminalization of migration 
offences (as opposed to treating them as an administrative offence) and cross-border 
collaboration by police and other authorities, which have, in certain cases, resulted in increased 
violations against migrants. While comprehensive State policies &#8211; as opposed to ad hoc measures 
&#8211; on migration are desirable, these policies must incorporate a human rights-based approach, 
including protection against arbitrary detention. To address these issues, together with other 
partners, OHCHR co-organized a number of conferences and seminars, such as the African 
Parliamentary Conference on Migration, in Rabat, in May 2008, a regional conference on 
refugee protection and international migration in West Africa, in Dakar, in November 2008 and a 
parallel event to the seventh session of the Council on the challenges of irregular migration, with 
the participation of national delegations, non-governmental institutions and trade unions.   
 
40. As a founding member of the Global Migration Group, OHCHR contributed 
substantively to the report published in October 2008 on international migration and human </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights. The report advocates for a human rights-based approach to migration and recalls that 
respecting human rights is not only a legal obligation but also a precondition for our societies to 
grow and prosper in peace and security. 
</p><p> 
41. Together with the Government of Mexico, OHCHR co-organized in September 2008, the 
International Meeting on the Protection of the Rights of Children in the Context of International 
Migration. At the Meeting, participants discussed aspects related to the human rights of children 
in the context of migration, and adopted a set of recommendations to that effect. As the convenor 
of the steering committee for the promotion of ratification of the Migrant Workers Convention, 
in which the International Labour Office (ILO), the International Organization for Migration, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and several non-governmental organizations participate, 
OHCHR continued its advocacy for the ratification of the Convention.  
 
42. States and intergovernmental organizations need to review existing migration 
frameworks, which, by failing to respect the basic human rights of migrants, may increase their 
vulnerability and thus their risk of becoming victims of trafficking. Particular attention should be 
given in this regard to the preservation of the principle of family unity. States have an obligation 
to prevent trafficking and associated human rights violations, including through addressing the 
factors that increase vulnerability to trafficking, such as inequality, poverty and discrimination. 
 
43. OHCHR developed the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1) in 2002 as a framework and reference point for our own 
work on this issue; we encourage States and intergovernmental organizations to implement the 
Principles and Guidelines in their own efforts to prevent trafficking and to protect the rights of 
trafficked persons. 
 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Freedom of expression and incitement to racial and religious hatred 
 </b></p>
<p>44. In accordance with Council resolution 7/19 on combating defamation of religions, the 
Office submitted, in September 2008, a report on the implementation of that resolution 
(A/HRC/9/7) as well as a study compiling relevant existing legislations and jurisprudence 
concerning defamation of and contempt for religions (A/HRC/9/25). In addition, the report of the 
Secretary-General of October 2008 (A/63/365) focuses on measures and activities undertaken by 
Member States, United Nations human rights mechanisms and treaty bodies, United Nations 
bodies, regional organizations, national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations with regard to the implementation of General Assembly resolution 62/154.   
 
45. In order to contribute further to the ongoing debate on the demarcation line between 
freedom of expression and hate speech, especially in relation to religious issues, OHCHR 
convened an expert meeting to address the issued of freedom of expression in the context of 
advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. A 
substantive report on the seminar, which was held in Geneva on 2 and 3 October 2008, is 
submitted as an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/10/31/Add.3).<b> 
 </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Economic, social and cultural rights in the light of the  
food, energy and financial crises</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>46. In 2008, the impact on all human rights of the food and energy crisis earlier in the year, 
followed then by the financial crisis, was felt globally, but most particularly by those individuals 
and groups in society who were already marginalized and discriminated against. Direct negative 
effects include the loss of employment, limited access to credit for productive activities, and the 
weakening of social security systems and others social safety-net mechanisms, further 
undermining the capacity of marginalized groups to cope with rising food prices. During the 
year, OHCHR engaged actively and systematically in international discussions in the response to 
the food crisis, including by supporting the special session of the Council, on 22 May 2008, my 
predecessor&#8217;s participation in the High-Level Conference on World Food Security of the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, held in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008, and 
through substantive contributions to the Secretary-General&#8217;s High-Level Task Force on the 
Global Food Security Crisis. Joint contributions were made to the Task Force with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food to develop a comprehensive framework for action as a common 
strategy for the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions in response to the crisis.  
 
47. OHCHR also developed guidance on human rights and the food crisis for field presences, 
and support was extended to national responses to the negative impact of the food crisis.  
 
48. On 10 December 2008, International Human Rights Day, the General Assembly closed a 
long-standing gap in the equal treatment and indivisibility of all civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights by adopting the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. I look forward to the speedy entry into force of this 
important instrument for individual redress.  
 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Climate change 
 
</b></p>
<p>49. In response to the Council&#8217;s call in its resolution 7/23 to study the relationship between 
human rights and climate change, OHCHR undertook an extensive consultative process, 
including initiating institutional links with the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) towards the 
preparation of an analytical report (A/HRC/10/61) looking at the human rights dimensions of 
climate change, to be presented to the Council at its tenth session.  I also participated in a high-
level planning meetings organized on this topic by the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>  
</p><p>50. Inside countries, existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the effects of climate change, 
the effects of which on human rights are determined by non-climatic factors, including 
discrimination and unequal power relationships. The application of a human rights approach in 
preventing and responding to the effects of climate change serves to empower individuals and 
groups, who should be perceived as active agents of change and not as passive victims.  
</p>
<p> 
<b>I.  Right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>51. OHCHR has continued to promote the right to development by providing substantive 
support for human rights mechanisms, including the high-level task force on the implementation </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>of the right to development and the open-ended working group on the right to development. 
Furthermore, it undertook activities aimed at integrating human rights, in particular the right to 
development, into global development partnerships. For instance, a workshop was organized in 
Geneva in September 2008 to discuss the financing for development agenda from the perspective 
of human rights, and a panel discussion on global economics and human rights was held at 
Headquarters in October; both events were aimed at contributing an input to the preparatory 
process for the Doha Review Conference on Financing for Development. The Office also 
promoted the integration of a human rights perspective into aid effectiveness through 
participation in a United Nations-wide preparatory process leading up to the Accra High-Level 
Forum on Aid Effectiveness. OHCHR also co-sponsored and participated in the panel discussion 
organized in October 2008 during the annual World Trade Organization Public Forum, which 
highlighted the values of human rights for promoting people-centered and development-oriented 
trade policies. In January 2009, OHCHR, in partnership with Harvard University, organized an 
expert consultation on methodological issues of qualitative and quantitative tools for measuring 
compliance with the right to development, intended to contribute to the development of criteria 
for evaluating progress towards Millennium Development Goal 8 from the perspective of the 
right to development.  
 
52. The Office continued to work on and publish communications and advocacy materials, 
describing how efforts directed towards the Millennium Development Goals, including Goal 8 
could be strengthened by human rights and how both international and national responsibilities 
are critical for poverty reduction. Such materials included &quot;Claiming the MDGs: a human rights 
approach&quot;, a joint OHCHR/United Nations Millennium Campaign brochure, and a joint 
publication with the World Health Organization entitled &quot;Health, human rights and poverty 
reduction strategies&quot;, embracing obligations of international and national actors to realize human 
rights in the context of health and national poverty reduction strategies.<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>J.  Human rights mainstreaming 
</b> 
53. The 2005 World Summit Outcome 1  gave further impetus to system-wide efforts to 
mainstream human rights in United Nations activities, which will continue to be a priority for the 
Office across thematic areas and country-level work. Particular focus has been put on 
strengthening support for the United Nations Resident Coordinator system, providing guidance, 
advice and training in response to national needs. A strong partnership was forged with United 
Nations development agencies under the Action 2 interagency initiative led by OHCHR, which 
successfully concluded at the end of 2008. Over the past four years, the programme has 
supported more than 60 United Nations country teams in developing their capacity and that of 
national partners in strengthening national protection systems.  
 
54. In line with the commitment made by Member States at the 2005 World Summit and in 
response to their increasing requests, the Office has also paid great attention to supporting efforts 
to mainstream human rights into national policies, particularly in the context of country-led 
poverty reduction strategies and national Millennium Development Goals.  In 2008, OHCHR 
organized a regional dialogue in Johannesburg, South Africa and one in Bangkok, bringing 
together national actors on development and human rights as well as international and regional

<p>partners to assess human rights integration into regional and national-level policies, with a view 
to identifying key gaps and possible legal and policy responses to align the Millennium 
Development Goals with human rights. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  STRENGTHENED COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT 
</b> 
55. OHCHR has continued to focus on strengthening human rights promotion and protection 
at the country level by means of the various tools at its disposal, including support for human 
rights mechanisms, dialogue with national counterparts, continued partnerships within the United 
Nations system and with regional organizations, and through field presences.  
 
56. As at January 2009, OHCHR is running and supporting 51 field presences: 10 regional 
presences,2 10 offices at the country level,3 16 human rights components in United Nations 
peace missions,4 and 15 human rights advisers in United Nations country teams.5 With regard to 
field presences, a most welcome development was the signature, in December 2008, of a 
memorandum of understanding between the Government of Qatar and OHCHR for the 
establishment of a human rights training and documentation centre for South-West Asia and the 
Arab Region, requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 60/153. I am also grateful for 
the renewal, in August 2008, by the Government of Guatemala, of the memorandum of 
understanding governing the OHCHR country office, and for the Government of Panama&#8217;s 
intention to extend the agreement on the Regional Office based in Panama City. OHCHR has 
conducted consultations for the establishment of a regional office for Europe, to be based in 
Brussels, and is undertaking preparations to this end. I look forward to successful discussions 
concerning the conclusion of renewed agreements for OHCHR country offices in Cambodia and 
Uganda and for the renewal of the OHCHR office in Nepal. Negotiations have been ongoing to 
identify a host country for the establishment of a regional office for South-West Asia as well as 
for the Middle East and North Africa. I am hopeful of concluding these processes in 2009.  
 
57. Since 2006, the activities of the OHCHR rapid response unit has been at the core of 
efforts to react promptly, systematically and effectively to deteriorating or potentially 
</p>
<p> 
2<b> </b>Regional presences included the OHCHR Regional Offices for Southern Africa (Pretoria), East Africa (Addis 
Ababa), West Africa (Dakar), Southeast Asia (Bangkok), the Pacific (Suva), the Middle East (Beirut), Central Asia 
(Bishkek), Latin America and the Caribbean (Panama City); the OHCHR Liaison Office for Latin America and the 
Caribbean (Santiago) and the Central Africa Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (Yaound&#233;). In 2009, the 
Regional Office for Latin America will be fully reinstated, while the Regional Office in Panama will cover Central 
America, in accordance with the agreement between the Government of Panama and OHCHR. 
3 OHCHR presences at the country level included offices in Bolivia, Cambodia, Colombia, Guatemala, Kosovo, 
Mexico, Nepal, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Togo and Uganda.  
4 OHCHR supported the human rights components of the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi, the United 
Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic, the United Nations Mission in the Central 
African Republic and Chad, the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, the United 
Nations Mission in Liberia, the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone, the United Nations 
Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau, the United Nations 
Office for West Africa, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, the United Nations Integrated 
Mission in Timor-Leste, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, the United Nations Observer Mission in 
Georgia and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.  
5 Human rights advisers were posted to Ecuador, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Nicaragua, the Niger, 
Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, Serbia, the southern Caucasus, Sri 
Lanka and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  </p>

</p>
<p>deteriorating human rights situations, and to coordinate conceptual and operational support for 
the implementation of resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council or other United 
Nations organs requesting fact-finding missions or investigations. Thus, in 2008, through its 
rapid response capacity, OHCHR was able to provide support in a number of situations, 
including in the context of the elections in Georgia to support the United Nations country team, 
in January; in support of the mission of the Special Rapporteur to Myanmar, in March; through 
the deployment of a fact-finding mission to Kenya, following the post-electoral violence of 
December 2007, in February; in Armenia, in support to the United Nations country team, in the 
context of post-electoral violence, in March; to Beit Hanoun, in support of the High-Level Fact-
Finding Mission mandated by the Council in its resolution S-3/1 in November 2006, deployed in 
June 2008; in Bolivia, in support of the OHCHR country office in the context of local elections 
and referendums, in May and June; and in Georgia again and the Russian Federation, to 
strengthen human rights advice to the country team in the aftermath of the crisis in the region, in 
August and September.  
</p><p> 
58. Through its National Institutions Unit, OHCHR continued to provide advice to Member 
States on the establishment and responsibilities of national human rights institutions, assisting in 
ensuring their compliance with the Paris Principles and in strengthening their capacity to address 
protection issues. 6  In 2008, OHCHR thus assisted in the establishment or strengthening of 
institutions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde, the Central African 
Republic, Chile, Denmark, Djibouti, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Iraq, 
Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Liberia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, 
Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, the Sudan (South Sudan), Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, 
Togo, Uganda and Uruguay. It continued to provide secretarial support for the meetings of the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Throughout its work, OHCHR 
has focused on the importance of partnerships among national human rights institutions, non-
governmental organizations and the United Nations system, at the country, regional and 
international levels. In 2008, OHCHR started a fellowship programme, whereby the staff 
member of an A-status national human rights institution works at the Unit for six months in 
order to gain knowledge of and experience with the United Nations human rights system.  
 
59. Progress towards further integration of human rights in peace missions continued in 
2008, including through the release of more public human rights reports by peace missions and 
through the participation of OHCHR in a number of technical assessment missions, led by the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations or the Department of Political Affairs, and other 
significant mission-planning activities. 
 
60. Increasing engagement in the area of humanitarian work and reform remained an 
important part of the Office&#8217;s focus in 2008. Through the Geneva and New York-based inter-
agency settings and increasingly through field presences, efforts continued to ensure more 
systematic consideration of human rights in relevant humanitarian discussions and actions. At 
the country level, an increasing number of human rights field presences have taken a leading role 
</p>
<p> 
6 See A/HRC/10/54 and AHRC/10/55.  </p>

 <p> 
in protection clusters, in Nepal, northern Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chad, Timor-Leste and 
Georgia.   
 
61. In addition to the work conducted by country and regional presences, at the headquarters 
level, partnerships with regional organizations have been enhanced in all regions and made a 
fresh start when OHCHR organized a seminar on regional arrangements for the promotion and 
protection of human rights in November 2008.  
 
62. The special procedures benefit from OHCHR field presences as their follow-up activities 
and close collaboration with Governments help translate recommendations formulated by 
mandate-holders during their country visits into reality. Follow-up initiatives to the 
recommendations of special procedures have increased in recent years as the number of field 
presences has also increased.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION  
OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p> 
63. The year-long advocacy campaign to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights yielded a wide range of public information products, activities and 
events throughout the world. OHCHR organized a campaign around the slogan &#8220;Dignity and 
justice for all of us&#8221; and a special logo, and produced a number of public information products 
and websites. All partners, including States, civil society and United Nations entities took part in 
the campaign. OHCHR field offices organized celebratory activities throughout the year.
 
64. OHCHR commissioned, together with the non-governmental organization Art for the 
World, a series of 22 short films created by some of the world&#8217;s leading directors entitled <i>Stories 
on Human Rights</i>. This was accompanied by the publication of a book featuring 12 
internationally known writers, including five Nobel Prize winners. The Office also called on all 
human rights partners worldwide to pay special attention to the civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights of persons deprived of their liberty in prisons and other places of 
detention, in the Dignity and Justice for Detainees week in October 2008.   
 
65. Two commemorative sessions were held by the United Nations: one by the General 
Assembly on 10 December, another by the Human Rights Council on 12 December with the 
participation of the Secretary-General.  
 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  THE DURBAN REVIEW CONFERENCE: TOWARDS AN INCLUSIVE 
AND SUCCESSFUL REVIEW CONFERENCE 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>66. The main objective of the Durban Review Conference is to assess the implementation of 
the commitments undertaken by the international community at the World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001. I am pleased to 
note the progress made during the second substantive Preparatory Committee meeting in October 
2008, and the commitment demonstrated to reach consensus. 
 
67. Ensuring the holding of a successful Durban Review Conference is a priority for the 
Office. In accordance with decision PC.2/9 of the Preparatory Committee, my Office, in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>collaboration with the Department of Public Information, has launched a dedicated Durban 
Review Conference website to highlight the objectives of the Review Conference and to keep all 
stakeholders of the Durban process updated. In a similar vain, OHCHR is producing regular 
Durban Review Conference updates containing an overview of progress in the preparations for 
the Conference. An E-bulletin with information of specific interest to civil society is also being 
produced regularly. Furthermore, in accordance with decision PC.3/103 of the Preparatory 
Committee, I am preparing a report for the Review Conference on the activities undertaken and 
further steps to be taken by my Office in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action and relevant decisions of the General Assembly and the Council (and 
formerly the Commission on Human Rights) adopted as a follow-up to the Durban World 
Conference of 2001.<b> </b>  
68. I have highlighted my concerns with regard to the need to ensure broad participation in 
the activities related to the Review Conference. With this objective in mind, I have been meeting 
with various delegations and regional groups conveying the need to accommodate diversity of 
opinion and promoting participation. The Office has also engaged in an inter-agency cooperation 
exercise to encourage participation of the United Nations agencies in the Durban Review 
Conference preparatory process. On 21 October 2008, the Office held a first meeting with United 
Nations agencies and programmes (the United Nations Population Fund, ILO, the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees) in Geneva, at which a framework of cooperation was agreed upon. 
Agencies based outside Geneva (the Pan American Health Organization, the United States 
Agency for International Development, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women, the Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean and the United Nations Environment Programme), have since been integrated 
in the process. The agencies in question agreed to hold regular meetings, share updates on 
developments and participate in activities connected to the Review Conference. They expressed 
their intention to organize jointly side events before and/or during the Review Conference. 
 
69. Within the limited resources available, the Office facilitated the participation of 
representatives of least developed countries, treaty bodies and special procedures in the regional 
preparatory meetings for Africa (in Abuja) and Latin America (in Brasilia). Limited financial 
contributions were also provided to representatives of national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations to participate in regional preparatory meetings. Similarly, and with a 
view to support the constructive engagement of civil society in the Durban review process, the 
Office will provide travel support to some non-governmental organizations, national human 
rights institutions and delegates from least developed countries to facilitate their participation in 
the Review Conference, in April 2009. 
 
70. Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are global problems 
which must be of concern to all. We owe a frank debate and concrete action to the victims of 
these scourges. The Durban Review Conference offers a timely opportunity to reaffirm the 
principles of non-discrimination and to build on the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action in order to ensure that implementation gaps are closed. It is imperative that all States 
participate and contribute to this crucial process in order to consolidate and improve the common 
ground on fundamental human rights issues.    
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS 
</b> 
71. OHCHR has continued to support human rights treaty bodies in their quest for 
improvement and harmonization of their working methods so that the human rights treaty body 
system can provide the best possible framework for the promotion and protection of human 
rights for individuals and groups at the national level. In 2008, OHCHR supported all human 
rights treaty bodies, and began preparations for the first session of the Committee on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, which will meet from 23 to 27 February 2009. OHCHR continued 
to advocate for universal ratification of all human rights treaties and substantive and procedural 
optional protocols thereto, focusing particularly on those treaties, such as the International 
Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, where ratification has been slow. OHCHR also strongly encouraged 
ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, which has yet to enter into force. With the adoption of the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in December 2008, the 
Office will campaign energetically for its ratification to facilitate its early entry into force. 
 
72. Treaty bodies have continued to develop procedures to enhance their accessibility to 
States parties, national human rights institutions, civil society and individuals. They have also 
focused on simplifying and streamlining their reporting requirements, with a number adopting 
their treaty-specific reporting guidelines, which complement the guidelines for the common-core 
document. The eighth inter-committee meeting set the deadline for the adoption of the remaining 
treaty-specific guidelines for late 2009.  
 
73. Treaty bodies have sought to make their concluding observations more concrete and 
implementable at the national level, with most introducing follow-up procedures relating to 
reporting that aim to strengthen the dialogue and cooperation with the State party. The eighth 
inter-committee meeting recommended that a working group or task force on follow-up to 
concluding observations be established intersessionally, consisting of the rapporteur for follow-
up on concluding observations of each treaty body, if applicable, or the members responsible for 
follow-up activities.  
 
74. Furthermore, the four treaty bodies handling individual complaints procedures have 
emphasized the importance of follow-up to views to ensure both individual relief for petitioners 
and implementation of treaty provisions generally. Following the adoption of the first follow-up 
report on views by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, all four treaty bodies now have largely similar follow-up procedures on decisions in 
individual cases. Numerous submissions continued to be submitted in 2008 by States parties 
providing relevant follow-up information on efforts made to give effect to the treaty bodies&#8217; 
decisions.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSION 
</b> 
75. Adequate and effective answers to<b> </b>the human rights challenges outlined in the present 
report require a strong commitment by all stakeholders. The commitment made by all Member 
States at the 2005 World Summit to make human rights a third and equal United Nations pillar </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>alongside peace and security and development, and to provide the United Nations human rights 
machinery with additional resources and support should be renewed. The need for increased 
support for the promotion and protection of human rights has been heightened by the current 
food, energy and financial crises as well as the challenges of continuing conflicts and climate 
change. Human rights principles, such as accountability, non-discrimination, participation and 
empowerment, as well as the respect for international human rights standards and the rule of law, 
are an efficient way to address these challenges and to deliver on the promises made 60 years 
ago by the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
