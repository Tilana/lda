</p>
<p>*<b>  </b>This document is submitted late so as to include the most up-to-date information possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, by decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006, requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  The last report on human rights and forensic science 
(E/CN.4/2002/67) was submitted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to the Commission at its fifty-eighth session in 2002.  In resolution 2005/26, the 
Commission requested the Office to submit an updated report on human rights and forensic 
science to it at its sixty-third session (para. 10).  OHCHR understands decision 2/102 to preserve 
the reporting cycle on this issue until otherwise decided by the Council.  The present report 
therefore covers the period from January 2002 to December 2006. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 2005/26, the Commission on Human Rights welcomed the increased use 
of forensic investigations in situations where grave violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law have occurred.  It requested OHCHR to keep its database of forensic experts 
updated in consultation with Governments, relevant United Nation bodies, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and professional organizations of forensic and related experts (para. 3). 
</p>
<p>3. The Commission recommended that the Office encourage forensic experts to coordinate 
further and promote the consolidation of relevant guidelines, with a view to harmonizing the 
procedures in forensic investigation and repatriation (para. 4).  Furthermore, the Commission 
recommended that OHCHR encourage the dissemination and use of principles, best 
practices, manuals and international human rights standards and the promotion of forensic 
capacity-building, including training where necessary, particularly in countries without sufficient 
expertise in forensic science and related fields (para. 5). 
</p>
<p>4. The Commission also requested the Secretary-General to provide appropriate resources, 
from within existing overall United Nations resources, to fund the activities of the Office to 
implement the resolution, including the revision of the <i>Manual on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions</i> (para. 9)<i>. 
</i>5. In July 2005, a note verbale was sent to all Governments requesting relevant information 
relating, inter alia, to resolution 2005/26.  As of 1 January 2007 OHCHR had received replies 
from the Governments of Lebanon, Mexico and Togo. </p>
<p><b>II.  DATABASE AND ROSTER OF FORENSIC EXPERTS 
</b></p>
<p>6. The OHCHR database currently contains the names of 402 forensic specialists.  
Experience from past forensic assessment and fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry 
supported by OHCHR have provided useful lessons with regard to the identification and profile 
of the experts required to respond better to the needs of such missions, which will be taken into 
account in maintaining the database and coordinating it with the other related initiatives 
described below. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR relies on forensic experts from Member States and NGOs contracted on the 
basis of the cooperation service agreement (E/CN.4/1998/32, annex II) to carry out fact-finding 
and forensic assessment missions or training and capacity-building activities.  In this context, 
OHCHR is exploring the option of developing a standby roster of forensic experts that would 
allow the Office to dispatch such experts at short notice. 
</p>
<p>8. Efforts to build up a roster of experts, including on forensics, are being made in the 
context of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The Optional Protocol provides the mandate for the 
Subcommittee on Prevention to carry out regular in-country inspections of places of detention in 
collaboration with a visiting body at national level.  Under article 13 (3) of the Optional 
Protocol, the members of the Subcommittee may be accompanied, if needed, by experts of 
demonstrated professional experience and knowledge in the fields covered by the Optional 
Protocol.  These experts shall be selected from a roster prepared on the basis of proposals made 
by the States parties, OHCHR and the United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention, 
now part of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  In preparing the roster, 
the States parties concerned may propose up to five national experts. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONSOLIDATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STANDARDS 
</b></p>
<p>9. OHCHR continued to disseminate the Principles on the Effective Prevention and 
Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1989/65) and the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (General Assembly 
resolution 55/89, annex).  A revised version of the <i>Istanbul Protocol:  Manual on the Effective 
Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment</i> (HR/P/PT/8/Rev.1) was published by the Office in July 2004 and is available in 
all United Nations official languages.  In addition to commercial sales, 5,532 copies of the 
revised <i>Manual</i> were provided to prosecutors, criminal investigators, forensic specialists, 
professional organizations, NGOs and United Nations agencies between July 2004 and 
December 2006. 
</p>
<p>10. Owing to resource constraints, OHCHR has not been in a position to engage in a broad 
consultative process with specialized organizations and expert bodies on proposals for a revision 
of the <i>Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions</i>, published in 1991 by the Centre for International Crime Prevention in 
Vienna.<b>1</b>  Such a process is needed to ensure that the <i>Manual</i> will contribute to the further 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  United Nations publication, Sales No. E.91.IV.1.  All substantive parts of the <i>Manual</i>, 
</p>
<p>including the Model Autopsy Protocol and the Model Protocol for Disinterment and Analysis of 
Skeletal Remains, were reprinted by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs in <i>Guidelines for 
the Conduct of United Nations Inquiries into Allegations of Massacres</i>, United Nations 
publication, Sales No. E.97.I.21, 1997. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>consolidation of existing guidelines and the harmonization of the procedures followed in forensic 
investigation, as recommended by the Commission.  The <i>Manual</i> contains in addition to its 
forensic protocols a model protocol for the legal investigation of extralegal, arbitrary and 
summary executions (Minnesota Protocol). 
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR participated actively in the consultative process culminating in the international 
conference entitled &#8220;The Missing - Action to resolve the problem of people unaccounted for as a 
result of armed conflict or internal violence and to assist their families&#8221;, organized by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from 19 to 21 February 2003.  The conference 
brought together governmental and non-governmental experts and highlighted the need to 
develop a standardized autopsy form based on the Minnesota Protocol and the Interpol Disaster 
Victim Information autopsy form.  It proposed combining the respective advantages of these 
protocols.  The conference also led to the publication of <i>Operational Best Practices Regarding 
the Management of Human Remains and Information on the Dead by Non-Specialists</i>.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND FORENSIC SCIENCE 
</b></p>
<p>12. Special procedures established by the Commission on Human Rights have continued to 
rely on forensic specialists in the course of their work, particularly under the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
The Special Rapporteur has stated that it is fundamental that he be assisted on fact-finding visits 
by independent medical doctors with specialized knowledge and experience in documenting 
torture, in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol (see E/CN.4/2006/6, para. 23).  The findings 
contained in the forensic reports of these experts assist the Special Rapporteur to draw his 
conclusions on the practice of torture, and he has used such experts on missions, for example to 
Mongolia, Nepal, Jordan and Paraguay. 
</p>
<p>13. As part of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions sends communications to Governments in cases where there are reasons to believe 
that extrajudicial executions have taken place.  He reminds Governments, inter alia, of their 
obligations, reflected in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.  Several 
of his reports highlighted gaps in the investigative and forensic capacity at national level with 
regard to cases of deaths in police custody or alleged extralegal executions.  The Special 
Rapporteur also observed that forensic experts and institutions often lack the necessary 
independence to carry out investigations into such deaths.<b>3</b>

Brazil (E/CN.4/2004/7/Add.3) and Jamaica (E/CN.4/2004/7/Add.2). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  TRAINING AND CAPACITY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>14. OHCHR has provided training to the national staff of truth and reconciliation 
commissions established in Peru and Sierra Leone.  In response to a request of the Government 
of Peru and of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), 10 national experts were 
recruited and trained in forensic investigative techniques in the period April-July 2002 to enable 
them to work with the TRC investigative teams in various provinces.  With the support of the 
International Centre for Transitional Justice, a two-week consultation on anthropology and 
forensic medicine was held in June and July 2002.  OHCHR continued to support these experts 
when the mandate of TRC was extended through 2003. 
</p>
<p>15. In Sierra Leone, OHCHR provided a forensic team to TRC to conduct an assessment of 
mass graves and execution sites and provide training on basic principles of anthropology and 
forensic techniques to participants from government agencies and NGOs in June and July 2002.  
The team visited 52 sites and made recommendations on how to preserve them for future 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR provided support to the United Nation Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) and Afghan authorities in addressing transitional justice issues.  In January and 
February 2002, OHCHR fielded a short mission to look into allegations of mass graves in the 
Mazar region.  Responding to a request by UNAMA, OHCHR organized forensic investigation 
and needs-assessment missions in the period April to May 2002 to Bamyan, Mazar and 
Sheberghan.  This mission included a preliminary assessment of Afghan national forensic 
capacity in Kabul.  OHCHR conducted a preliminary forensic investigation in December 2002, 
to review plans for a large-scale investigation into two sites in the Mazar area in response to a 
request from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and UNAMA.  Security 
concerns prevented further investigation of the two gravesites in the north and a broader strategy 
was adopted in 2006.  In June 2006, an assessment mission was fielded to examine the 
possibility of conducting forensic investigations of mass graves in Afghanistan within the 
framework of the Action Plan of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 
Peace, Reconciliation and Justice. 
</p>
<p>17. In Mexico, OHCHR organized, in coordination with the Federal Attorney-General&#8217;s 
Office, workshops on effective investigation and documentation of torture and the Istanbul 
Protocol.  These workshops provided medical and psychological professionals and public 
institutions responsible for investigating, documenting and prosecuting cases of torture with 
information about the application of the Istanbul Protocol as a model for investigating torture at 
the national and local levels.  Participants included doctors and psychologists from local 
prosecutors&#8217; offices, civil society organizations dealing with cases of torture and mistreatment, 
and forensic personnel from state human rights commissions.  The first workshop took place in 
Monterrey, Nuevo Le&#243;n, in September 2005, in coordination with Physicians for Human Rights 
and the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT).  Similar workshops 
were held in Morelia, Michoac&#225;n, Oaxaca and Chihuahua.  In addition, three seminars were 
organized in Mexico City, Le&#243;n, Guanajuato and Quer&#233;taro in 2005 and 2006 to generate 
discussion on the creation of a national torture prevention mechanism, which is provided for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  Between 40 and 100 participants 
attended each seminar, including public officials, human rights institutions and civil society 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>18. In 2005, OHCHR provided assistance to the Colombian School of Criminal Investigation 
and Forensic Sciences to develop an institutional training programme in human rights and 
international humanitarian law.  Advice was provided to the national forensic institute and the 
national commission responsible for locating persons who disappeared during the internal 
conflict.  A one-day conference on forensic medicine and human rights was held in Casablanca, 
Morocco, in October 2002.  One hundred doctors, magistrates, advocates and officials of the 
judiciary and police attended. 
19. Besides its own work programme, OHCHR follows closely training and 
capacity-building activities carried out by NGOs promoting United Nations standards.  
IRCT, for example, embarked in 2003 on an Istanbul Protocol implementation project.  The 
project aimed at raising awareness and contributing to the implementation of the Istanbul 
Protocol in five pilot countries - Georgia, Mexico, Morocco, Sri Lanka and Uganda.  In this 
context IRCT produced targeted training material for specific professional groups (lawyers, 
doctors and psychologists).<b>4</b>  The current phase of the project aims to train over 250 health 
professionals. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. USE OF FORENSIC EXPERTS IN FACT-FINDING MISSIONS 
AND COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the reporting period the use of forensic experts in fact-finding missions and 
commissions of inquiry supported by OHCHR became a frequent practice.  Forensic experts 
accompanied three different fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire:  
a fact-finding mission to gather precise information regarding violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in 2002; the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the events 
connected with the march planned for Abidjan on 25 March 2004; and the International 
Commission of Inquiry into allegations of serious violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law committed in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since 19 September 2002, established in 2004. 
</p>
<p>21. A forensic expert accompanied the fact-finding mission established by the High 
Commissioner, which took place from 5 February<b> </b>to 5 May 2005, to look into allegations 
of violence and human rights violations before, during and after the presidential elections of 
24 April 2005 in Togo.<b>5</b>  From 22 to 28 May 2006, following a request by the United Nations

</p>
<p>the Secretary-General on impunity (E/CN.4/2006/89). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Department of Peacekeeping Operations, OHCHR sent a forensic assessment mission to Liberia 
for the identification of a mass grave in the operational area of the United Nations Mission in 
Liberia. 
</p>
<p>22. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (2004-2005), established by 
Security Council resolution 1564 (2004), enabled OHCHR to develop a comprehensive approach 
to future commissions of inquiry for serious violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law.  At the request of the Secretary-General, OHCHR set up a secretariat for the 
Commission with more than 30 staff, including legal and human rights researchers, investigators, 
military analysts, experts in gender violence and forensic experts. 
</p>
<p>23. Forensic specialists contributed significantly to the high quality of the reports produced 
by these fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  REPLIES RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Government of Lebanon, in response to the note verbale, informed OHCHR that it 
had taken note of Commission resolution 2005/26 and that its Ministry of Public Health would 
take action as it deemed appropriate. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of Mexico informed OHCHR that model training courses on the 
effective documentation of torture and ill-treatment had increased the methodological and 
practical forensic expertise inside the investigation and prosecution services.  The Federal 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Office (Procurador&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica) published a directive 
(A/057/2003) on 18 August 2003, establishing guidelines for legal and forensic investigation 
into alleged cases of torture or ill-treatment as a measure in implementation of the Istanbul 
Protocol.  In addition, a committee and a consultative group were established, composed of 
members of the prosecution services and forensic experts.  The committee and the consultative 
group, which also included members of NGOs, were tasked with verifying that the medical and 
psychological analysis of alleged torture and ill-treatment conforms to the guidelines established 
by the Federal Attorney-General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government of Togo informed OHCHR that since 1994 a module on the protection 
of human rights and the dignity of the person has been included in the second and sixth years of 
medical studies and at the school for health workers.  In August 2004, a forensic service (Service 
de m&#233;decine l&#233;gale) was established to take care of victims of physical violence and provide 
advice to health professionals and social workers.  Hospitals also employed forensic doctors 
(<i>m&#233;decins l&#233;gistes</i>) to evaluate the psychological harm suffered by victims of traffic accidents. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>The developments since the last report point to an increasing and more systematic 
use of forensic expertise in the context of human rights fact-finding and investigative 
activities by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council and international commissions of inquiry.  The 
Subcommittee on Prevention mandated under the Optional Protocol to the Convention </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is also 
expected to make use of such expertise for its activities.  The High Commissioner welcomes 
efforts made by several Member States to strengthen their forensic capacities to support 
investigations into human rights violations.  At the same time, many serious human rights 
violations remain insufficiently investigated, and poor investigation is often linked to 
limited forensic capacity, as has been noted by some special rapporteurs.</b> 
</p>
<p>28. <b>To support both national and international efforts, there continues to be a need to 
actively encourage the application of internationally agreed forensic standards and of 
consistent approaches in the field; to review and consolidate relevant expertise and develop 
mechanisms for making it readily available when needed; and to support capacity-building 
activities at the national level in cooperation with specialized institutions.  While OHCHR 
has taken a number of initiatives in this regard, its own capacity must be strengthened 
to adequately respond to these challenges in cooperation with Member States, other 
United Nations bodies and organizations, and other relevant institutions.</b>
