<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Panama on 
the basis of information gathered by the Special Rapporteur during his visit to the country 
from 19 to 26 July 2013 and independent research. 
</p>
<p> Panama has an advanced legal framework for the promotion of the rights of 
indigenous peoples. In particular, the system of indigenous regions (<i>comarcas</i>) provides 
considerable protection for indigenous rights, especially in terms of land and territory, 
participation and self-governance, and health and education. National laws and 
programmes on indigenous affairs provide a vital foundation on which to continue building 
upon and strengthening the rights of indigenous peoples in Panama. 
</p>
<p> However, the Special Rapporteur notes that this foundation is fragile and unstable in 
many regards. As discussed in this report, there are a number of problems with regard to 
the enforcement and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in Panama, particularly 
with regard to their right to their lands and natural resources, the implementation of large-
scale investment projects, self-governance, participation and their economic and social 
rights, including the rights to economic development, education and health. In the light of 
the findings set out in this report, the Special Rapporteur makes specific recommendations 
to the Government of Panama.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Panama 
and makes recommendations in that regard on the basis of information gathered by the 
Special Rapporteur during his visit to the country from 19 to 26 July 2013 and independent 
research. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur held a series of meetings in Panama City 
with various representatives of the Government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Education, the 
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Development, the National Land Management 
Agency, the National Environment Agency, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, the 
Electoral Court, the Office of the Attorney General and the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of indigenous peoples and civil society in 
Panama City and held meetings with representatives of the Bribri, Kuna, Ember&#225;, Naso, 
Ngobe and Wounaan peoples in the Ngobe-Bugle and Kuna Yala indigenous regions 
(<i>comarcas</i>) and in the collective territory of the Ember&#225; people. 
3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Panama for its 
cooperation and its readiness to allow him to conduct his visit and hold discussions with 
indigenous representatives freely and openly. He also wishes to thank the Panama offices of 
the United Nations system for their cooperation, the Regional Office for Central America of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for its invaluable 
help in making the preparations for the visit and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva for its assistance in drafting this report. Lastly, 
he wishes to express his gratitude to the indigenous peoples of Panama, in particular their 
authorities and members of their general congresses, for inviting him to their territories, for 
showing him such hospitality and for sharing their stories, concerns and hopes with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The indigenous peoples of Panama 
</b></p>
<p>4. Over the course of his mission, and especially during his visit to indigenous 
territories, the Special Rapporteur was able to observe the cultural diversity of the 
indigenous peoples of Panama, which can be seen in the customs, languages and other 
cultural expressions which they have preserved. It is clear that the indigenous peoples of 
Panama are proud of their indigenous identity and wish to continue preserving and 
strengthening all aspects of their cultures. 
</p>
<p>5. The preservation of these cultures is largely attributable to the system of indigenous 
<i>comarcas</i>, in which indigenous peoples have exclusive rights over their lands and enjoy 
considerable autonomy over internal matters. All indigenous peoples of Panama, except the 
Naso and Bribri, have <i>comarcas</i> that have been established under the corresponding legal 
regime. Taken together, the indigenous <i>comarcas</i> account for 22.2 per cent of the country&#8217;s 
area, or 16,634 km2. As discussed below (section IV, subsection B), these indigenous 
peoples have a high degree of autonomy and a certain degree of control over the use of 
renewable and non-renewable resources within these areas, although concerns remain in 
this regard (see section IV, subsection A). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.14-07234 
</p>
<p>6. According to the 2010 census, indigenous peoples make up 12.3 per cent of the 
population, although some of them claim that their population is larger than what the census 
results indicate. The 2010 census, gives the following population estimates for the various 
indigenous peoples of Panama: Ngobe, 260,058; Kuna, 80,526; Ember&#225;, 31,284; Bugle, 
24,912; Wounaan, 7,279; Teribe/Naso, 4,046; Bokota, 1,959; and Bribri, 1,068.1 The 2010 
census results indicate that 196,059 indigenous persons live in <i>comarcas</i>, while 221,500 
live in other areas. 
</p>
<p>7. The Ngobe have the largest population and speak Ng&#228;bere. Their <i>comarca</i>, which is 
shared with the Bugle people, was established in 1997 and spans 6,968 km2 in the 
provinces of Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veraguas; approximately half of the Ngobe 
population lives in the <i>comarca</i>. In recent years, the Ngobe have been organizing 
opposition to hydroelectric projects that have an impact on their traditional lands, both 
inside and outside the <i>comarca</i>. Although the Bugle have historically been considered part 
of the Ngobe people, they have their own language, culture and forms of internal 
organization. The Bokota people are related to the Bugle and are considered by some 
sources to belong to the same ethnic group.2 
</p>
<p>8. The Kuna people live in three <i>comarcas</i> (Madungandi, Wargandi and Kuna Yala) in 
the Dagargunyala collective territory, Dari&#233;n National Park and areas outside their 
traditional lands. Kuna Yala, the first <i>comarca</i> in the country, was established in 1938 
following a long struggle for the recognition of the political structures, autonomy and lands 
of the Kuna people. The Kuna currently wield considerable political influence compared to 
other indigenous groups. Nevertheless, they expressed particular concern about a lack of 
consultation by the Government, the failure to abide by decisions taken by their authorities, 
the lack of State recognition of their rights over areas that they consider to be part of their 
traditional territory and the incursion of settlers into their lands. The language of the Kuna 
people is also called Kuna.  
</p>
<p>9. The Ember&#225; and Wounaan live in an area in eastern Panama that extends up to its 
border with the Colombian department of Choco. Most of the members of these groups 
currently live in the province of Dari&#233;n. The Ember&#225;-Wounaan <i>comarca</i> covers 438,350 
hectares (or 27 per cent of Dari&#233;n Province) and has a population of 9,397 members of the 
Ember&#225; and Wounaan peoples, spread out among 40 communities. Outside of the <i>comarca</i>, 
two Wounaan communities have been officially recognized by the Government, and their 
lands have been given collective land status; other Ember&#225; and Wounaan communities 
await official recognition. These communities&#8217; main concerns regarding their rights relate 
to encroachments on their <i>comarca</i> and collective lands, which have triggered violent 
clashes. These communities are also affected by the internal armed conflict in Colombia 
and by the presence on their lands of illegal armed groups belonging to the Fuerzas 
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) 
(FARC) and Colombian refugees. The Ember&#225; speak their own languages, both of which 
are in the Choco linguistic family.  
</p>
<p>10. The Naso live in western Panama, on the shores of the Teribe River in the province 
of Bocas del Toro, and in Costa Rica. They have adopted a monarchic system of self-
government under the leadership of the Naso king. Their language is also referred to as 
Naso. For decades the Naso have been requesting the establishment of a <i>comarca</i> and have

<p>also reported problems relating to hydroelectric projects and agribusinesses operating on 
the lands to which they lay claim, as discussed below (section IV, subsection A). 
</p><p>11. The Bribri are the smallest indigenous group in Panama and were included in the 
national census for the first time in 2000. They live along the Yorkin and Sixaola rivers in 
Costa Rica and Panama, in the districts of Guabito and Bocas del Toro. The Bribri on both 
sides of the border maintain ties with each other and speak the Bribri language. The Bribri 
people are still awaiting official recognition and protection of their territorial rights, and 
this constitutes their chief human rights concern. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Panamanian laws governing indigenous affairs are undoubtedly among the most 
advanced in the world in terms of the protection and promotion of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples. The Constitution contains key provisions for safeguarding the rights of 
the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples in respect of their identity,3 language,4 education,5 
autonomy and lands.6 In overall terms, it stipulates that the State shall recognize and respect 
the ethnic identity of indigenous communities and carry out programmes to promote their 
cultures and material, social and spiritual values.7  
</p>
<p>13. Regarding the right of indigenous peoples to their lands and other related rights, the 
Constitution guarantees that the lands required by indigenous communities to ensure their 
economic and social well-being will be set aside and that their collective ownership of 
those lands will be maintained.8 Between 1938 and 2000, in what has been acknowledged 
as being one of the foremost achievements in terms of the protection of indigenous rights in 
the world, the Government established the five aforementioned <i>comarcas</i>, or indigenous 
territories: Kuna Yala,9 Ember&#225;-Wounaan,10 Madungandi,11 Ngobe-Bugle12 and Wargandi.13 
The laws providing for the establishment of the <i>comarcas</i> set forth the right of indigenous 
peoples to collective ownership of land within the <i>comarcas</i> and contain other provisions 
regarding natural resources, governance, the administration of justice, economic activity, 
culture, education and health. The Ember&#225;-Wounaan, Madungandi and Ngobe-Bugle 
<i>comarcas</i> each have their own charters. These charters were adopted by executive decree 
and govern internal affairs as well as relations between the Government and the traditional 
authorities. The Kuna Yala <i>comarca</i> has drawn up regulations which, although they have

<p>not yet been adopted, have nevertheless served as a basis for agreements between the 
Government and the Kuna General Congress.  
</p>
<p>14. Indigenous peoples enjoy a certain degree of decision-making power with respect to 
the preservation and development of the natural resources in their <i>comarcas</i>. In the case of 
renewable resources, some of the laws governing indigenous <i>comarcas</i> contain provisions 
authorizing the development of natural resources within their borders but only under certain 
conditions, which include the mandatory preparation of impact studies and the obligation to 
obtain the authorization of the indigenous authorities. Forestry laws stipulate that 
government agencies are to work in conjunction with the relevant indigenous congress 
when granting licences for forestry development in <i>comarcas</i> and indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>15. Under <i>comarca</i> laws, indigenous authorities have less control over the development 
of non-renewable resources, except in Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> where, thanks to recent 
reforms, revenue from the development of such resources must be shared with the <i>comarca</i>. 
In March 2012, the Government adopted a special regime for this <i>comarca</i> to protect its 
mineral, water and environmental resources.14 The law absolutely prohibits the issuance of 
licences in the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> for mineral exploration or mining, with a few 
exceptions, and revokes all licences previously issued for such purposes.15 It sets forth a 
separate regime for hydroelectric projects and specifies that the authorization of the plenary 
of the corresponding general, regional or local congress will have to be obtained for future 
projects, which will then be submitted for referendum in the corresponding district within 
the <i>comarca</i> or the regional or local district concerned.16 The law also states that at least 5 
per cent of the revenue from these projects is to be funnelled back into the Ngobe-Bugle 
community. 
</p>
<p>16. The <i>comarca</i> system was strengthened in 2008 with the promulgation of Act No. 72 
on the establishment of a special procedure for granting collective title to indigenous lands 
outside the <i>comarcas</i>.17 Under this special procedure, the authorities of the indigenous 
group or community in question are to submit an application to the National Directorate for 
Agrarian Reform.18 Negotiation procedures are in place for the resolution of disputes when 
such applications are contested.19 The land title awarded to communities through this 
procedure is collective, indefinite, non-transferable, irrevocable and inalienable.20 The 
Government and third parties are obliged to coordinate with traditional authorities in order 
to obtain their free, prior and informed consent for the roll-out of projects on their 
collective lands.21 
</p>
<p>17. Panama also has a strong legal framework for the protection of the intellectual 
property and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples. A law was passed in 2000 which 
provides for the establishment of a special collective intellectual property rights regime for 
the protection and defence of the cultural identity and traditional knowledge of indigenous 
peoples.22 Furthermore, the Criminal Code of 2007 contains provisions under which the 
reproduction, copying or modification of works or traditional knowledge protected as part 
of the collective rights of indigenous peoples are punishable offences.

<p>18. The provisions of the Constitution on indigenous languages and education stipulate 
that the State shall promote bilingual literacy programmes in indigenous communities.23 
Article 10 of the Education Act states that education in indigenous communities is to be 
based on their right to preserve, develop and honour their cultural identity and heritage, 
while article 11 states that instruction is to be provided in a manner that is in keeping with 
the characteristics, objectives and methods of bilingual, intercultural education.24 The Act 
mandates the Ministry of Education to set up a unit for the implementation of special 
programmes in indigenous areas.25 A number of <i>comarca</i> laws require that the education 
programmes rolled out by the Ministry, especially bilingual and intercultural programmes, 
be coordinated with <i>comarca</i> authorities. In 2010, the Government adopted a law that 
grants official recognition to indigenous languages and alphabets and makes bilingual, 
intercultural instruction mandatory in all public and private schools in indigenous 
communities located in <i>comarcas</i> and on collective lands.26 
</p>
<p>19. There are also considerable safeguards in place regarding the health of indigenous 
peoples. The <i>comarca</i> laws guarantee the right to health, including access to health-care 
services that incorporate traditional healing methods. Pursuant to Ministry of Health 
resolution No. 322 of 2005, health-care facilities located in <i>comarcas</i> are required to 
provide services to the indigenous population free of charge. 
</p>
<p>20. Other laws also contain specific provisions on indigenous peoples. In addition to 
constitutional and <i>comarca</i> law provisions on the administration of indigenous justice, the 
Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes indigenous judges to adjudicate on cases involving 
offences committed in the <i>comarcas</i> in accordance with indigenous law (with the exception 
of cases involving murder or offences related to drugs or organized crime or offences 
committed against the Government or the national economy).27 The Civil Registration Act 
contains specific provisions that authorize members of indigenous groups to register their 
children under their indigenous name and in their people&#8217;s or ethnic group&#8217;s <i>comarca</i>, even 
if they were born elsewhere.28 Indigenous peoples are authorized to register and celebrate 
their marriages in accordance with their culture and traditions.29  
</p>
<p>21. The Indigenous Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, established in 1995, 
informed the Special Rapporteur of a number of bills regarding indigenous peoples that 
have been submitted in recent years, including a bill on the prior consultation of indigenous 
and native peoples and a bill on the protection of traditional indigenous medical knowledge, 
use and practices and other matters. However, these and other bills have been criticized on 
the grounds that they were drafted without sufficient consultation with indigenous peoples; 
the Special Rapporteur has not received any information from the National Assembly in 
this regard.  
</p>
<p>22. In what could prove to be a best practice in terms of responding to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; considerable development needs, the Government has undertaken to devise a 
comprehensive development plan for indigenous and native peoples. This initiative has 
been launched at the request of indigenous peoples and was agreed to by the Government 
during a dialogue that will be described below (see para. 44). Discussions about the plan 
focus on four main areas: (a) social issues; (b) economic issues; (c) politics; and (d) special

<p>issues, such as the administration of justice, traditional governance, institution-building in 
the territories and for the authorities, and food security). A panel made up of indigenous 
representatives appointed by their peoples and government representatives has been 
established to draw up the plan. The Government has expressed the hope that an executive 
decree can be issued that will convert the plan into a policy of State. The Special 
Rapporteur considers that this would be a key achievement, provided that the plan is truly 
based on the aspirations of indigenous peoples and that sufficient funds are allocated for its 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>23. Following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Government announced that it would 
establish an office for indigenous affairs at the deputy ministerial level in order to address 
the problems of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur considers this to 
be a positive step, provided that this office is given a large enough budget and that 
indigenous peoples are given a role in its work. 
</p>
<p>24. Panama is a party to major international treaties such as the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. At the regional level, Panama has ratified the American Convention on 
Human Rights and has recognized the competence of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights. The Government also voted in favour of the adoption of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. 
</p>
<p>25. One of the concerns brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention in many parts of 
the country has to do with the fact that Panama has not yet ratified the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (no. 169). The 
Government has taken some decisive steps towards ratification, including the establishment 
of an inter-institutional working group on ILO Convention no. 169 in 2010. The working 
group, composed of a number of different government agencies, prepared a report in which 
it analysed the historical, social, legal and political reasons why Panama should ratify ILO 
Convention no. 169 and stated that it had not found any disadvantages associated with its 
ratification.30 Accordingly, the Government informed the Human Rights Council that, in 
response to recommendations made at the universal periodic review regarding the 
ratification of that convention, the working group had concluded its work and advocated 
ratification (A/HRC/16/2, para. 431).  
</p><p>26. However, the Government has since notified the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office that it will 
not ratify ILO Convention No. 169 for constitutional, economic, political, administrative, 
social, legal and environmental reasons,31 and it restated this position to the Special 
Rapporteur during his visit. Having considered the Government&#8217;s position in the light of the 
relevant background information, particularly the working group&#8217;s analysis of the 
Convention, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the Government&#8217;s refusal has no 
solid legal basis and that Panama should proceed with ratification.

<p><b> IV. Main human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>27. National laws and programmes dealing with indigenous affairs provide a vital 
foundation on which to continue building upon and strengthening the rights of indigenous 
peoples in Panama. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that this foundation is fragile 
and unstable in many regards and that indigenous peoples&#8217; rights are threatened in a 
number of ways. The following section outlines a series of problems that exist with regard 
to the enforcement and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>28. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Panama, many indigenous representatives 
told him that, as a rule, the Government does not respond to their complaints and concerns, 
especially about threats to their lands and natural resources, unless they take drastic 
measures. In fact, in recent years indigenous peoples have blocked the Inter-American 
Highway on a number of occasions in an effort to call attention to their situation. These 
efforts have resulted in the opening of dialogues with the Government and have led to 
tangible action on its part, but not before indigenous persons had been killed during violent 
clashes with the police. The Special Rapporteur considers that indigenous peoples and the 
Government should enter into an ongoing dialogue in order to address existing concerns in 
a peaceful and constructive manner.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Land and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>  <i>Comarcas 
</i></b></p>
<p>29. As mentioned previously, the preservation and development of indigenous cultures 
in Panama is in large part due to the official recognition of their territories and autonomy as 
embodied in the <i>comarca</i> system. Titles have yet to be awarded for the areas adjacent to the 
Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> in Bocas del Toro Province, which were designated for demarcation 
within a period of two years under Act No. 10 of 1997. This has not been done in Bocas del 
Toro, and these lands continue to be threatened, particularly by tourism and real estate 
development.  
</p>
<p>30. Although lands within the <i>comarca</i> are the collective property of indigenous 
peoples, are protected against private takeovers and cannot be transferred to other parties, 
indigenous peoples have repeatedly expressed their deep concern at the presence of third 
parties on their territory, both inside and outside the <i>comarcas</i>. The situation has resulted in 
the loss of large tracts of indigenous land and natural resources and the erosion of the 
indigenous authorities&#8217; decision-making powers and control over their lands. These 
outsiders include settlers, private farming, ranching and tourism companies, and illegal 
miners and loggers. 
</p>
<p>31. Although indigenous peoples have a certain degree of control over the development 
of renewable and non-renewable resources in the <i>comarcas</i> (see paras. 14 and 15), this is 
one of the chief concerns that they brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. Specific 
projects that are a cause of concern are discussed below (paras. 42&#8211;48). 
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous lands without official recognition or protection 
</b></p>
<p>32. One of the primary concerns of the country&#8217;s seven indigenous peoples is the lack of 
sufficient official recognition and protection of their traditionally held lands and natural 
resources outside the <i>comarcas</i>. More than 100 indigenous communities are thought not to 
have land titles or any other form of official recognition of their rights over the lands that 
they have traditionally used and inhabited. Some of these communities live in protected 
areas, such as national parks. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.14-07234 
</p>
<p>33. There are a number of Ember&#225;, Wounaan, Ngobe and other indigenous communities 
located outside their <i>comarcas</i>. When the Ember&#225;-Wounaan <i>comarca</i> was set up in 1983, 
44 Ember&#225; and Wounaan communities remained outside its boundaries. Since then, the 
indigenous authorities in these areas have been requesting the titling of their collective 
lands in the provinces of Dari&#233;n and Panam&#225;. This continues to be the Wounaan people&#8217;s 
top priority. 
</p>
<p>34. Indigenous representatives of all these communities have submitted, or are working 
on, their titling applications under Act No. 72 of 2008 (see para. 16). In November 2011, 
members of the Ember&#225; and Wounaan peoples blocked the Inter-American Highway for 
five days to call attention to their territorial demands. The blockade ended with the 
conclusion of an agreement between the National Land Management Agency and the 
traditional authorities of the collective lands in question under which the Government 
committed to grant titles to two Wounaan communities (Rio Hondo/Platanares and Maje 
Chiman) and to continue the titling processes for other communities. 
</p><p>35. Representatives of the National Land Management Agency have informed the 
Special Rapporteur that delays in according official recognition to collective lands and in 
issuing titles to them have chiefly been due to the claims made by landowners and settlers 
to the lands to be demarcated. Pursuant to Act No. 72, the National Directorate for Agrarian 
Reform is responsible for settling disputes involving challenges to applications for 
collective land ownership titles; if an amicable settlement cannot be reached, legal action is 
taken.32 Act No. 72 does not provide for protection against encroachments that take place 
while a titling application is being processed. 
</p>
<p>36. While communities await the titling of their collective lands, settlers and loggers 
continue to move into them, leading to growing tensions and conflict. The delay in 
recognizing the Rio Hondo/Platanares collective lands has resulted in heightened conflicts 
over illegal logging. 
</p>
<p>37. The fact that two of the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples, namely, the Bribri and the 
Naso, do not have <i>comarcas</i> of their own is a particular concern. Bribri representatives 
informed the Special Rapporteur that the titling application that they submitted under Act 
No. 72 for their collective lands, which cover a total area of 28,207 hectares, remains 
pending. They also reported that 80 per cent of the territory has been demarcated. However, 
the representatives of the National Land Management Agency with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met said that they had no knowledge of the application. 
</p>
<p>38. The Naso people have been fighting for the establishment of a <i>comarca</i> since 1973. 
They drafted a bill to that end and submitted it to the Legislative Assembly, but the bill has 
yet to be adopted. The government representatives with whom the Special Rapporteur 
broached the topic acknowledged the importance of establishing a <i>comarca</i> for the Naso 
and stated that they remained open to the possibility of doing so. While the Naso people 
await legal protection for their traditional territory, they are having problems with settlers 
and other outsiders. In particular, the Naso community of San San Druy has had many 
disputes with Ganadera Bocas SA, a company operating on the lands that they are claiming. 
The Bonyic hydroelectric project has also sparked conflict, as is discussed in the next 
section.

</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07234 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Investment projects  
</b>39. Numerous allegations of violations of the rights of indigenous peoples have been 
made as a result of the development of large-scale hydroelectric and other investment 
projects in Panama&#8217;s indigenous territories, particularly in recent years. Government 
representatives informed the Special Rapporteur that the State views hydroelectric power 
generation as its main priority and that there are plans to construct further plants in the 
coming years.  
</p>
<p>40. In general, the indigenous peoples affected by these projects claim that there have 
been irregularities in the processes involved in obtaining authorization for the construction 
of hydroelectric power stations or in reaching agreement on such projects. It has also been 
claimed that the revenues from these projects have been distributed improperly. Most of 
these projects are located outside of the boundaries of the indigenous <i>comarcas</i>, but they 
nevertheless have an impact on lands recognized as belonging to or claimed by indigenous 
peoples.  
</p>
<p>41. Recent experiences in connection with hydroelectric projects in Panama illustrate 
the consequences of the lack of an appropriate governing framework for consultations with 
indigenous communities. In the cases that have arisen recently, consultations were carried 
out in an improvised manner. Representatives of both the Government and indigenous 
peoples stated that those processes were unsatisfactory, partly because the enterprises 
involved undertook to carry out the consultations on their own and failed to work with the 
peoples concerned through their representatives.  
</p>
<p><b>  Specific projects  
</b>42. <b>Barro Blanco.</b> The Barro Blanco hydroelectric project is being developed by 
Generadora del Istmo, SA, a Panamanian enterprise with Central American financial 
backing. The dam for this hydroelectric project is currently under construction and is 
located outside the boundaries of the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i>. However, the dam&#8217;s reservoir 
will flood lands in an adjacent area and will thus have a direct impact on a number of the 
<i>comarca</i>&#8217;s inhabitants. Representatives of the Government and of the indigenous peoples 
concerned agree that the existing tensions and the continued rejection of the project by the 
Ngobe people are, to a large extent, the consequence of shortcomings in the consultation 
process. The environmental impact study approved by the National Environment Agency 
has also given cause for concern, since it fails to assess the project&#8217;s impact on the lands 
and territories of the Ngobe-Bugle people.  
</p>
<p>43. The disputes surrounding this project began at the start of 2011, when members of 
the Ngobe people closed off various sections of the Inter-American Highway. The 
demonstrations ended on 27 February 2011 with the signing of the San F&#233;lix Agreement by 
the Government and the Coordinating Body for the Defence of the Natural Resources and 
Rights of the Ngobe-Bugle People and Campesinos. The Government undertook to work 
for the passage of a law that would prohibit mining and mineral exploration in the Ngobe-
Bugle <i>comarca</i>. However, when the bill was passed into law by the National Assembly at 
its first reading, the article providing for the cancellation of commercial mining concessions 
already in operation within the <i>comarca</i> had been removed from the text. This sparked a 
fresh wave of demonstrations, and the Inter-American Highway was again closed off in 
February 2012. Two members of the Ngobe community died during those demonstrations, 
and the inquiry into the circumstances surrounding their deaths has not been completed. 
Indigenous peoples and various civil society organizations also claim that, while in police 
custody, a number of girls and women were subjected to sexual violence, including rape in 
one case. Investigations are also ongoing in these cases.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.14-07234 
</p>
<p>44. Following the signing of the San Lorenzo Agreement in February 2012, the 
Government, with the Catholic Church acting as mediator and the United Nations country 
team in Panama as an observer, set up two round tables with representatives of the Ngobe 
people to address controversial issues that remained unresolved, including the Mining Act 
and the Barro Blanco hydroelectric project. The round table on the Mining Act led to the 
drafting and adoption of Act No. 11 of 2012 (see para. 15 above). As a result of the round 
table on the Barro Blanco dam, the parties agreed to send a joint verification mission 
comprised of representatives of the Government of Panama, the United Nations and the 
Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> to the area to carry out a preliminary study on the impact of the 
project.  
45. In its report of September 2012, the joint verification mission recommended that an 
independent study be carried out by an international team of experts. The hydraulic, 
ecological and economic aspects of the project were examined in July and August 2013 and 
a participatory, community-level assessment was prepared. The study concluded that the 
project&#8217;s impacts on the environment and the Ngobe communities in question could be 
mitigated but that appropriate consultations with the indigenous peoples in question had not 
been carried out and that the direct and indirect impacts had not been clearly explained or 
understood. It went on to say that the direct impacts could certainly affect the community as 
a whole and should be mitigated properly.33 
</p>
<p>46. <b>Chan 75.</b> In 2009, the Special Rapporteur visited the country to examine the 
situation of the indigenous communities affected by the Chan 75 hydroelectric project and 
issued a report containing recommendations in that regard (A/HRC/12/34/Add.5). For the 
most part, those recommendations were not heeded by the Government. The project 
resulted in the flooding of five Ngobe communities located outside the boundaries of the 
Ngobe <i>comarca</i>. Following the visit, most of the families concerned reached agreements 
with the Government and with AES Corporation, the terms of which have been made 
public. Two families have failed to reach an agreement with the enterprise, despite the fact 
that their farms have already been flooded. It is further claimed that AES has not completed 
construction work on the alternative housing that was promised to the families, who are 
currently living at various widely scattered locations. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 
government representatives told him that it had been a mistake on their part to allow the 
company to carry out the Chan 75 consultations on its own at the start of the project. 
Indigenous representatives also complained that the consultation process took the form of 
negotiations with individual families, rather than with indigenous representatives or 
traditional decision-making bodies.  
</p>
<p>47. <b>Bonyic.</b> The Bonyic project, which is located on traditional lands claimed by the 
Naso people, is another controversial hydroelectric project. Although the enterprise 
carrying out that project has reached agreements on compensation with a number of the 
families concerned, others informed the Special Rapporteur that they had not negotiated 
with the company. In 2004, the previous Naso king signed an agreement on compensation 
and benefits between the enterprise Hidro Ecol&#243;gica del Teribe and the Naso people 
regarding the construction of the Bonyic hydroelectric power station. In 2012, the current 
king signed an accord with the corporation which broadened the agreement on 
compensation and benefits, with the enterprise agreeing to provide a number of benefits 
mainly in the areas of job creation, education, health and infrastructure. However, a number 
of members of the Naso community oppose the accord and assert that they were not

<p>represented in the process and that the project will have an impact on the environment and 
will block access to certain areas within Naso territory.  
</p>
<p>48. <b>Bayano.</b> Indigenous representatives of the Kuna and Ember&#225; peoples have made a 
number of allegations relating to the Bayano hydroelectric project, which, in the 1970s, led 
to the relocation of a large number of members of the Kuna and Ember&#225; communities and 
the loss, according to one estimate, of 35,000 hectares of their traditional lands. Prior to the 
relocation phase, the Government offered to give the communities in question title to new 
lands, financial compensation and other benefits.34 It is claimed, however, that the 
communities have still not obtained legal recognition of their ownership of the lands to 
which they were moved and that the Government has not paid the financial compensation 
that it had said it would. On 26 February 2013, the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, after the 
Commission had concluded that there has been an &#8220;ongoing violation of the right to 
collective property of the Kuna de Madungandi and Ember&#225; de Bayano indigenous peoples 
and their members as a result of the State of Panama&#8217;s failure, to date, to pay the financial 
compensation stemming from the dispossession and flooding of the victims&#8217; ancestral 
territories as from 1969&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p><b> B. Self-governance and participation  
</b></p>
<p>49. A strong protective framework exists in the country for self-government and 
political participation by the indigenous peoples of Panama. This framework is linked to the 
<i>comarca</i> system and, to a lesser extent, to the existence of collective lands. However, no 
specific protection of this type exists for these collective lands or for indigenous peoples 
whose territories have not been recognized.   
</p>
<p>50. As to political participation, under the Constitution of 2004, <i>comarca</i> inhabitants 
can elect parliamentary representatives, mayors, councillors and representatives of 
administrative districts. Currently, 7 of the 71 representatives in the National Assembly are 
indigenous persons (3 Ngobe and 4 Kuna), meaning that, at the national level, the Ngobe-
Bugle community is proportionally represented and the Kuna people are overrepresented. 
The Ember&#225;-Wounaan <i>comarca</i> elects parliamentary representatives jointly with Dari&#233;n 
Province; the inhabitants of that <i>comarca</i> are therefore not, in actual fact, guaranteed 
appropriate representation, as their votes are merged with those of the overall electorate of 
Dari&#233;n. The percentage of other political representatives (such as mayors, councillors and 
representatives of administrative districts) elected by the <i>comarcas</i> has been nearly 
proportional to the size of their population.   
</p>
<p>51. Indigenous peoples enjoy a significant level of self-governance within the <i>comarcas</i>, 
which includes the election of their local leaders and control over internal affairs.36 
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, indigenous authorities enjoy formal, although not 
always effective, control over non-renewable resources within their <i>comarcas</i> and, as will 
be discussed below, many public economic and social development services are provided at 
the <i>comarca</i> level in coordination with those authorities. However, the Government retains 
control over the disbursement of public funds and over tax revenues within the <i>comarcas</i>.  
</p>
<p>52. The traditional governments of the indigenous peoples also enjoy a certain amount 
of recognition within the framework of the legally recognized collective lands located

<p>outside the boundaries of the <i>comarcas</i>. Act No. 72 states that the executive branch shall, 
by executive decree, accord recognition to the traditional form of organization, culture and 
authorities of the indigenous peoples holding collective title to their lands and that it shall 
establish procedures for coordination between those authorities and the Government.37  
</p>
<p>53. Notwithstanding such formal protection mechanisms, indigenous peoples have 
expressed concern that, in their view, the State does not duly respect the indigenous 
authorities and that it frequently fails to coordinate or consult with those authorities 
regarding legislative, political and administrative decisions that affect them, both within 
and outside the boundaries of the <i>comarcas</i>. In particular, there has been a lack of 
consultation on extractive and hydroelectric activities and on the development of related 
legislation. A number of laws are said to have been adopted in recent years without 
consulting indigenous peoples, including legislation on communal expropriation,38 wind 
power concessions39 and amendments to the Criminal Code.40 It has also been claimed that 
the bills referred to in paragraph 21 were submitted to the National Assembly without 
involving the indigenous authorities of the <i>comarcas</i> and indigenous territories.  
</p>
<p>54. Those regions where government authorities are present within indigenous territories 
suffer the most from a lack of coordination, and this is particularly true of the border areas 
inhabited by the Kuna, Ember&#225; and Wounaan peoples. The Special Rapporteur has been 
informed that the National Border Service of the Republic of Panama has failed to 
coordinate its activities with the indigenous authorities of the Kuna Yala and Ember&#225;-
Wounaan <i>comarcas</i>. The Ministry of Public Security has stated that, in general, the police 
coordinate their activities with the <i>comarca</i> authorities but that State authorities have 
special jurisdiction and responsibility in certain regions, such as the border areas in Kuna 
Yala and Dari&#233;n.   
</p>
<p>55. One cause of concern that has arisen in the past few years is related to the 2011 
elections in the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i>. In 2010, by means of Executive Decree No. 537 of 
2 June 2010, the Government amended provisions of the administrative organizational 
charter of the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> relating to procedures for the election of <i>comarca</i> 
authorities. According to the Electoral Tribunal, the amendments were of a technical legal 
nature and were designed to correct legal provisions governing the election of authorities 
contained in the administrative organizational charter that were thought to be in 
contradiction with the law which authorized the establishment of the Ngobe-Bugle 
<i>comarca</i>. It is clear that the indigenous peoples of the <i>comarca</i> were not duly consulted 
regarding those changes. The amendments were in place by the time that the Electoral 
Tribunal organized and monitored the 2010 elections, during which 1,740 <i>comarca</i> 
representatives were elected. According to the Electoral Tribunal, 23.9 per cent of the 
population voted in the elections, but a number of representatives of the Ngobe-Bugle 
people claim that the electoral process was manipulated by the Government and that the 
results are not legitimate.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur has received information which indicates that indigenous 
women often suffer from discrimination within their own communities, particularly in 
terms of their participation in traditional systems of representation. Such allegations give 
cause for concern and warrant attention.

<p><b> C. Economic and social development  
</b></p>
<p>57. In recent years, progress has been made in raising the level of economic and social 
well-being of indigenous peoples. As will be discussed later on in this section, various 
indicators point to an improvement in the living conditions of indigenous peoples. 
However, indigenous peoples continue to be poorer than other sectors of the Panamanian 
population and to be worse off in terms of access to basic services, education and health.  
</p>
<p><b>  Economic development  
</b></p>
<p>58. According to Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance figures for 2012, poverty 
and extreme poverty levels among the indigenous peoples of Panama are alarmingly high, 
with 89.8 per cent of the population of the <i>comarcas</i> living in poverty, compared to 21.4 
per cent of the population outside of the <i>comarcas</i>. Furthermore, 68.5 per cent of the 
population of the indigenous <i>comarcas</i> live in extreme poverty, compared to 6.4 per cent of 
the population elsewhere.41 In addition, in contrast to the trend for the general population, 
levels of poverty among indigenous peoples have not fallen in recent years.42  
</p>
<p>59. The situation in terms of access to basic services is also a cause for concern and is 
undoubtedly exacerbated by the remoteness of many communities and homes in the 
indigenous <i>comarcas</i>. According to the latest official census, carried out in 2010, 93.3 per 
cent of the nation&#8217;s households have access to water fit for human consumption. However, 
the figures for the Ngobe-Bugle, Ember&#225; and Kuna Yala <i>comarcas</i> are much lower, 
standing at 28 per cent, 41 per cent and 77 per cent respectively.43 Furthermore, at the 
national level only 5.5 per cent of all households lack access to sanitation services, whereas 
the percentages of households without sanitation services in the Kuna Yala, Ngobe-Bugle 
and Ember&#225; <i>comarcas</i> stand at 94 per cent, 59 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively.44 
Access to sanitation services in the <i>comarcas</i> has, however, increased significantly since 
1990.45  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was not provided with any information on government anti-
poverty programmes specifically targeting the indigenous population. However, the 
Ministry of Social Development provided the Special Rapporteur with information on its 
social inclusion programme, which makes the receipt of specified social benefits 
conditional upon the fulfilment of certain responsibilities, such as school attendance and 
regular visits to health clinics. This programme is not, however, limited to indigenous 
peoples, and the way in which it is implemented has not been adapted to take into account 
their distinct ways of life and cultures.  
</p>
<p>61. During the visit, the indigenous representatives who met with the Special 
Rapporteur reported on a number of grass-roots economic development initiatives. One 
example which stands out is that of the Kuna, who have benefitted significantly in financial 
terms from tourism in the Kuna Yala <i>comarca</i>, where local tourism ventures are managed 
by the Kuna Congress. The Special Rapporteur also notes that natural resource 
development projects conducted by the Government or by third parties could provide 
indigenous peoples with economic development opportunities. However, such projects 
must be implemented on the basis of consensual agreements with the peoples concerned in

<p>a manner that is beneficial to those peoples and respectful of their human rights. As 
previously stated, under Act No. 11 of 2012, a minimum of 5 per cent of the revenues from 
hydroelectric projects in the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> must be allocated to the Ngobe-Bugle 
community. The Special Rapporteur will closely monitor the implementation of this law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Education  
</b></p>
<p>62. As previously stated (see para. 18 above), Panama has a solid legal framework, 
including constitutional provisions and national and <i>comarca</i> laws, on education for 
indigenous peoples and intercultural and bilingual education. This framework is one of the 
most advanced of its kind that the Special Rapporteur has seen anywhere in the world.  
</p>
<p>63. In addition to these laws, the Ministry of Education has set up various programmes 
on education for indigenous peoples,46 including the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) In 2007, the Government created the National Intercultural Bilingual 
Directorate,47 a body responsible for developing education programmes for indigenous 
peoples that are suited to their cultural norms; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Ministry of Education has set up regional education directorates48 which 
have helped 42 Ember&#225; and Wounaan schools and 369 Ngobe-Bugle educational centres to 
develop intercultural, bilingual education programmes in 2012. The Ministry also devised a 
2013 Panama peer-to-peer project for training teachers, directors and supervisors working 
in rural and indigenous schools in the use of new instructional technologies. The Ministry 
has also developed a number of programmes to improve education within multi-grade 
educational centres in rural and indigenous areas based on teacher-training and other 
initiatives.  
</p>
<p>64. Academic achievement levels in the <i>comarcas</i> are improving. However, the gap in 
this regard between members of indigenous peoples and the non-indigenous population 
remains wide; for example, levels of school attendance among the indigenous communities 
are still lower than among the rest of the population. In general, indigenous children tend to 
leave school at an earlier age than children from other sectors of the population, with girls 
remaining at school for fewer years than boys. At the national level, on average, children 
attend school for 8.39 years, while the average for the Kuna Yala, Ember&#225;-Wounaan and 
Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarcas</i> is 4.34 years, 4.32 years and 3.54 years,49 respectively. Illiteracy 
rates in the <i>comarcas</i> are higher than the national average of 5.5 per cent, as well. The 
averages for the Kuna Yala, Ngobe-Bugle and Ember&#225;-Wounaan <i>comarcas</i> are 28.3 per 
cent, 30.8 per cent and 22.9 per cent,50 respectively. It should be noted, however, that these 
figures have improved since 2000.  
</p>
<p>65.  Notwithstanding the progress made, indigenous peoples undoubtedly still face a 
number of obstacles in terms of their access to education, including a shortage of schools, 
particularly secondary schools in the <i>comarcas</i> and other rural communities that are home 
to indigenous peoples. The Ministry of Education estimates that around 96 per cent of 
schools in the indigenous <i>comarcas</i> are multi-grade institutions. Furthermore, progress in 
the provision of intercultural bilingual education is said to be limited; both indigenous

<p>peoples and the Ministry of Education have identified a lack of funding as a factor that 
hampers the development of programmes in that field. Moreover, even though the 
introduction of a curriculum suited to the needs of indigenous peoples is required by law, 
teachers still tend to follow the national curriculum.  
</p>
<p><b>  Health 
</b></p>
<p>66. Both government representatives and representatives of indigenous peoples 
acknowledge that the health status of indigenous peoples are negatively affected by poverty 
and extreme poverty, low levels of education, limited access to drinking water and 
sanitation, and the geographical isolation of many indigenous communities in Panama.  
</p>
<p>67. The available figures point to a gap between the indigenous and non-indigenous 
populations in terms of health conditions. For example, nationally, the average infant 
mortality rate stands at 13.2 deaths per 1,000 live births. The averages for the Kuna Yala 
and Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarcas</i> are 19.5 and 20.8,51 respectively. The national average 
maternal mortality indicator for Panama is 80.5 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the 
averages for the Kuna Yala and Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarcas</i> are 542.3 and 300.5,52 respectively.  
</p>
<p>68. Indigenous peoples also tend to suffer from higher rates of infectious diseases. The 
incidence of tuberculosis has been identified as an issue of particular concern, with the 
Kuna Yala and Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarcas</i> having the highest rates: 163.3 cases per 100,000 
inhabitants and 85.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively (compared to the national 
average of 41.2).53 The indigenous areas also have the highest rate of malnutrition among 
children of preschool age (under 5 years of age), and this situation has worsened over the 
past few years.54  
</p>
<p>69. In general, the indigenous peoples expressed concern at the limited availability of 
health services in rural areas. The number of health workers in the <i>comarcas</i> and other 
areas with large indigenous populations remains low, although the situation is improving. 
In 2011, medical-worker density in the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> was 2.6 (an increase of 0.8 
as of that year) and 13.0 in the Kuna Yala <i>comarca</i> (up from 10.9 in 2001).55 A study on the 
health status of the indigenous peoples of Panama showed that 64.2 per cent of the 
indigenous persons who were interviewed identified distance as being an obstacle in terms 
of access to health services.56  
</p>
<p>70. The Government runs a number of programmes designed to facilitate access to 
health services. For example, it provides subsidies and transportation to clinics for 
midwives, has set up hostels and homes for expectant and new mothers close to major 
health-care centres and arranges for visits to indigenous communities by health workers 
trained to provide basic services. However, much remains to be done in this regard. One 
issue raised by the representatives of the Ministry of Health is that non-indigenous health 
workers are often unwilling to work in the <i>comarcas</i> despite the higher wages on offer. 
Cultural and linguistic factors also can interfere with access to health services. According to 
representatives of the Ministry of Health, most health workers in the <i>comarcas</i> should be 
indigenous persons who are familiar with the <i>comarca</i> laws. One of the many problems in 
this area has to do with the sensitization of health workers.

<p>71. The creation in 2011 of the Directorate for Indigenous Health Affairs of the Ministry 
of Health marked a major step forward. The Directorate is responsible for providing 
comprehensive health care to indigenous peoples and for helping them to preserve their 
ancestral knowledge and uphold their fundamental rights.57 The Directorate provides health 
services such as vaccinations, dental care and the dispensation of medicines, as well as 
offering awareness-raising and training services, for example, to traditional midwives and 
doctors concerning health issues linked to their work in indigenous areas. Authorization for 
the creation of the National Commission on Traditional Indigenous Medicine58 was issued 
in 2003. The Commission was given the mandate to promote traditional indigenous 
medicine, in cooperation with the traditional indigenous authorities. To date, however, this 
body has not been established.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b>72. <b>The legislative framework of Panama is highly developed in terms of the rights 
of indigenous peoples. In particular, the <i>comarca</i> system provides a significant level of 
protection for the rights of indigenous peoples in Panama, especially with regard to 
lands and territories, participation and self-governance, and health and education.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The country&#8217;s laws and programmes on indigenous issues provide a vital 
foundation for further work to build upon and strengthen the rights of the indigenous 
peoples of Panama. However, the Special Rapporteur observes that this foundation is 
fragile and unstable in many regards.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>As pointed out earlier in this report, Panama is faced with a series of issues 
related to the enforcement and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, 
particularly in connection with their lands and natural resources, the implementation 
of large-scale investment projects, self-governance and participation, and social and 
economic rights, including their rights to economic development, education and 
health.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In the light of the observations made in this report, the Special Rapporteur 
makes the following specific recommendations to the Government:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Seek out way of engaging in an ongoing dialogue with indigenous 
representatives in order to address existing concerns in a peaceful and constructive 
manner (para. 28); 
 (b) Ensure that indigenous peoples play an appropriate role in the 
formulation of a bill on the prior consultation of indigenous peoples. This bill should 
provide for consultation with the indigenous authorities in the <i>comarcas</i> and collective 
lands (para. 21); 
 (c) Proceed with the ratification of the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
Convention, 1989 (No. 169) (para. 25); 
 (d) Redouble efforts to protect the lands and natural resources located 
within the <i>comarcas</i> and to resolve the pending issue of the titling of the areas 
adjacent to the Ngobe-Bugle <i>comarca</i> (para. 29); 
 (e) Move forward with the processing of the pending applications filed by 
the Bribri, Ember&#225; and Wounaan peoples under Act No. 72 of 2008 and assist them in

regard (paras. 34 to 37); 
 (f) Re-examine the proposal put forward by the Naso people regarding the 
establishment of a <i>comarca</i> as a means of safeguarding and securing official 
recognition of their territorial rights (para. 38); 
 (g) Take the necessary steps, in coordination with the corresponding 
indigenous authorities, to prevent third parties from entering recognized or claimed 
indigenous territories and punish any persons illegally present on those lands (paras. 
30 and 36); 
 (h) Ensure that natural resource development projects are implemented on 
the basis of consensual agreements with the peoples concerned in a manner that is 
beneficial to those peoples and respectful of their human rights (paras. 39 to 41); 
 (i) In the light of recent experiences with the implementation of 
hydroelectric projects without appropriate consultations with the indigenous 
communities concerned, such as the Barro Blanco and Chan 75 projects, establish, in 
coordination with indigenous representatives, a governing framework for a system of 
consultations to be applied in the case of hydroelectric and extractive projects that 
have an impact on indigenous peoples (paras. 42 to 46); 
 (j) As to the Barro Blanco hydroelectric project, the lands of the Ngobe 
people should not be flooded or adversely affected in any way without the prior 
agreement of the representative authorities of that people as to the conditions attached 
thereto. Without the agreement or consent of the Ngobe people, the State should not 
allow the territorial rights of this people to be prejudiced in any way unless it is 
necessary to do so for a public purpose that is valid from a human rights perspective 
and, in such cases, only to the extent that it is necessary for and proportional to that 
valid purpose (paras. 42 to 45); 
 (k) In recognition of the significant framework of protection provided by the 
<i>comarca</i> system with regard to self-governance and political participation, develop 
special protective measures of that type for collective lands and for indigenous peoples 
whose territories have not been recognized (paras. 49 to 55); 
 (l) Strengthen its coordination and consultations with indigenous 
authorities concerning legal, political and administrative decisions that affect them 
and ensure that any decisions taken by those authorities within their areas of 
competence are respected (para. 54). In that regard, the National Border Service of 
the Republic of Panama should coordinate its activities with the indigenous 
authorities;

<p><b> (m) Respect the right of indigenous peoples to elect their authorities in line 
with their traditional forms of representation (para. 55); 
 (n) In view of the fact that indigenous peoples continue to have higher 
poverty rates and worse living conditions in terms of access to basic services, 
education and health: (i) Increase the efforts and resources devoted to narrowing the 
gap between indigenous peoples and other Panamanians in terms of access to 
education, health and economic development; (ii) Strengthen the coordination and 
implementation of education, health and economic development programmes and 
policies in collaboration with indigenous authorities, both within and outside the 
boundaries of the <i>comarcas</i>, and allocate additional resources for that purpose; (iii) 
Provide education and health specialists operating in indigenous areas with training in 
the areas of interculturality, indigenous languages and the legislation governing the

<p><b> (o) Given the strong legal recognition accorded to the right to bilingual and 
intercultural education, allocate additional resources for the enforcement of that 
right, provide indigenous teachers with intercultural bilingual teacher training and 
develop additional curricular guidelines and materials in ongoing consultation with 
the indigenous peoples concerned (paras. 62 and 63).
