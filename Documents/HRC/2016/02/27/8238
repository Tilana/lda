</b></p>
<p> 
 The present study discusses the intersection between malnutrition, childhood 
diseases and human rights, taking children affected by noma as an example. It reiterates the 
importance of socio-economic conditions in which children are born, grow up and live in 
influencing their opportunity to be healthy. Malnutrition is the key risk factor of noma, a 
disease that devours the face of children and is fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases if basic, 
cost-effective treatment is not administered early on. 
</p>
<p> The study recommends that the fight against poverty and malnutrition is reinforced 
and pursued in accordance with human rights principles; that noma is addressed at global 
level and the efforts to prevent and treat it in Africa are strengthened; and that it is formally 
listed by the World Health Organization as a neglected disease in an attempt to raise 
awareness. The annex contains the human rights principles and guidelines to improve the 
protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, specifically at risk of or affected 
by noma.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee in resolution 16/27 
of 25 March 2011 to undertake a comprehensive study on the relationship between severe 
malnutrition and childhood diseases, taking children affected by noma as an example, and 
on ways to improve the protection of malnourished children. The mandate followed up the 
Committee&#8223;s study on discrimination in the context of the right to food (A/HRC/16/40), 
which identified children with noma as victims of de facto discrimination in relation to the 
right to food. 
</p>
<p>2. The drafting group on the right to food, consisting of Jos&#233; Bengoa Cabello, 
Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Jean Ziegler and Mona Zulficar1 prepared a preliminary 
study on severe malnutrition and childhood diseases with children affected by noma as an 
example (A/HRC/AC/7/CRP.2). At its seventh session, the Committee welcomed the 
preliminary study and invited the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to collect the views and comments on the study of all Member States, 
relevant United Nations special agencies and programmes and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The present study on severe malnutrition and childhood diseases with children 
affected by noma as an example is the outcome of research and consultations among 
members of the Advisory Committee and relevant stakeholders, and draws upon previous 
work of the Committee (A/HRC/16/40 and A/HRC/AC/3/CRP.3). The study benefited from 
the support, views and comments by Member States, the World Health Organization 
(WHO), non-governmental organizations and experts in the field of malnutrition and 
noma.2 The study was considered and endorsed by the Committee at its eighth session, for 
submission to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p>4. The first part of the study focuses on the intersection between severe malnutrition, 
childhood disease and human rights. The second part elaborates on the situation of children 
at risk of or affected by noma. The annex contains human rights principles and guidelines 
to improve the protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, specifically at risk 
of or affected by noma. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Severe malnutrition, childhood diseases and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. The intersection between severe malnutrition, childhood diseases and human rights 
deserves greater attention for a number of reasons. First, the timeliness of the mandate 
entrusted by the Council to the Committee should be seen against statistics that show that 
malnutrition in children remains strikingly high.3 The food crises of recent years,

<p>characterized by skyrocketing prices for basic foodstuffs,4 and the recent famine in the 
Horn of Africa5 add to the urgency of understanding the linkages between severe 
malnutrition and childhood diseases from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>6. Second, the host of human rights which are at stake in the context of severe 
malnutrition and childhood diseases need to be identified in order for the international 
community to address in a comprehensive reply the symptoms and root causes of the 
problem. It is imperative, as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
United Nations Special Rapporteurs have emphasized, to pay particular attention to the 
most vulnerable individuals and groups and their access to food that should satisfy their 
dietary needs.6 Surely, children affected by malnutrition are such a vulnerable group, while 
children affected by or at risk of noma are among the most vulnerable. A human rights 
analysis of severe malnutrition and childhood diseases, including noma, helps us 
understand that the rights of children and other individuals &#8211; as opposed to privileges which 
can be given and taken &#8211; and obligations of States and international organizations under 
international law &#8211; as opposed to voluntary commitments &#8211; are centre stage.

<p>7. According to WHO, malnutrition essentially means &#8220;bad nourishment&#8221; and can refer 
to the quantity as well as the quality of food eaten.7 In medical terms, malnutrition is 
explained as a state of nutrition in which inadequate intake of calories, proteins, nutrients &#8211; 
including vitamins &#8211; causes adverse effects on tissue and/or body functions.8 It includes 
both undernutrition and overnutrition.9 While the latter has also become a concern in recent 
years for developing countries,10 the current report will focus on the undernutrition aspect 
of malnutrition in children. As such, malnutrition in children is the consequence of a range

<p>of factors that are often related to poor food quality, insufficient food intake, and severe and 
repeated infectious diseases, or a combination of the above.11 
</p>
<p>8. A classification of malnutrition would include protein-energy malnutrition 
(deficiency in calories and proteins), as well as micronutrient malnutrition (deficiency in 
vitamins or minerals).12 Malnutrition can take mild, moderate or severe forms; it can be 
chronic or acute. 
</p>
<p>9. A key indicator of chronic malnutrition is stunting, which is defined as height for 
age below minus two standard deviations from the median height for age of the standard 
reference population.13 In other words, children affected are too short for their age group 
compared to the WHO Child Growth Standards. In 2010, approximately 171 million 
children globally were stunted, resulting from not enough food, a diet poor in vitamins and 
minerals, inadequate child care and disease. In south-central Asia 36 per cent of children 
were affected by stunting as of 2010;14 in Africa stunting has stagnated since 1990 at about 
40 per cent.15 
</p>
<p>10. In addition to the statistics, the consequences of chronic malnutrition on the future of 
children must be understood: adverse cognitive development, reduced learning ability, poor 
school performance, school dropout and decreased productivity as an adult.16 &#8220;Once 
established, stunting and its effects typically become permanent. Stunted children may 
never regain the height lost and most will never gain the corresponding weight. And when 
the window of early childhood is closed, the associated cognitive damage is often 
irreversible&#8221;.17 In other words, stunted children may be unable to reach their full potential 
in adulthood, a fate for which they are not responsible and which they cannot escape. A 
range of human rights are infringed upon during the life cycle of an individual who suffered 
stunting in childhood: the right to an adequate standard of living including the rights to 
food, health, water and sanitation, often the right to adequate housing, the right to 
education, the right to work, non-discrimination and ultimately the right to life. Indeed, the 
high number of stunted children today cast a shadow over the progress on other Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), such as child health and education. It is legitimate to observe 
that: &#8220;new schools and hospitals are crucial, but how much of a difference can they make if 
the infants arriving for their lessons and check-ups have already been consigned to 
debilitating physical and mental limitations by early life nutritional deficiencies?&#8221;18 Yet 
again the importance of a human rights framework for the MDGs which would stress the 
interdependence of human rights and move the debate from the arena of voluntarily 
commitment to that of States&#8223; obligations under human rights law is underscored. In 
addition, chronic malnutrition puts into question the future of economic development of

<p>those countries that have high rates of stunting in children who, without early intervention, 
may be unable to reach their full potential as productive members of society. 
</p>
<p>11. At the global level, 20 million children are estimated to be severely wasted19 and 
thus suffer from severe acute malnutrition.20 The (preventable) tragic thing about these 
children has been described by Nicholas Kristof as their equanimity: &#8220;They don&#8223;t smile. 
They don&#8223;t move. They don&#8223;t show a flicker of fear, pain or interest. Tiny, wizened 
</p>
<p>zombies, they shut down all nonessential operations to employ every last calorie to stay 
alive&#8221;.21 The human dignity of these children is being compromised and ultimately their 
right to life, since about 1 million children die every year from severe acute malnutrition.22 
</p>
<p>12. As is evident from the above, malnutrition in itself is a serious medical condition 
that affects children. In addition, there is a two-way relationship between malnutrition and 
childhood diseases. As medical studies show: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Infection adversely affects nutritional status through reductions in dietary intake 
and intestinal absorption, increased catabolism and sequestration of nutrients that are 
required for tissue synthesis and growth. On the other hand, malnutrition can 
predispose to infection because of its negative impact on the barrier protection 
afforded by the skin and mucous membranes and by inducing alterations in host 
immune function.&#8221;23 
</p>
<p>13. Thus, children become severely malnourished because of acute paediatric diseases, 
such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles, which are not treated or are 
inadequately treated owing to poor access to health care in terms of both timing and 
quality.24 Often a deadly circle ensues. For example, in recent decades, applied research has 
confirmed the deleterious effect of diarrhoeal illness on the nutritional status of children.25 
Diarrhoea seriously exacerbates malnutrition in children, while at the same malnourished 
children are more vulnerable to acute diarrhoea and suffer multiple episodes every year.26 It 
is important to note in this context that diarrhoea is the second leading cause of death 
among children under 5 at the global level, killing about 1.5 million each year.27 
</p>
<p>14. Equally, chronic diseases in children, such as HIV, cancer, tuberculosis and sickle-
cell anaemia, that are not treated or are inadequately treated may be a reason for severe 
malnutrition in children.28 In the context of HIV/AIDS, WHO flags the need for a massive 
effort &#8220;to alleviate the overall burden of malnutrition and to reduce the severity and

<p>complexity of the impact that HIV/AIDS and malnutrition have on each other&#8221;.29 A typical 
example of this complex relationship between HIV/AIDS and malnutrition is the need to 
balance the risk of infants acquiring HIV through breast milk with the higher risk among 
non-breastfed infants, in particular from the developing world, of dying from malnutrition 
and diarrhoea.30 
</p>
<p>15. Another facet of the relationship between severe malnutrition and childhood 
diseases is the medical complications ensuing from specific aspects or pathogens occurring 
in malnourished children. Malnutrition compromises the immune system, which acts as a 
trigger for severe diseases with unclear aetiology and wounds in kwashiorkor.31 Examples 
of such diseases include Lyell&#8223;s syndrome in severely malnourished children, non-
infectious wounds in children with severe malnutrition, myelodysplastic syndromes and 
noma. The second part of this study will focus extensively on noma. 
</p>
<p>16. Infants and young children are the most vulnerable to malnutrition because of their 
high nutritional requirements for growth and cognitive development and their often 
vulnerable place in society.32 Malnutrition as a stand-alone condition and in relation to 
other childhood diseases &#8211; be they chronic, acute or severe complications &#8211; contributes 
significantly to the premature death of children. In fact, malnutrition is thought to 
contribute to one third of the 8 million deaths of children under 5 every year.33 
</p>
<p>17. It is widely acknowledged that the socioeconomic conditions into which children are 
born and in which they grow up and live influence their opportunity to be healthy: the 
lower an individual&#8223;s socioeconomic position, the higher their risk of poor health; which 
applies from country to country, as well as within countries.34 Poverty is a complex human 
condition characterized by &#8220;sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources, capabilities, 
choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living 
and other civil, economic, cultural, political and social rights&#8221; (statement by the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, E/C.12/2001/10, para. 8). The Special Rapporteur 
on extreme poverty and human rights defines the &#8220;realities of poverty&#8221; as stigmatization, 
discrimination, penalization, and exclusion (report to the General Assembly, A/66/265, 
para. 5). In slums and rural areas that have been affected by disinvestment in agriculture in 
recent decades (see study of the Advisory Committee on discrimination in the context of 
the right to food, A/HRC/16/40, paras. 18 and 21), poverty and its realities are often 
responsible for the ignorance of and/or lack of options for parents in respect to food and 
feeding practices, hygiene and sanitation, healthy child-rearing and child education, and the 
abyss of child labour and prostitution. The elimination of poverty is an imperative flowing 
from the human rights obligations of States to realize all human rights for all, while 
prioritizing the most vulnerable (see chap. II, sect. B.).

<p>18. The vulnerability of children is closely connected to the vulnerability of women. 
Gender plays an important role which cannot be overstated: pregnant women, breastfeeding 
mothers, girl children are highly vulnerable to malnutrition. A malnourished mother is 
likely to give birth to a baby of low birthweight susceptible to disease and premature 
death.35 It is contended that &#8220;malnourished girls, in particular, risk becoming yet another 
malnourished mother, thus contributing to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition&#8221;.36 
From a human rights perspective, we must question those cultural practices that place limits 
on women&#8223;s access to nutrition and food, clean water and sanitation and education and 
expose them as forms of gender discrimination.37 Such discriminatory practices may also be 
responsible for malnutrition in girl children and later in women, and thus for the 
propagation of a cycle of malnutrition. Access to nutritious food for a mother and her child 
is as important as access to information about adequate feeding practices.38 Even in 
developed contexts breastfeeding mothers face hurdles, such as societal pressure not to 
breastfeed in public and the lack of proper facilities that enable breastfeeding at the 
workplace.39 At the same time, the lack of paid maternity leave or maternity leave that does 
not cover the WHO-recommended six months of exclusive breastfeeding often leaves no 
choice to young mothers but to return to work and to stop/reduce breastfeeding.40 
Furthermore, as the Human Rights Council underlines in its resolution 16/27, non-
discriminatory access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, 
and to education, science and technology are vital for women to be able to feed themselves 
and their families. 
</p>
<p>19. As the above paragraphs bear witness, the relationship between malnutrition and 
childhood diseases is one that more often than not rests on poverty; and poverty itself is 
often traceable to either de jure or de facto discrimination in society and the family itself 
(see A/HRC/16/40). The strong link between malnutrition and childhood diseases stems 
from poor access to sufficient or sufficiently nutritious food, adequate and timely health 
care, safe water and sanitation facilities, education, access to information, decent work and 
livelihood opportunities, and adequate and sanitary shelter and housing. This lack of access 
is a saga about the human rights of children and adults that are not being fulfilled. A 
UNICEF publication from 2000 summarizes: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The success the world has had in protecting children&#8223;s rights and realizing human 
</p>
<p>potential is captured far more eloquently in flesh and bone than in concrete or steel, 
far more tellingly in the height of children than in that of skyscrapers.&#8221;41 
</p>
<p>20. The observation remains valid today against the reality of 195 million malnourished 
children worldwide susceptible to acute and chronic paediatric diseases and medical 
complications, such as noma.

<p><b> B. Malnutrition and childhood diseases: binding obligations of States 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international law 
</b></p>
<p>21. This human rights situation is taking place against the background of an 
international legislative framework that guarantees the host of rights of children and their 
mothers that are at stake when malnutrition intersects with childhood disease, notably the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>22. States parties to these international instruments are legally bound to respect, protect 
and fulfil human rights. In the context of malnutrition, States should ensure, in 
collaboration with international organizations and civil society, the necessary conditions for 
parents to be able to adequately feed themselves and their children (Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, art. 11, para. 1, and the Committee&#8223;s, general comment No. 12). 
Moreover, States have agreed to establish food insecurity and vulnerability maps and to use 
disaggregated data to identify &#8220;any form of discrimination that may manifest itself in 
</p>
<p>greater food insecurity and vulnerability to food insecurity, or in a higher prevalence of 
malnutrition among specific population groups, or both, with a view to removing and 
preventing such causes of food insecurity or malnutrition&#8221;.42 These tools must be used to 
rectify the current situation, which has seen &#8220;no meaningful improvement&#8221; in reducing 
underweight prevalence among children from poor households as opposed to considerable 
progress in rich households.43 Protecting the rights of the most vulnerable is a human rights 
imperative which flows not least from the general prohibition on discrimination under 
human rights law and the Charter of the United Nations (A/HRC/16/40, paras 9&#8211;11). 
</p>
<p>23. Of great relevance for the intersection of malnutrition and paediatric diseases is 
article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified human 
rights instrument. It provides that States shall pursue &#8220;full implementation&#8221; of the right of 
</p>
<p>the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and shall therefore 
take appropriate measures to combat disease and malnutrition, including within the 
framework of primary health care, through, inter alia, the application of readily available 
technology and the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water. 
According to the same article, States are &#8220;to ensure that all segments of society, in 
particular parents and children, are informed, have access to education and are supported in 
the use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition, the advantages of breastfeeding, 
hygiene and environmental sanitation and the prevention of accidents&#8221;. Article 12 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women requires 
States parties to ensure to women appropriate services concerning with pregnancy, 
confinement and the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as 
adequate nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 
</p>
<p>24. The 2010 UNICEF report on achieving the MDGs with equity should therefore be 
read in the key of international legal obligations of States, and not of voluntarily 
commitments: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Many countries that have met &#8211; or are close to meeting &#8211; the MDG 1 target on 
underweight prevalence must make a serious effort to reduce the prevalence of 
stunting. A comprehensive approach will address food quality and quantity, water

<p>and sanitation, health services, and care and feeding practices, as well as key 
underlying factors such as poverty, inequity and discrimination against women 
(including low levels of education among girls)&#8221;.44 
</p>
<p>25. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights enshrines the 
principle of international assistance and cooperation giving rise to extraterritorial 
obligations for State parties.45 The legal character of these obligations has been recognized 
by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of 
the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i> and the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comment No. 3 on the nature of States 
parties&#8223; obligations (para. 13).46 Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Covenant is of particular 
relevance for the current study since it stipulates that State Parties &#8220;shall take, individually 
</p>
<p>and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes&#8221;, in 
order for everyone, thus including children, to be free from hunger. A similar stipulation on 
international cooperation is present in the Convention on the Rights of the Child in relation 
to the right of the child to health (art. 24, para. 4). 
</p>
<p>26. Articles 22 and 23 of the Covenant have been considered by the Committee to serve 
as a framework for the activities of international organizations and United Nations 
specialized agencies.47 A renewed commitment has been sought from international 
organizations to respect economic, social and cultural rights while designing and 
implementing their policies and programmes and to assist States in fulfilling their human 
rights obligations.48 
</p>
<p>27. An analysis by M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) has, however, revealed that the aid 
dedicated by States, international and regional organizations and private actors to nutrition 
over the period 2004&#8211;2007 has stagnated at 350 million USD, the same level since 2000&#8211;
</p><p>2004. Taking a World Bank costing exercise49 as a starting point, MSF argues that spending 
dedicated to nutrition must increase considerably and be specifically earmarked if 
malnutrition is to be overcome.50 Moreover, MSF argues that the money is not being spent 
on &#8220;the right things&#8221; or in the most efficient way.51 For example, it emphasizes that if the 
United States of America were to renounce their current practice of in-kind food aid &#8211; 
consisting of shipping food produced in their country to the target country &#8211; and to adopt a 
policy of purchasing food locally, about 600 million USD could be freed up.52 The 
importance of acquiring locally produced food inter alia in the context of the fight against

<p>malnutrition has been recognized by other donors and agencies, such as the European 
Union and the World Food Programme.53  
</p>
<p>28. Fighting malnutrition and associated childhood diseases requires accountability and 
that is precisely what the human rights obligations of States establish. They establish an 
integrated accountability framework, whereby States with high numbers of malnourished 
children are accountable for actively removing discrimination patterns (against women, the 
poor living in the rural areas, etc.; see A/HRC/16/40), promoting participation and 
inclusiveness of the most vulnerable and, importantly, systematically eradicating corruption 
and promoting transparency. The human rights framework also requires that the 
international assistance of wealthier States enables individuals to feed themselves and does 
not only bring short-term alleviation while stifling the prospects of sustainable agriculture 
practices.54 Moreover, coherence &#8211; as opposed to fragmentation &#8211; of international law 
should be sought by all States, and trade and investment regimes should thus not be allowed 
to collude with the human rights system: especially when at stake is the nutritious food so 
much needed by malnourished children or the antiretroviral medicine for their HIV infected 
mothers is at stake. 
</p>
<p>29. In conclusion, as emphasized by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in his 
most recent report (A/HRC/19/59), &#8220;a transition towards sustainable diets will succeed only 
by supporting diverse farming systems that ensure that adequate diets are accessible to all, 
that simultaneously support the livelihoods of poor farmers and that are ecologically 
sustainable.&#8221; Nutrition initiatives should therefore be based upon a human rights approach, 
defined through accountability, participation and non-discrimination.

<p><b> III. Children at risk of or affected by noma 
</b></p>
<p>30. The first part of this study has underlined the importance of understanding the 
intersection of malnutrition, childhood diseases and human rights. Noma is the most brutal 
face of poverty and malnutrition in children and thus gives rise to some of the worst 
violations of the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>31. Noma (<i>cancrum oris</i>), which borrows its name from the Greek term &#8220;to devour&#8221;, is 
an infectious yet non-contagious disease that destroys the soft and hard tissue of the face.55 
The lesion is thought to begin as a localized ulceration in the gingiva or the mucosa of the 
cheek or lip and to spread rapidly through the surrounding tissues. At the same time, there 
is swelling of the corresponding part of the face. Untreated, the swollen skin will become 
gangrenous and will perforate, within a week, leaving a hole in the face.56 Noma is thought 
to lead to death in 70&#8211;90 per cent of cases.57 Most deaths are attributed to complications 
such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and septicaemia associated with severe malnutrition.58

<p>32. The clinical data available is unanimous: children are the main victims of this 
debilitating disease. Acute noma occurs predominantly in malnourished children up to 6 
years,59 while sequelae have been observed in adolescents and adults.60 Having studied 
patients with noma in Nigeria, scholars concluded that noma is not observable in children 
of &#8220;elite Nigerians residing in affluent sections of the urban areas&#8221; and that &#8220;it is rather a 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic disease afflicting preferentially the deprived, malnourished children in the 
poor, rural communities&#8221;.61 Medical studies concur on the specific population group that is 
predominantly affected by noma: deprived and severely malnourished young children from 
communities living in extreme poverty.62 
</p>
<p><b> A. History of noma, incidence and distribution of the disease 
</b></p>
<p>33. Known in classical and medieval Europe, noma remained common in Europe and 
North America until the beginning of the twentieth century.63 As early as in the eighteenth 
century, awareness had increased that noma was related to poverty, malnutrition and 
diseases from which the child suffered previously, such as measles.64 The economic 
progress witnessed by European and North American societies is credited with having 
allowed them to feed their children sufficiently and hence to practically eradicate noma.65 
Cases of noma reappeared in the Nazi concentration camps of Bergen-Belsen and 
Auschwitz66 and in some other European countries subjected to extreme food shortages 
during the Second World War.67 More recently, the disease has been documented in 
patients with HIV or AIDS from developed States, suffering of malnutrition, bad oral 
hygiene and immunosuppression.68 
</p>
<p>34. Low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, are considered 
to be the most affected by noma.69 Experts, including from non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), working in the field describe the area that stretches across parts of West Africa 
and Central Africa towards Sudan as the &#8220;noma belt&#8221;.70 It is assumed that a large number of

<p>individuals affected by noma live in the sub-Saharan countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, 
Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan.71 Cases are reported from other countries in 
Africa, Asia and Latin America,72 as figure 1 shows. A medical paper on noma in the Lao 
People&#8223;s Democratic Republic concludes that &#8220;it is likely that it is much more frequent in 
remote Asian rural communities than is currently appreciated&#8221;.73 
</p>
<p>Figure 1 
<b>Global distribution of noma
</b></p>
<p>74 
</p>
<p> 
35. According to estimates released by WHO in 1998, 140,000 individuals contract 
noma on a yearly basis;75 100,000 of these are children.76 The survival rate is between 10 
and 20 per cent, which means that at least 110,000 people, the vast majority of which are 
children, die every year because of noma.77 According to the WHO <i>World Health Report 
1998</i>, 770,000 persons survived the disease with heavy sequelae.78 
</p>
<p>36. In 2003 data on the incidence of noma have been calculated based on information 
from patients which have been admitted with the disease in two hospitals in Sokoto, 
Nigeria.79 By extrapolating the incidence from north-western Nigeria to the countries 
bordering the Sahara Desert, the research showed an annual incidence of 25,600 cases for

<p>that region and a global incidence per year of 30,000&#8211;40,000.80 Experts consider this data to 
be rather conservative, given that less than 10 per cent of the individuals suffering from 
noma seek medical care.81 In the evocative words of Dr. Enwonwu, a leading expert on 
noma, these cases represent merely &#8220;the tip of the iceberg&#8221;.82 
</p>
<p>37. This need for recent data is more pressing in the context of the recent food and 
economic crises. The effect of the latter on the incidence of noma is believed to be 
important given that, as a consequence of the crises, the number of individuals, including 
children, suffering of hunger and malnutrition has skyrocketed.83 Previous medical studies 
have pointed to the link between economic crisis, shortages in food and the incidence of 
noma. Some specifically identify the declining food supplies in the 1980s in sub-Saharan 
Africa and the subsequent severe chronic malnutrition as one of the explaining factors of 
the reported increase of noma.84 The effects of the food crisis in Niger in 2005 were 
registered by the NGO Sentinelles three years later when the number of small children with 
noma doubled. This increase in noma cases is probably explainable by the fact that 
malnourished babies were born to malnourished mothers, the latter victims of the 2005 food 
crisis.85 The importance of accurate and up-to-date information on noma cannot be 
understated. 
</p>
<p>38. On an institutional level, attempts to focus on noma have been discouraged by the 
lack of recent data.86 In turn, the lack of focus on noma is precisely what determines the 
low interest in gathering information on the incidence and distribution of acute noma 
worldwide. This vicious circle leads to the situation that the majority of children and other 
individuals with noma are not receiving treatment and are thus neglected. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes, predisposing factors and treatment of noma 
</b></p>
<p>39. Researchers have not identified a specific micro-organism responsible for causing 
noma.87 Despite the lack of certainty in respect to the microbiology and pathophysiology, 
there is a wide consensus among experts that noma results from the interaction between 
several main elements: malnutrition, poor oral hygiene &#8211; itself a consequence of extreme 
poverty, compromised immunity and intraoral infections.88

<p>40. First, malnutrition is considered to be the major predisposing factor for noma.89 
Experts describe malnutrition as &#8220;mandatory&#8221; for noma to appear.90 The absence of noma 
cases in well-nourished African children associated with the occurrence of the illness in 
Nazi concentration camps where malnourishment was rampant strongly supports other 
evidence that malnutrition plays a significant role in the development of this disease.91 In 
the words of Dr. Enwonwu et al, &#8220;the global distribution pattern of the disease reflects the 
worldwide distribution of malnutrition&#8221;.92 
</p>
<p>41. Recent research is inquiring into the relevance of prenatal malnutrition for the 
contraction of noma by children. In several countries where noma has been documented, 
malnutrition is said to commence in utero as a consequence of the poor nutrition of the 
mother, which then results in intrauterine growth retardation and a baby with a low 
birthweight.93 In early postnatal life, and often extending through adolescence into 
adulthood, babies with a low birthweight suffer of chronic malnutrition and have a 
diminished resistance to infections.94 These in turn are key contributing elements to the 
development of noma. Therefore, in the context of preventing noma, tackling malnutrition 
of babies, as well as mothers, is imperative. 
</p>
<p>42. Second, poor oral hygiene is necessary for noma to develop. Experts consider that 
noma is less likely to occur in malnourished children provided that oral care is undertaken 
regularly and thoroughly.95 Preventive oral examinations and providing education to parents 
on good practices in respect to oral hygiene are key interventions to preventing noma in 
malnourished children. 
</p>
<p>43. Third, the weakening of the immune system due to malnutrition and infections, such 
as measles, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, can contribute to the development of noma in 
children.96 
</p>
<p>44. Fourth, research has shown that a high bacterial load of normal micro-organisms 
from the mouth breaks the resistance of a failing immune system.97 The present expert 
consensus is that acute necrotizing gingivitis is a precursor of noma.98 Previously 
<i>Fusobacterium necrophorum</i> and <i>Prevotella intermedia</i> were thought to be key players in 
this process in which components of the normal oral flora become pathogenic,99 but recent 
investigations conducted with more advanced technologies could not identify a specific 
bacteriological agent for noma.100

<p>45. Other important risk factors for the development of noma are unsafe drinking water 
and dehydration, poor sanitation including due to unsanitary housing conditions and close 
proximity to unkempt livestock.101 
</p>
<p>46. Noma can reach its terminal phase in the extremely short timespan of three weeks.102 
WHO identifies four stages of the disease and the treatment of noma differs accordingly. In 
the early stage, when the gingiva is bleeding and has lesions, the onset of noma can be 
treated in a manner which is &#8220;simple, effective, low-cost&#8221;103 with disinfecting mouth rinses 
and daily food with vitamins.104 During the next phase, involving swelling of the face and 
fever, mouth rinses, administration of antibiotics and nutrients supplementation is 
essential.105 These have been shown to prevent progression from the initial ulceration to the 
extensive gangrene, which require emergency care and, in the latter stage, costly 
reconstructive surgery.106 Survivors suffer disfigurement and functional impairment. 
Doctors describe the restriction of the jaw movement and the loss of part of the maxilla, 
mandible or other facial bones as the usual consequences of noma.107 Without 
reconstructive surgery &#8220;[a] child who survives is unlikely ever to be able to speak or eat 
normally again.&#8221;108 
</p>
<p>47. As was noted in a previous section, the death rate associated with noma is very high. 
However, if recognized early and treated correspondingly with oral hygiene, antibiotics and 
nutritious feeding, mortality can drop from 70&#8211;90 per cent to approximately 20 per cent.109 
Hence, early recognition of the clinical signs of this disorder and timely treatment is critical 
for saving the lives of children affected by noma. 
</p>
<p>48. By addressing the predisposing factors to noma, the occurrence of this disorder can 
be lowered; a comprehensive perspective is needed. Therefore, addressing oral hygiene as 
well as chronic and acute malnutrition should be a priority in the fight against noma. 
Vaccination against infections such as measles that weaken the immune system would 
considerably cut the incidence of noma.110 Taking decisive action to improve sanitation and 
access to clean drinking water and adequate housing, and to provide information on oral 
hygiene and on the importance of breastfeeding, while keeping a focus on the vulnerable 
children and their mothers from poor rural areas and slums, are all essential in the fight 
against noma. Overall, the fight against extreme poverty is certainly also a fight against 
noma.

<p><b>affected by the disease 
</b></p>
<p>49. Prompted by reports from several NGOs and some Governments about the 
recrudescence of noma, WHO organized the first information session on noma at the World 
Health Assembly in 1989.111 This was followed, in 1994, by the adoption of a five-point

<p>action programme against noma, which comprised: prevention &#8211; ensuring training and 
awareness on early diagnosis and treatment for each public health structure and raising 
awareness and informing populations, especially mothers; epidemiology and surveillance &#8211; 
finding out the incidence and incorporating noma surveillance into existing epidemiological 
surveillance systems; etiological research &#8211; establishing the causes of noma and why it 
develops in some children but not in others; primary health care -&#8211;including making sure 
that the necessary antiseptics, drugs and nutritional supplements are available; and surgery 
and rehabilitation.112  
</p>
<p>50. In 1998, the WHO Regional Committee for Africa declared the disease a priority on 
the continent.113 Following a decision of the Regional Consultative Committee in 2000, the 
noma programme activities were transferred from the WHO headquarters in Geneva to the 
WHO Regional Office for Africa.114 In 2008, noma was integrated into the list of diseases 
targeted for eradication and elimination in the Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease 
Surveillance and Response in the African Region.115 
</p>
<p>51. This study cannot fully assess the effects of the transfer of responsibilities from the 
WHO Geneva headquarters to the WHO Regional Office for Africa on the fight against 
noma in Africa (see above). What can be clearly ascertained, however, is that, as a 
consequence of the transfer, there is no longer a global overview of the situation of noma. 
The fight against noma is coordinated by the WHO Regional Office for Africa exclusively 
on the African continent. The 1994 five-point action programme against noma and the 
technical guidelines are thus intended for application only in Africa, while children in Asia 
and in other regions are excluded from surveillance, health care, surgery and rehabilitation. 
From a public health perspective, the neglect of Asia and other parts of the world where 
malnutrition rates are disturbingly high and children may be exposed to noma is highly 
problematic. From a human rights point of view, it may amount to a violation of the rights 
of the children at risk or affected by noma. 
</p>
<p>52. In the African region, some progress in the fight against noma has been achieved. In 
this context, it is fundamental to note the crucial importance of the activity developed by 
NGOs, charities and private individuals based in Africa or abroad. These have been the 
driving force of the fight against noma, offering financial, logistical, medical, surgical and 
post-operatory support and assistance, and undertaking etiological research.116 
</p>
<p>53. The Regional Noma Programme of the WHO Regional Office in Africa receives 
long-term funding from the Winds of Hope Foundation &#8211; which initiated the No-Noma 
International Noma Federation gathering over 30 members.117 The programme develops 
noma prevention, early detection and management activities in six West African countries: 
Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, the Niger, Senegal and Togo.118 Other countries in Africa which

<p>are part of the so-called &#8220;noma belt&#8221; and which have high rates of malnutrition are now not 
included in the WHO regional noma programme, however. Reports show that several other 
countries in Africa are placing emphasis on &#8220;severe oral health problems&#8221;, including 
noma.119 
</p>
<p>54. The German foundation Hilfsaktion Noma &#8211; a non-governmental organization that 
works on prevention and treatment of noma and aftercare in the Niger and Guinea-Bissau &#8211; 
inter alia through setting up vaccination centres, noma children houses and hospitals120 &#8211; is 
supporting the WHO Regional Office for Africa in the development of a manual on the 
integrated prevention and the management of main oral diseases, including noma, in the 
African region.121 
</p>
<p>55. A number of NGOs and charities are funding reconstructive surgery on survivors of 
noma in Africa and are increasingly investing in the aftercare of patients in their home 
countries. These include the British foundation Facing Africa which has been financially 
supporting the multiannual trips of teams of volunteer surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses to 
Nigeria and Ethiopia to operate on victims of noma.122 AWD-Stiftung Kinderhilfe from 
Germany and Noma-Hilfe-Schweiz are active in Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, 
respectively.123 Among others, the Dutch Noma Foundation, Interplast France and 
PhysioNoma are involved.124 Sentinelles is carrying out awareness raising and prevention 
work and treatment and has financially supported surgery on children affected by noma in 
Burkina Faso and Niger.125 
</p>
<p>56. The multidisciplinary Geneva Study Group on Noma initiated a large case-control 
study that includes acute cases in children under 12 years from Niger, aiming to identify the 
exact causes of noma and establish a treatment for it.126 Over the last decade, Dr. Enwonwu 
explored the etiopathogenesis of noma and has contributed to a better understanding of the 
potential roles of viruses (noma is seen now as a co-infection with HIV),127 bacteria, 
parasites and close residential proximity to livestock in the genesis of the very destructive 
disease.128

<p><b> D. Discrimination of children affected by noma and neglect of noma itself

<p>to be perceived as a curse, &#8220;coming from the devil&#8221; and, ultimately, shame on the family. 
The social stigma attached to noma pushes families to sometimes hide away or isolate their 
children with animals, instead of seeking health care.129 The chances of these children being 
treated early on and recovering are thus further minimized. Given the high death rate, 
hiding children with noma away virtually gives them a death sentence. If they survive, 
hidden children with noma are also left out from any statistics on the disease. It is thus the 
urgent and imperative human rights obligation of authorities to dispel the myths about 
noma and provide information to health workers and parents on how to identify and treat 
noma. Foremost, the right to life of these children must be protected, in addition to the right 
to adequate and timely health care and to non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>58. Survivors of noma are condemned to a life marred by discrimination. While trying 
to hide away their mutilated face, they are often condemned to a life in poverty, unable &#8211; 
either because of the disease or society &#8211; to access education, a decent work place or 
adequate housing. Victims of noma are similar to victims of leprosy, shunned and rejected 
by their communities.130 Reconstructive surgery would thus be a rare chance for the 
survivors to live without discrimination. Dedicated individuals and NGOs are almost the 
only actors in that field and often perform reconstructive surgery without payment during 
their free time (see next section). Yet many NGOs reported encountering bureaucratic 
hurdles and corruption, which are thus affecting the already poor chances of the most 
vulnerable to a decent life and livelihood.   
</p>
<p>59. The neglect of the noma disease itself has far-reaching consequences. It is a major 
impediment in the context of determining incidence and assuring the surveillance of 
noma.131 To overcome the difficulties of epidemiological surveillance, the WHO Regional 
Office in Africa is planning to work jointly with the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases 
Programme.132 This cooperation may indeed be an indication of a wider acknowledgement 
that noma is a neglected disease and it should, as a consequence, formally be granted the 
status of a neglected disease.    
</p>
<p>60. The neglect of this disease has enormous implications for the needed timely 
treatment to children with acute noma and later reconstructive surgery. For example, Dr. 
Srour argues that only a few doctors in Asia are aware of noma and that probably they 
would not recognize it because it has rarely been described as a disease present on the 
Asian continent.133 Providing information about and training on noma in Asia and beyond 
falls to the responsibility of every State, while the leadership must be assured by WHO. 
Experts in the field have, however, reported that noma is neglected or outright ignored by 
political authorities, which perpetuates the vicious circle of neglect of the disease itself and 
the discrimination of those affected by noma. It would thus not be far-fetched to describe 
children with noma as representing a group of neglected victims.  
</p>
<p>61. Despite having an associate mortality rate comparable to diseases such as multiple 
sclerosis and appendicitis, noma does not appear in the annual WHO global reports.134 
Moreover, noma is not listed among the major killers like malaria, diarrheal diseases, HIV-
infection/AIDS, measles, tuberculosis, and severe chronic malnutrition; however it is a

<p>complication of these diseases.135 The 2010 <i>First WHO Report on Neglected Tropical 
Disease</i> &#8220;<i>Working to Overcome the Global Impact of Neglected Tropical Disease</i>&#8221; also 
omits noma.136 According to Alexander Fieger, this reflects the lack of a good monitoring 
system for noma, and the lack of interest for this affliction from public health policymakers 
both in less privileged countries where noma is prevalent and world institutions like WHO 
and the World Bank.137  
</p>
<p>62. MSF has recently undertaken an investigation into the medical humanitarian issues 
surrounding noma. It concluded that this disease is &#8220;more than neglected, it is ignored and 
is concerned by the low level of awareness, funding and the lack of global oversight. 
Besides ensuring that there is an ongoing high level expertise for the detection and 
treatment of noma in its malnutrition projects, MSF is planning to examine how it can work 
towards the goal that noma gets more recognition as a neglected disease by WHO and other 
global health actors.&#8221;138 
</p>
<p>63. Noma is ignored by Government funding and has escaped the interest of major 
human rights or humanitarian NGOs. Across the board, the actors consulted during the 
drafting process agreed that more needs to be done in the fight against noma &#8211; starting with 
policies aimed at eliminating poverty and reducing malnutrition &#8211; and that States and 
relevant specialized agencies ought to assume responsibility. 
</p>
<p>64. In its statement on the Advisory Committee&#8223;s preliminary study, the Winds of Hope 
Foundation, the main funder of the WHO Regional Noma Programme in Africa, declares: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;A clear statement from the United Nations Human Rights Council would be a 
powerful catalyst to raise awareness among political authorities and other 
international organisations about the fight against this neglected and deadly disease 
of poverty. This would encourage Governments to implement the practical measures 
that could really make a difference.&#8221;139 
</p>
<p>65. In its submission on the preliminary study, WHO expresses its &#8220;hopes that the study 
may help generate increased interest and support from Member States to WHO to address 
noma and to strengthen its mandate in this regard. Such support could help ensure, as is 
recommended in the study, that the program has a global mandate, independent of the 
geographical location it is led from&#8221;.140

<p><b>(a) States </b>&#8211;<b> those with high stunting and wasting rates in children, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>donor States </b>&#8211;<b> should step up their fight against malnutrition;</b>141<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) International assistance earmarked for nutrition should be increased. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such aid should be spent more efficiently and with a human rights framework in 
</b></p>
<p><b>mind, by enabling individuals to feed themselves not by fuelling a dependency cycle; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Policies for the reduction of poverty and malnutrition should prioritize 
</b></p>
<p><b>the most vulnerable groups. Gender discrimination, discrimination of the poor from 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rural areas and slums, exclusion and corruption must be systematically tackled as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a paramount condition for achieving a brighter future for children. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>As the present study has revealed, noma is a neglected disease killing, 
disfiguring, and destroying the lives of children worldwide. It is a disease of extreme 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty, the main predisposing factor of which is malnutrition. The persistence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>noma - the disease of Nazi concentration camps </b>&#8211;<b> </b>in today&#8217;s world raises doubts not 
</p>
<p><b>only about our morality, but proves that the human rights of children, the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable members of the international community are being severely ignored and 
</b></p>
<p><b>violated. States and international organizations should assume responsibility for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>neglected victims of noma. The following is therefore recommended: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The exclusive focus on noma in Africa through the WHO Regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office in Africa is insufficient; therefore noma should be addressed at the global level. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This includes worldwide surveillance, prevention, primary health care, surgical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitation treatment and etiological study. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Government and private funding for the fight against noma in Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be increased and funding and WHO coordination for other regions urgently 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Affected States must establish noma action plans and appoint a noma 
</b></p>
<p><b>focal person. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Modalities to raise awareness about noma among the medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, Government authorities, private donors and public opinion should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>explored. As a means to reach this aim, noma could be formally acknowledged as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>WHO neglected disease. States should promote a resolution at the World Health 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly to list noma as a neglected disease.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Advisory Committee invites the Human Rights Council to 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage States to implement the Human rights principles and guidelines to improve 
</b></p>
<p><b>the protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, specifically at risk of or 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by noma.

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights principles and guidelines to improve the 
protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, 
specifically at risk of or affected by noma</b>142<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Principles 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The rights of the child  
</b></p>
<p>1. Children at risk or affected by malnutrition and noma are entitled on an equal basis 
to other individuals to the rights proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
enshrined in international human rights instruments to which their respective States are 
parties, including in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, as well as to the rights stipulated by customary international law. The well-
being and human rights of children are intrinsically linked to the right of their mothers. The 
full realization of the rights stipulated by Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women is thus paramount for the fulfilment of the rights of women 
and of children, including those at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma. 
</p>
<p>2. States have an international obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of the 
child and of their parents. Authorities at local, regional and national level are bound by 
these obligations. State decisions regarding children should be guided by the principles of 
non-discrimination, adherence to the best interests of the child, the right of children to life, 
survival and development, and the right of children to participate in matters that affect 
them.  
</p>
<p>3. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
inherent right to life. States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival 
and development of the child. 
</p>
<p>4. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
right to food. States shall respect, protect and fulfil the right of the child to have regular and 
permanent access to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food that 
ensures a physical and mental dignified life free of hunger and malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>5. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
right to water and sanitation. States shall respect, protect and fulfil the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation, and thus take steps to realize the physical and economic access to

<p>  
 142 The parallel to leprosy and the findings of the study on severe malnutrition and childhood diseases 
</p>
<p>with children affected by Noma as an example has led the Committee to consider as a model for 
further action the <i>Principles and guidelines for the elimination of discrimination against persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members</i> prepared by Shigeki Sakamoto, adopted by the 
Committee (A/HRC/15/30) and of which the Human Rights Council has taken note with appreciation 
(A/HRC/15/L.18). Special thanks for the input on the earlier draft of the principles and guidelines 
aimed at improving the protection of children at risk or affected by malnutrition, specifically at risk of 
or affected by noma are due to the Government of Canada (submission on A/HRC/AC/7/CRP.2, not 
dated).  </p>


<p>sanitation which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable, provides 
privacy and ensures dignity. 
</p>
<p>6. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the 
treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. The health of the mother is vital in 
preventing malnutrition in children and hence preventing noma. Therefore particular 
attention must be given to the health and nutrition of women, in particular during the pre- 
and post-natal period.  
</p>
<p>7. A mentally or physically disabled child, including as a result of malnutrition and/or 
noma, has the right to enjoy a full and decent life, in conditions, which ensure dignity, 
promote self-reliance and facilitate the child's active participation in the community.  
</p>
<p>8. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
right to adequate housing. States shall respect, protect and fulfil the right to housing by 
ensuring access to secure, affordable, sanitary, culturally adequate shelter and characterized 
by availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure essential for health, 
nutrition and comfort.  
</p>
<p>9. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, has the 
right to education. States shall respect, protect and fulfil the right of children to education, 
which is available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. 
</p>
<p>10. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, and her/his 
parents have the right to seek, receive and impart information. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>11. Every child, including a child at risk/affected by malnutrition and noma, and her/his 
parents have the right to exercise their rights and freedoms without de jure or de facto 
discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status. The prohibition 
on discrimination gives rise to both positive and negative obligations of States. In 
particular, States shall ensure that a child or an adult with sequelae is not discriminated 
against based on her/him being affected by noma.   
</p>
<p><b> C. International cooperation and assistance 
</b></p>
<p>12. States have undertaken to cooperate internationally and to promote and encourage 
international assistance with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights and the rights of the child. This commitment is equally 
to be upheld for the full realization of the rights of children at risk or affected by 
malnutrition or noma. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>13. Acknowledging that the worsening of the world food crisis, which seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, including mothers and children, and 
threatens to further undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, 
States shall urgently take all necessarily measures to diminish child morbidity and mortality 
ensuing from the intersection of malnutrition and childhood diseases, which threaten the 
development and survival of the child. To this end:<b> </b></p>


<p>(a) States should prioritize the budgetary spending on the prevention and 
treatment of malnutrition in children and women. Donor States should sharply<b> </b>increase 
earmarked international assistance for nutrition which respects and promotes human rights 
and does not increase the vulnerability of children and their parents on long-term;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(b) States should establish national strategies for the prevention and treatment of 
chronic and acute malnutrition in children and women. The national strategies should apply 
a human rights framework and thus respect, protect and fulfil the right to food, the right to 
water and sanitation, the right to health, the right to housing, the right to education and the 
right to information of the child and her/his parents and eliminate discrimination patterns in 
particular in relation to women or the poor living in the rural area;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(c) States should establish food insecurity and vulnerability maps and use 
disaggregated data to identify any form of discrimination that may manifest itself in greater 
food insecurity and vulnerability to food insecurity, or in a higher prevalence of 
malnutrition among specific population groups, in particular children, with a view to 
removing and preventing such causes of food insecurity or malnutrition. They should use 
this food insecurity and vulnerability maps in implementing the national strategies for the 
prevention and treatment of chronic and acute malnutrition in children and women;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(d) States should promote a resolution at the World Health Assembly to list 
noma as a neglected disease;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(e) States, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, should take all 
necessary steps to establish the incidence of noma at the global level and assure the 
surveillance of the disease in all affected States by incorporating it into existing 
epidemiological surveillance systems;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(f) All affected States should adopt a noma action plan focusing on the 
elimination of discrimination in all spheres of life of children affected by noma and adults 
with sequelae, on awareness raising and prevention of noma, on primary health care, 
surgery and rehabilitation of children at risk/affected by noma. Inter alia, the following 
priorities should be set:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(i) States should ensure that de jure and de facto discrimination of children 
affected by noma and adults with sequelae is eliminated. Particular attention 
should be given that children with noma are not isolated or hidden away by 
their families or communities, that they have access to sufficient nutritious 
food, to timely and qualitative health care, to education, and that they have 
adequate housing, clean drinking water and sanitary conditions of life; 
</p>
<p>(ii) States should raise awareness about noma through all means, including by 
using media and health workers to inform communities, in particular mothers, 
social and religious leaders with the view to remove the social stigma attached 
to this disease and the discrimination of children affected by noma and adults 
with sequelae; 
</p>
<p>(iii) States should undertake targeted information campaigns through media and 
health workers for mothers, comprising information on breastfeeding, on 
complementary feeding of infants after the age of 6 months, and on improved 
hygiene practices including washing of hands. States should ensure access to 
specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of 
women, including information and advice on family planning; 
</p>
<p>(iv) States should systematically provide information and tackle administratively 
and legislatively cultural food practices, which amount to discrimination 
against women and are detrimental to the nutrition and health of mothers and 
their children; </p>


<p>(v) States should ensure training and education for each public health structure on 
early diagnosis and treatment of noma, including in respect to the crucial 
relevance of malnutrition as a risk factor of noma; 
</p>
<p>(vi) Oral checks during health investigation of infants and children should be 
mandatory in order to identify the first signs of noma, usually acute 
necrotizing gingivitis;  
</p>
<p>(vii) Mouth-rinses, antibiotics and nutritional supplements should be made 
available and free of charge for children with acute necrotizing gingivitis; 
</p>
<p>(viii) States should to the maximum of their available resources ensure access to 
reconstructive surgeries for children and adults with sequelae from noma and 
to rehabilitation and should seek international cooperation and assistance to 
that end; 
</p>
<p>(ix) States should ensure that no bureaucratic barriers or hurdles stemming from 
corruption are preventing the activity of international organizations and NGOs 
related to awareness raising, prevention, primary health surgery and 
rehabilitation in relation to noma; 
</p>
<p>(x) States should promote collaborative programmes involving the Government, 
NGOs and private institutions to raise funds and develop programmes to 
improve the standard of living of children affected by noma and adults with 
sequelae; 
</p>
<p>(xi) States should appoint a noma focal person to liaise with the World Health 
Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, NGOs and other actors 
working on noma. 
</p>
<p>14. States are encouraged to include in their State party reports to the relevant treaty 
bodies, specifically, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, information on the adopted 
noma action plans and on the progress as well as problems encountered during 
implementation.
