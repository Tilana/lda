<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth session from 
22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Japan was held at the 14th  meeting on 31 
October 2012. The delegation of Japan was headed by Hideaki Ueda, Ambassador in 
charge of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At its 17th 
meeting, held on 2 November 2012, the Working Group adopted the report on Japan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Japan: Libya, Peru, and Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review 
of Japan: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/JPN/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/JPN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/JPN/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Spain, Mexico, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia was 
transmitted to Japan through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the 
universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Japan believes that the UPR was a useful mechanism to promote human rights 
through dialogue and cooperation with the international community. 
</p>
<p>6. Japan voluntarily published its follow-up status report in 2011, having given serious 
consideration to the outcomes of its UPR review in 2008. Japan recognizes the important 
role played by the civil society in promoting respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2009, Japan ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance (CPED). Japan recognized the individual communications 
procedures as a noteworthy mechanism for effectively guaranteeing the implementation of 
human rights treaties. Japan would continue to seriously consider whether to accept the 
procedures, while taking into account opinions from various quarters. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government submitted to the Diet the Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction, also known as the Hague Convention, and its domestic 
legislation, in view of its significance for the interests of children. It will continue its efforts 
toward the earliest conclusion of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>9. In September 2012, Japan withdrew its reservation to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) provision that reads &#8220;in particular by the </p>


<p>progressive introduction of free education&#8221; referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
paragraph 2, article 13. 
</p>
<p>10. Japan issued a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council in 2011, and a visit by Special Rapporteur on the right to health was scheduled for 
November. 
</p>
<p>11. The sovereignty of the people and respect for fundamental human rights were 
considered as fundamental principles in the Constitution. Japan has been making 
continuous efforts to improve its domestic human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>12. The Human Rights Organs of the Ministry of Justice are carrying out human rights 
protection activities. In September 2012, the Cabinet adopted a decision confirming the 
content of a bill to establish an independent Human Rights Commission, compliant with the 
Paris Principles, and a bill to partially amend the Human Rights Volunteers Act, in order to 
submit them to the next Diet session. The Government of Japan would make further efforts 
in making necessary preparations for its establishment. 
</p>
<p>13. Japan recognized the merits of the audiovisual recording of interrogations in that it 
facilitated an accurate judgment of whether a confession was made voluntarily. Japan had 
been conducting recordings of suspect interrogations under certain conditions and has been 
gradually expanding its scope, on an experimental basis. Advisory boards of the Minister of 
Justice were currently exploring and deliberating on the structuring of a new and up-to-
date,  broad criminal-justice system, including the institutionalization of its audiovisual 
recording. Japan is hoping to receive a report from its boards as soon as possible and realize 
its institutionalization. 
</p>
<p>14. Japan had a system that guaranteed human rights and appropriate treatment in 
detention facilities. The detention of suspects in police facilities played an important role in 
criminal justice proceedings as it facilitates the efficient conduct of proper investigations. 
The police detention facilities were usually located in areas accessible to the detainee&#8217;s 
family members and lawyers, allowing them easy contact with detainees. The Act on Penal 
Detention Facilities stipulated the principle of the &#8220;separation between investigation and 
detention,&#8221; which clearly states that a police officer working in detention affairs shall not 
</p>
<p>engage in criminal investigations against a detainee. A Committee that functions 
independently from the police, whose members include lawyers, also inspected detention 
facilities. Detainees could further file complaints with the Prefectural Public Safety 
Commission, which exercised administrative supervision over the police. 
</p>
<p>15. Japan&#8217;s basic position on the issue of retention or abolition of the death penalty was 
that this should be examined carefully based on domestic public opinion, the crime 
situation, the criminal policy and other factors. The decision on this issue should be made 
by each country of its own accord. The majority of the Japanese people considered the 
death penalty to be unavoidable in the case of extremely vicious crimes, and there seems to 
be no end to such crimes. Therefore, Japan considered that an immediate abolition of the 
death penalty was not appropriate. 
</p>
<p>16. Japan was working to realize a gender-equal society based on the Third Basic Plan 
for Gender Equality, formulated in 2010, and an Action Plan for Economic Revival through 
Women&#8217;s Active Participation, formulated in 2012. 
</p>
<p>17. Japan had drawn up a new &#8220;Japan&#8217;s 2009 Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in 
Persons&#8221;, through which agencies are working together. The Government compiled in 2011 
guidelines outlining the measures to be taken by the concerned ministries and agencies 
engaged in combating trafficking in persons. Through these efforts, Japan was working to 
identify and protect victims of human trafficking. </p>


<p>18. Japan was carrying out intensive institutional reforms concerning persons with 
disabilities and is moving steadily toward an early conclusion of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Japan had already signed. 
</p>
<p>19. Japan continued its active efforts toward building a rich and cohesive society in 
which Ainu people could live with a sense of pride. In 2008, the Diet adopted a resolution 
calling for the recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous people. Since 2010, the Council for 
Ainu Policy Promotion, with Ainu representation, has been promoting Ainu policies 
comprehensively and effectively. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2009, Japan amended the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act to 
specify that, in cases of deportations, the destination shall not include the countries 
proscribed in the Convention against Torture or in CPED. Further, Japan established an 
expert committee to ensure transparency of treatment and improve management at 
immigration detention facilities. Free legal counselling is also being provided by Attorneys 
to detainees under an agreement with the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. 
</p>
<p>21. Nineteen months had passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake. Japan expressed 
its heartfelt appreciation for the generous assistance extended to it by many countries. Japan 
is committed to alleviating the continuing hardship of affected people and carrying out 
reconstruction projects. 
</p>
<p>22. Japan continued its work for the improvement of its domestic human rights situation 
as well as to contribute to the protection and promotion of human rights at the international 
level, in close cooperation with the United Nations, Governments of other countries, civil 
society and others. 
</p>
<p>23. Japan looked forward to engaging in a constructive exchange of opinions in the 
course of the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>24. Responding to advance questions, Japan referred to the issue of direct and indirect 
discrimination. It noted that article 14 of the Constitution of Japan provides that all people 
are equal under the law. 
</p>
<p>25. Japan indicated that in 2010, it had submitted a resolution to the United Nations 
calling for sufficient attention to the principles and guidelines for the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy, which was unanimously adopted by the 
General Assembly. Japan would continue to support the work of the Goodwill Ambassador 
on the persons affected by leprosy. 
</p>
<p>26. In response to questions on the rights of children born out of wedlock, it noted that 
as long as the birth of a child is notified in accordance with the law and the information is 
correct, children are registered in the family register. There were no discriminatory 
provisions regarding nationality. Under the Civil Code, shares of inheritance for a child 
born out of wedlock are one half of that of a child born in wedlock. This was an attempt to 
respect the status of a child born from the legal spouse while giving consideration for the 
child born out of wedlock. Japan is however continuing to address revising the civil code. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding corporal punishment of children, information had been provided in the 
national report. Corporal punishment at schools and at home is prohibited. Furthermore, the 
civil code was revised in 2011, with a view to preventing child abuse and protecting 
children. Corporal punishment in penal institutions, juvenile training schools and other 
correctional facilities was deemed to be in violation the Constitution and other legislation. 
</p>
<p>28. Japan provided information on human rights education activities offered in the 
schools, as well as on human rights education research promotion projects. 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding efforts to address violence against women, Japan referred to coordinated 
efforts undertaken to enhance support services, including protection actions. </p>


<p>30. On the procedures and treatment of applicants for refugee status, Japan indicated 
that refugee recognition was conducted in a fair and transparent manner, taking due 
consideration to the language, race and sex of the applicants, in particular during the 
interview.  Furthermore, permission to stay in Japan is granted to applicants who were not 
recognized as refugees, when there was a reason for their protection due to the situation in 
their country. In filing objections, decisions are made upon listening to the opinions of 
Refugee Examination Counsellors appointed by the Ministry of Justice, upon the 
recommendation of UNCHR, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations and other 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>31. On the issue of Defense Counsel, Japan indicated that because of the limited means 
to obtain evidence, interrogation of suspects was the most important investigation method 
to bring out the truth. Therefore, Japan noted that the issue of the presence of Defense 
Counsel requires a cautious consideration. Japan also noted there are currently no 
limitations for detainees to access Defense Counsel in police detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>32. Japan reported that a study group on the death penalty, which had been set up by the 
Minister of Justice, published the report in March 2012; it has been subsequently dissolved. 
Japan believes that there should be a broader discussion on this issue. Japan has taken 
seriously the recommendations from treaty bodies regarding the treatment of inmates 
sentenced to death and will also continue its effort to treat them appropriately. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>33. During the interactive dialogue, 79 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>

discrimination towards persons with leprosy, and about measures to ensure the 
independence of the National Human Rights Commission. 
</p>

violence against women. Myanmar also noted Japan&#8217;s bilateral human rights dialogue with 
other countries. Myanmar made recommendations.<b>

It commended the Third Plan for Gender Equality and initiatives to prevent violence against 
women and expand their participation in decision-making processes. Nepal made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. The Netherlands<b> </b>regretted that the issue of &#8220;comfort women&#8221; during the Second 
World War was no longer part of the school curriculum. This eliminated an instrument to 
raise awareness on past atrocities and a discussion of the relevant rights involved. It made 
recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>

Equality. It commended the reforms in the administration of justice, particularly those 
aimed at ensuring fair and transparent interrogation procedures. Nicaragua made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Norway<b> </b>was concerned about Japan&#8217;s continued application of the death penalty, 
widespread use of solitary confinement and incarceration conditions prior to execution, as 
well as by the lack of legislation regarding discrimination. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>41. Pakistan<b> </b>noted Japan&#8217;s measures to address human rights challenges involving the

</b></p>
<p>59. The Government of Japan recognizes that the issue of &#8220;comfort women&#8221; was a grave 
affront to the honour and dignity of a large number of women, and has extended its sincere 
apologies and remorse to all those known as &#8220;comfort women&#8221; who suffered immeasurable 
pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds. 
</p>
<p>60. The issue of reparations, property and claims concerning the Second World War has 
been legally settled with the countries that are parties to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, 
bilateral treaties, agreements and instruments. 
</p>
<p>61. In 1995, the Government of Japan, together with the people of Japan, jointly 
established the Asian Women&#8217;s Fund to facilitate support for former comfort women who 
</p>
<p>had by then reached an advanced age. The Government of Japan has extended its maximum 
support to the activities of the Fund, including health and welfare assistance projects as well 
as the provision of &#8220;atonement money&#8221; to former comfort women. The Government of 
</p>
<p>Japan will continue its utmost efforts to widen further recognition of the earnest feelings of 
the people of Japan as reflected through the activities of the Fund, and will continue to 
follow up on the activities of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the education curricula, Japan indicated that the Courses of Study refers 
to the Second World War, mentioning in the commentary of it that Japan has inflicted 
tremendous losses, especially to those in Asia. Respect for the opposite sex and respect of 
human rights is also part of the Courses of Study. 
</p>
<p>63. Japan indicated that the Basic Act for Persons with Disabilities was revised and the 
General Support for Persons with Disabilities Act was passed by the Diet, and that it 
intends to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as early as 
possible. 
</p>
<p>64. Japan reported that, in 2005, the Diet gave its approval for the ratification of the 
Palermo Protocol but it has not been concluded yet, since the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime needs to be ratified before the Protocol. 
</p>
<p>65. Japan reported that it was also studying the legal implications of the ratification of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>66. In 2010 Japan established comprehensive measures to eliminate child pornography.  
Legislation on sexual exploitation and abuse of children had been enacted, and producing 
and providing child pornography was a crime. The Diet was studying the possibility of 
widening the scope of penalizing child pornography. Among the police, enhanced 
enforcement and filtering  was being promoted.  Internet providers have voluntarily begun 
since April 2011 to adopt measures to block images of child pornography on the Internet. </p>


<p>67. On calls for the introduction of a moratorium of the death penalty, Japan indicated 
that the majority of the Japanese people consider the death penalty to be unavoidable for 
heinous crimes and that, in a constitutional State, the sentence by the court should be 
executed impartially. Japan considers that its introduction is not appropriate. 
</p>
<p>68. On the question of life sentence without parole, Japan noted that there is an opinion 
that such sentence can be crucial because it can cause despair to the inmate as there is no 
chance to reduce the sentence and that it can destroy the personality of the inmate. 
</p>
<p>69. Regarding inmates sentenced to death, Japan believes that confinement in a single 
room all day and night as the law stipulates is not in violation of their human rights.  This 
was done with a view to ensuring emotional stability of inmates. Inmates on death row had  
access to chaplains and voluntary visitors, and the law permitted contact with other inmates 
on death row if necessary and where deemed advantageous. 
</p>
<p>70. Addressing violence against women is an important issue to overcome to form a 
gender equal society. Japan referred to new challenges, such as the Internet and mobile 
phones and indicated that there was close collaboration between the public and the private 
sector in this regard. Japan mentioned that it had distributed a start-up manual for 
supporting victims&#8217; self-efficiency to local governments. Japan is strengthening efforts, 
including through awareness campaigns and activities related to the International Day for 
the Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November. 
</p>
<p>71. Regarding individual communications procedures, Japan reiterated its 
aforementioned position. 
</p>
<p>72. Japan further noted that it had already ratified the CPED. 
</p>
<p>73. Trinidad and Tobago<b> </b>praised Japan&#8217;s commitment following the earthquake there 
and the partnerships developed to achieve the. It applauded the Third Basic Plan for Gender 
Equality. It made recommendations.<b>

achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It encouraged Japan to continue efforts to 
increase its official development assistance (ODA) to the international standard of 0.7 per 
cent. It made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>75. Turkey referred to concerns regarding discrimination and violence towards women, 
despite Japan&#8217;s adoption of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality. Turkey regretted 
</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s continued application of the death penalty. It made recommendations.<b>
