SUPPLEMENTARY DECISION

1.      
Since the delivery of my decision on 14th December, 2011 in this matter it has come to my attention that here has been mathematical miscalculation in the amount of damages awarded as regards to the time period of interest and the rate of interest. At the hearing both parties agreed on the rate of interest and the time period so the error is purely confined to the mathematical calculation of the damages awarded by the court.

2.      
Both parties were informed of this fact and they were heard on this matter upon the request and they have agreed on the amount as stated in the letter of 3rd February, 2010 written by the solicitor of the Defendant. In open court the Plaintiff's solicitor consented to the said amounts on 3rd February, 2012.

3.      
In this action the rate of interest and the duration were all agreed between the parties at the hearing and contained as agreed facts in the pre trial conference minutes.

4.      
In Harrison v Harrison, Willian v Richardson and Ropner v Ropner [1955] 1 Ch 260 English Court of Appeal held that order pronounce by judge, whether in open Court or in chambers, can always be withdrawn, altered or modified by him either on his own initiative or on the application of a party until such time as the order has been drawn up, passed and entered.

5.      
So as to the amounts stated in my judgment on assessment of damages in this case should be read as follows

a.      
General Damages.

Past pain and suffering $30,000.00
Interest on past pain and suffering from 10 November 2008 to
14 December 2011 being 1129 days at the rate of 6% per annum $ 5,567.67
Future pain and suffering $15,000.00


b.      
Special Damages

Past economic loss $ 1,200.00
Interest on past economic loss from 9 November 2005 to 10
November 2008 being 1097 days at the rate of 3% per annum $ 108.19
Special damages $ 675.00

Interest on special damages from 9 November 2005 to 10 November
 2008 being 1097 days at the rate of 6% per annum $ 60.89

c.      
Costs $ 2,000.00

Total payable $54,611.72

Dated at Suva this 14th day of February, 2012.
