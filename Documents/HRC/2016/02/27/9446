<p>*  This report is submitted late in order to include the most up-to-date information. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 in 
which the Council requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the 
fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission 
on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.  On the current issue regarding 
assistance to Sierra Leone in the field of human rights, a comprehensive annual report 
(E/CN.4/2006/106) was submitted to the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human 
Rights pursuant to resolution 2005/76.  The information in the report remains relevant.  The 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights understands decision 2/102 to preserve the 
previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the Council.  
The report accordingly addresses developments regarding the assistance to Sierra Leone in the 
field of human rights over the last year. 
</p>
<p> Sierra Leone continues to enjoy relative peace and political stability even after the 
termination of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone 
(UNAMSIL) on 31 December 2005.  Building on the foundation laid by UNAMSIL and working 
in close collaboration with the United Nations Country Team and international partners, the 
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL), established pursuant to 
Security Council resolution 1620 (2005), has played a major supportive and catalytic role in the 
consolidation of peace in Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p> As reported previously, further considerable progress has been achieved in the area of 
civil and political rights.  Preparations for the 2007 general and presidential elections got under 
way with the constitution of a National Elections Commission and the establishment of the 
Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC).  By the end of 2006, there were 28 registered 
political parties in Sierra Leone operating with considerable level of political tolerance, albeit 
some isolated incidents.  However, the justice system remains weak and requires considerable 
support and intervention to address perennial problems such as lack of access to justice and 
significant delays in trials. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, due in part to the poor performance of the economy, high levels of poverty 
and illiteracy, there has been no significant improvement in the area of economic and social 
rights. 
</p>
<p> Sierra Leone has been selected as one of the first countries to benefit from the newly 
established United Nations Peacebuilding Commission (PBC).  The Government, in 
collaboration with the United Nations, identified four priority areas for support:  (a) youth 
empowerment and employment; (b) strengthening governance; (c) justice and security sector 
reform; and (d) capacity-building and public service delivery. 
</p>
<p> A National Human Rights Commission has been established following sustained 
advocacy and technical support from the United Nations.  The report of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was disseminated nationwide and awareness-raising activities 
on its findings and recommendations have been conducted in all 149 chiefdoms of the country.  
Notwithstanding progress, the implementation of the recommendations has been very slow.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Under intense pressure from the United Nations and civil society organizations, the Government 
designated the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) as the lead government agency 
to administer reparations to address the needs of the victims of the 10-year-old conflict.  A task 
force was also constituted in this regard to coordinate the operational modalities of the 
programme. 
</p>
<p> There has been no significant progress either in the area of women&#8217;s rights.  Cultural and 
traditional practices, discriminatory laws, weak government institutions and enforcement 
mechanisms have continued to seriously hamper the rights of women.  Impunity for 
gender-based violence, in particular domestic violence, remains particularly preoccupying. 
</p>
<p> While the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights remains committed to 
assisting the Government and people of Sierra Leone in addressing considerable human rights 
needs of the country, it is necessary that the Government strengthen its commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.<b> </b>In its resolution 1734 (2006), the Security Council requested the extension of UNIOSIL 
for a further period of 12 months, beginning on 1 January 2007.  The Council mandated 
UNIOSIL, inter alia, to assist the Government of Sierra Leone in implementing the 
recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), developing a national 
plan of action for human rights, and establishing the National Human Rights Commission.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN SIERRA LEONE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The right to life and security of the person 
</b></p>
<p>2. There has been no report of extrajudicial execution, or persistent and pervasive patterns 
of gross human rights violations, except for female genital mutilation, which remains widespread 
throughout the country and to which the Government&#8217;s response is at best ambivalent in that it 
has neither condemned the practice nor has it put in place any legal enforcement mechanism to 
end or curtail it. 
</p>
<p>3. As reported previously, Sierra Leone still maintains the death penalty in its statutory laws 
in spite of the recommendation of the TRC to abolish it (E/CN.4/2006/106, para. 5).  The 
Government led by Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has consistently maintained that it will only resort to 
executions for the most serious crimes, and this was reflected in its White Paper issued in 
response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report.  By the end of 2006, there 
were 22 persons on death row - 21 adult males and 1 adult female. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Political rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. The overall political situation in the country is stable and there is an increasing trend 
towards respect for political rights albeit some isolated violations.  Preparation for the 
2007 elections started unfolding in 2006.  The National Elections Commission (NEC) was 
constituted, the Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) established and over 
28 political parties registered.  However, as the major political parties embarked on 
awareness-raising programmes around the country, a number of isolated cases of harassment, 
intimidation and threats had been initially registered against some political parties and their 
members.  Supporters of the People&#8217;s Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC) and the All 
People&#8217;s Congress (APC) in Nongowa chiefdom, Kenema District and in Mattru Jong, Bonthe 
District, complained of frequent threats and intimidations from supporters of the Sierra Leone 
People&#8217;s Party (SLPP) in general, and chiefs of section in particular, but with the increasing 
presence of officers of National Elections Commission (NEC), the frequency of these incidents 
had decreased by the end of 2006. 
</p>
<p>5. There were also a number of reports of civil unrest such as strikes and riots which, in 
some cases, resulted in death and/or destruction of property.  For instance, on 9 February 2006, 
during a student strike in Port Loko, one student was shot by the local police and died as a result 
of his injuries.  A police station in Mile 91 was burnt down by students, after a clash with the 
police.  On 27 February 2006, the junior and intermediate staff of Port Loko Teachers College 
(PLTC) joined the staff of other institutions nationwide on a strike to request a 40 per cent salary 
increase.  On 9 March 2006, an inter-secondary school competition in Freetown ended in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>violence and the destruction of public properties.  On 26 May 2006, requesting the release of 
colleagues detained by the police for having failed to obey police stop signs, students of 
Waterloo Peninsular Secondary School burnt down the Waterloo Police Post in the Western area. 
</p>
<p>6. Pursuant to an act of Parliament, national administration has been decentralized, local 
district councils established and a number of functions devolved from central government to 
these local councils.  The decentralization of administration continues to facilitate the realization 
of political rights at the community level, including popular participation in local government.  
UNIOSIL field reports indicate that there has been increasing efforts on the part of civil society 
organizations to hold local district councils accountable to the public.  The chairpersons of two 
district councils, Bombali and Tonkolili, were forced out of office under allegations of 
corruption and misappropriation of funds. 
</p>
<p>7. The instrumentalization of the institution of the Paramount Chiefs, established by 
customary law, continues to challenge the democratization process.  It limits the right to contest 
the right of the chieftaincy to rule households and, within households, to oppose patrilineal 
heritage which results into significant numbers of the population being disenfranchised and 
discriminated against.  Since independence, the institution of the chieftaincy in Sierra Leone has 
become increasingly politicized and subjected to interference from central government, as was 
the case with the Biriwa Chieftaincy elections. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government&#8217;s insistence on conducting the Biriwa Chiefdom Paramount Chief 
elections in August 2006, notwithstanding the boycott by the Limbas, who constitute over 
85 per cent of the population, on grounds of irregularities led people to think that the 
Government was using its influence and power to advance the interests of the ruling party to the 
detriment of the rights of some significant segments of the community.  Paramount Chief 
elections are not conducted under statutory laws, but rather under customary law which is 
unwritten, male dominated and discriminatory, and which still coexists with the Constitution and 
statutory laws of the country.  In Biriwa Chiefdom, under customary law, every 20 women 
taxpayers are entitled to designate 1 woman representative to vote in the elections.  Nonetheless, 
the names of the representatives of over 400 women, who had paid their taxes, were deleted from 
the official gazette and hence were not permitted to vote.  This practice leads to the 
marginalization, exclusion and disenfranchisement of women, and works against peace and 
stability.  The situation in Biriwa Chiefdom remains tense.  The Limbas have refused to 
recognize the electoral winner, a Mandigo, as the Paramount Chief, and the situation presents a 
potential for large-scale violence between Limbas and Mandigos. 
</p>
<p>9. A number of Paramount Chiefs are known to use their power in their respective 
chiefdoms to intimidate, harass and threaten opposition parties, and obstruct their activities.  The 
Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIOSIL noted some cases in which Paramount 
Chiefs denied opposition parties access to their chiefdoms.  The TRC in its final report stated 
that &#8220;Chiefs and traditional structures did little more than the bidding of the power base in 
Freetown&#8221; and called upon the Government to &#8220;seriously consider the return of the Chiefs to 
traditional roles and functions and to embark on a national dialogue in this regard&#8221;.<b>1</b>  No concrete

<p><b>1
</b>  See volume II, chapter 2 of the final report of TRC, which is available online at 
</p>
<p>http://trcsierraleone.org/drwebsite/publish/index.shtml. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>actions have been taken by the Government to reform the institution and the role of the 
Government in the Biriwa elections had the propensity to inflame the situation rather than 
resolve existing conflicts.  The Government should seriously consider the recommendations of 
the TRC in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Children</b>&#8217;<b>s rights 
</b></p>
<p>10. Gradual progress was noted in the promotion and protection of children&#8217;s rights.  There 
was an improvement in the enrolment of children in schools, with a rate for girls of 69 per cent 
for primary education.  The Government&#8217;s policy of providing free education for girls attending 
secondary schools in some regions is still in effect.  A child rights bill, drafted to harmonize a 
myriad of statutory provisions which were inconsistent with international standards, in particular 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), has gone through a second reading in 
Parliament and is now set for enactment into law.  Notwithstanding, children continue to be 
subjected to a number of harmful practices affecting their health, education, development, etc.  
Some of the harmful practices are the result of some traditional and cultural practices, others of 
inadequate social services and high levels of poverty and illiteracy. 
</p>
<p>11. The initiation of young girls into secret societies, some forcefully, is a preoccupying 
practice.  In May 2006, a group of women belonging to Bondo society entered a primary school 
in a village in Luawa Chiefdom, Kailahun District, and forcefully took 14 girls to the Bondo 
bush and initiated them through female genital mutilation (FGM), without the consent of their 
parents.  The girls were finally released after spending one month and two days in detention in 
the society bush at the detriment of their health and well-being.  In Bonthe District, a 16-year-old 
girl, forcefully initiated, escaped from the Bondo bush and reported the matter to the police who 
refused to take action.  The Government has to take urgent steps to address the issue of forceful 
initiation of girls, even in case of parental consent. 
</p>
<p>12. Early and forced marriages occasioned by traditional practices and encouraged by 
poverty also continue to prevent the full realization of women and girl&#8217;s rights, including their 
health, education and general well-being.  Child labour is also quite widespread in the country, 
especially in the mining sector, in spite of statutory laws prohibiting the practice.  There is a need 
for effective mechanisms to be put in place, buttressed by awareness-raising activities on child 
rights and the provision of alternatives to child labour to the families.  The policy of the 
Government, which instructs the Ministry of Mines to suspend the licence of mining operators 
who engage children, was not implemented during the period.  Most of the children in the 
mining sector are of school age and work long hours with rudimentary tools. 
</p>
<p>13. The adoption of the Anti-Human Trafficking Act as a renewed commitment to addressing 
child trafficking is a welcomed step.  In 2006, an Inter-Ministerial Committee and National Task 
Force on Human Trafficking, co-chaired by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and 
Children&#8217;s Affairs and the Ministry of Justice were established, as called for by the Anti-Human 
Trafficking Act.  The Government also engaged in consultations with a view to developing a 
National Action Plan for the implementation of the joint Economic Community of Central 
African States/Economic Community of West African States Plan of Action against trafficking 
in persons, especially women and children, over a three-year period, starting in 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. UNICEF has provided assistance to children in a number of areas, including legal 
services through local organizations and addressing the needs of juveniles in some detention 
facilities.  There are only two remand homes and one approved school nationwide for juveniles 
in conflict with the law.  These institutions remain inadequately supported in terms of food, 
medical care, logistics and supplies, and do not respect minimum requirements.  There are still 
no remand homes in the Eastern and Northern provinces and as a result, children are held in 
police stations or detained in prisons until they are transferred to Bo or Freetown.  There is a 
need for a more coordinated approach by the relevant Ministries and responsible government 
institutions, including the police and prison authorities, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the 
Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Women</b>&#8217;<b>s rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. Through consistent advocacy, support and intervention by the United Nations, 
international partners and civil society groups, significant progress has been made in including 
women&#8217;s issues on the national agenda.  However, very little has been achieved in terms of 
actual implementation due to a number of factors including (a) lack of political will; 
(b) existence of entrenched cultural and traditional practices; (c) lack of robust and vibrant 
women&#8217;s groups.  However, one area where significant progress has been noted was the 
submission by the Government of its combined first and fifth periodic reports to the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women with the support of UNIFEM and 
UNIOSIL.  The Government has yet to incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) into its national legislation, although a 
number of nationwide awareness-raising activities were conducted by the Parliamentary 
Committee on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>16. To facilitate the implementation of certain provisions of CEDAW, the Law Reform 
Commission, jointly with the Parliamentary Committee on Human rights, drafted three bills:  
(a) the Domestic violence Act (2006); (b) the Registration of Customary Marriages Act (2006); 
and (c) the Devolution of Property Act (2006).  These bills are still with the Ministry of Justice 
and have yet to be transmitted to the Parliament.  Addressing the issues of gender equity and 
empowerment of women is crucial to the consolidation of peace and the Government of 
Sierra Leone has to take steps to ratify the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of 
Women in Africa and to enact the three draft bills mentioned above, which are consistent with 
the recommendation of the TRC. 
</p>
<p>17. Another key challenge to women&#8217;s basic security and the consolidation of peace is the 
widespread and continuous violence against women, especially in rural areas.  Cases of domestic 
violence, rape and female genital mutilation were reported on a daily basis during the reporting 
period, and very few of those were followed with investigations and redress, a clear indication 
that the rule of law and the enforcement mechanisms in place are not functioning. 
</p>
<p>18. There has been no appreciable reduction in the reported incidence of rape, although some 
attempts have been made to routinely investigate charges and to prosecute perpetrators.  Those 
found guilty have been in some cases sentenced to long prison terms; however, in some others 
the perpetrators have not been brought to justice and in fact benefited from their crime.  For </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>instance in 2006, a 12-year-old girl was raped by the Town Chief of Mano village in Pujehun 
District.  The Chief was not prosecuted and instead the girl was forced to marry him.  The TRC, 
as one of its main recommendations, called for the launch of a national campaign to end the 
practice according to which victims of rape are forced to marry the offender.  The Government 
and civil society organizations should turn this recommendation into concrete action. 
</p>
<p>19. As a result of concerted awareness-raising action and the existence of Family Support 
Units (FSU) within the Sierra Leone police, staffed by female police officers, more women 
mustered the courage to file complaints for domestic violence.  However, the enforcement 
capacity of the FSU to deal with those cases is insufficient.  They are poorly staffed and 
equipped, inadequately trained, and they lack basic logistics and supplies to respond to cases of 
domestic violence and indeed to other sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).  Also noted 
was community pressure to settle cases of SGBV, including the unwillingness of the victims 
themselves (in a number of cases after the initial shock of the violence) to proceed with 
prosecution.  Further, the practice of requiring victims of SGBV to secure medical certificates as 
a condition to prosecution not only imposes a heavy burden on the victims, but also reinforces 
impunity as many perpetrators are not prosecuted due to the inability of the victim to obtain such 
a certificate.  The Government needs to establish a trust fund that will provide free medical 
examinations for victims of rape, domestic violence and other acts of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>20. Women&#8217;s exclusion from decision-making processes in the public and private spheres 
remains a major challenge.  Only 15 per cent of Parliamentarians and 14 and 12 per cent of the 
staff of the Cabinet and the District Councils, respectively, are women.  Women&#8217;s access to 
resources and social justice, as well as their general well-being are still largely restricted and 
women still bear the burden of cultural expectations which limit their role to the private sphere 
of the home.  Women who have entered public or political life are often faced with opposition or 
stigma from family, friends or their community.  With the upcoming 2007 elections, there is a 
greater need for gender sensitivity on the part of the National Elections Commission (NEC), and 
for innovative approaches and focused efforts in several areas including:  (a) registration of 
women voters; (b) provision of education for women; and (c) training for prospective candidates, 
voluntary quotas for party candidates, and gender sensitivity on the part of the National Elections 
Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>21. At the end of December 2006, the residual population of refugees in Sierra Leone under 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) care and support 
from neighbouring countries stood at 27,317 of which 21,702 are residing in 8 UNHCR 
supported camps, and 5,615 in private residences in Freetown, Bo and Kenema.  During several 
visits made to refugee camps by UNIOSIL, it was noted that access to education and health 
facilities were the major problems faced.  The withdrawal of educational assistance by UNHCR 
to students at secondary school levels in July 2006, led to a drop in the number of refugee 
students.  For example, at Taiama Refugee Camp, Kori Chiefdom, Moyamba District, 
214 students were reported to have discontinued their education as a direct consequence of 
this withdrawal.  Voluntary repatriation of Liberian refugees, however, has continued 
with 11,259 Liberians repatriated in 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. In June 2006, a number of Liberian refugees stormed UNHCR headquarters in 
Sierra Leone and damaged properties, in protest for the delay in processing their documents for 
resettlement in a third country.  The police intervened and quelled the situation.  Forty-three 
refugees were consequently arrested and later released on bail, while the case is still in court. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>23. Very little progress was noted in the enjoyment of economic rights.  Massive 
unemployment, in particular of young people, many of whom are former combatants, remains a 
major concern.  Youth empowerment and employment must be addressed as matter of priority so 
as to avoid unravelling the gains that have been achieved through international efforts in 
consolidating peace and stability in the country.  The level of the poverty is alarming with over 
70 per cent of the population living on less than one United States dollar per day.  Low salaries 
in the public sector, coupled with lack of incentives and poor working conditions also continue 
to translate into endemic corruption and low productivity. 
</p>
<p>24. A number of land disputes between neighbouring communities were reported in the 
districts of Tonkolili, Bombali, Kenema, Kambia, Kailahun and Moyamba.  In one incident in 
February 2006, a police vehicle was burnt and several people wounded during a clash between 
the villages of Kobanka and Molanina in Ribbi chiefdom, Moyamba District. 
</p>
<p>25. There has been no significant improvement in the mining sector with respect to 
addressing the human rights needs of those affected by mining operations, especially in 
Kono District.  By the end of 2006, the Koidu Diamond Mining Company had built only 56 of 
the 500 houses it had agreed to build for the relocation of families affected by the blasting 
operations.  Even in the 56 houses completed, complaints were received that some did not meet 
adequate standards. 
</p>
<p>26. Many of the consequences of the conflict, in particular the lack of adequate housing and 
shelter, have not been fully addressed yet.  Thousands of citizens are still living in slums, while 
others are squatting on public lands.  The Government carried out a number of extrajudicial 
demolitions of properties and forced evictions in the Hill Station neighbourhood in Freetown and 
in Hanga Road, Kenema District, which caused enormous suffering and hardship.  These 
demolitions constitute a violation of the rights to adequate housing and to property rights and 
have the potential to cause resentment, increase poverty and hardship.  Consequently, they also 
have the propensity to undermine national unity and reconciliation.  In Freetown, this exercise 
led to the death of a government official who was supervising the exercise; he was reportedly 
abducted and killed by persons believed to be affected property owners.  The Government should 
adhere to the rule of law and address the housing needs of vulnerable populations. 
</p>
<p>27. The availability of basic social services such as safe drinking water as well as affordable 
and accessible health care is a continuing challenge.  The lack of adequate health facilities, the 
shortage of trained and qualified staff and the costs involved in obtaining services have made 
health-care services inaccessible to many.  Infant mortality is still high, estimated at 170 per 
1,000 live births at the close of 2006, compared to 98 in least developed countries and 59 in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>developing countries.  Less than 50 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking 
water. The lack of access to health care has created a window of opportunity for the 
proliferation of quack doctors.  The Government continued the implementation of its policy of 
providing antiretroviral drugs free of charge to persons living with HIV/AIDS, which is to be 
welcomed. 
</p>
<p>28. Even though there was a reported increase in the number of registered pupils, the 
educational system continues to encounter numerous problems; inadequate classrooms, shortage 
of didactic materials and a high drop-out rate of female students due to teenage pregnancy.  
Overcrowded classrooms and the late payment of subsidies by the State were some of the 
pressing issues.  In Bombali District for example, some schools only received subsidies for 
the 2005/2006 school year in August 2006 at the end of the academic year. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  The justice sector 
</b>29. In its final report, the TRC identified the weakness of the justice sector as one of the 
underlying causes of the civil war and advanced a number of recommendations including legal 
and legislative reform.  In 2006 additional magistrates have been recruited, trained and deployed, 
with the support of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  With the exception of 
Pujehun District, each district now has a resident Magistrate.  A new Registry has been 
established in Makeni, Northern Province, which now enables cases for the High Court and 
appeals emanating from the Magistrate Courts to be filed in Makeni instead of Freetown.  
Notwithstanding these developments, delays in trials and prolonged pretrial detentions still 
continue to hinder justice delivery.  The Government should strengthen, in an integrated manner, 
the institutional capacity of justice institutions. 
30. Courts are still largely ill-equipped in resources.  Over 80 per cent of the population has 
access to customary law only, which is largely unwritten, male-dominated and discriminatory 
against, or even harmful to, women and children.  The Justice Sector Development Programme 
(JSDP) sponsored by the Department of Foreign International Development (DFID) launched a 
project with a view to supporting the reform of customary law and its integration into the 
formal legal system.  JSDP also funded mobile sittings of the Magistrate Court in different 
locations in Moyamba District to bring justice closer to the people and to address the problem of 
access to justice or lack thereof.  Government should support such interventions and ensure 
that human rights, in particular the rights of women, are protected under customary law and 
practices. 
</p>
<p>31. The Ministry of Justice remains an obstacle in the transmission of bills drafted by the 
Law Reform Commission.  At the end of 2006, 20 bills drafted by the Commission, including 
the furtherance of the implementation of CEDAW, remained with the Ministry of Justice.  
Parliament in July 2006 passed the Sierra Leone Citizenship (Amendment) Act to amend the 
Sierra Leone Citizenship Act so as to grant the right of dual citizenship and to tap the investment 
potential of Sierra Leoneans who acquire citizenship of another country.  The amendment also 
removed the situation whereby a person cannot obtain citizenship by birth directly from the 
mother, a source of discrimination against women which is contrary to the principles of 
the 1991 Constitution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> II. HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS  
  IN SIERRA LEONE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIOSIL 
</b></p>
<p>32. In its resolution 1620 (2005) the Security Council established UNIOSIL to assist the 
Government in consolidating peace and serve as a catalyst for development.  The mandate of 
UNIOSIL in the area of human rights is well defined:  to assist the Government in 
(a) establishing the National Human Rights Commission, (b) developing a national plan of action 
for human rights, and (c) strengthening the rule of law, including by promoting the independence 
of the judiciary and enhancing the capacity of the police and penal systems.  The Department of 
Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) approved a staff increase of 24, including 10 international 
human rights officers.  OHCHR provided 12 additional posts for national staff so that the 
United Nations is present in each of the 12 districts, and to build national capacity for a seamless 
transfer of responsibility to nationals upon the expiration of the mandate of UNIOSIL. 
</p>
<p>33. OHCHR, in its biannual budget (2006-2007) has also allocated US$ 410,000 for 
technical support, including equipment and logistics, to facilitate the implementation of the 
human rights and rule of law activities of UNIOSIL.  This support, combined with that from 
DPKO, enabled the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIOSIL to carry out a number 
of activities in three core areas:  (a) building national capacity for the promotion and protection 
of human rights; (b) promoting reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law; (c) monitoring 
and reporting on the human rights situation, and implementing technical assistance programmes 
of OHCHR in Sierra Leone.  Acting as the representative of the High Commissioner, the Chief 
of the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIOSIL carried out these activities consistent 
with OHCHR plan of action which called for country engagement and close partnerships with 
relevant stakeholders.  The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section worked in close 
collaboration with the United Nations Country Team, the Government, civil society, and 
international partners using existing national frameworks including the Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (PRS) and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), the 
Peace Consolidation Strategy developed jointly by the United Nations, the Government and civil 
society.  The Section also worked closely with other sections of UNIOSIL, including Peace and 
Governance, United Nations Police, Public Information and the Military.  Additionally, the 
Section served as the implementing partner for some remaining OHCHR funded projects, 
including construction of human rights and law reference libraries and the dissemination of the 
TRC final report and awareness-raising activities on its findings. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Monitoring of the courts, police stations and prisons 
</b></p>
<p>34. At the termination of the mandate of UNAMSIL in 2005, it was determined that assisting 
the Government in supporting the reform of the justice sector could be a major contribution 
to the consolidation of peace.<b>  </b>The mandate of UNIOSIL was therefore expanded to include the 
strengthening of the rule of law by developing the independence and capacity of the judiciary, 
the police and the penal system.  Regular monitoring visits were therefore, made by the Human 
Rights and Rule of Law Section  to courts, police stations and prisons, which regularly brought 
the irregularities observed to the attention of the authorities concerned. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Courts 
</b></p>
<p>35. At the end of 2006, courts were functioning in all 12 districts, albeit with significant 
difficulties.<b> </b> Each district, except Pujehun, had a resident magistrate.  However, no significant 
impact was noted on the backlog of cases, even after the deployment of resident magistrates, due 
to a number of factors including:  (a) delays in processing cases by the administrative staff of the 
courts; (b) inadequate prosecutorial capacity; (c) lack of a public defender system and legal aid 
services.  Low salaries and poor working conditions resulting in low morale also obstructed the 
speedy delivery of services.  These problems were more pronounced in the provinces than in the 
capital city of Freetown. 
</p>
<p>36. Despite the aforesaid, the courts heard a number of high profile cases in 2006 related to 
war crimes.  After nearly six years on the docket, the case of the Revolutionary United Front 
(RUF) and Westside Boys were finally adjudicated, thus bringing domestic trials of cases arising 
out of the civil conflict to an end.  Of the 57 RUF boys indicted, 47 were acquitted and 10 were 
convicted on 15 counts of conspiracy murder and were given a jail term of 10 years on each 
count to be served concurrently.  Of the 32 Westside Boys indicted, 25 were acquitted 
and 7 were convicted on 6 counts of conspiracy and sentenced to prison terms of 10 years on 
each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Police 
</b></p>
<p>37. Training in human rights in administration of justice provided to the Sierra Leone Police 
over the years continue to yield dividends.  An increasing respect for human rights was noted in 
the operations of the police.  However, a number of disturbing incidents involving police officers 
were noted during the year, all of which are still pending in court undetermined. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>38. UNIOSIL concluded a national assessment of prisons in the country, which involved 
visits to all the detention facilities.<b>  </b>Conducted in close collaboration with the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and other stakeholders, this exercise was specifically aimed at assessing the 
living conditions in the facilities and the level of compliance with international standards in 
relation to the treatment of persons in detention.  The exercise revealed that while there have 
been efforts towards adherence to international standards, prison conditions are generally poor, 
requiring a reform of the system.<b>  </b>A final report which will soon be released by UNIOSIL, will 
be recommending a number of reforms, the management of prisons, and the general conditions 
of detention. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>39. At the core of UNIOSIL&#8217;s mandate, is the task of building national capacity for the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  With the assistance of OHCHR, UNIOSIL Human 
Rights and Rule of Law Section conducted a number of training programmes targeting specific 
segments of the Government and the population.  For the mainstreaming of human rights in local 
governance, nine training workshops benefiting over 300 members of district and Town Councils 
were conducted in the area of human rights, democracy and the rule of law to empower civil </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>society organizations, UNIOSIL provided training to over 230 members of human rights 
committees in six districts.  These committees are umbrella grouping of human rights and 
pro-democracy organizations operating at the level of the districts.  In partnership with 
UNIOSIL, they are playing an essential role in monitoring the human rights situation in their 
respective areas as well as sensitizing local communities on human rights. 
</p>
<p>40. UNIOSIL also organized a training workshop for about 30 media practitioners to 
familiarize them with democratic values, human rights standards and basic tenets of the rule of 
law with the view to strengthening their capacity to incorporate these in their reporting.  
Extensive awareness-raising campaigns on the TRC final report were conducted throughout the 
country, to promote reconciliation and healing.  A total of 149 workshops on the findings and 
recommendations of TRC were conducted (one in each of the 149 chiefdoms in the country) in 
close collaboration with district Human Rights Committees.  A summarized version of the TRC 
report was published, used and distributed at these workshops.  Workshops were also organized 
for members of churches and affiliate organizations on the &#8220;Role of religious leaders in the 
implementation of the TRC recommendations and human rights issues&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. A training workshop was organized for local musicians and artists aimed at deepening 
their understanding of the TRC findings and recommendations.  Out of this training, a concrete 
agreement was reached between UNIOSIL and seven recording studios under which they will 
produce musical CDs on the TRC and its recommendations.  By the end of 2006, the production 
of those CDs was still in progress.  Similar arrangements were concluded with local theatre 
groups to produce 30 episodes of radio dramas on certain TRC provisions, including the findings 
and recommendations on children, women, governance, rule of law and human rights.  Musical 
tunes were also produced which are now being played on the United Nations Radio.  These 
activities were intended to deepen public understanding of the causes of the conflict and the way 
forward to prevent its repetition. 
</p>
<p>42. Capacity-building activities included participation in and facilitation of sessions of the 
workshops organized jointly by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees/National 
Commission for Social Action (UNHCR/NacCSA) for government officials and civil society 
organizations on the Refugee Bill of Sierra Leone; presentation on the &#8220;National and Regional 
Human Rights Monitoring and Documentation&#8221; in relation to child soldiers at the workshop 
organized by the West African Network to stop the use of child soldiers under the theme:  
&#8220;Capacity-building programme on human rights, international humanitarian law and human 
security&#8221;.  The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section also participated in trainings on the 
human rights dimension of peacekeeping operations for the Sierra Leone Police, as well as 
presentation at the International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT) Course on 
Mission preparedness for the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF) high officers. 
</p>
<p>43. UNIOSIL Human Rights and Rule of Law Section continued to provide support to the 
human rights work of non-governmental organizations (NGO), including the Human Rights 
Committees in Freetown and in the districts as well as human rights groups in academic 
institutions, including Njala University College and Fourah Bay College.  UNIOSIL Human 
Rights and Rule of Law Section also provided training to the United Nations Country Team to 
reinforce and sustain the capacity to mainstream human rights in their programmes and 
activities.  In this regard, funds have already been secured under the Action 2 Global Programme 
which aims at strengthening human rights-related United Nations actions at country level. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Technical cooperation and advocacy 
</b></p>
<p>44. Under the comprehensive programme of assistance to Sierra Leone of OHCHR, 
UNIOSIL Human Rights and Rule of Law Section, in collaboration with the Sierra Leone 
Library Board (SLLB), established human rights and law reference libraries in Bo, Makeni and 
Kenema.  Bo and Kenema libraries are now completed and ready for use.  The beneficiaries are 
not only human rights groups but also legal practitioners, students and the general public. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 11 December 2006, the Government appointed the members of the Human Rights 
Commission.  Established by Act of Parliament in 2004, the Human Rights Commission of 
Sierra Leone (HRCSL) is mandated to receive and to act on complaints for human rights 
violations; to monitor, to investigate, to document and to report on the human rights situation; 
and to promote awareness of human rights through information and education.  It also has the 
mandate to oversee compliance with treaty obligations, to promote conformity of national laws 
and practices with international standards.  The HRCSL has also been designated as the 
&#8220;Follow-up Committee&#8221; to facilitate and to monitor the implementation of the TRC 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR Office in Geneva had earlier responded to a request for support from the 
Government by contracting a consultant who traveled to Sierra Leone on two occasions and 
provided advisory services with a view to the establishment of the Commission.  With the full 
establishment of the HRCSL, its urgent task, among others, is to formulate a national plan of 
action for the promotion and protection of human rights; OHCHR will continue to provide 
support to the HRCSL in this regard. 
</p>
<p>47. The Commission is still in its inception phase; it has to develop minimum operational 
modalities and to arrange for logistics and other basic needs, and the Commissioners also require 
training.  The beginning is crucial for the future and credibility of the Commission and, 
therefore, it needs the full support and a strong commitment from the Government and the 
international community in this context.  OHCHR welcomes the initiatives of the Government to 
identify support to the Commission as a priority area in the context of the Peacebuilding 
Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The Peacebuilding Commission 
</b></p>
<p>48. Sierra Leone has been selected as one of the first countries to benefit from the newly 
established Peacebuilding Commission (PBC).  The Government, in collaboration with the 
United Nations, identified four priority areas for support:  (a) youth empowerment and 
employment; (b) strengthening governance; (c) justice and security sector reform; and 
(d) capacity-building and public service delivery.  These priority areas were presented by the 
Vice-President of Sierra Leone in New York and approved by the PBC.  Subsequently, concept 
notes covering the four priority areas were developed and submitted to PBC for approval  in 
order to trigger the release of the country envelope. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), was established to create a historical 
record of the conflict, to promote reconciliation and to address the human rights needs of the 
victims.<b>  </b>TRC completed its task and submitted a final report with a number of recommendations 
to the Government to address the root causes of the conflict and to facilitate the consolidation of 
peace.  UNIOSIL Human Rights and Rule of Law Section, with support from OHCHR under its 
technical cooperation project, facilitated nationwide dissemination of the report and 
awareness-raising activities on its findings and recommendations.  As indicated earlier 
UNIOSIL, in collaboration with the District Human Rights Committees, conducted 
awareness-raising activities in all 149 chiefdoms of the country.  Summaries of the report were 
published and several socio-professional groups, such as journalists, churches, NGOs, the police 
and the army, were informed on the findings and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. While there have been some noticeable efforts with a view to implementing the TRC 
recommendations, one particular area of concern remains the reparations programme.<b>  </b>The needs 
of thousands of victims of the conflict, in particular amputees and the war-wounded, including 
victims of rape and other forms of sexual abuse, have to be addressed as quickly as possible.  
Besides the resolution adopted by the Cabinet to provide free medical treatment and other social 
services, the Government has recently designated the National Commission for Social Action 
(NaCSA) as the lead agency for the implementation of the reparations programme, but no 
significant progress has been made.  With the formal establishment of the Human Rights 
Commission of Sierra Leone which will follow-up the TRC recommendations, including the 
reparations programme, it is expected that more action will be taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p>51. In July 2006, in a civil society workshop aimed at exchanging views on PBC and 
identifying the possible role of NGOs in the work of the Commission in Sierra Leone, the 
dissemination and implementation of the TRC recommendations was identified as one of the 
human rights concerns that PBC needs to focus on.  Finally, in December 2006, UNIOSIL 
Human Rights and Rule of Law Section assisted the Government in designing concept notes for 
support towards the implementation of the TRC recommendations under the Peacebuilding 
Fund. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The Special Court for Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Court for Sierra Leone is now in its fifth year of operations.  The trial of 
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Civil Defense Force (CDF) and Armed Forces 
Revolutionary Council (AFRC) indictees charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and 
grave breaches of international humanitarian law, continued throughout 2006.  In February, a 
number of high profile witnesses including Joe Demby, former Vice-President of Sierra Leone, 
Peter Penfold, former British High Commissioner, and British Army General Richards testified.  
By October, the CDF defence team rested their case and oral hearings on the final trial briefs of 
both prosecution and defence were heard on 28 and 29 November.  No definite date was 
scheduled for the final judgement, but it was expected to take place in the early part of 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Yet, by the end of 2006, the Special Court was engaged in discussions with the Government 
of Senegal to have Hinga Norman, leader of CDF, fled to Dakar for medical treatment.  He 
was evacuated to Senegal on 17 January 2007 and passed away on 22 February at Dakar 
hospital. 
</p>
<p>53. On 29 March<b> </b>2006,<b> </b>Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia, was arrested and 
brought under the jurisdiction of the Special Court where he made his first appearance on 
3 April 2006.  He pleaded not guilty to an 11 count indictment for war crimes, crimes against 
humanity and violations of international humanitarian law.  On 20 June 2006, Mr. Taylor was 
flown to The Hague following orders of the Special Court, backed by resolution 1688 (2006) of 
the Security Council and according to the International Criminal Court Memorandum of 
13 April 2006 in which the Court agrees to allow the use of its premises for the detention and 
trial of former President Taylor by the Special Court.  Two status conferences have been held in 
The Hague and June 2007 has been scheduled as a tentative date for the commencement of the 
trial. 
</p>
<p>54. The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council Defence (AFRCD) lost a motion for acquittal 
and started their defence on 28 June 2006.  Testimonies were heard from both prosecution and 
defence witnesses including expert witnesses.  On 7 December, oral presentations were made by 
both the prosecution and defence on the final trial briefs.  No definite date was slated for the final 
judgement. 
</p><p>55. The trial of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) resumed proceedings on 18 July 2006, 
mostly in closed sessions.  Over 100 witnesses were presented and the prosecution have finally 
closed their case when the defence filed a motion for acquittal which was denied by the Trial 
Chamber on 26 October.  Consequently, it was agreed that the RUF defence would start in the 
third week of April 2007. </p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS </b></p>
<p>56.<b> Substantial progress continues to be noted in the promotion and protection of 
human rights in Sierra Leone, especially in the field of civil and political rights.  Progress 
in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, as in many post-conflict countries, 
is slow and continues to pose serious challenges.  From these two perspectives, the 
peacebuilding and development mandate of UNIOSIL has been to provide significant 
assistance to Sierra Leone.  However, the effective consolidation of peace still requires 
addressing the root causes of the conflict as well as the human rights challenges occasioned 
by the conflict. </b></p>
<p>57.<b> In this regard, the need for the Government of Sierra Leone to take ownership of 
and demonstrate political will and financial commitment to interventions in the field of 
human rights is crucial.  However, Sierra Leone still needs international support in 
addressing human rights gaps, especially in relation to economic and social challenges, 
which, if not timely addressed and in a holistic manner, may unravel the successes achieved 
towards the realization of civil and political rights. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>58.<b> Accordingly, the High Commissioner strongly urges the Government of 
Sierra Leone to: </b></p>
<p><b> (a) Collaborate with the international community to strengthen the justice 
system so as to address the perennial problems of access to justice, delays in trials, 
prolonged pretrial detentions and prison conditions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Implement the TRC recommendations, especially the reparations 
programme, with the view to addressing the human rights needs of the victims of the 
conflict and promoting national reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Demonstrate political will and commitment to the operationalization of the 
Human Rights Commission and provide the necessary logistic and financial resources to 
the Commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To request the Ministry of Justice to forward some 20 bills drafted by the 
Law Reform Commission, including the draft bills in furtherance of CEDAW, which the 
Ministry has kept for nearly a year and neglected to submit to Parliament for enactment. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Incorporate CEDAW into national legislation and harmonize national laws 
in conformity with its provisions so as to promote gender equality and empowerment; 
particular attention must be made to the continuous discriminatory practices and 
persistent patterns of sex- and gender-based violence which continue; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Strengthen the enforcement mechanisms currently in place, including the 
Family Support Units and the Courts, to effectively address the increasing incidents of 
rape, domestic violence, and other forms of gender violence that continue to frustrate the 
basic security of women and frustrate their full participation in the political, economic and 
social spheres of the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Establish effective measures to fight corruption, enhance transparency and 
accountability in governance, and embark on effective measures to improve basic services 
especially safe drinking water and health care. 
</b></p>
