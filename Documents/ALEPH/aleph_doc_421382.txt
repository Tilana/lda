Bonavista Energy Trust (“Bonavista” or the “Trust”) is pleased to report to its unitholders (the “Unitholders”) the 
consolidated financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2006.  The results for the first 
quarter  of  2006  represent  eleven  consecutive  quarters  of  profitability  for  Bonavista  since  commencing 
operations  as  an  energy  trust  in  July  2003.    The  continued  successful  execution  of  Bonavista’s  proven 
strategies  in the  first quarter  of 2006  is  a  testament  to  the  validity  and effectiveness of  an  operationally  and 
technically focused energy trust.  The first quarter of 2006 is also highlighted by continued strong commodity 
prices  for  both  oil  and  natural  gas  and  an  increased  selection  of  drilling  and  acquisition  opportunities  for 
Bonavista. This favourable environment creates the opportunity for Bonavista to continue to record strong and 
profitable results, both operationally and financially, for the remainder of 2006 and beyond.   
 
Other significant accomplishments for Bonavista include:
Delivered a total return to its Unitholders of 190%, comprised of a 133% increase in unit price and 
a 57% return from cash distributions, since inception as an energy trust on July 2, 2003.  For the 
twelve months ended March 31, 2006, the total return to investors was 36%, which is in the top 
decile of industry performance.  Bonavista's monthly cash distribution is $0.33 per trust unit, which 
represents a 32% increase in cash distributions since inception as an energy trust.  The monthly 
distribution  is  comprised  of  a  regular  base  distribution  of  $0.28  per  trust  unit,  plus  a 
supplementary  distribution  of  $0.05  per  trust  unit  due  to  the  significant  strength  in  commodity 
prices being realized.  Bonavista’s monthly cash distribution to unitholders currently results in a 
cash on cash yield of approximately 11%; 
Operationally, production volumes were a record 52,654 boe per day during the first quarter of 
2006 as compared to 51,302 boe per day reported in the first quarter of 2005, and represents a 
52% increase over the 34,600 boe per day on commencement as an energy trust on July 2, 2003.  
Our current production rate is approximately 52,800 boe per day; 
Experienced a very productive and successful first quarter, drilling a record level 129 wells with an 
overall 94% success rate;  
Continued to actively participate in acquiring undeveloped land by investing $7.2 million during the 
quarter, further enhancing our undeveloped land position and our future drilling prospect inventory 
to more than two years; 
Invested $101.7 million of capital during the first quarter of 2006, with $96.5 million in exploitation 
and development activities and $5.2 million in six synergistic acquisitions within our core regions;  
Generated  funds  from  operations  of  $127.4 million  ($1.27  per  unit)  and  distributed  63%  to 
Unitholders for the three months ended March 31, 2006, with the remaining funds from operations 
used to reinvest in the business to continue growing our production base; 
Continued to record strong profitable growth in the first quarter of 2006 with average return on 
equity of 27% and a strong net income to funds from operations ratio of 59%; and 
Maintained significant financial flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities in 
2006 and beyond.

Strengths of Bonavista Energy Trust 
Since  restructuring  into  an  energy  trust  in  July  2003,  Bonavista  has  maintained  a  high  level  of  investment 
activity  on  its  asset  base.    This  activity  stems  from  the  operational  and  technical  nature  of  our  trust  and  our 
ability to uncover value from our assets within the Western Canadian Basin.  Our long-standing technical teams 
have a solid understanding of our asset base and possess the necessary discipline to deliver profitable results 
to  our  Unitholders  for  the  long-term.    We  actively  participate  in  undeveloped  land  acquisitions  through  either 
crown  land  sales,  property  purchases  or  farm-in  opportunities,  which  have  continued  to  add  to  our  already 
extensive low-risk drilling inventory.  This has led to low cost reserve additions, lengthening of the reserve life 
index,  and  a  growing  production  base.    Our  production  base  is  weighted  57%  towards  natural  gas,  is 
geographically  focused  within  select  medium  depth,  multi-zone  regions  in  Alberta,  Saskatchewan  and  British 
Columbia  and  has  one  of  the  lowest  operating  cost  structures  in  the  oil  and  natural  gas  sector.    In  addition, 
these high working interest assets are predominantly operated by the Trust, ensuring that operating and capital 
cost efficiencies are maintained.  All of these attributes combined result in top quartile operating netbacks for 
Bonavista. 
 
Our team brings a successful track record of executing low to medium risk development programs, including 
both asset and corporate acquisitions, along with sound financial management.  Unitholders benefit from a fully 
internalized, industry leading cost structure, which results in one of the lowest per unit overhead cost structures 
in the energy trust industry.   The management team, along with a strong Board of Directors possess extensive 
experience in oil and natural gas operations, corporate governance and financial management.  Directors and 
management  also  own  approximately  17%  of  the  Trust,  resulting  in  an  alignment  of  interests  with  all 
Unitholders.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of the financial condition and results of operations should be 
read  in  conjunction  with  Bonavista  Energy  Trust’s  (“Bonavista”  or  the  “Trust”)  consolidated  interim  financial 
statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and the audited consolidated financial statements and 
MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Our audited consolidated financial statements, Annual Report, 
and other disclosure documents for 2005 are available through our filings on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or can 
be obtained from Bonavista’s website at www.bonavistaenergy.com.
Basis  of  Presentation  -  The  financial  data  presented  below  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian  Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The reporting and the measurement currency is the Canadian dollar. For the purpose 
of calculating unit costs, natural gas is converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (“boe”) using six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
equal to one barrel of oil unless otherwise stated. 
Forward-Looking  Statements  –  Certain  information  set  forth  in  this  document,  including  management’s  assessment  of 
Bonavista’s future plans and operations, contains forward-looking statements.  By their nature, forward-looking statements are 
subject  to  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties,  some  of  which  are  beyond  Bonavista’s  control,  including  the  impact  of  general 
economic conditions, industry conditions, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, 
environmental risks, competition from other industry participants, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management, 
stock market volatility and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources.  Readers are cautioned that the 
assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove 
to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.  Bonavista’s actual results, 
performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements or if 
any of them do so, what benefits that Bonavista will derive therefrom.  Bonavista disclaims any intention or obligation to update 
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required 
by law.  Investors are also cautioned that cash-on-cash yield represents a blend of return of investor’s initial investment and a 
return on investors initial investment and is not comparable to traditional yield on debt instruments where investors are entitled to 
full return of the principal amount of debt on maturity in addition to a return on investment through interest payments. 
Non-GAAP Measurements - Within Management’s discussion and analysis, references are made to terms commonly used in 
the oil and gas industry. Management uses funds from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage.  Funds from 
operations as presented does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore it may not be 
comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities.  Funds from operations as presented is not intended to 
represent  operating  cash  flow  or  operating  profits  for  the  period  nor  should  it  be  viewed  as  an  alternative  to  cash  flow  from 
operating activities, net income or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with Canadian GAAP.  All 
references to funds from operations throughout this report are based on cash flow from operating activities before changes in 
non-cash working capital and abandonment expenditures. Funds from operations per unit is calculated based on the weighted 
average number of trust units outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income per unit. Netbacks equal total revenue 
less royalties, transportation and operating expenses calculated on a boe basis. Total boe is calculated by multiplying the daily 
production by the number of days in the period.  Management uses these terms to analyze operating performance and leverage.
Operations -  Bonavista’s  exploitation  and  development  program  in  the  first  three  months of  2006  led  to  the 
drilling of 129 wells in its four core regions, with an overall success rate of 94%.  This program resulted in 102 
natural gas wells,  19 oil wells and 8 dry holes.  Bonavista operated 61 of these wells, with an average working 
interest of 90% in the operated wells.  Operatorship and high working interest ownership remain an integral part 
of our strategy to ensure control over the pace of our activity and control of spending on any given project.  In 
addition to the exploitation and development program, Bonavista executed six complementary acquisitions in its 
core regions during the first three months of 2006. 
Production - As a direct result of Bonavista’s active and successful capital programs, production for the first 
quarter of 2006 increased 3% to a record 52,654 boe per day from 51,302 boe per day for the same period in 
2005.  Natural gas production increased 2% in the first quarter of 2006 to 180 mmcf per day from 177 mmcf per 
day for the same period a year ago, while total oil and liquids production in the first quarter of 2006 increased 
3% to 22,580 bbls per day (comprised of 15,642 bbls per day of light and medium oil and 6,938 bbls per day of 
heavy oil) from 21,865 bbls per day (comprised of 15,576 bbls per day of light and medium oil and 6,289 bbls 
per day of heavy oil) for the same period a year ago.  Our current production is approximately 52,800 boe per 
day consisting of 57% natural gas, 30% light and medium oil and 13% heavy oil.   Bonavista will continue to 
focus on a diversified commodity investment approach to minimize our dependence on any one product.  
Production revenue - Production revenue for the first quarter of 2006 increased by 23% to $230.2 million from 
$187.7 million in the first quarter of 2005.  This increase is attributable to a 3% increase in production volumes 
and  a  20%  increase  in  commodity  prices  on  a  boe  basis.    In  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  natural  gas  prices 
averaged $8.55 per mcf, up 24% from $6.88 per mcf for the same period in 2005.  The average oil and liquids 
price also increased 13% to $44.96 per bbl (comprised of $51.71 per bbl for light and medium oil and $29.75 per 
bbl  for  heavy  oil)  in  the  first  quarter  of  2006  from  $39.85  per  bbl  (comprised  of  $44.84  per  bbl  for  light  and 
medium oil and $27.47 per bbl for heavy oil) for the same period in 2005.   
Commodity  hedging  -  As  part  of  our  financial  management  strategy,  the  Trust  has  adopted  a  disciplined 
commodity-hedging program.  The purpose of the hedging program is to reduce volatility in the financial results, 
protect  acquisition  economics  and  stabilize  cash  flow  and  Unitholder  distributions  against  the  unpredictable 
commodity  price  environment.    At  any  given  period  of  time,  our  hedging  strategy  is  restricted  to  a  maximum 
hedge  position  of  60%  of  forecasted  production,  net  of  royalties,  and  primarily  utilizes  costless  collars  in  our 
hedging portfolio.  This strategy limits our exposure to downturns in commodity prices while allowing for more 
participation in commodity price increases.  For the three months ended March 31, 2006, we incurred a net loss 
of $1.3 million, due to stronger commodity prices realized in excess of our hedge positions.   
Royalties  -  For  the  three  months  ended  March  31, 2006  royalties  increased  25%  from  $38.8  million  to 
$48.5 million primarily as a result of the higher revenues derived from the increases in production volumes and 
commodity  prices  realized.    Royalties  as  a  percentage  of  revenue  for  the  first  quarter  also  increased  from 
20.7%  in  2005  to  21.1%  in  2006,  primarily  as  a  result  of  stronger  commodity  prices.    For  the  three  months 
ended March 31, 2006, royalties as a percentage of revenues by product were 22.7% for natural gas, 20.1% for 
light and medium oil and 12.8% for heavy oil.  In the first quarter of 2005 royalties as a percentage of production 
revenue by product were 22.5% for natural gas, 19.7% for light and medium oil and 12.0% for heavy oil.   
Transportation  costs  -  For  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2006,  transportation  costs  were  $9.4  million 
($1.98 per  boe)  as  compared  to  $7.1  million  ($1.54 per  boe)  for  the  same  period  last  year.    The  increase  in 
transportation costs were primarily due to increasing cost pressures and higher production volumes in the first 
quarter of 2006 versus the same period in 2005.  Transportation costs by product for the first quarter of 2006 
were  $0.41  per  mcf  for  natural  gas,  $0.75  per  bbl  for  light  and  medium  oil  and  $2.72  per  bbl  for  heavy  oil, 
compared to $0.28 per mcf for natural gas, $0.71 per bbl for light and medium oil and $2.88 per bbl for heavy oil 
for the first quarter of 2005. 
Operating expenses - Operating costs for the first quarter of 2006 were $36.1 million, an increase of 21% over 
the  $29.8 million  incurred  for  the  same  period  a  year  ago.    Primarily  driven  by  strong  commodity  prices  and 
record levels of activity, the industry is experiencing a significant pressure on all costs. These factors resulted in 
average per unit operating costs for the three months ended March 31, 2006 increasing to $7.62 per boe from 
$6.46 per boe in the same quarter of 2005. The breakdown of the first quarter 2006 operating costs was $1.09 
per mcf for natural gas, $8.51 per bbl for light and medium oil and $10.20 per bbl for heavy oil, compared to 
$0.88 per mcf for natural gas, $7.73 per bbl for light and medium oil and $8.69 per bbl for heavy oil for the first 
quarter of 2005.   Notwithstanding recent increases, Bonavista continues to place significant emphasis on the 
control of operating costs and maintains one of the lowest cash cost structures in the industry.
General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses, after overhead recoveries, for 
the three months ended March 31, 2006, increased 19% to $2.4 million from $2.0 million in the same period in 
2005.  On a per boe basis, general and administrative expenses increased 16% for the three months ended 
March 31, 2006 to $0.51 per boe from $0.44 per boe in the first quarter of 2005. This increase is largely due to 
the  higher  staffing  levels  required  to  manage  our  larger  operations  and  increasing  cost  pressures,  primarily 
driven  by  strong  commodity  prices  and  record  levels  of  industry  activity.    Through  the  Technical  Services 
Agreement with NuVista Energy Ltd., Bonavista provides administrative services and receives a fee determined 
on a cost recovery basis.  The fee charged under this agreement for the first quarter of 2006 was $480,000, 
compared to $297,000 for the same period a year ago.  In connection with its Trust Unit Incentive Rights Plan, 
Bonavista also recorded a unit-based compensation charge of $1.2 million for the three months ended March 
31, 2006, compared to $594,000 for the same period in 2005.  
Financing  expenses  -  Financing  expenses,  which  include  interest  expense  related  to  bank  debt  and 
convertible debentures, decreased to $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 from $6.0 million 
for the same period in 2005 and on a boe basis decreased to $1.12 for the three months ending March 31, 2006 
from  $1.31 per  boe  in  the  same  period  in  2005.    These  decreases  are  primarily  due  to  lower  interest  on 
convertible debentures resulting from significant conversions into trust units since March 31, 2005.  Amortization 
and  accretion  expenses  related  to  the  Trust’s  convertible  debentures  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31, 
2006  were  $248,000  compared  to  $485,000  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2005.    This  decrease  is 
largely  attributable  to  the  significant  conversions  of  debentures  into  trust  units  since  March  31,  2005.    The 
amortization  component  reflects  the  charge  to  net  income  of  the  debenture  issue  costs  over  the  term  of  the 
debenture.  The fair value of the conversion option of the debentures is classified as equity.  Over the term of 
the debentures, the carrying value will accrete to the principal balance at maturity, with the charge to accretion 
expense on convertible debentures. During the first quarter of 2006, Bonavista paid cash interest of $5.0 million 
compared to $4.7 million in 2005.   
Depreciation, depletion and accretion expenses - Depreciation, depletion and accretion expenses increased 
10% to $51.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006 from $46.7 million in the same period of 2005 
due to higher production levels and a larger asset base in 2006.  For the three months ended March 31, 2006 
the average unit cost increased to $10.85 per boe from $10.11 per boe in the same period of 2005.  These 
increases  are  due  to  the  overall  higher  cost  of  adding  new  reserves,  which  is  a  trend  being  experienced 
throughout the industry.   
Income and other taxes - For the three months ended March 31, 2006, the provision for income and other 
taxes was $250,000 compared to a reduction of $1.4 million for the same period of 2005.  The increase in the 
provision for income and other taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2006 over the same period a year 
ago, was largely due to higher levels of net income generated in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first 
quarter  of  2005.  For  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2006,  Bonavista  paid  capital  tax  installments  of 
$906,000 compared to $603,000 of capital and income taxes for the same period a year ago.  The increase in 
the installments was due to the increase in capital tax base period over period.   
Funds from operations and net income - For the three months ended March 31, 2006, Bonavista experienced 
a 24% increase in funds from operations to $127.4 million ($1.27 per unit, basic) from $102.7 million ($1.09 per 
unit,  basic)  recorded  in  the  same  period  in  2005.    Net  income  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2006, 
increased to $75.4 million ($0.75 per unit, basic), which represents a 31% increase from $57.5 million ($0.61 per 
unit, basic) in the first quarter of 2005.  The increases in both funds from operations and net income in both 
periods were largely attributable to increases in production levels and commodity prices realized.     
Capital expenditures - Capital expenditures for the three month period ended March 31, 2006, were $101.7 
million  consisting  of  $96.5  million  of  exploitation  and  development  spending  and  $5.2  million  of  net  property 
acquisitions.  For the same period in 2005, capital expenditures were $58.0 million, consisting of $51.4 million of 
exploitation and development spending and $6.6 million of net acquisitions.
Liquidity and capital resources - As at March 31, 2006, bank debt, including working capital deficiency, was 
$426.7 million  with  an  attractive  debt  to  annualized  funds  from  operations  ratio  of  0.8:1  (1.0:1  including 
convertible debentures).  With our banking facility of $600 million, Bonavista has $173.3 million of unused bank 
borrowing  capability,  leaving  significant  flexibility  to  finance  future  expansions  in  our  capital  programs  or 
acquisition opportunities as they arise.  
In 2006, Bonavista plans to invest between $280 and $300 million (of which $101.7 million has been spent to 
the end of March 31, 2006) to expand its Core Regions, which will be financed through a combination of funds 
from operations and bank debt.  The Trust is committed to the fundamental principle of maintaining financial 
flexibility  and  the  prudent  use  of  debt.    As  such,  the  2006  capital  expenditure  program  is  based  on  using  a 
conservative amount of debt in our financing structure.
Unitholders’ equity - As at March 31, 2006, Bonavista had 100,863,000 equivalent Trust Units outstanding.  
This includes 12,511,267 Exchangeable Shares, which are exchangeable into 17,535,667 additional Trust Units.  
The  exchange  ratio  in  effect  at  March  31,  2006  for  Exchangeable  Shares  was  1.40159  to  1.    As  at 
May 11, 2006,  Bonavista  had  101,560,390  equivalent  Trust  Units  outstanding.    This  includes  12,467,728 
Exchangeable Shares which are exchangeable into 17,629,617 additional Trust Units.  The exchange ratio in 
effect at May 11, 2006 for Exchangeable Shares was 1.41402 to 1. 
As  a  result  of  minimal  conversions  in  2005  of  Exchangeable  Shares  into  Trust  Units,  Bonavista  elected  to 
redeem 10% of its Exchangeable Shares outstanding on March 16, 2006.  This redemption will allow the Trust 
to  manage  the  dilution  created  by  the  compounding  effect  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares,  maintain  an  optimal 
capital  and  tax  efficient  trust  structure  while  managing  the  reinvestment  of  capital  without  adverse  tax 
consequences to the Trust and its Unitholders.  In connection with this redemption, Bonavista has exercised its 
overriding "redemption call right" to purchase such Exchangeable Shares from holders of record on March 16, 
2006.  Each redeemed Exchangeable Share was exchanged for Trust Units in accordance with the exchange 
ratio in effect at March 15, 2006, rounded to the nearest whole trust unit.   
As at March 31, 2006, Unitholders’ equity included $1.5 million for the ascribed value of the conversion feature 
of convertible debentures.  This amount was determined at the time of issue and subsequently reduced by the 
amounts attributed to debentures that have been converted into Trust Units.  Of the 100,000, 7.5% convertible 
debentures issued on January 29, 2004 there have been 77,937 of these debentures converted to Trust Units, 
leaving  22,063  debentures  with  a  principal  amount  of  $22.1 million  outstanding  at  March  31,  2006.    On 
December 31, 2004, the Trust also issued 135,000, 6.75% convertible debentures in conjunction with a property 
acquisition  in  British  Columbia.    These  debentures  have  a  principal  amount  of  $135 million  and  from  date  of 
issuance  to  March  31, 2006  there  have  been  81,909  of  these  debentures  converted  to  Trust  Units,  leaving 
53,091 debentures outstanding with a principal amount of $53.1 million. 
Distributions - For the three months ended March 31, 2006, the Trust distributed $80.9 million, amounting to 
63% of funds from operations generated during the period, while the remaining 37% of funds was reinvested in 
exploitation, development and acquisition programs.  
Bonavista  announces  its  distribution  policy  on  a  quarterly  basis.    The  amount  of  the  cash  distributions  is 
determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  is  dependent  upon  the  commodity  price  environment,  production 
levels, and the amount of capital expenditures to be financed from funds from operations.  Bonavista’s current 
monthly  distribution  rate  is  $0.33  per  Trust  Unit.    This  monthly  distribution  is  comprised  of  the  regular  base 
distribution of $0.28 per Trust Unit plus a supplementary distribution of $0.05 per Trust Unit due to the significant 
strength in commodity prices currently being realized. The base distribution rate assumes realized commodity 
prices of $8.00 CDN per gj at AECO for natural gas and $58.00 CDN per barrel at Edmonton for light crude (this 
equates to approximately $8.40 US per mmbtu NYMEX natural gas and $50.00 US per barrel WTI crude oil). 
While current natural gas prices are below this level, the current strength in oil prices significantly offsets this 
shortfall.  Our supplementary distribution is anticipated to be maintained while commodity prices remain strong. 
The combined regular base and supplementary cash distribution incorporates the withholding of sufficient cash 
flow to be used for the financing of capital expenditures in order to maintain the current production base and 
provide sustainable distributions in the long-term.    
Quarterly financial information –The following table highlights Bonavista’s performance for the eight quarterly 
periods  ending  on  June  30,  2004  to  March  31,  2006.    For  the  quarterly  periods ending on  June 30,  2004  to 
December 31, 2004, net income has been restated and reduced by the reclassification of debenture interest and 
net income attributable to Exchangeable Shares.  Up to December 31, 2004, the Exchangeable Shares did not 
meet the conditions for equity treatment for these periods under the accounting abstract “Exchangeable Shares 
Issued by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”.  Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the terms of the Exchangeable 
Shares were amended, resulting in the Exchangeable Shares being classified as equity of the Trust:

Since its reorganization into an energy trust on July 2, 2003, Bonavista has experienced growth in production 
volumes in each quarter. Production revenue has increased over the past eight quarters due to the impact of 
increased production levels and the trend of increasing oil and natural gas commodity prices.  Over this period,
production revenue has increased 55% and net income before non-controlling interest related to exchangeable 
shares  has  increased  56%.    In  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  production  revenue  and  net  income  before  non-
controlling interest were lower than the previous two quarters due to the decrease in the price of natural gas.
Multilateral Instrument 52-109, Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings 
Disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by 
the  Trust  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  management  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions 
regarding required disclosure.  Bonavista’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) 
have concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that material information related to the Trust, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known 
to  them  by  others  within  those  entities  during  the  period  in  which  the  interim  filings  have  been  prepared.    It 
should  be  noted  that  while  the  CEO  and  CFO  believe  that  the  Trust’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures 
provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective, they do not expect that the disclosure controls 
and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
OUTLOOK 
The Trust continues to benefit from all the same qualities that drove the success of Bonavista Petroleum Ltd. as 
a public corporation prior to its conversion to an energy trust.  We continue to apply the same proven principles 
and execute our strategy in a disciplined and cost-effective manner.  The foundation of this strategy is to actively 
pursue  low  to  medium  risk  drilling  opportunities  on  the  extensive  undeveloped  land  base  within  our 
geographically  concentrated  areas  of  operations.    Despite  spending  a  record  amount  on  exploitation  and 
development activities in 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 and drilling over 470 wells, our inventory of quality 
drilling opportunities continues to increase in 2006.  This increase in inventory can be directly attributed to the 
detailed  and  tireless  work  of  our  talented  Bonavista  team,  who  possess  the  track  record  and  a  solid 
understanding of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. We also continue to search for strategic acquisition 
opportunities where we can add value utilizing our own technical expertise.  This prudent approach to our capital 
investment  program  has  been  very  effective  in  the  past  and  together  with  our  steadfast  commitment  and 
attention  to  detail,  will  provide  the  foundation  for  the  future  success  of  the  Trust.    Today,  our  efficiency, 
productivity, activity and profitability remain at the highest levels in our eight year history. 
For  2006,  Bonavista’s  preliminary  capital  budget  includes  drilling  approximately  340  to  360  wells  on  existing 
lands in Bonavista’s four Core Regions.  Similar to 2005, these locations generally consist of low to medium risk 
prospects drilled within close proximity of our owned and operated infrastructures.  Assuming a forecasted 15% 
increase  in  industry  service  costs  in  2006,  the  capital  required  to  complete  this  drilling  program  and  our 
complementary  acquisition  program  would  be  in  the  $280  to  $300  million  range  and  should  result  in  modest 
growth in average daily production levels to between 53,000 and 54,000 boe per day in 2006.  
We are proud of our achievements since converting to an energy trust in mid-2003 and are very excited about 
the growing opportunities that exist for Bonavista in the future.  We sincerely appreciate the support of all our 
Unitholders who endorsed our decision to reorganize into the Trust.  We would also like to thank our employees 
for their significant effort and their continued enthusiasm and excitement as we pursue this phase as an energy 
trust.  Our experienced team remains committed to applying the same proven strategies within our efficient trust 
structure, to continue adding unitholder value in the oil and natural gas business for many years to come.

Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 
For the three months ended March 31, 2006 (unaudited)
Bonavista Energy Trust (the “Trust” or “Bonavista”) is an open-ended unincorporated investment trust governed by the laws 
of the Province of Alberta.  The Trust was established on July 2, 2003 under a Plan of Arrangement entered into by the 
Trust, Bonavista Petroleum Ltd. (“BPL”) and its subsidiaries and partnerships and NuVista Energy Ltd.  Under the Plan of 
Arrangement,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Trust  amalgamated  with  BPL  and  became  the  successor  company.   
The  Trust  has  two  significant  subsidiaries  in  which  it  owns  100%  of  the  common  shares  of  BPL  (excluding  the 
exchangeable shares) and 100% of the units of Bonavista Trust (2003).  The activities of these entities are financed through 
interest bearing notes from the Trust and third party debt as described in the notes to the financial statements.  The 
business  of  the  Trust  is  carried  on  through  the  entities  owned  by  the  subsidiaries  of  the  Trust,  Bonavista  Petroleum 
Partnership (“BP”) and Bonavista Petroleum Limited Partnership.  The net income of the Trust is generated from interest on 
notes  advanced  to  its  subsidiaries,  royalty  payments  on  oil  and  gas  assets  owned  by  BP,  as  well  as  any  dividends  or 
distributions paid by its subsidiaries.  The Trustee must declare payable to the Trust Unitholders all of the taxable income of 
the Trust. 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Trust and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and have been 
prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles.    The  interim 
consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended December 31, 2005. The March 31, 2005 financial statements have been restated for the change in accounting 
policy  related  to  exchangeable  shares  -  non-controlling  interest.    Certain  amounts  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to 
current year's presentation.
1.  Asset retirement obligations:
The Trust’s asset retirement obligations result from net ownership interests in oil and natural gas assets including well sites, 
gathering systems and processing facilities. The Trust estimates the total undiscounted amount of expenditures required to 
settle its asset retirement obligations is approximately $424.9 million (2005 - $286.6 million) which will be incurred over the 
next 51 years.  The majority of the costs will be incurred between 2011 and 2036.  A credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 7.5% 
(2005  –  7.5%)  and  an  inflation  rate  of  2%  (2005  –  1.5%)  was  used  to  calculate  the  fair  value  of  the  asset  retirement 
obligations.  
A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligations is provided below:

2.  Long-term debt:
Bonavista has a revolving bank loan facility with a maximum borrowing of $600 million.  All terms and conditions of the 
bank loan facility remain unchanged from December 31, 2005.
3.  Convertible debentures:
The debt component of the debentures has been recorded net of the fair value of the conversion feature and issue costs.  
The fair value of the conversion feature of the debentures in Unitholders’ equity at the date of issue was $4.7 million.  The 
issue costs are amortized to earnings over the term of the obligation and the debt component of the obligation is adjusted 
for the amortization as well as for the portion of issue costs relating to conversions.  The debt portion is accreted over the 
term of the obligation to the principal value on maturity with a corresponding charge to net income.   The following table sets
