<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>24/18. Access to affordable water and sanitation services is crucial for the realization of the 
</p>
<p>human rights to water and sanitation. Where water or sanitation services are available but 
</p>
<p>not affordable, people will not be able to use sufficient amounts of water and adequately 
</p>
<p>maintain latrines, or will turn to cheaper, unsafe sources or practices, or will compromise 
</p>
<p>the realization of other human rights such as food, housing, health or education. However, 
</p>
<p>the issue of affordability does not always receive the attention it deserves. As people will 
</p>
<p>go to great lengths to pay for water to ensure their survival and health, there is often an 
</p>
<p>assumption that people will obtain the water they need even without State support. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, monitoring practices sometimes assume that people have access without 
</p>
<p>considering whether they can actually afford services. The results of this neglect on 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s lives, well-being and human rights are devastating. 
</p>
<p>2. Ensuring affordability is complex and requires different interventions in different 
</p>
<p>contexts. People&#8217;s capacity to pay for water and sanitation differs depending on their socio-
</p>
<p>economic situation, as well as the method of service delivery. States must find ways of 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing affordability, especially for the most disadvantaged individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities, while also ensuring overall sustainability of services. 
</p>
<p>3. This report considers the affordability of water and sanitation at the household level. 
</p>
<p>The State&#8217;s obligations to ensure affordable access to water and sanitation in institutions &#8211; 
</p>
<p>such as schools, health centres and prisons &#8211; or at work and in public spaces is also 
</p>
<p>essential, but is beyond the scope of this report. State obligations in institutional contexts 
</p>
<p>are different and may require direct provision. In any case, affordability should never be a 
</p>
<p>barrier for children, women and men to accessing water and sanitation when they are 
</p>
<p>outside the home. 
</p>
<p>4. From the perspective of human rights, the starting point for State decision-making 
</p>
<p>on public financing and policy for water and sanitation service provision is that water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation must be affordable to all. This differs starkly from the purely economic 
</p>
<p>perspective. The focus in the context of water and sanitation services tends to be on cost 
</p>
<p>recovery, whether full or partial. Economic perspectives and human rights perspectives are 
</p>
<p>not impossible to reconcile, but human rights require ensuring affordable service provision 
</p>
<p>for all, regardless of ability to pay, and economic instruments must be (re-)designed to 
</p>
<p>achieve this objective. 
</p>
<p>5. While the human rights framework does not prescribe the concrete measures for the 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, it does set important parameters. When comparing water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation with the realization of other socio-economic rights, different models of financing 
</p>
<p>become apparent. Some countries use public funding for health care systems, while systems 
</p>
<p>in other countries rely on individual contributions. The realization of the human right to 
</p>
<p>food usually relies on individual sourcing to a significant extent, while the human rights 
</p>
<p>framework requires States to provide assistance to individuals who need it, and States may 
</p>
<p>fix pricing for essential foodstuffs, to ensure that these remain affordable for all. For the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to education, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights specifically requires States to ensure that primary education is free to all 
</p>
<p>and to progressively introduce free education for secondary and higher education, hence 
</p>
<p>relying on public financing for education. The realization of the human rights to water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation is most likely to rely on a mix of sources of financing. From an environmental 
</p>
<p>perspective, charging for the use of water is one means of discouraging wasteful 
</p>
<p>consumption. On the other hand, the public health dimension of water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>suggests a significant role for public financing. Sanitation, in particular, not only affects the </p>


<p>individual&#8217;s right to access a toilet or latrine, but also other people&#8217;s human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the right to health (see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports on sanitation 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/12/24), paras. 23-29, and on wastewater (A/68/264). The State therefore has a 
</p>
<p>significant role to play in ensuring that the necessary funding is available for service 
</p>
<p>provision, and for using public financing where services would otherwise be unaffordable. 
</p>
<p>6. The human rights framework does not, however, rule out tariffs and user 
</p>
<p>contributions for water and sanitation provision. Water and sanitation do not necessarily 
</p>
<p>have to be available free of charge. The human rights framework recognizes that revenues 
</p>
<p>have to be raised in order to ensure universal access to services. If everyone obtained water 
</p>
<p>and sanitation free of charge, that could actually harm low-income households by depriving 
</p>
<p>governments and service providers of the revenue needed to expand and maintain the 
</p>
<p>service, posing a risk to the overall economic sustainability of the system or to the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity to protect and fulfil other human rights. Moreover, where a policy provides free 
</p>
<p>water distributed through utility networks, this tends only to benefit those who have access 
</p>
<p>to a formal water supply. As the majority of poor and marginalized individuals and groups 
</p>
<p>in developing countries do not enjoy access to a formal water supply, they will not be able 
</p>
<p>to access free water provided by utilities. From a human rights perspective, public funds 
</p>
<p>need to be directed towards extension of services for the most disadvantaged and for 
</p>
<p>ensuring that such services are affordable.  
</p>
<p>7. Where people face an inability to pay, the human rights framework indeed requires 
</p>
<p>free services that must be financed through sources other than user contributions. To ensure 
</p>
<p>both affordability and financial sustainability, States must look beyond tariffs toward a 
</p>
<p>broader system for financing water and sanitation services, including taxes and transfers, 
</p>
<p>and cross-subsidization through public finance or tariff systems (see the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s report on financing (A/66/255)). 
</p>
<p>8. The human rights to water and sanitation also have important implications as to how 
</p>
<p>payment for services is raised. Human rights call for safeguards in the process of setting 
</p>
<p>tariffs and determining subsidies, both in procedural and substantive terms, which include 
</p>
<p>the human rights principles of transparency, access to information, participation and 
</p>
<p>accountability. They oblige States to ensure that the cost of accessing water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>is affordable and meets the needs of marginalized and vulnerable individuals and groups. 
</p>
<p>The aim of ensuring financial sustainability at the macro level must never lead to situations 
</p>
<p>in which individuals are unable to afford services. Affordability assessments must consider 
</p>
<p>the totality of rights and the expenses people face to realize their human rights. This is all 
</p>
<p>the more important in the context of austerity measures that have resulted in the significant 
</p>
<p>overall burdening of people.
1
 Particularly during times of economic and financial crises, 
</p>
<p>decisions to introduce or raise tariffs need to be carefully considered. Where price rises 
</p>
<p>happen concurrently with rising unemployment and social spending reductions, they leave 
</p>
<p>many unable to afford essential services.  
</p>
<p>9. Deciding on the most effective system to ensure affordability will often require 
</p>
<p>focused studies that examine all of the above variables, from assessing the types of services 
</p>
<p>to which individuals have access, to considering how public financing can be used most 
</p>
<p>efficiently. In an attempt to improve affordability of service provision in France, as part of 
</p>
<p>the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Protocol on Water and Health, France is

</p>
<p>affordability can best be assured.

</p>
<p>10. Discussions on affordability often focus on tariffs in the context of networked 
</p>
<p>supply. While there are important challenges, this ignores that many people living in 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged areas and within marginalized communities do not benefit from public 
</p>
<p>networks, but rely on on-site or communal, often informal, sanitation and water solutions. It 
</p>
<p>has been estimated that up to 25 per cent of the urban population of Latin America and 
</p>
<p>almost 50 per cent of the urban population in Africa relies on small-scale informal 
</p>
<p>providers to some extent.
3
  
</p>
<p>11. In many instances, these communities pay high prices for low-quality services &#8211; 
</p>
<p>adding another layer of complexity to discussions on affordability. As informal service 
</p>
<p>providers by definition tend not to be regulated for quality or affordability, they charge 
</p>
<p>prices determined by what the market will bear or by price-fixing between providers 
</p>
<p>(including cartel-like structures). For people in disadvantaged communities, paying for 
</p>
<p>formal service provision is often a welcome opportunity to have a more regular and better-
</p>
<p>quality service, often at a lower price. These dimensions need to move centre stage in the 
</p>
<p>discussion on finding solutions for ensuring affordable service provision for all. 
</p>
<p>12. Against this background, the present report presents an overview of the various costs 
</p>
<p>that individuals and households must pay for water, sanitation and hygiene. It seeks to 
</p>
<p>define affordability from the perspective of human rights and discusses the importance of 
</p>
<p>setting concrete standards to determine affordability. It puts affordability in the broader 
</p>
<p>context of ensuring environmental and economic sustainability, and discusses the impact of 
</p>
<p>disconnections as a result of inability to pay. The report discusses who benefits from public 
</p>
<p>financing in current practice, and then considers a variety of different mechanisms to ensure 
</p>
<p>affordability of services for all through public financing and devising appropriate tariff 
</p>
<p>schemes, including their advantages and challenges. Finally, the report discusses the 
</p>
<p>importance of regulating and monitoring affordability before providing conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Costs associated with water, sanitation and hygiene 
</b></p>
<p>13. This section considers the various costs associated with water, sanitation and 
</p>
<p>hygiene, not only direct costs, but also time costs, as well as the additional burdens that 
</p>
<p>corrupt practices and inadequate governance may cause. It concludes by considering the 
</p>
<p>costs of inaction. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Different types of costs  
</b></p>
<p>14. In order to assess and ensure affordability, States need to look into the overall cost 
</p>
<p>of delivering service that can have implications to the user&#8217;s payments. These include not 
</p>
<p>only those regularly occurring costs such as operation and maintenance, but also the entire 
</p>
<p>&#8220;life-cycle&#8221; costs of services, which include construction and rehabilitation (where

</p>

<p>necessary). This life-cycle cost is particularly relevant for sanitation, considering the 
</p>
<p>management of wastes. Once the costs for service delivery have been estimated, a different 
</p>
<p>discussion is how to recover them. This can include a variety of sources, from tariffs to 
</p>
<p>external public financing and, more important to the aim of this report, how to share the 
</p>
<p>revenues from different users. On this last point, affordability needs to be a key 
</p>
<p>consideration in order to avoid excessively compromising the expenses of people living in 
</p>
<p>poverty.  
</p>
<p>15. For water, costs range from construction, operation and maintenance, in the case of 
</p>
<p>networked provision, to costs of construction and maintenance of on-site solutions such as 
</p>
<p>wells or boreholes. Connection charges are often a significant barrier for those living in 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty. Household contributions for water services in rural areas and in informal 
</p>
<p>settlements can differ quite substantially from household contributions for piped water 
</p>
<p>provision. Beyond the option of buying water from public or private suppliers, individuals 
</p>
<p>may need to cover the costs of the construction, operation and maintenance of communal or 
</p>
<p>individual household provision (such as a rainwater cistern
4
), the cost of purchasing 
</p>
<p>containers to store water, and the treatment of water. Even where water is safe at the source, 
</p>
<p>by the time it has been transported and stored for future use, there is a high risk that it will 
</p>
<p>become contaminated, which leads to extra costs for household water treatment. 
</p>
<p>16. In relation to sanitation, associated costs for households range from construction of 
</p>
<p>the toilet within the home and tariffs in the case of networked provision, to costs of on-site 
</p>
<p>solutions such as the construction or maintenance of pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site 
</p>
<p>technologies generally require regular cleaning and maintenance, including the emptying of 
</p>
<p>pits or septic tanks, and the proper management and disposal or re-use of wastewater and 
</p>
<p>excreta. Sanitation systems that require water for flushing, such as sewerage systems, will 
</p>
<p>generally imply extra costs for the water needed for flushing toilets.  
</p>
<p>17. While often overlooked, the use of hygiene facilities and services also has costs. The 
</p>
<p>main expenses, other than installation of a handwashing station, are for water and soap for 
</p>
<p>handwashing and personal hygiene, for water and cleaning products for domestic and food 
</p>
<p>hygiene, and for sanitary napkins or other products for menstrual hygiene management. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition to material costs of service provision, the time spent on collecting water 
</p>
<p>and accessing sanitation facilities outside the home must also be valued. As women and 
</p>
<p>girls are largely responsible for collecting water, maintaining and cleaning sanitation 
</p>
<p>facilities, and for ensuring the hygienic management of the household, these time costs 
</p>
<p>have an important gender equality dimension. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Costs of corruption 
</b></p>
<p>19. Studies have shown that corruption within the water sector is common.5 Even where 
</p>
<p>services are nominally affordable to people, corruption may increase the cost of accessing 
</p>
<p>services above official pricing. There may be a lack of transparency in decisions relating to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>the choice of technology or service provider, which can result in inappropriate &#8211; often more 
</p>
<p>costly &#8211; choices being made. Corruption also affects prices directly when bribes have to be 
</p>
<p>paid for repair work, connection or reconnection. On a larger scale, there can be corruption 
</p>
<p>within tendering processes for the delivery of services. Corruption tends to 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affect poor and disadvantaged individuals and groups, as they lack the 
</p>
<p>necessary power to oppose the vested interests of elites, and do not have the necessary 
</p>
<p>resources to pay bribes.
6
  
</p>
<p>20. Limiting corruption requires focused efforts by States, regulatory bodies and service 
</p>
<p>providers. Introducing a strong legal structure based on human rights can provide for anti-
</p>
<p>corruption measures such as strengthening transparency and accountability mechanisms.
7
 
</p>
<p>For instance, one city in South-east Asia recognized the importance of addressing corrupt 
</p>
<p>practices in order to increase access to water and sanitation for the poor, and instituted 
</p>
<p>specific measures, including focused training for employees, the establishment of public 
</p>
<p>offices so that customers could pay their bills directly rather than going through bill 
</p>
<p>collectors, and the introduction of meters for all connections.
8
  
</p>
<p><b> C. The cost of poor governance  
</b></p>
<p>21. Poorly managed service provision can also have a significant impact on the cost of 
</p>
<p>service provision. States must work to ensure that the right incentives are in place such that 
</p>
<p>providers improve the management of water and sanitation services, including through 
</p>
<p>appropriate organizational structure, optimized running costs, efficient service delivery (e.g. 
</p>
<p>low water losses), among other measures. It also includes strengthening the human rights 
</p>
<p>principles of participation, access to information and accountability in governance 
</p>
<p>structures and decision-making processes.
9
 Further, where the provision of services is 
</p>
<p>intended to provide profits for the provider or shareholders (whether publicly or privately 
</p>
<p>owned), this imperative to extract profits can also increase costs for the user beyond levels 
</p>
<p>of affordability, and prevent the company from reinvesting in the service (see Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s mission report for Brazil (2014), A/HRC/27/55/Add.1, para. 68). 
</p>
<p><b> D. The price of inaction 
</b></p>
<p>22. The costs of ensuring access to water and sanitation may be high. Yet, the price of 
</p>
<p>not investing is even higher. The lack of access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene 
</p>
<p>underlies severe human costs such as poor health and high mortality rates, as well as major 
</p>
<p>economic losses &#8211; globally, an estimated $ 260 billion is lost yearly due to lack of access to 
</p>
<p>sanitation alone.
10
</p>
<p> In developed nations, advances in life expectancy and child mortality 
</p>
<p>accompanied economic growth only after governments began making substantial 
</p>
<p>investments in water supply and, more importantly, sanitation.

<p>23. Studies have shown evidence of a positive cost-benefit ratio. One analysis estimated 
</p>
<p>that for each dollar invested in achieving universal access to basic drinking water at home, 
</p>
<p>the average return is $4. For universal access to basic sanitation at home, the estimated 
</p>
<p>benefit is $3, while the return on eliminating open defecation in rural areas is $6 per dollar 
</p>
<p>spent.
12
</p>
<p> The safe management and treatment of wastewater has received less attention in 
</p>
<p>cost-benefit analyses. While requiring large initial investments, in the long term the price of 
</p>
<p>inaction is far greater than the cost of ensuring adequate wastewater management. Studies 
</p>
<p>on the economic returns of sanitation interventions show that both septic tanks with 
</p>
<p>treatment as well as sewerage networks with treatment have a positive cost-benefit ratio, for 
</p>
<p>instance about 1:4 in the Philippines
13
</p>
<p> and about 1:3 in Vietnam.

</p>

<p>intangible benefits related to time saved, dignity gained and diseases and deaths prevented. 
</p>
<p>The particularly positive impact for women and girls of investing in water and sanitation is 
</p>
<p>crucial for achieving gender equality. Environmental benefits are also significant, given that 
</p>
<p>improving water and sanitation services helps combat contamination and environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Understanding affordability 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Defining affordability and setting standards 
</b></p>
<p>25. Affordability, as a human rights criterion, requires that the use of water, sanitation 
</p>
<p>and hygiene facilities and services is accessible at a price that is affordable to all people. 
</p>
<p>Paying for these services must not limit people&#8217;s capacity to acquire other basic goods and 
</p>
<p>services guaranteed by human rights, such as food, housing, health, clothing and education. 
</p>
<p>Affordability standards must be considered together with standards of an adequate quantity 
</p>
<p>and quality of water and sanitation to ensure that human rights standards are met. 
</p>
<p>26. Affordability provisions in water and sanitation laws are quite common. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in Namibia, the Water Resources Management Act requires ensuring &#8220;that all 
</p>
<p>Namibians are provided with an affordable and a reliable water supply that is adequate for 
</p>
<p>basic human needs&#8221;.15 In many instances, the challenge is to translate general provisions 
</p>
<p>into concrete affordability standards. Such standards are essential to ensure that tariffs are 
</p>
<p>set in a way that is affordable to people and to ensure accountability. Generally, people are 
</p>
<p>prepared to pay a high price for water because it is essential for so many aspects of a 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s life, but this does not justify a high affordability threshold. Willingness-to-pay 
</p>
<p>studies therefore often deliver limited results in terms of people&#8217;s actual capacity to pay.  
</p>
<p>27. A number of countries have set standards for affordability. For instance, a regulation 
</p>
<p>in Indonesia explains that &#8220;Tariff shall meet the principle of affordability... if domestic 
</p>
<p>expense on the fulfilment of the standard of basic need for drinking water does not exceed 
</p>

<p>4% (four per cent) of the income of subscribers&#8221;.16 For some households, however, even a 
</p>
<p>small proportion of their expenditure will be too much, and water and sanitation must be 
</p>
<p>available for free in these instances. 
</p>
<p>28. It is impossible to set a generally applicable affordability standard at the global 
</p>
<p>level. Any such standard would be arbitrary and cannot reflect the challenges people face in 
</p>
<p>practice and the context in which they live, including how much they need to spend on 
</p>
<p>housing, food and the realization of other human rights. The affordability of water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation services is highly contextual, and States should therefore determine affordability 
</p>
<p>standards at the national and/or local level. The human rights framework stipulates 
</p>
<p>important parameters for the process of doing so, in particular in terms of participation.
17
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Reconciling affordability with environmental and economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>29. When seeking to ensure affordability in practice, measures to implement human 
</p>
<p>rights often need to be reconciled with broader considerations of ensuring environmental 
</p>
<p>and economic sustainability. &#8220;Social sustainability&#8221; in the form of affordable access must 
</p>
<p>not be jeopardized in favour of measures that aim to secure economic and environmental 
</p>
<p>sustainability. To be environmentally sustainable, there must be sufficient water resources 
</p>
<p>of good quality available to serve existing and future users. Water tariffs should be 
</p>
<p>designed to allow for access to sufficient water for essential purposes but, where necessary, 
</p>
<p>to limit use for luxuries. Water resources must be protected from pollution, which means 
</p>
<p>that sanitation services must include appropriate collection, transport, treatment and 
</p>
<p>disposal of wastewater to protect both public health and the environment. However, 
</p>
<p>sanitation tariffs must not be so high that people avoid using the service, which could put a 
</p>
<p>strain on public health. 
</p>
<p>30. To ensure economic sustainability, some have argued for full cost recovery through 
</p>
<p>tariffs, i.e. for water and sanitation service providers to charge full operational costs (and in 
</p>
<p>some cases also construction and rehabilitation) to existing and future users. Where there 
</p>
<p>are sufficient numbers of well-off people compared to those who are unable to pay the full 
</p>
<p>cost of a service, full-cost recovery may be possible, with some cross-subsidization 
</p>
<p>between the former and the latter. However, even in countries with a relatively well-off 
</p>
<p>population, for sanitation services in particular, governments frequently provide significant 
</p>
<p>amounts of public funding in order to make the service financially viable and to protect 
</p>
<p>public health.
18
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>31. In many developing countries, there are insufficient numbers of people who are 
</p>
<p>well-off to provide a cross-subsidy. In these situations, full cost recovery only through 
</p>
<p>tariffs will not be a feasible option. Public finance may be needed in such instances to 
</p>
<p>ensure affordability for all households. To make such financing available and achieve 
</p>
<p>affordability for all, as a first step States should make better use of budgets already 
</p>
<p>allocated for water and sanitation, specifically to reduce inequalities in access to services.

<p><b> C. Disconnections as a result of unaffordable services 
</b></p>
<p>32. The affordability of water and sanitation services and disconnections are 
</p>
<p>inextricably linked, as in many instances the failure to pay for services leads to 
</p>
<p>disconnection. 
</p>
<p>33. Disconnection of services due to an inability to pay for the service is a retrogressive 
</p>
<p>measure and constitutes a violation of the human rights to water and sanitation (Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 15 (2002) 
</p>
<p>(E/C.12/2002/11), para. 44a). Disconnections are only permissible if it can be shown that 
</p>
<p>households are able to pay but are not paying. The South African 1997 Water Services Act 
</p>
<p>states that disconnections may not result in a lack of access to services for non-payment 
</p>
<p>where the individual is unable to pay for basic services.
19
</p>
<p> More recently, France adopted 
</p>
<p>the Brottes Law, which prohibits disconnections for inability to pay.
20
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>34. In some instances, disconnections have taken place on a large scale. For instance, 
</p>
<p>the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department has been disconnecting water services with no 
</p>
<p>consideration of whether people are able to pay or not. This led the former Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to state, &#8220;when there is genuine inability to pay, human rights simply forbids 
</p>
<p>disconnections&#8221;, and to demand the residents&#8217; immediate reconnection.21  
</p>
<p>35. Pre-paid water meters are suggested as an option for service providers to ensure that 
</p>
<p>households and individuals pay for the water that they use, as they require payment in 
</p>
<p>advance.
22
</p>
<p> This may lead to &#8220;silent disconnections&#8221; due to lack of ability to pay, and can be 
</p>
<p>a violation of the human rights to water and sanitation. Therefore, plans to use pre-paid 
</p>
<p>meters must be carefully examined before they are installed. Some pre-paid water meters 
</p>
<p>will allow for access to a limited quantity of water even where the individual or household 
</p>
<p>has not paid. The quantity, continuity and quality of water would need to be carefully 
</p>
<p>assessed for human rights compliance.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Mechanisms for ensuring affordability in practice 
</b></p>
<p>36. To ensure affordability for all and a sustainable system, States must develop 
</p>
<p>appropriate pricing, tariff and subsidy structures. In the following section, the report 
</p>
<p>explores how public financing is allocated, and who is likely to benefit from this. The 
</p>
<p>report then seeks to discuss how financing mechanisms can be used to effectively target 
</p>
<p>those groups who rely on these mechanisms to ensure the affordability of services.

<p><b> A. Public finance for water, sanitation and hygiene: Who benefits and who 
</b></p>
<p><b>does not? 
</b></p>
<p>37. Almost all large-scale water and sanitation systems receive some level of public 
</p>
<p>financing. For sanitation in particular, while it has long been known that the costs of not 
</p>
<p>having access far exceed the actual cost of providing access, it has been hoped that private 
</p>
<p>sector participation would be sufficient to improve access to sanitation. However, more 
</p>
<p>recently, research by the World Bank and others is beginning to show that it is unrealistic 
</p>
<p>for the private sector to fill the service gap alone.
23
</p>
<p> States must be the driving force in 
</p>
<p>investments in sanitation, in particular to cover the costs of constructing and maintaining 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, and in some cases also for operation, for example where pit-emptying is 
</p>
<p>prohibitively expensive.  
</p>
<p>38. In many instances, however, public financing is unequally distributed. Middle-class 
</p>
<p>households often benefit from subsidies, both direct subsidies and &#8220;hidden&#8221; subsidies. 
</p>
<p>Direct subsidies include tax breaks or financial incentives for constructing a toilet, which, 
</p>
<p>when poorly targeted tend to benefit middle-income families. Subsidies are &#8220;hidden&#8221; when 
</p>
<p>public financing is used to construct infrastructure and services that are intended to be used 
</p>
<p>by all, but in fact are only available to middle- and high-income households.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Public finance for networked provision 
</b></p>
<p>39. Public finance is very common in large-scale piped water and sewerage systems, 
</p>
<p>with governments (and other funders, such as multilateral and bilateral donors) investing 
</p>
<p>significantly in networks, water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants and trunk 
</p>
<p>sewers. Provided that all households within a city are able to connect to use these services, 
</p>
<p>this may be an efficient approach to ensuring that public finances are used well for water 
</p>
<p>and sanitation service provision, even if it also results in subsidizing service provision for 
</p>
<p>those who would not need such support to ensure affordability. 
</p>
<p>40. In the majority of developing countries, piped water and sewerage systems are 
</p>
<p>accessible only to a minority of those living in urban areas &#8211; and to very few of those living 
</p>
<p>in rural areas.
24
</p>
<p> Focusing public finance on networked provision thus disproportionately 
</p>
<p>benefits comparatively better-off households, unless specific action is taken to extend 
</p>
<p>networked provision to all residents. 
</p>
<p>41. Public finance may also be provided for the maintenance and extension of water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation services and facilities, including for connection charges. Where extensions are 
</p>
<p>expected to reach all households, they can be an appropriate form of providing support to 
</p>
<p>low-income households, as they will ensure more affordable and regular charges for water 
</p>
<p>and sanitation than charges of informal provision.

<p><b> 2. Communities in informal settlements 
</b></p>
<p>42. Residents of informal settlements often do not enjoy formal service provision, 
</p>
<p>receiving their services from a range of different, often informal and/or small-scale 
</p>
<p>providers or through self-supply. For water services, this can include water kiosks, water 
</p>
<p>vendors that come to a user&#8217;s home, as well as piped water delivered to the household. For 
</p>
<p>sanitation, there is an even larger range of types of service, from no service at all through 
</p>
<p>substandard pit latrines (seldom emptied and often overflowing) to shared or community-
</p>
<p>level toilets, to connections to a rudimentary sewage system, where wastes are not treated, 
</p>
<p>to small-scale sewage systems with adequate treatment plants. Given this range of services 
</p>
<p>that exists outside the formal system, any pricing, subsidy or tariff system can seem 
</p>
<p>irrelevant to an often substantial part of the population. In many cities, tariff structures, 
</p>
<p>subsidy systems or other special measures are only accessible for households with a formal 
</p>
<p>address or to a registered household or individual.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Communities relying on self-supply 
</b></p>
<p>43. Local governments often lack the capacity to support sustainable access to water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation services, in particular in rural areas. As a result, donors and local governments 
</p>
<p>have often turned to promoting community management approaches. Unfortunately, there 
</p>
<p>continues to be a high rate of failure under community management. One study estimated 
</p>
<p>that an average of 30 per cent of rural hand pumps in sub-Saharan Africa are not working, 
</p>
<p>with the figure rising to as high as 65 per cent in some countries.
25
</p>
<p> Explanations for these 
</p>
<p>situations include a lack of local technical skills, management capacity, spare parts, or 
</p>
<p>funds to pay for the necessary repairs. Further, as people are understandably unwilling to 
</p>
<p>pay for services that are unreliable, there is inadequate funding for repairs. Institutional 
</p>
<p>reform, developing communities&#8217; capacity, and increased financial and human resources 
</p>
<p>are therefore required to realize the human rights to water and sanitation in rural areas.
26
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>44. On the other hand, significant inroads have been made through Community-Led 
</p>
<p>Total Sanitation in expanding access to sanitation. Recognizing that improving sanitation 
</p>
<p>relies to a large extent on practicing safe and hygienic sanitation, the approach focuses on 
</p>
<p>mobilizing communities to analyse and improve the situation with regard to open 
</p>
<p>defecation.
27
</p>
<p> Community-Led Total Sanitation is in principle opposed to the provision of 
</p>
<p>subsidies based on the premise that subsidized sanitation often does not align with people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>preferences and that such solutions have often been unsustainable by creating a culture of 
</p>
<p>dependency.
28
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>45. The approach, or its implementation in particular cases, has encountered some 
</p>
<p>criticism from the perspective of human rights,
29
</p>
<p> including concerns about the affordability 
</p>
<p>of adequate sanitation for the most disadvantaged due to the lack of subsidies. Without 
</p>
<p>external support, people living in extreme poverty may only be able to build very basic

<p>latrines and do not always have the means to afford maintenance and improvements.
30
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Some variants of Community-Led Total Sanitation are open to using external subsidies for 
</p>
<p>the most disadvantaged in communities. Some suggest a sequencing approach to the use of 
</p>
<p>public finance. While the initial investments in hardware are expected to be made by the 
</p>
<p>community, public finance should be used in the long term to create the enabling 
</p>
<p>environment for sustainable sanitation and ensuring public health, for instance for 
</p>
<p>maintenance and pit emptying, or through public health interventions that promote 
</p>
<p>sanitation and good hygiene practices.
31
</p>
<p> Some schemes have provided microfinance for the 
</p>
<p>construction of latrines, which is then paid off over a two- or three-year time frame. This 
</p>
<p>can be an effective way of spreading the cost, but affordability concerns will remain for the 
</p>
<p>poorest households. 
</p>
<p>46. More generally, Community-Led Total Sanitation encourages community support 
</p>
<p>and assistance from better-off households to people living in greater poverty. Yet many 
</p>
<p>communities are not a coherent whole; there are entrenched power asymmetries and 
</p>
<p>inequalities. People not only experience different levels of poverty and deprivation, but 
</p>
<p>may be marginalized on grounds of ethnicity, caste or other factors. There may be instances 
</p>
<p>where community support is not forthcoming. In other instances, people may feel that they 
</p>
<p>have to rely on the charitable benevolence of others rather than feel entitled to the 
</p>
<p>realization of their right to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>47. In such instances, as in other contexts of self-supply, the human rights framework 
</p>
<p>stresses that States have an obligation to support people in the realization of their human 
</p>
<p>right to water and sanitation, where needed with financial assistance. States may not 
</p>
<p>absolve themselves of their human rights obligations by relegating responsibilities to 
</p>
<p>communities.
32
</p>
<p> What must be ensured is that sanitation and water services are affordable to 
</p>
<p>even the most disadvantaged member of a community. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring that public financing benefits the most disadvantaged 
</b></p>
<p>48. The current reality is that public financing for water and sanitation largely benefits 
</p>
<p>better-off parts of society. Public finance is largely used for large-scale infrastructure in 
</p>
<p>urban areas, which is enjoyed predominantly by middle- and high-income households. 
</p>
<p>49. The first step to ensuring that public financing is targeted toward the most 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged is to acknowledge the inherent inequalities and biases in the current 
</p>
<p>distribution of public financing. On that basis, States must adopt measures to reach the 
</p>
<p>people who rely on public finance to ensure the affordability of water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>services for all and to reduce inequalities in access. States need to reallocate resources to 
</p>
<p>the most disadvantaged. Reallocating current public resources may mean extending access 
</p>
<p>for all to citywide systems in urban areas or shifting from high-cost interventions that serve

</p>
<p>particularly those who most need assistance.
33 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>50. One option is seeking to develop truly universal systems that include everyone. Any 
</p>
<p>such universal system for distributing public finance would include people who do not need 
</p>
<p>such funding to access services. This raises questions in terms of the most appropriate use 
</p>
<p>of available resources. Yet this needs to be carefully balanced against the risk of being 
</p>
<p>under-inclusive and leaving out parts of populations that do rely on subsidies to ensure the 
</p>
<p>affordability of services. Any type of targeting risks not reaching the people who are most 
</p>
<p>in need. As a general principle, from the perspective of human rights, unintended exclusion 
</p>
<p>is far more serious than unintended inclusion. 
</p>
<p>51. Research suggests that some governments have succeeded in effectively using 
</p>
<p>public funding for increasing access to sanitation. For instance, Thailand achieved nearly 
</p>
<p>universal access to sanitation in the late 1990s due to sustained funding over decades based 
</p>
<p>on a comprehensive programme. The Government has provided subsidies through 
</p>
<p>revolving funds as well as funding for specific activities, with villages having flexibility in 
</p>
<p>allocating funds to those most in need.
34
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. Recent projects in Dar es Salaam (United Republic of Tanzania), Blantyre (Malawi), 
</p>
<p>Chinhoyi (Zimbabwe) and Kitwe (Zambia) driven by slum or shack dweller federations 
</p>
<p>seek to develop citywide sanitation provision in situations where households can only 
</p>
<p>afford $3-$4 per month. They look into choices for low-income households, loan financing 
</p>
<p>and the crucial role of engagement with local authorities from the outset.
35
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>53. Where States choose to adopt universal systems for subsidizing service provision, 
</p>
<p>they need to ensure that these are truly universal rather than reaching only as far as 
</p>
<p>networked provision does. Financing for universal access, and indeed the universal 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, does not necessarily require one universal system. On the 
</p>
<p>contrary, in many countries it will mean additional approaches that are targeted to reach 
</p>
<p>people beyond utility networks. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges in targeting 
</b></p>
<p>54. Where States adopt targeted measures, this also poses challenges. In practice, 
</p>
<p>unfortunately, such measures often fail to reach the target population for a variety of 
</p>
<p>reasons, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Target groups are not informed of the availability of subsidies or financial 
</p>
<p>support; 
</p>
<p>(b) There is excessive paperwork or a requirement for specific pieces of 
</p>
<p>documentation that low-income or marginalized people may not have; 
</p>
<p>(c) The target groups are not involved in the design of the mechanism;

<p>(d) In most countries where subsidies are applied through tariff systems, these 
</p>
<p>are only available to people connected to networks, thus excluding those who rely on 
</p>
<p>kiosks, standpipes or public toilets; 
</p>
<p>(e) Often, due to an increasing block tariff structure, consumption subsidies do 
</p>
<p>not benefit large families or multiple households sharing one water connection; 
</p>
<p>(f) Public financing is available only to those who have secure land tenure, thus 
</p>
<p>excluding those living outside the formal legal system; 
</p>
<p>(g) Those who are responsible for allocating public funding engage in corrupt 
</p>
<p>practices; 
</p>
<p>(h) Those who are connected to water supply services but not to sewerage 
</p>
<p>networks are often disadvantaged by cross-subsidies between water and sanitation services. 
</p>
<p>This subsidy results in persons who have a water connection but no sewerage connection 
</p>
<p>subsidizing better-off people or households that have such a connection; 
</p>
<p>(i) In many instances, subsidies for water are targeted towards commercial or 
</p>
<p>industrial users. Where such subsidies benefit users that do not actually rely on them for 
</p>
<p>their livelihoods, they should be eliminated or reduced to free up resources for the benefit 
</p>
<p>of the population in need. 
</p>
<p>55. In all cases, it is critical that any sort of public financing is transparent, clearly 
</p>
<p>explained and widely promoted to ensure that those entitled to it receive it, to reduce the 
</p>
<p>scope of corruption, and to analyse whether the mechanism has been effective.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Subsidies based on income, geographic location and types of access 
</b></p>
<p>56. In different contexts, different mechanisms have been used with the aim of targeting 
</p>
<p>financial support at those individuals and groups who rely on it to ensure the affordability 
</p>
<p>of services. Subsidies could apply to low-income households, to areas populated 
</p>
<p>predominantly by low-income communities, or to small-scale services likely to be used by 
</p>
<p>those living in poverty or on a low-income. 
</p>
<p>57. Targeted subsidies can be provided at the household level based on income. In many 
</p>
<p>cultures, however, there is significant stigma attached to the receipt of subsidies, in 
</p>
<p>particular where the application for the subsidy becomes publicly known. In a country in 
</p>
<p>Africa, for example, there are subsidies available for a range of social services, but many 
</p>
<p>people choose not to register even where they are eligible reportedly due to the stigma 
</p>
<p>attached. One way to overcome such stigmatization would be to adopt ways of distributing 
</p>
<p>subsidies that do not publicly expose people. Beyond this, however, broader cultural 
</p>
<p>changes are needed in the perception of subsidies to overcome the often internalized shame 
</p>
<p>and stigma of relying on public subsidies. 
</p>
<p>58. Targeting schemes that are based on levels of household income or expenditure may 
</p>
<p>be costly, requiring administratively labour-intensive surveys to assess who is eligible, 
</p>
<p>except when this is available information for other administrative needs such as taxes. 
</p>
<p>Targeting is especially difficult where there is a large informal economy. More generally, 
</p>
<p>such targeting is often imprecise. Even sophisticated social security systems can exclude 
</p>
<p>significant numbers of the poorest residents, particularly those living in rural areas, where it 
</p>
<p>may be difficult to keep people informed of their entitlements.  
</p>
<p>59. In some cases, household income or expenditure data is not available. In such cases, 
</p>
<p>other indicators such as the type of access (for example, whether a small-scale facility is 
</p>
<p>used), property value, size of the residence or geographical location can be used to evaluate 
</p>
<p>the economic capacity of users.  </p>


<p>60. While being easier and cheaper to administer, they have the drawback of not always 
</p>
<p>being able to differentiate between people living in poverty, who may be able to pay a small 
</p>
<p>amount, and people living in extreme poverty, who cannot afford to pay more than a 
</p>
<p>nominal sum or anything at all. In many instances, it may be useful to utilize a mixture of 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. For example, a comparison of schemes of subsidies in Chile (based on 
</p>
<p>household means) and in Colombia (based on categories of socio-economic status and 
</p>
<p>socio-geographic context) suggests that means-tested subsidies are more effective at 
</p>
<p>identifying poor households than geographically targeted schemes.
36
</p>
<p> For example, it may 
</p>
<p>be beneficial to provide subsidies automatically in low-income areas, but to permit people 
</p>
<p>outside such areas to apply for subsidies on the basis of their low income. Moreover, where 
</p>
<p>an income supplement is provided, households that are not connected to a network, 
</p>
<p>including those living in rural areas, could also be eligible. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Social protection floors 
</b></p>
<p>61. A broader mechanism for achieving access to water and sanitation services for 
</p>
<p>people living in poverty is to put in place &#8220;social protection floors&#8221;. These are nationally 
</p>
<p>defined basic social security guarantees that ensure access to essential services, including 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation, as well as providing basic income security to those in need.
37
</p>
<p> Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolution 28/12 of 9 April 2015 acknowledged &#8220;that social protection 
</p>
<p>floors may facilitate the enjoyment of human rights&#8230; safe drinking water and sanitation, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the human rights obligations of States&#8221; and encouraged &#8220;States to put in 
</p>
<p>place social protection floors as part of comprehensive social protection systems&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/RES/28/12, paras. 6 and 8). Social protection floors can be particularly relevant 
</p>
<p>for achieving gender equality and protecting marginalized or disadvantaged individuals and 
</p>
<p>groups. At the national level, for instance, Cambodia has made support for sanitation and 
</p>
<p>water in times of emergency and crisis a key intervention under the National Social 
</p>
<p>Protection Strategy for the Poor and Vulnerable.
38
</p>
<p> In Mexico, the federal budget for social 
</p>
<p>spending, which contributes to building a social protection floor, includes water supply and 
</p>
<p>sewerage.
39
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> F. Ensuring affordability through tariff schemes  
</b></p>
<p>62. Other types of mechanisms to ensure the affordability of services can be built into 
</p>
<p>tariff schemes. Different tariff systems have different potentials but also limitations to 
</p>
<p>ensure the affordability of services. These are generally only relevant to those connected to 
</p>
<p>piped water and sewerage systems.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Flat rate 
</b></p>
<p>63. Flat rates are commonly used where meters are not installed, where a charge based 
</p>
<p>on a certain volume of water used or sewage discharged would be impossible to implement. 
</p>
<p>Some countries use property taxes as the basis for charging unrelated to consumption. 
</p>
<p>Differentiated flat rates could be used that rise or fall depending on such criteria as 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>household size, income and property value, among others, with care taken that marginalized 
</p>
<p>and vulnerable individuals and groups are not being charged an unaffordable rate.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Uniform volumetric tariff 
</b></p>
<p>64. Uniform tariff approaches depend on a metered system, where households pay a 
</p>
<p>fixed rate for each unit that they use. Such systems will generally be cheaper to administer 
</p>
<p>than a differentiated system. However, they do not take account of households&#8217; size or 
</p>
<p>ability to pay, or whether a household has particular needs that will require more water, 
</p>
<p>such as dialysis or other health needs. They will almost invariably lead to better-off 
</p>
<p>households having access to more water or paying lower bills than poorer residents. Where 
</p>
<p>poorer households access larger quantities of water to meet their requirements, services 
</p>
<p>may become unaffordable without additional safeguards. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Differential pricing 
</b></p>
<p>65. Differentiated tariffs, which intend to provide a lower tariff targeted at poorer 
</p>
<p>households or communities, may be more complex to administer but may help to ensure 
</p>
<p>affordability even for disadvantaged households. Yet, difficulties remain in ensuring that 
</p>
<p>they actually reach the target groups. In the United States, several municipalities have 
</p>
<p>adopted differential pricing with the aim of higher-income households subsidizing lower-
</p>
<p>income households. Recently, the Philadelphia City Council passed legislation to establish 
</p>
<p>a low-income programme to ensure that water bills are affordable in relation to income. To 
</p>
<p>ensure that residents are aware of the programme, the bill places an affirmative obligation 
</p>
<p>on the city to refer them to the programme. 
</p>
<p>66. Increasing block tariffs is a common model for differential pricing in which 
</p>
<p>differing quantities of water (or sewage) are charged at different rates. The first &#8220;block&#8221; 
</p>
<p>may be set at a &#8220;lifeline&#8221; tariff &#8211; a sufficient quantity for the average household &#8211; at a low 
</p>
<p>rate, generally below the cost of providing the service. Once this first &#8220;block&#8221; has been 
</p>
<p>used, there is an increase in price so that households using water beyond their basic 
</p>
<p>domestic and personal needs will pay comparatively more.  
</p>
<p>67. To ensure affordability for all households, it is imperative that the blocks are set 
</p>
<p>appropriately. If the first block is too small, or the tariff is too high, poor families will not 
</p>
<p>be able to afford to buy sufficient quantities of water. However, if the first block is too 
</p>
<p>large, or the tariff too low, then people who do not actually need the lowest rate will 
</p>
<p>benefit, which may put the overall financial sustainability of the system at risk. 
</p>
<p>68. One problem with this system is that often poorer households have more household 
</p>
<p>members or share their connection with other households, and will therefore reach the 
</p>
<p>maximum quantity for the &#8220;lifeline&#8221; tariff, and be forced to pay a higher rate, as is the case 
</p>
<p>in Jordan (see Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, mission to Jordan (A/HRC/27/55/Add.2), para. 
</p>
<p>24). In Portugal, the regulator has therefore proposed that municipalities and providers 
</p>
<p>ensure a particular tariff for people living in larger households,
40
</p>
<p> as has Los Angeles.

<p>69. A particular model, which can be part of increasing block tariffs, involves the 
</p>
<p>provision of a first block free of charge. Cities and countries such as South Africa with the 
</p>
<p>Free Basic Water Policy, some Colombian cities and the minimum provided by the Delhi 
</p>
<p>Jal Board are examples of such policies. Still, the same challenges remain in terms of 
</p>
<p>setting the amount of free water at the right volume to ensure the overall financial 
</p>
<p>sustainability of the system. The key challenge is that households connected to the formal 
</p>
<p>network are likely to benefit more from such policies than households relying on informal 
</p>
<p>service provision. Even where utilities or municipal authorities provide for additional water 
</p>
<p>services through truck deliveries in informal areas, huge disparities in terms of the quantity 
</p>
<p>and accessibility of water remain. 
</p>
<p>70. Differential pricing can also be used for different sectors, for instance using higher 
</p>
<p>tariffs for industrial, commercial and public users to cross-subsidize residential users. In 
</p>
<p>practice, however, such cross-subsidization is often discouraged and agricultural and 
</p>
<p>industrial water use may be highly subsidized. Where such public financing is not 
</p>
<p>necessary to secure livelihoods and is not directly related to the realization of human rights, 
</p>
<p>existing pricing and subsidy policies should be revised to use the maximum amount of 
</p>
<p>available resources for the realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Connection charges 
</b></p>
<p>71. Charges to a household to connect to a service can be a barrier to gain access to an 
</p>
<p>existing networked service. Some countries have decided to remove these charges for all or 
</p>
<p>some households in order to reduce the barriers. The costs of extending the services are 
</p>
<p>then financed by incorporating them into standard service charges. Historically, many 
</p>
<p>countries have used surcharges on existing users to finance the extension of the network in 
</p>
<p>rural areas. Removing the connection charge is particularly relevant for low-income 
</p>
<p>households to gain access to a sewerage network, as the connection charge is often a 
</p>
<p>significant barrier to affordable sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>72. In determining mechanisms for allocating public financing and setting tariffs, 
</p>
<p>participation, access to information and an active role in decision-making are essential. 
</p>
<p>Such decisions translate into the prioritization of resource allocation. Most important from 
</p>
<p>the perspective of human rights is that such participation includes the most marginalized 
</p>
<p>and disadvantaged individuals and groups to ensure that measures are taken that actually 
</p>
<p>reach the ones most in need of public financing. This relates to decisions at the national 
</p>
<p>level concerning overall resource allocation as well as decisions at the local level, including 
</p>
<p>on the prioritization between different parts of a municipality to ensure citywide service 
</p>
<p>provision, including in informal settlements. 
</p>
<p>73. At a broader level, communities have used participatory wealth rankings as a way of 
</p>
<p>assessing poverty to determine how to target measures within their communities. 
</p>
<p>Determining relative poverty in a community allows for targeting on that basis. Such 
</p>
<p>participatory processes can provide detailed insights on local poverty and often include 
</p>
<p>access to water as an indicator in the analysis.

<p>74. Participatory budgeting is increasingly common in municipalities across the world, 
</p>
<p>enabling residents to agree on the budget priorities of local government. Such processes 
</p>
<p>have often contributed to improving basic service provision, including water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation.
43
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> V. Regulation and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>75. The discussion on ensuring affordability has repeatedly pointed out the crucial role 
</p>
<p>of regulation and monitoring. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Regulating service provision for affordability 
</b></p>
<p>76. Ensuring the affordability of water and sanitation services requires an effective legal 
</p>
<p>and policy framework, which includes a strong regulatory system. The International Water 
</p>
<p>Association Lisbon Charter recognizes the importance of regulation, recommending that 
</p>
<p>regulators &#8220;supervise tariff schemes to ensure they are fair, sustainable and fit for purpose; 
</p>
<p>promoting efficiency and affordability&#8221;.44 
</p>
<p>77. Once a tariff system that meets affordability standards has been developed, the body 
</p>
<p>responsible for regulating service providers should be able to ensure both that the tariff 
</p>
<p>system is correctly applied, and that it is having the desired impact on affordability levels 
</p>
<p>for all users. Likewise, a regulatory body, in collaboration with the relevant government 
</p>
<p>department, can ensure that public financing is adequately targeted. Complaints 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, put into place by service providers or regulators, can support these processes.  
</p>
<p>78. Particular challenges arise for regulation in the context of small-scale and informal 
</p>
<p>provision, as governments often do not have any control over the operation of these 
</p>
<p>providers. Governments may formalize the informal sector while keeping the small-scale 
</p>
<p>nature of the provision through effective regulation, such that the small-scale providers 
</p>
<p>serve as contractors to the government. This is the strategy that is being initiated in Nairobi, 
</p>
<p>Kenya, where water kiosks in informal settlements are supplied by and registered with the 
</p>
<p>utility, and the tariff is fixed by the regulatory body. However, this tariff is not always 
</p>
<p>complied with.
45
</p>
<p> Where households rely on informal service provision, governments should 
</p>
<p>also provide support in terms of management and technical support to increase the quality 
</p>
<p>and affordability of their services. A similar approach is taken in Maputo, Mozambique, 
</p>
<p>where the regulator supports informal service provision in the absence of the capacity of the 
</p>
<p>utility, in the short-to-medium term, to deliver services to all residents.
46
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>79. Above all, regulation of informal and small-scale service provision should assist in 
</p>
<p>increasing access to water and sanitation for poor and marginalized households, and not

<p>hinder such access. Formalization and regulation of informal service provision must pay 
</p>
<p>due attention to the impact of this process on levels of access, affordability and quality of 
</p>
<p>service provision. Where States seek to replace informal service provision with formal 
</p>
<p>providers, they must ensure that people can actually afford these alternatives and do not 
</p>
<p>experience retrogression in the realization of their human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Monitoring affordability 
</b></p>
<p>80. Monitoring affordability is essential for assessing whether standards are being met, 
</p>
<p>and whether people in fact have access to affordable services. Unless efforts are made to 
</p>
<p>monitor whether services are affordable for all, States and service providers alike will 
</p>
<p>struggle to provide appropriate support to individuals and households that may have 
</p>
<p>difficulties in paying for services.  
</p>
<p>81. However, monitoring affordability is not a straightforward process. Accurate and 
</p>
<p>meaningful monitoring of affordability is extremely complex. If carried out on the basis of 
</p>
<p>an affordability standard, the necessary parameters for calculating affordability &#8211; the 
</p>
<p>expenses for accessing water and sanitation in comparison to overall household 
</p>
<p>expenditure, and the real income of a household &#8211; are difficult to measure. Monitoring 
</p>
<p>whether a household&#8217;s expenditure on water and sanitation exceeds a specific proportion of 
</p>
<p>its income in a specific context is not easily done, given the precarious incomes of many 
</p>
<p>low-income households, and the many different types of expenses for water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>services in informal settlements, where affordability concerns are most acute. Given these 
</p>
<p>difficulties, States often use an &#8220;average&#8221; or a &#8220;lowest&#8221; income level, and an assumed 
</p>
<p>acceptable volume of water to set appropriate service charges. However, such 
</p>
<p>generalizations hide whether individuals can actually afford services in their particular 
</p>
<p>context, which may involve a large household, or individuals with specific health problems. 
</p>
<p>82. Other approaches to monitoring affordability take a different starting point. Rather 
</p>
<p>than relying on an absolute affordability threshold, they look at the impact that the cost of 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation services has on the enjoyment of other human rights. Human rights 
</p>
<p>monitoring can greatly contribute to qualitative, more contextualized monitoring. For 
</p>
<p>instance, treaty bodies can provide details on the impact of the lack of affordability on 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s lives, including through disconnections, the challenges people face, and the inter-
</p>
<p>linkages with the realization of other human rights. 
</p>
<p>83. The ECE Protocol on Water and Health has developed an Equitable Access 
</p>
<p>Scorecard, which assists States to monitor whether services are affordable. This scorecard 
</p>
<p>looks beyond the affordability of tariffs to other measures that Member States may employ 
</p>
<p>to ensure affordability. This includes monitoring the inclusion of affordability concerns in 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation policy, the affordability of self-provision, whether public funding is 
</p>
<p>made available to address affordability concerns, how much public funding has actually 
</p>
<p>been spent on affordability concerns, and whether social protection measures are effective 
</p>
<p>in ensuring affordability.

</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>84. In terms of global monitoring, there are heightened challenges due to data gathering 
</p>
<p>and comparability. The proposed goal 6.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals explicitly 
</p>
<p>refers to achieving affordable drinking water for all, hence calling for including the 
</p>
<p>criterion of affordability in global monitoring.

<p>85. For households that receive water and sanitation through utilities, data is available 
</p>
<p>through the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities, which 
</p>
<p>includes data on water tariffs charged by a significant number of utilities.
48
</p>
<p> Beyond such 
</p>
<p>existing initiatives, a review of potential indicators demonstrates the complexity of 
</p>
<p>monitoring affordability.
49
</p>
<p> Determining and monitoring the costs of non-networked supply 
</p>
<p>and including them into measures of affordability is particularly challenging, but essential 
</p>
<p>from the perspective of human rights. Focusing solely on utility tariffs bears the risk of 
</p>
<p>severely underestimating expenses and would paint an overly positive picture of 
</p>
<p>affordability that only captures the better-off, while neglecting the very real challenges that 
</p>
<p>the most disadvantaged people and communities face in accessing water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>This review shows that monitoring affordability in its complexity (including water, 
</p>
<p>sanitation and hygiene access expenditure) is feasible, but would require a combination and 
</p>
<p>analysis of data from different sources.
50
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur encourages States and 
</p>
<p>international organizations to explore these options further to ensure more comprehensive 
</p>
<p>monitoring of the affordability of access to services. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Affordability is key for the realization of the human rights to water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation. Ensuring affordable service provision for all people requires a paradigm 
</b></p>
<p><b>shift </b>&#8211;<b> starting from the perspective of human rights. Economic sustainability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>affordability for all people are not impossible to reconcile, but human rights require 
</b></p>
<p><b>rethinking current lines of argumentation and redesigning current instruments. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>main challenge is to ensure that targeted measures and instruments do, in fact, reach 
</b></p>
<p><b>the people who rely on them most. For instance, tariffs must be designed in such a way 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the most disadvantaged of those connected to formal utilities receive the 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance they need. It also requires ensuring that public finance and subsidies reach 
</b></p>
<p><b>the most marginalized and disadvantaged individuals and communities, who are often 
</b></p>
<p><b>not (yet) connected to a formal network, who may live in informal settlements without 
</b></p>
<p><b>any formal title or in remote rural areas where self-supply is common, and who are 
</b></p>
<p><b>often overlooked or deliberately ignored in current policymaking and planning. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur offers the following recommendations. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>take the following measures: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Assess what financing mechanisms and subsidies are in place, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>hidden subsidies, and who benefits from them; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure transparency about existing and planned financing mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and subsidies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Consider establishing national legislation requiring that service 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers and subnational governments include affordability concerns in policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in service provision; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Set affordability standards at the national and/or local level, based on a 
</b></p>
<p><b>participatory process, involving in particular people living in poverty and other 
</b></p>

<p><b>marginalized and disadvantaged individuals and groups, that consider all costs 
</b></p>
<p><b>associated with water, sanitation and hygiene; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Consider affordability standards together with other standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly for availability and quality, to ensure that people can afford to pay for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the services based on human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure participation in the process of decision-making on determining 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms for allocating public financing and setting tariffs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Use public financing to support access for people living in poverty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>those who are marginalized or discriminated against and eliminate inequalities in 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to water and sanitation services;

<p><b>sanitation provision, where costs are frequently underestimated; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Focus on ensuring affordability for the most disadvantaged, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities in informal settlements and communities that rely on self-supply, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>explore different mechanisms to achieve this; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Consider the impact of mechanisms adopted to ensure affordability, 
</b></p>
<p><b>whether universal systems are actually universal in scope and reach beyond 
</b></p>
<p><b>networked supply, and whether targeted systems (whether based on income, 
</b></p>
<p><b>geographic location, type of access or other factor) in fact reach the intended 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Put into place strong regulatory frameworks and bodies for ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>affordability of service provision that covers all types of services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Address corrupt practices that add to the cost of service provision;

</b></p>
<p><b>human rights monitoring mechanisms to pay increasing attention to the affordability 
</b></p>
<p><b>of water and sanitation service provision in the particular contexts people live in.
