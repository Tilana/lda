<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/8, requested the Special Rapporteur 
to emphasize practical solutions for the implementation of the right to adequate housing. 
In her first report on this subject, the Special Rapporteur identified the global tenure 
insecurity crisis as a challenge deserving specific attention (A/HRC/22/46). In the present 
report, she offers some guiding principles to address urban tenure insecurity. These 
principles are informed by several responses from States to questionnaires, as well as 
thematic and regional consultations with various stakeholders, and comments and input 
from civil society organizations.1 The Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation for all 
contributions. 
</p>
<p>2. In the last decade, States&#8217; obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to 
adequate housing have been elucidated, including through legislation and case law at 
national and regional level. Internationally, in 2007, the previous Special Rapporteur in his 
report (A/HRC/4/18) presented the basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;). In 2012, member States of the Committee 
on World Food Security adopted by consensus the Voluntary Guidelines on the 
Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of 
National Food Security. In the humanitarian context, in 2005 the Principles on Housing and 
Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons were developed 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/17). The present report reflects and builds upon these instruments, 
focusing in particular on urban tenure security, to fill an important gap in human rights 
guidance.  
</p>
<p>3. Consistent with international human rights law, these principles give guidance on 
existing human rights standards as they pertain to housing and land tenure. Nothing in these 
principles should be read as limiting or undermining the existing human rights obligations 
of States or other actors. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur wishes to suggest that the 
Council adopts these guiding principles on security of tenure for the urban poor.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report is organized in two sections, with the guiding principles in the 
first and commentary in the second. The commentary explains each principle and includes 
examples of their practical implementation by authorities at all levels and by other relevant 
actors around the world.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Guiding principles 
</b>5. Below are the guiding principles on security of tenure for the urban poor as 
suggested by the Special Rapporteur to the Council for adoption: 
</p>
<p><b>   Guiding principles on security of tenure for the urban poor 
</b></p>
<p>Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and 
land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid 
arrangements, that enables one to live in one&#8217;s home in security, peace and dignity. 
It is an integral part of the right to adequate housing and a necessary ingredient for 
the enjoyment of many other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. All 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 All responses from States to questionnaires and more information on the consultations are available 
</p>
<p>from www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/StudyOnSecurityOfTenure.aspx. </p>


<p>persons should possess a degree of security of tenure that guarantees legal protection 
against forced eviction, harassment and other threats.  
</p>
<p>The plight of the urban poor presents one of the most pressing challenges to security 
of tenure, especially in an increasingly urbanized world. These principles aim to 
provide guidance to States and other actors to address this challenge in order to 
ensure adequate housing for poor and vulnerable people in urban and peri-urban 
areas. 
</p>
<p>Underlying these guiding principles is a presumption that individuals and 
communities occupying land or property to fulfil their right to adequate housing, and 
who have no other adequate option, have legitimate tenure rights that should be 
secured and protected. The concept of legitimate tenure rights extends beyond 
mainstream notions of private ownership and includes multiple tenure forms 
deriving from a variety of tenure systems. 
</p>
<p><b>  1. Strengthening diverse tenure forms 
</b></p>
<p>States should promote, protect and strengthen a variety of tenure forms, including 
those deriving from statutory, customary, religious and hybrid tenure systems. All 
relevant laws, policies and programmes should be developed on the basis of human 
rights impact assessments, which identify and prioritize the tenure arrangements of 
the most vulnerable and marginalized. The following types of tenure, among others, 
should be promoted, strengthened and protected, as appropriate in the given context: 
</p>
<p>(a) Possession rights; 
(b) Use rights; 
(c) Rental; 
(d) Freehold; and 
(e) Collective arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b>  2. Improving security of tenure  
</b></p>
<p> In order to improve security of tenure, especially for vulnerable and marginalized 
persons and groups living in urban poor settlements, States, including relevant 
authorities, should take the following measures: 
</p>
<p>(a) Conduct citywide assessments of tenure arrangements; 
(b) Identify insecure settlements and population groups, including the 
</p>
<p>homeless; 
</p>
<p>(c) Develop citywide strategies for securing tenure and upgrading 
settlements on different categories of land and with different tenure arrangements; 
</p>
<p>(d) Review and reform urban plans and regulations in order to integrate 
settlements; 
</p>
<p>(e) Adopt and implement a human rights-compliant resettlement policy to 
be applied where in situ solutions are not possible; 
</p>
<p>(f) Facilitate participatory settlement mapping, enumerations and tenure 
registration; 
</p>
<p>(g) Establish fair and effective land dispute resolution mechanisms; 
(h) Allocate sufficient funds to ministries, municipalities and local 
</p>
<p>governments for the implementation of these measures; and </p>


<p>(i) Adopt or revise legislation to recognize and protect multiple tenure 
arrangements.  
</p>
<p><b>  3. Prioritizing in situ solutions  
</b></p>
<p>Tenure should be secured in situ unless there are exceptional circumstances that 
justify eviction consistent with international human rights law. Regulations aimed at 
protecting public health and safety and the environment or at mitigating risk for the 
population should not be used as an excuse to undermine security of tenure. In situ 
solutions should be found whenever it is possible to: (a) mitigate and manage risks 
of disaster and threats to public health and safety; or (b) balance environmental 
protection and security of tenure; except when inhabitants choose to exercise their 
right to resettlement. 
</p>
<p><b>  4. Promoting the social function of property 
</b></p>
<p>Property has a vital social function including adequate housing of the urban poor. 
States should balance property rights with the social function of property in 
designing and implementing housing and other relevant policies. In particular, 
States, including relevant authorities, should promote access to secure and well-
located housing for the urban poor through, inter alia, the following measures: 
</p>
<p>(a) Conduct citywide audits of vacant and underutilized land, housing and 
buildings; 
</p>
<p>(b) Conduct assessments of spatial needs to house the urban poor, 
including homeless persons, taking into account current and anticipated trends; 
</p>
<p>(c) Allocate available public land for the provision of low-income 
housing; 
</p>
<p>(d) Adopt measures to combat speculation and underutilization of private 
land, housing and buildings; 
</p>
<p>(e) Adopt inclusive urban planning strategies and regulations;  
(f) Adopt measures to regulate and stimulate the low-income rental 
</p>
<p>market and collective forms of tenure; and 
</p>
<p>(g) Adopt measures to regulate the housing finance market and financial 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>  5.  Combating discrimination on the basis of tenure  
</b></p>
<p>Non-discrimination on the basis of tenure status must be guaranteed and protected in 
law, policy and practice. This guarantee must apply to all forms of tenure. Non-
discrimination on the basis of tenure status must be guaranteed in the context of, 
inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Access to basic services and facilities; 
(b) Access to social security;    
(c) The collection and presentation of official data;  
(d) Land administration programmes; 
(e) Housing legislation and policies;  
(f) Urban planning;  
(g) Land acquisition and use for public purposes; </p>


<p>(h) Police procedures; and 
(i) Humanitarian assistance, including access to shelter.    
</p>
<p><b>  6. Promoting women&#8217;s security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>Both de jure and de facto gender equality are essential to the enjoyment of the right 
to adequate housing. In this regard, States must strengthen and protect women&#8217;s 
security of tenure, regardless of age, marital, civil or social status, and independent 
of their relationships with male household or community members. 
</p>
<p><b>  7. Respecting security of tenure in business activities    
</b></p>
<p>Business enterprises should take all relevant steps to ensure that: (a) there are no 
adverse impacts on security of tenure as a result of or in connection with their 
activities or business relationships; and (b) any adverse impacts are addressed, 
including through the provision of remedies to affected persons. Business enterprises 
should ensure transparent, free and fair negotiations regarding any transfer or 
modification of tenure rights with full respect for the right of people or communities 
to accept or reject offers. 
</p>
<p><b>  8. Strengthening security of tenure in development cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>Multilateral and bilateral development agencies should ensure that their operations 
and projects promote and do not undermine security of tenure, including by adopting 
binding safeguard policies that aim to give effect to the right to adequate housing. 
Such agencies should support States lacking sufficient resources to take all necessary 
measures to strengthen security of tenure of the urban poor.  
</p>
<p><b>  9. Empowering the urban poor and holding States accountable 
</b></p>
<p>Urban poor individuals and communities are essential actors in strengthening tenure 
security. States should be accountable to the urban poor for the implementation of 
these guiding principles by, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Making tenure-related information public and accessible to all in a 
timely manner; 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensuring transparency of all decision-making, including reasons for 
decisions;  
</p>
<p>(c) Guaranteeing free, informed and meaningful participation of the urban 
poor in the design and implementation of measures to secure their tenure status;  
</p>
<p>(d) Developing contextually appropriate indicators and benchmarks 
against which to measure progress and regressions; and 
</p>
<p>(e) Periodic reporting of progress at national and international levels. 
</p>
<p><b>  10. Ensuring access to justice 
</b>Tenure status should not pose a barrier to people in accessing an effective remedy 
for the violation of human rights. States must ensure access to effective 
administrative and /or judicial remedies for violations of the right to adequate 
housing, due to, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Discrimination on the basis of tenure status, including multiple 
discrimination; </p>


<p>(b) Discrimination on the basis of any prohibited ground in the enjoyment 
of security of tenure; 
</p>
<p>(c) Failure to adopt appropriate and timely measures to address tenure 
insecurity of the urban poor; and 
</p>
<p>(d) The undermining of security of tenure including through forced 
eviction.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Commentary 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>6. Security of tenure guarantees that people access and enjoy their home without fear 
of forced evictions, and enables them to improve their housing and living conditions. It 
provides a foundation for the enjoyment of all aspects of the right to adequate housing and 
other human rights.2 Conversely, when tenure insecurity results in forced eviction and 
homelessness, many human rights are violated and denied. 
</p>
<p>7. States have an immediate obligation to ensure that all persons possess a degree of 
security of tenure that guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and 
other threats.3 They also have an obligation to take progressive measures to strengthen 
security of tenure for all persons using land or housing for their basic housing needs, and 
who currently lack such security. The entitlement to secure tenure in situ is, however, not 
absolute and can be rebutted in exceptional circumstances that justify eviction, consistent 
with international law obligations concerning, inter alia, due process, reasonableness and 
proportionality and the exploration of all feasible alternatives.4 When such circumstances 
exist, States must guarantee safeguards to ensure evictions and resettlement fully respect 
the human rights of those affected, including through access to alternative housing.5 
</p>
<p>8. Contrary to dominant discourse on tenure, freehold titles are not the sole instrument 
of tenure security. Often, policies that promote individual freehold simultaneously reduce 
support to other tenure arrangements. Such policies risk excluding and undermining the 
tenure status of large segments of urban and peri-urban populations, particularly the 
poorest, leading to retrogression in the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing.6 
Conversely, policies favouring diverse tenure forms can improve secure access to housing 
for different population groups.

<p><b> B. Strengthening diverse tenure forms 
</b></p>
<p>9. States should take immediate and progressive measures to confer legal security of 
tenure on individuals and communities currently lacking protection.7 States should 
undertake human rights impact assessments of proposed measures, in the housing, land and 
financial sectors. These assessments should examine potential effects on all existing tenure 
forms and on groups vulnerable to eviction, including market-induced displacements. 
If there is risk of exacerbating tenure insecurity, alternatives should be considered or, as a 
last resort, mitigation measures should be developed. Based on these assessments, States 
should take legislative and programmatic measures to secure diverse tenure forms, 
prioritizing arrangements for those facing barriers to the full realization of their housing 
rights.  
</p>
<p>10. In many places, rapid urbanization has led to the development of large peri-urban 
areas, blurring divisions between urban and rural systems. The following types of tenure 
forms, among others, whether deriving from customary, religious,8 statutory or hybrid9 
tenure systems, should be promoted, strengthened and protected, as appropriate in the given 
urban and peri-urban context. 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Possession rights. </i>The legal recognition of the rights of those occupying public, 
private or community land and housing for a prescribed period, through adverse possession 
of land and housing, above the rights of absentee owners or the State, is an important 
measure to ensure that land and housing is being used in the most socially productive 
manner and to fulfil the right to adequate housing for all. For example, article 183 of the 
Brazilian Constitution recognizes <i>usucapio </i>of urban land used for a home after five years of 
possession without interruption or opposition, provided that the possessor does not own any 
other property. 
</p>
<p>12. Administrative and judicial procedures for the recognition of adverse possession 
should be simple, prompt and affordable. Both individual and collective adverse possession 
should be recognized. Where owners have been forcibly displaced or forced to flee their 
homes, caution should be exercised to ensure that one&#8217;s right of adverse possession does 
not obstruct others&#8217; right to return.10 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Use rights.</i> The right of people to use public or private property for their housing 
needs under certain conditions should be recognized and protected in law and policy. For 
example, in Trinidad and Tobago, Certificates of Comfort give the holders a right not to be 
removed from the plot unless resettlement is deemed necessary and an alternative plot is 
identified and made available.11 In Mozambique, a right to use and improve State land can 
be granted to individuals or groups, which allows persons to mortgage or sell their 
buildings and other improvements on that land.12

<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 In many societies, customary and religious tenure systems enjoy a high degree of social legitimacy. 
</p>
<p>Since a diverse range of tenure forms exists under these systems governing land allocation, use and 
management and conferring tenure security, some of which are akin to the forms of tenure described 
in this commentary, they are not discussed separately, notwithstanding their special character.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 Hybrid tenure systems refer to a combination of two or more tenure systems, including those often 
</p>
<p>referred to as &#8220;informal&#8221; or &#8220;extralegal&#8221; tenure.

<p>14. <i>Rental.</i> Renting a plot, dwelling or room from a private or public owner provides 
access to housing for many urban poor households.13 Rental involves the right to use 
housing for a period of time at a given price, without transfer of ownership, on the basis of 
a written or verbal contract. 
</p>
<p>15. In addition to public and non-market rental options, States should promote private 
rental for the urban poor, including through policies to expand rental-housing stock. Such 
policies include tax incentives to owners, guarantees or insurance schemes against non-
payment of rent, and the provision of grants or low-interest loans to landlords to improve 
dilapidated housing units on the condition that they rent to low-income tenants. 
A Government incentive programme in New Jersey, United States of America, for example, 
provides grants to landlords to provide safe, suitable and affordable housing for low and 
moderate-income residents.14 In Slovakia, subsidies are provided for the construction of 
rental apartments for low-income groups, including for socially excluded Roma 
communities.15 Housing allowances for low-income tenants should also be considered.16 
</p>
<p>16. States should regulate the rental sector, including by placing flexible restraints on 
rent increases and limits on eviction consistent with international human rights 
obligations.17 These measures should balance the rights of tenants and landlords. For 
example, in Germany,18 where a majority of households rents, regulations place a cap on 
increases for sitting tenants providing a high degree of tenure security, while maintaining 
the profitability of private investments in rental.19 States should also encourage the use of 
standardized human rights-compliant rental contracts, and make them freely available and 
free from notary approval. 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Freehold ownership</i>. Individual ownership confers full control over housing and 
land, subject to law and local regulations, as well as adverse possession rights and the 
State&#8217;s expropriation powers. This quality makes it a desirable form of tenure for many 
households. Since ownership rights are generally expensive to acquire, housing finance is 
often necessary. Tenure security is jeopardized when owner-occupiers are unable to cope 
with loan repayments and default on their mortgages. Foreclosures by banks and other 
credit institutions pose a serious threat to the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing, 
with the poorest disproportionately affected. States should take all measures to protect 
security of tenure of owner-occupiers and prevent the loss of homes and homelessness as a 
result of foreclosures.20 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Collective tenure</i>. Several types of collective tenure arrangements exist in which 
ownership, rental or use rights over land and housing are shared under joint governance 
structures. Rights are allocated to individuals according to rules established by the group or 
local custom. Collective arrangements can reduce the costs of securing housing by creating 
a single legal entity. Collective organization also promotes affordability by leveraging 
group resources to maintain and repair housing infrastructure, and by enabling group loans

<p>and savings.21 Collective tenure can also provide a high degree of security and safeguard 
against the threat of predatory purchasing by higher-income groups and speculators by 
vesting decision-making powers, including the right to sell, in the collective. Collective 
tenure forms include the following.  
</p>
<p>19. <i>Housing cooperatives</i> are established by a group of persons who form a legal entity 
to develop and maintain a housing project for the collective benefit of members.22 In 
countries like the Philippines, Sweden and Uruguay, government programmes help 
communities to acquire, develop and manage land for cooperative housing. Since 1968, 
Uruguay has had legislative regulation of cooperatives, and approximately 600 cooperatives 
currently house some 20,000 families.23 Cooperatives&#8217; success as a provider of low-income 
housing has been largely due to the existence of the Federation of Mutual Aid Housing 
Cooperatives, which supports democratic participation, self-management and the joint 
effort of families in the construction of homes.24 In Argentina, the Buenos Aires 
municipality has established a credit programme for housing cooperatives.25 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Community land trusts</i> (<i>CLTs)</i> are held by non-profit community-controlled 
organizations that acquire land for the purpose of providing affordable housing.26 Lands are 
removed from the speculative market to preserve affordability and made available through 
long-term leases for housing, businesses, urban agriculture and community facilities. CLTs 
have increased in popularity since the 1980s, especially in the United States where over 260 
have been established.27 Community organizing, and land donations and financial support 
from municipal governments, are key to their success. 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Hybrid tenure models</i> combine cooperatives and CLTs. Multi-residential buildings 
are owned and managed by a housing cooperative and the underlying land is owned by the 
CLT, providing another layer of protection for affordability. The Cooper Square CLT, for 
example, in New York City holds the land to over 300 low-income housing units in multi-
family buildings owned and managed by a mutual housing association.28 
</p>
<p>22. States should adopt measures to promote collective forms of tenure, including 
supportive legislative and institutional frameworks and suitable financing instruments.29 
States should consider supporting collective tenure strategies for low-income housing 
through the allocation of public funds and well-located urban land, property tax exemptions 
and other tax benefits.30

<p><b> C. Improving security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>23. Local authorities should conduct a citywide assessment of existing tenure categories 
and the degree of security of tenure that each provides. The assessment should ascertain the 
underlying causes of tenure insecurity, such as inadequate urban planning, exclusionary 
zoning and building regulations; market forces; the political economy; or cultural and social 
factors, including discrimination. Authorities should identify settlements and groups 
throughout the urban and peri-urban area that lack tenure security and other aspects of the 
right to adequate housing, including homeless populations. They should also identify areas 
subject to gentrification and sudden raises in rents and housing prices that could produce 
future tenure insecurity.  
</p>
<p>24. The assessments should be made public in an accessible format, including to 
settlement residents for discussion and verification. They should inform the preparation of 
citywide strategies for securing tenure for the different situations, with strong participation 
of residents.  
</p>
<p>25. In the absence of affordable housing options the urban poor increasingly find self-
help tenure solutions in urban and peri-urban areas. Programmes like the Thai Baan 
Mankong National Collective Housing Programme in Thailand, for example,31 can 
recognize and upgrade settlements on a citywide scale. Strategies should address the 
situation of settlements on both public and private land, with a presumption in favour of in 
situ tenure solutions, unless residents prefer another option.  
</p>
<p>26. States are obliged to make use of the maximum available resources in order to 
realize human rights. Public land is an essential resource available to the State to fulfil the 
right to adequate housing. As such, unless exceptional circumstances exist, the tenure 
arrangements of households and communities residing on State land, with no other 
adequate housing option, should be legally secured in situ.32 
</p>
<p>27. States should also facilitate in situ tenure solutions, wherever possible, for those 
people residing on privately owned property where the inhabitants have no other adequate 
housing option. Options for securing tenure for inhabitants, either on an individual or 
collective basis, include:  
</p>
<p> (a) The recognition of adverse possession rights; 
 (b) Rental of the property by the owner at affordable rates and with legal tenancy 
protections; 
</p>
<p> (c) Sale of the property with State support where necessary; 
 (d) Sale of the property to the State, or expropriation of the property as a last 
resort, for the purposes of granting use, rental or other secure tenure rights to the 
inhabitants; 
</p>
<p> (e) Land sharing that allocates sufficient land to the owner and to the inhabitants; 
 (f) Expropriation of the property with payment of compensation and subsequent 
granting of use, rental or other secure tenure rights to the inhabitants. This option should be 
considered only as a last resort when other measures have been unsuccessful, given the high 
fiscal cost to the State.

<p>28. Municipal authorities should revise existing legislation and planning regulations 
based on the tenure assessment. Urban plans should integrate settlements into city systems, 
facilities and infrastructures. The plan may, for example, designate low-income settlements 
as &#8220;special zones&#8221; with regulations allowing for incremental upgrading. For example, the 
zoning laws of some Brazilian cities establish social interest special zones, which contain 
special regulations reflecting the reality of settlement configurations. This allows 
settlements to be formally recognized as part of the city through participatory 
mechanisms.33 
</p>
<p>29. Urban plans should incorporate citywide strategies for any necessary resettlement. 
They should identify available, suitable and safe locations for resettlement, ensuring access 
to livelihood opportunities, services and facilities. Resettlement is only permissible under 
international human rights law where it is assessed, in consultation with the community, 
and subject to administrative and judicial review, that in situ upgrading is not viable due to 
exceptional circumstances and the absence of feasible alternatives to eviction.34 Authorities 
should not resettle any household until it has adopted a resettlement policy that is fully 
consistent with their international human rights law obligations. 
</p>
<p>30. States should work with settlement communities to recognize and secure their tenure 
arrangements (both in situ or in preparation for resettlement). Relevant authorities should 
facilitate people-driven settlement mapping and enumerations to gather settlement and 
household data, using both oral and written evidence.35 States should encourage and enable 
community organization and mobilization throughout this process, and remove any 
impediments to freedom of assembly and association.36 Any community-level negotiation 
with the State should only occur through legitimate representatives of the community. All 
relevant actors should ensure that marginalized groups within the community meaningfully 
participate in the process. The participation of such groups, including tenants, whose rights 
and interests are often ignored, should be supported. 
</p>
<p>31. Registering tenure rights in a land information system is an important step towards 
tenure security. However, consideration must be given to the risk of sudden price hikes due 
to registration that could lead to economic eviction of the poorest households, including 
tenants. Tenure options that safeguard against these risks, such as cooperatives and CLTs, 
should be promoted. Rentals should be secured during the registration process through 
recorded contracts to protect tenants from unaffordable rent hikes. Consideration should 
also be given to suitable secure tenure options that reflect the needs of households and 
communities with mobile lifestyles. 
</p>
<p>32. Settlement land information systems should be simple, affordable, accessible and 
transparent. People should have opportunities to contest, clarify or query recorded tenure 
arrangements through an appropriate process including public display of maps. Unlike 
conventional cadastres, settlement land information systems should reflect varied and 
overlapping tenure rights &#8211; not only freehold &#8211; and the spatial realities that exist in urban 
settlements. For example, the Social Tenure Domain Model, developed by the Global Land

<p>Tenure Network (GLTN), enables the recording of multiple forms of individual and 
collective tenure, overlapping rights, and irregular spatial units in urban settlements.37 
</p>
<p>33. States, public and private utilities and service providers, businesses and other actors 
should recognize and respect the tenure rights recorded in settlement information systems, 
on an equal footing to established land cadastres and registries. 
</p>
<p>34. Professional technicians, including surveyors, planners and notaries, and the use of 
technology, such as satellite imagery and global positioning systems, should serve to 
facilitate community mapping and tenure-recording processes, and not pose an obstacle to 
the establishment of accessible and affordable land administration systems. 
</p>
<p>35. States should establish, in consultation with communities, a local dispute resolution 
mechanism, which is socially legitimate and culturally appropriate, to address disputes that 
arise during these processes. Dispute resolution mechanisms should be impartial, fair, 
competent, transparent and human rights-compatible, and affordable and accessible to all. 
Negotiation and mediation between parties to a dispute should be encouraged wherever 
possible in order to promote mutually beneficial outcomes that secure the tenure rights of 
all parties. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Prioritizing in situ solutions 
</b></p>
<p>36. There are legitimate circumstances in which resettlement in a manner consistent 
with international human rights law may be appropriate to protect the health and safety of 
inhabitants exposed to natural disasters or environmental hazards, or to preserve critical 
environmental resources. However, the misuse of regulations aimed at protecting public 
health and safety or the environment to justify eviction of poor households in the absence of 
genuine risk, or when other options are available, is contrary to international human rights 
law.38 
</p>
<p>37. Where a genuine risk to health and safety or the environment exists, prior to any 
decision to evict being made, States must explore all feasible alternatives in consultation 
with affected persons. Specifically, States should use all resources at their disposal, 
including through international assistance, to explore in situ alternatives to mitigate and 
manage risks, regardless of the tenure status and housing standards of inhabitants unless the 
inhabitants prefer to be resettled to alternative adequate housing.39  
</p>
<p>38. Precarious housing structures in hazard-prone areas, such as along fault lines, on 
steep slopes or on river banks should be prioritized for incremental upgrading for current 
inhabitants, whenever feasible. States should explore technical options, like the 
construction of embankments and retaining walls, to transform the area into a safe location 
for housing. For example, a participatory project in the Lower Lempa River Valley in El 
Salvador led to the construction of safer houses with relocation of people living in 
particularly hazardous areas, improved woodland management as a natural buffer to floods,

<p>and a risk management and early-warning system.40 States should raise awareness among 
inhabitants of hazardous areas and help them to improve their living environment.41 
</p>
<p>39. Where settlements pose risks to environmental resources, like parks, coastlines, 
rivers, lakes and wetlands, States should explore options in consultation with affected 
people to protect both the environment and the tenure security and livelihoods of 
inhabitants. For example, participatory land readjustment and incremental upgrading of 
settlements along water bodies, including improved sanitation and waste disposal services, 
can address both concerns. The local government of Surabaya in Indonesia has taken 
successive measures in this direction, via the Settlement and Urban Infrastructure Strategies 
(SPPIP) programme, established in 2010. This programme improved the infrastructure 
conditions (pavements, drainage, waste-management) in the Bozem Morokrembangan 
region, including of households located along the riverbank areas.42  
</p>
<p>40. All potentially affected persons have the right to information about risks to health 
and safety or the environment, and should be afforded opportunities for active participation 
in the process of exploring alternatives to in situ solutions and decision-making. Any 
decision to resettle households should be subject to judicial review. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Promoting the social function of property 
</b></p>
<p>41. The inability of the poor to access secure and well-located urban housing is often a 
direct result of policies that promote the commodification of land and housing to the 
detriment of their social function. As housing becomes increasingly unaffordable, 
especially in city centres, people have no choice but to resort to insecure self-help 
alternatives, including sleeping in public places.  
</p>
<p>42. Policies that promote the social function of property aim to ensure that land is 
allocated, used and regulated in a manner that serves both individual and collective needs.43 
Limitations are placed on private property rights for the purpose of promoting social 
interests and the general welfare.44 States inherently recognize the social function of land 
through, inter alia, the collection of property taxes, the exercise of expropriation powers for 
the public good, adverse possession laws, and urban planning that designates spaces for 
public use and environmental protection. States should take further measures to ensure both 
private and public land is used optimally to give effect to its social function, including 
adequate housing of the urban poor.  
</p>
<p>43. <i>Audits of unused land and housing and assessments of housing needs</i>. An audit of 
unused and underutilized land, housing and buildings, both public and private, should be 
conducted concurrently with an assessment of the housing needs of the urban poor, 
including homeless persons, with the objective of matching availability with spatial needs. 
The assessment of current and anticipated housing needs should take into account patterns

<p>of urbanization and trends in migration, population growth and ageing. In South Africa, for 
example, the City of Cape Town was ordered by the High Court to conduct an audit of 
unused land plots to accommodate people facing eviction.45 
</p>
<p>44. <i>Allocation of public land for the provision of housing</i>. States should utilize available 
public land, including land obtained by municipalities through tax foreclosures and other 
means, to meet current and anticipated housing needs of the urban poor, using suitable 
secure tenure arrangements. States may choose to provide adequate housing or ensure that 
the conditions exist to enable recipients to construct or rehabilitate housing themselves.  
</p>
<p>45. <i>Measures to combat speculation and underutilization of private land and housing</i>. 
States should adopt a range of measures to curb property speculation and the 
underutilization of private land and housing. Tax liabilities on underutilized property can be 
progressively increased to discourage speculation and neglect.46 Public authorities can be 
empowered to acquire rights in unused parcels for use for low-income housing. 
In Colombia, the Urban Reform Law establishes the Priority Development Declaration, 
under which owners of vacant land unwilling to put it back into use are compelled to sell. If 
the land is not sold at auction, the State can expropriate the land at 70 per cent of its tax-
base value for social housing purposes.47 The Netherlands has used an alternative scheme 
allowing local authorities to temporarily take over management of an empty property for 
social rental housing. Renovation of the property, paid for by the local authority, can be 
reimbursed through rent, with both tenant and owner benefiting from the rehabilitation.48 
</p>
<p>46. <i>Inclusive urban planning</i>. Inclusive urban planning is instrumental in promoting 
integrated communities and ensuring that well-located housing is available to the poor. 
Inclusionary zoning requires that a proportion of neighbourhood property be allocated to 
low-income dwellings; and, if combined with a mandate to maintain affordability over 
time, it can provide adequate housing for the urban poor. Inclusive parcelling and 
development regulations require that a proportion of new housing developments is reserved 
for low-income housing. For example, in France, 25 per cent of all new housing 
developments in an urban area with a population of more than 50,000 must be allocated to 
social housing.49 Similar policies exist in Canada, Colombia, Chile, Ireland, Maldives, the 
United States, England and Scotland, among others.50 A ceiling on plot sizes in residential 
zones can also lower housing costs by promoting higher-density accommodation. 
</p>
<p>47. Inclusive urban renewal can be facilitated by participatory land readjustment 
processes. Communities jointly plan and redevelop their pooled land plots to improve 
infrastructure and services, and in some cases densify the area.51 Fragmented land plots are 
assembled and then re-parcelled to achieve a better use of urban space.

<p>48. <i>Measures to regulate financial markets and institutions. </i>The deregulation of 
financial markets, along with policies prioritizing homeownership, has had adverse impacts 
on many urban-poor households.52 Sub-prime loans, payment defaults and foreclosures 
have led to tenure insecurity and evictions in several countries.53 Often, financial 
institutions, including microcredit institutions, charge higher interest rates to the poor to 
mitigate the heightened risk of default. In some cases, lenders have aggressively targeted 
low-income households for loans with exploitative terms, without explaining the terms and 
conditions, and ignoring their ability to repay.54 States should prohibit predatory lending 
practices and adopt regulations to ensure that mortgage payments are commensurate with 
income levels and do not compromise the satisfaction of other basic needs. Regulations 
should also mandate the full disclosure and communication of loan terms to applicants in 
accessible formats and languages.55 
</p>
<p>49. Regulatory safeguards should be put in place to protect households facing default 
and foreclosure, including prohibiting eviction until the household has access to alternative 
adequate housing. In England and Wales, a pre-action protocol for possession claims 
obliges lenders and borrowers to follow procedures aimed at ensuring that repossession is a 
last resort after all reasonable attempts to resolve the situation have failed.56 In Richmond, 
California, the municipality voted to use its powers of eminent domain to seize mortgages 
of households that have defaulted or are at risk of default, when the investor refuses to sell. 
Under the scheme, the City pays the investor the current market value for the mortgage, 
often considerably less than the amount owing, and then supports affordable refinancing 
options for the homeowner.57 A decree-law in Andaluc&#237;a, Spain, currently under appeal, 
allows the local Government to expropriate empty residences that have been repossessed by 
banks and developers in order to house families who have lost their homes.58

<p>discrimination and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the 
recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights.60 
</p><p>51. Property status and place of residence, including a settlement that is not legally 
recognized, are prohibited grounds of discrimination.61 States should adopt deliberate, 
concrete and targeted measures to combat discrimination against individuals and groups on 
the basis of their tenure status in the enjoyment of their human rights.62 The prohibition on 
discrimination applies whether or not the tenure arrangements are recognized under law, 
and whether or not there is documentary evidence of tenure status.  
</p>
<p>52. <i>Access to basic services and facilities</i>. People without an officially recognized 
tenure status are often denied access to basic services and facilities. In some situations, 
public and private service providers, including of water, sanitation and electricity, require 
the presentation of title as a prerequisite for connection or delivery. In other situations, 
access to social facilities, such as school enrolment, is conditional on a registered address. 
States should take measures to ensure that access to basic services and facilities, whether 
publicly or privately provided, is not dependent on tenure status, official registration of 
residence, or the presentation of title.63 
</p>
<p>53. <i>Access to social security.</i> Social security is critical to guaranteeing human dignity 
and the enjoyment of human rights when people are faced with circumstances that deprive 
them of their capacity to otherwise realize them.64 Sometimes homeless persons or 
individuals without a registered address are unable to access social security either owing to 
eligibility criteria or indirect bureaucratic obstacles.65 These obstacles amount to 
discrimination on the basis of tenure status. States should take all necessary steps to remove 
barriers faced by persons who are homeless or have an ambiguous tenure status in receiving 
social security, including by ensuring that a registered address and other residence 
requirements are not a de jure or de facto prerequisite to receiving benefits. 
54. <i>The collection of official data.</i> Individuals without legally recognized tenure, 
including those living in urban settlements, homeless and displaced persons, are often not 
covered in censuses and other official data collection. When their information is ignored, 
their lack of legal tenure status effectively denies them official recognition as members of 
society.66 This exclusion exacerbates their invisibility in policy design and budget 
allocations essential to the realization of their human rights. States should ensure that such 
individuals are counted and included in all official data collection processes.67 
</p>
<p>55. <i>Land administration programmes, housing policies and urban planning.</i> 
Discrimination on the basis of tenure status is prevalent in land, housing and urban policies. 
Land administration programmes typically only register freehold rights, while ignoring the 
multiple other existing tenure forms.68 Housing policies commonly also promote freehold,

<p>with benefits and support, such as access to finance, made conditional on homeownership.69 
Meanwhile, many urban planning processes aim to benefit only those with registered tenure 
rights and fail to take into account the circumstances of urban poor communities whose 
arrangements are not legally recognized. These exclusions impair the enjoyment of human 
rights by those without freehold or other legally recognized tenure rights vis-a-vis other 
sectors of the population. States should ensure that land administration, housing policies 
and urban plans protect and secure a variety of tenure arrangements, prioritizing the most 
vulnerable and marginalized. For example, the Mexico City Housing Improvement 
Programme offers credit regardless of tenure status.70 
</p>
<p>56. <i>Land acquisition</i>. Land occupied by urban poor households with an ambiguous 
tenure status is disproportionately acquired by States for &#8220;public purpose&#8221; projects, such as 
infrastructure development, requiring the eviction of residents.71 This situation may amount 
to discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing on the basis of tenure 
and economic status. In selecting sites for public purpose projects,72 States should ensure 
that the urban poor are not disproportionately affected, and that all alternatives have been 
considered.  
</p>
<p>57. <i>Police procedures. </i>Residents of urban settlements and homeless persons face 
disproportionate levels of police intervention and use of force without due process.73 
In many countries, police enter homes in poor settlements, sometimes in major operations, 
without a court order, violating residents&#8217; rights to protection against arbitrary interference 
with their privacy, family and home.74 Homeless persons, who have no choice but to sleep, 
eat and conduct other life-sustaining activities in publics spaces are commonly harassed, 
fined and detained for doing so. Police must follow due process and respect human rights in 
conducting law enforcement activities, including in urban settlements, and ensure that any 
use of force is strictly necessary and proportional to lawful objectives. States should 
decriminalize homelessness and ensure full respect by police of human rights of homeless 
persons.75 </p>
<p>58. <i>Access to humanitarian assistance. </i>Sometimes tenure documentation, such as title, 
is a prerequisite to establishing eligibility for humanitarian assistance to ensure the 
sustainability of the assistance provided and avoid fraudulent tenure claims and future 
conflict.76 However, often those most in need are displaced, landless and/or tenure insecure, 
and may not hold title or evidence of occupancy in their names, or may have lost their 
documentation during the conflict or disaster. In many contexts, various forms of 
customary tenure that do not rely on documentary evidence are dominant and can provide a 
reliable basis for durable shelter assistance. 
</p>
<p>59. States, including donors, in cooperation with humanitarian actors, should ensure that 
all disaster and conflict-affected persons, irrespective of their tenure status and without

<p>discrimination of any kind, have access to emergency shelter. A rapid assessment of the 
land tenure situation should be conducted, recognizing the multiple tenure arrangements 
that exist or existed prior to the conflict or disaster.77 Non-documented evidence of tenure, 
like testimonies from neighbours, should be collected during this process. The findings 
should be used to design measures to facilitate the delivery of housing recovery and 
reconstruction assistance to those in need, including through negotiation and mediation to 
resolve disputes over tenure rights. Measures should also be taken to ensure access to 
adequate housing to those without evidence of tenure, such as homeless persons. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Promoting women&#8217;s security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>60. Discrimination on the basis of sex exists under all types of land tenure systems. 
Patriarchal laws, attitudes and customs affect the governance of land in many societies. The 
financialization of land and housing has, in some cases, further marginalized women and 
reduced their tenure security.78 
</p>
<p>61. States should guarantee the right of women to security of tenure, independent of 
their relationships with males or community members. States should adopt legislative and 
administrative measures to prohibit and eliminate discrimination against women in this 
respect by, inter alios, landlords, public housing providers and credit institutions. States 
should remove barriers to formal and substantive gender equality whether in laws, policies 
or programmes affecting tenure. The legal recognition and promotion of diverse tenure 
arrangements is crucial to removing barriers to tenure security for women, since, currently, 
they are much less likely than men to own land.79 
</p>
<p>62. States should adopt measures to strengthen women&#8217;s registration of tenure rights. 
The registration of tenure rights in joint or multiple names, including of women, should be 
promoted as standard procedure, in order to avoid de jure or de facto discrimination if 
registration is authorized solely in the name of the head of the household. For example, in 
Tajikistan, law reform in 2004 made it mandatory to list all family members on certificates 
when families receive plots of land from former collective farms.80 Practical measures 
include requiring men and women to be present at the registration process, during which all 
documentation should be read aloud and explained; and providing space on documentation 
for recording multiple names. Under the Ethiopian land certification programme, for 
example, certificates are issued jointly with photos of both husband and wife.81 Incentives 
can also be used to promote registration of tenure rights in the name of women. For 
example, in 2006, Nepal introduced a partial tax exemption for plots of land registered to 
women.82 
</p>
<p>63. In relation to customary and religious tenure systems, States should adopt measures, 
in consultation with communities, and with due respect for the rights of indigenous peoples 
and religious freedom, to eliminate discriminatory practices that deny women security of 
tenure. Efforts should be made to engage and cooperate with community and religious 
leaders in designing and implementing such measures. Women-led initiatives, in particular,

<p>should be supported. For instance, on Erromango Island, Vanuatu, women have challenged 
custom and successfully claimed land rights in the absence of male heirs.83 
</p>
<p>64. States should take measures to protect the tenure security and promote inheritance 
rights of women and girls in the case of the death of a spouse, father, brother, son or other 
male household member so that they are able to continue residing in the family home. 
States should also take measures to address the vulnerability of women and children to 
tenure insecurity due to a breakdown of spousal relations, including as a result of domestic 
violence.84 Women and children&#8217;s security of tenure should be prioritized in these 
circumstances. Many legal systems authorize the victim of domestic violence to stay in the 
family home, and order the removal of the perpetrator. For example, in Serbia, the Family 
Law authorizes the courts to issue an order for the removal of the perpetrator of domestic 
violence from the family home, allowing the victim to remain in the home, regardless of 
ownership (art. 198 (2)). When remaining in the family home is not feasible, States should 
ensure victims have access to alternative adequate housing with secure tenure.  
</p>
<p>65. In humanitarian settings, women and children are particularly vulnerable to tenure 
insecurity, homelessness and other human rights violations. States should prioritize safe 
emergency shelter to women and children until durable housing solutions are established. 
States should ensure that women are able to access humanitarian assistance and exercise 
their right to return, restitution and resettlement regardless of their family status or whether 
their name is recorded on tenure documentation.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Respecting security of tenure in business activities 
</b></p>
<p>66. Tenure security of the urban poor is affected by the activities of a diverse range of 
business actors, including property developers, construction companies, speculators, real-
estate agencies, landlords, mega-event organizers and banks. While States must protect all 
individuals against violations of human rights, business enterprises also have human rights 
responsibilities.85 The responsibility to respect the right to adequate housing requires that 
business enterprises avoid causing or contributing to infringements of the right, and address 
adverse impacts when they occur. It requires that business enterprises seek to prevent 
adverse impacts on, inter alia, security of tenure that are directly linked to their operations, 
products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to 
those impacts.86  
</p>
<p>67. As part of their human rights due diligence, business enterprises should regularly 
assess the potential and actual impacts on tenure security of their activities and those 
directly linked to their operations, products and services, paying special attention to 
vulnerable people, including the urban poor. Business enterprises should engage 
independent experts on security of tenure in relevant countries or contexts, and 
meaningfully consult with potentially affected groups and other relevant stakeholders.

<p>Business enterprises should promptly investigate any allegations of potential or actual 
adverse impacts on tenure security.87 
</p>
<p>68. If potential adverse impacts are identified, business enterprises should take all 
relevant measures to prevent them. They should ensure full disclosure of information, in 
accessible formats, about potential impacts on security of tenure; and transparent, free and 
fair negotiations regarding any interference with or transfers of tenure rights, whether or not 
legally recognized, with full respect for the right of people or communities to accept or 
reject offers. Other measures include making adjustments to project design, locations, and 
planned business relationships. Businesses should communicate through an appropriate 
channel with potentially affected groups in order to explain the risks and consult on 
prevention strategies. If a business enterprise finds that it is not possible to prevent adverse 
impacts, it should abandon or terminate the proposed or active operation, investment or 
business relationship. For example, a proposed business venture that would foreseeably 
result in forced eviction should be either adapted to avoid human rights violations or 
abandoned altogether. 
</p>
<p>69. If a business enterprise causes or contributes to adverse impacts on security of 
tenure, including through its business relationships, it should immediately take all relevant 
steps to address it. If an impact is current or ongoing, the business enterprise should 
immediately cease the activity causing it. If an adverse impact, such as a forced eviction, 
has already occurred, the business enterprise should provide remediation through legitimate 
processes and in consultation with the affected individuals or groups to ensure that the 
remedy is comprehensive and legitimate in their view. When people have been forcibly 
evicted or displaced, remedy should include return of the land, housing and resources to the 
victims and compensation for any losses, including of livelihood. When return of the land 
and housing is impossible, for example, when it has been destroyed, or when the business 
enterprise is not in a position to ensure its return, all possible steps should be taken to 
ensure other forms of reparations, such as secure alternative land and housing of the same 
or better quality and location.88 
</p>
<p>70. Business enterprises should publicly commit to taking all relevant steps to prevent 
and remedy adverse impacts on security of tenure. For example, in 2013, the Coca-Cola 
Company responded to a global campaign, &#8220;Sugar Rush&#8221;, launched by Oxfam urging food 
and beverage companies to respect land rights by committing to a &#8220;plan of action to prevent 
and address land grabs and other land controversies in [its] supply chain&#8221;.89 The company 
committed to conducting human rights impact assessments; public disclosure of suppliers; 
adherence to the principle of free, prior and informed consent for all communities; 
resolution of land disputes through appropriate grievance mechanisms; and working with 
suppliers on corrective action and terminating the relationship if such action is not taken.  
</p>
<p>71. Real-estate investments of a predominantly speculative nature can have the effect of 
undermining security of tenure of the urban poor by contributing to the unaffordability of 
land and housing. The result may be regression in the enjoyment of the right to adequate 
housing and increased homelessness. Business enterprises should refrain from entering into 
such property investments to avoid these adverse human rights impacts. 
</p>
<p>72. Banks and other credit institutions should act with due diligence in relation to the 
impact on security of tenure of their private lending and asset-based securitization 
operations. Banks should pay special attention to individuals or groups at heightened risk of

<p>losing their home as a result of the loan. Lending programmes that may undermine tenure 
security should be abandoned or safeguards put in place, such as measures to ensure 
applicants fully understand the terms of the loan, including the implications of default; 
flexible repayment options in cases of financial hardship; and policy and contractual 
commitments not to apply for an eviction from a foreclosed home until alternative adequate 
housing has been arranged. Predatory lending practices are incompatible with the 
responsibility of business to respect human rights and should be banned by banks and credit 
institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Strengthening security of tenure in development cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>73. Multilateral and bilateral development agencies regularly provide financial and 
technical assistance to operations that affect tenure security, including infrastructure 
development; land management, administration and spatial planning; urban development 
and renewal; settlement upgrading; and policy reforms in, inter alia, the housing and 
financial sectors. They also provide financing to diverse private sector activities that impact 
tenure.  
</p>
<p>74. Multilateral and bilateral development agencies should provide financial and 
technical assistance to countries lacking sufficient resources to strengthen security of 
tenure.90 However, they must ensure that all operations serve to strengthen and prioritize the 
tenure security of vulnerable and marginalized persons and groups. Impact assessments 
should be conducted in relation to all public and private operations before assistance is 
provided. The guiding principles should guide development agencies in ensuring that their 
operations support, promote and strengthen a variety of tenure forms and increase access to 
well-located housing for the urban poor.  
</p>
<p>75. In this regard, multilateral and bilateral development and finance agencies, including 
export credit agencies, should adopt binding safeguard policies on resettlement and security 
of tenure that aim to give effect to the right to adequate housing. While the World Bank, the 
International Finance Corporation, regional development agencies and some export credit 
agencies have commendably adopted policies on resettlement, these safeguards and their 
implementation should be strengthened to reflect human rights standards and extended to 
protect and promote security of tenure.91 
</p>
<p><b> J. Empowering the urban poor and holding the State accountable 
</b></p>
<p>76. The urban poor should drive the process of strengthening their tenure security. 
Global experience shows that the realization of the right to adequate housing depends as 
much upon the mobilization and advocacy of social movements as the concerted efforts of 
States. Governmental and other relevant actors should support the empowerment of urban 
poor individuals and communities by being accountable for the implementation of these 
principles.  
</p>
<p>77. Public access to information and transparency in decision-making are central to 
accountability because they allow for scrutiny and critical debate, including through the 
media. Free and meaningful consultation and active participation of people who are 
potentially affected ensures that their views and concerns are taken into account throughout 
</p>

<p>the process. These measures are crucial to ensure the social and political legitimacy of 
tenure security programmes. 
</p>
<p>78. While some of these principles focus on immediate obligations, the implementation 
of many measures is, by nature, a progressive process. States must demonstrate that they 
are taking deliberate, concrete and targeted steps as expeditiously and effectively as 
possible, including through the design and implementation of a plan of action for 
strengthening security of tenure.92 States should conduct baseline surveys of tenure security, 
develop quantitative and qualitative indicators and set benchmarks against which to monitor 
progress, evaluate outcomes and inform decision-making. Indicators and benchmarks 
should be designed to measure progress in, inter alia: (a) promoting a variety of tenure 
forms; (b) the degree of security they confer; (c) securing the tenure arrangements of 
marginalized groups; (d) reducing discrimination; and (e) achieving more equitable access 
to urban housing, including reductions in the number of vacant plots and buildings and the 
proportion used to house low-income households.93 
</p>
<p>79. All data on progress and outcomes should be made public, ensuring that the urban 
poor are able to access and understand the information. Progress reports should be 
presented to a range of national mechanisms, such as legislatures, national human rights 
institutions, and public forums, as well as to international mechanisms, including human 
rights treaty bodies and the Council through the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Ensuring access to justice 
</b>80. The urban poor face significant barriers in accessing justice, owing to, inter alia, 
political influence and corruption in courts and administrative bodies; prohibitive costs of 
legal representation; absence of legal information; and lack of legal recognition of persons 
without official identity documentation, including a registered address.94 States should take 
all measures to remove these barriers and ensure that the urban poor can access effective 
remedies through a range of judicial and administrative mechanisms. As an alternative to 
the courts, land dispute and grievance mechanisms that are inexpensive, accessible, socially 
legitimate and rule-bound should be established. States should establish, fund and enable 
legal aid and assistance for the urban poor, in order to address power asymmetries that 
pervade conflicts over land and obstruct access to justice.  
81. Remedies for violations of the right to adequate housing may include restitution, 
reparation,95 the provision of alternative adequate housing, rehabilitation of housing or 
livelihoods, financial or non-financial compensation for loss and damage, and punitive 
sanctions against the perpetrator. An injunction, precautionary measures or other judicial or 
administrative intervention may be required to prevent imminent forced eviction or other 
violation. Remedies may also include repeal or amendment of law or policy and quashing 
of administrative decisions. In this regard, States should ensure that policies and decisions 
affecting tenure security are subject to administrative and judicial review. In the case of an
