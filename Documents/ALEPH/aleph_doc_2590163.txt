Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
NOTE 1.                          BASIS OF PRESENTATION
In August 2009 the Company initiated a number of corporate changes, including 1), a name
change to TOA Distribution Systems Inc, (formerly known as Skyhigh Resources Inc, 2)
approved a 10 for 1 roll forward of its issued and outstanding common stock, 3), increased it
authorized par value $0.001 common shares to 250,000,000 shares (formerly 50,000,000), and
4), authorized 10,000,000 par value $0.001 preferred shares.
In mid-2009, the Company resolved to change its corporate focus, moving from mining and
exploration into bottled drinking water distribution.
The Company owned two (2) mineral properties acquired from related parties in January 2008 by
issuing stock to related parties. The purchase price was fully impaired. In February 2012 these
claims were deemed surplus and were sold in May 2012.
On September 2, 2009 the Company entered into to a Sub-Distribution agreement with Taste of
Aruba (US), Inc to distribute bottled water products produced in Aruba by Taste of Aruba-
Premium Aruban Water.   The territory in which the Company can distribute these products
include the United States and all its territories and insular areas in the Caribbean and Pacific
such as but not limited to Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Marshall Islands, and Guam, and all of
Canada.  In January 2016, the Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the Sub-
Distribution agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either party. Taste of Aruba was unable to
confirm when its products would be available for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover
the cost of the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were cancelled on
January18, 2016. This transaction which included full impairment has been reversed in the
financial records for the year ended March 31, 2016.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related statements of
income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ
from management's estimates and assumptions.
NOTE 2.                          GOING CONCERN
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which contemplates
continuation of the Company as a going concern.  However, the Company has no business
operations to date, accumulated losses amounting to $174,401 and must secure additional
financing to commence the Company's plan of operations, which means there is substantial
concern about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company intends to
acquire additional operating capital through equity offerings to the public to fund its business plan
or loans from shareholders and others. There is no assurance that the equity offerings will be
successful or loans will be received to provide sufficient funds to commence operations or to
assure the eventual profitability of the Company.
NOTE 3.                          SUB-DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
On September 2, 2009 the Company signed an Exclusive Sub-Distribution Agreement
("Agreement") with Taste of Aruba (US) Inc, a State of Nevada Incorporated company, owner and
master distributor of products from Taste of Aruba-Premium Aruban Water. Under the Agreement,
the Company will distribute in the United States, its territories and insular areas in the Caribbean
and Pacific and Canada, bottled water produced under license in Aruba by Water Energy
Company-Aruba.
In January 2016, the Company and Taste of Aruba agreed to cancel the Sub-Distribution
agreement on a no loss no gain basis for either party. Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when
its products would be available for resale. The 17,000,000 shares issued to cover the cost of the
Sub-Distribution Agreement have been returned and were cancelled on January18, 2016. This
transaction which included full impairment has been reversed in the financial records for the year
ended March 31, 2016.
NOTE 4.                          LOANS PAYABLE
Loans payable to related parties, were received from a director of the Company and others
closely associated persons or businesses. These funds were provided as cash loans to cover
operating expenses and as payment for services provided.
Loans payable to the past and current presidents totaled $6,214 made up of principal amounting
to $3,742 and accrued interest of $2,472
Loans payable to a closely associated business totaled 88,937 made up of principal amounting
to $75,498 and accrued interest amounting to $13,439.
In aggregate, Loans Payable Related Parties to June 30, 2016 totaled $95,151 made up of
$79,240 for principal and $15,911 for accrued interest.
NOTE 7.                          EQUITY
At a special shareholders meeting held August 13, 2009, the shareholders approved the change
of the Company's name to TOA Distribution Systems Inc, approved charges to the authorized
capital which included creation of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $0.01
per share and increased the authorized common stock to 250,000,000 with a par value of $0.001
per share. As well, the shareholders approved a 10 for 1 forward stock split of the outstanding
shares. All share amounts shown in these financial statements have been adjusted retroactively
to account for the forward stock split.
At June 30, 2016 we had zero preferred stock issued and outstanding and had 30,100,060
common shares issued and outstanding, which were issued on the dates and purposes listed
below.
-  15,000,000 common shares issued to a director for cash at $0.0001 on December 13, 2007
-  600,000 common shares issued for services at $0.0025 on December 13, 2007

-  2,500,000 common shares issued for a mining property on June 15, 2009

- (17,000,000) common shares returned for cancelled sub-distribution agreement January18,
2016
NOTE 8.                          CONTRIBUTED SURPLUS
The Company owned two (2) mineral claims that had been deemed surplus and fully impaired.
On May 1, 2012 these claims were sold to a related party to whom the Company had loans
payable. The terms of the sale was a reduction of the loans payable and proportionate accrued
interest in aggregate amounting to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollar, ($25,000.00), an extension on
the due date of these loan payable, a reduction of the rate of interest payable from 10% to 5%
and the issuance by the purchaser, of shares in its two private companies. The Company elected
to distribute these private company shares equally to the Company's shareholders. As these
shares were valued at $0 by the Company there was no impact on the financial statements.
NOTE 9.                          CHANGES TO GENERALLY ACCEAPTED ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES (GAAP)
During the September 30, 2014 period the Company adopted the revised Accounting Standard
Update No. 2014-10 that removes the definition of a development stage entity from ASC Topic
915 under GAAP, which become effective December 15, 2014 while permitting Companies to
adopt these guidelines earlier
NOTE 10.                          SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements
were issued. There were no significant subsequent events that need to be disclosed.
ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION
PLAN OF OPERATION
In an effort to make available the facilities of the public market to our funding requirements, the
Company intends to make application to FINRA for a trading symbol. The Company's application
to FINRA will consist of current corporate information, financial statements and other documents
as required by Rule 15c211 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On November 17, 2012, the Company filed a Form 8-K, Item 5.02: Departure of Directors or
Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. This 8-K filing disclosed the resignation of Trevor Blank as a Director
and from all officer positions held with the Company. Concurrent with Mr. Blank's resignation, Mr.
Andy Ruppanner was appointed to serve as sole director and as President and CEO, Vice-
President and CFO, Secretary and Treasurer.
In January 2016 the Company's and Taste of Aruba mutually agreed to cancel their Sub-
Distribution Agreement.  Taste of Aruba was unable to confirm when its products would be
available for resale. The cancelation agreement was on the basis of a no loss, no gain for either
party. The 17,000,000 shares issued as the cost for the Sub-Distribution Agreement have been
returned and cancelled.
Subsequent to the period ending June 30, 2016, the Company entered into discussion with
another non related entity to obtain a license for a water treatment technology

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our cash balance was nil on June 30, 2016. During this three month period ended June 30,
2016 we received loans from related parties amounting to $2,460 and have a commitment for any
additional funds required to fund our limited levels of operations through March 31, 2017. We
have not generated any revenue to date.
We have loans payable including interest amounting to $95,150 due June 30, 2016.
Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that
we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional
capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are
anticipated until we begin receiving and selling water products. There is no assurance we will
ever reach that stage.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
ITEM 3.                          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).
Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Security and
Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the current
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
EVALUATION OF AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for  the  company.  Internal  control  over financial reporting is to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our  financial  reporting  purposes  accordance 
with  accounting  principles generally  accepted in the United  States of  America.  Internal 
control  over financial  reporting  includes  maintaining  records that in  reasonable  detail
accurately and fairly reflect our transaction;  providing  reasonable  assurance that  transactions 
are recorded as necessary for  preparations of our financial statements;  providing  reasonable
assurance that receipts and  expenditures of company  assets  are  made in  accordance  with 
management  authorization;  and providing   reasonable   assurance  that  unauthorized  
acquisitions,   use  or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements would be prevented or detected.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation
management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was
ineffective as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting during the period  ended  June 30, 2016 that have  materially  affected,  or are
reasonable  likely to materially  affect our internal control over financial reporting.
