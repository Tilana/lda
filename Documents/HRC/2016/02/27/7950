</p>
<p> 5. In that context, the Council welcomes the Government&#8217;s decision to pursue 
the strengthening of the rule of law, notably by combating impunity, crime and the causes 
of crime, so as to ensure the functioning of institutions and public services and the 
enjoyment of all human rights, and encourages the Government of Haiti to take all 
necessary measures to achieve that goal. 
</p>
<p> 6. The Council applauds the efforts made by the Government of Haiti to 
strengthen national human rights institutions, in particular the Office of Citizen Protection. 
</p>
<p> 7. The Council invites the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt the 
necessary political and legal measures to safeguard the rights of members of vulnerable 
groups, including the victims of child trafficking, to increase women&#8217;s participation in 
political affairs and to continue to combat gender-based violence and discrimination. 
</p>
<p> 8. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties encountered by its leaders following the earthquake of 12 January 2010. It 
recognizes that the full enjoyment of civil and political, economic, social and cultural 
human rights is a factor in peace, stability and development in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 9. The Council encourages the international community as a whole and, in 
particular, international donors, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, the 
group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti, United Nations agencies and, in 
particular, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to step 
up their cooperation with the Haitian authorities with a view to the full realization in Haiti 
of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p> 10. The Council welcomes the request of the Haitian authorities for a one-year 
extension of the mandate of the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in 
Haiti, which concerns technical assistance and capacity-building, and decides to approve 
this request. 
</p>
<p> 11. The Council encourages the Independent Expert mandate holder to work with 
international institutions, donors and the international community to raise their awareness 
of the need to provide their expertise and sufficient resources to support the Haitian 
authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the country and pursue sustainable development. 
</p>
<p> 12. The Council also encourages the Independent Expert mandate holder to work 
with Haitian non-governmental organizations and civil society in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 13. The Council invites the Independent Expert mandate holder to assist the 
Government of Haiti in acting upon the recommendations made in the course of the 
universal periodic review. He or she will also provide their experience, expertise and 
contribution to the cause of human rights, including civil and political rights and with 
particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights, in Haiti. 
</p>
<p> 14. The Council invites the Independent Expert mandate holder to assist the 
Government of Haiti in acting upon the recommendations made by the special procedures, 
in particular those of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing. 
</p>
<p> 15. The Council also invites the Independent Expert mandate holder to undertake 
a mission to Haiti and to report to the Council at its twenty-fifth session. It encourages Haiti 
to continue to cooperate with the mandate and is ready to support Haiti in establishing a 
national human rights plan.
