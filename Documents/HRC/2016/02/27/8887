<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its second session 
from 10 to 14 August 2009. All five members of the Expert Mechanism were present. 
Participants in the session included: representatives of States, United Nations bodies and 
specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations, academics and a large number of 
indigenous peoples. The participation of some of the indigenous peoples was funded through 
the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations.  
</p>
<p>The Expert Mechanism held a discussion on the draft study on lessons learned and 
challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education, in 
order to finalize the study. It also held a discussion on the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, addressing (a) the implementation of the Declaration at the 
regional and national levels, and (b) specific provisions in the Declaration identifying remedies 
for infringements of rights (rights to adjudication, remedies, repatriation, redress and 
compensation).  
</p>
<p>The Expert Mechanism adopted the study on the right of indigenous peoples to education 
and adopted six proposals. Five of the proposals are addressed to the Human Rights Council and 
relate to the following topics: a suggested thematic study on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
participate in decision-making; human rights institutions and mechanisms; consideration of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights during the Human Rights Council sessions; the Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations; and follow-up to the Durban Review Conference. The sixth proposal 
related to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and was 
addressed to United Nations specialized agencies. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36 of 14 December 2007, the Human Rights Council decided to establish 
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary expert mechanism to 
assist the Council in the implementation of its mandate, by providing it with thematic expertise 
on the rights of indigenous peoples in the manner and form requested by the Council. The 
thematic expertise was to focus mainly on studies and research-based advice, and the mechanism 
could make proposals to the Council for its consideration and approval, within the scope of its 
work as set out by the Council.  
</p>
<p><b>II. ADOPTION OF THE STUDY ON THE RIGHT  
TO EDUCATION AND OF PROPOSALS

<p><b>A.  Adoption of the study on the right to education 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>:  1. <i>Refers</i> to paragraph 5 of Human Rights Council resolution 9/7 in which the Council

<p><b>Proposal 1.  Thematic study on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>:  1. <i>Refers</i> to paragraph 3 of Human Rights Council resolution 9/7, in which the Council

strengthening of existing ones; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Proposes</i> that the Human Rights Council encourage States to ensure that they have 
strong national human rights institutions and that these institutions have specific roles and 
activities to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Proposes</i> that the Human Rights Council encourage States to consider, in 
consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples, the establishment of national institutions

<p><i> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>:  1. <i>Proposes </i>that the Human Rights Council consider organizing regular panel events 
devoted to the rights of indigenous peoples during its future sessions, with the participation of 
the Expert Mechanism, regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions 
and other relevant experts. Such panel events could be devoted to specific themes, and they 
could include sessions on the follow-up of thematic studies prepared by the Expert Mechanism; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> the Human Rights Council to continuously pay particular attention to the 
rights of indigenous peoples and to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous

that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights prepare a compilation of the 
recommendations issued so far in the context of the universal periodic review process with 
respect to indigenous peoples;  
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Proposes </i>that the Human Rights Council ensure that the introduction of the reports 
related to indigenous peoples by the Expert Mechanism, the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights take place annually at the same session of the Human 
Rights Council and that these reports be grouped together in the agenda of the sessions, in order 
to enhance synergies and to facilitate participation of representatives of indigenous peoples.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 4.  United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>:<i>  
 Proposes</i> that the Human Rights Council follow up further on the recommendation made 
by the Expert Mechanism at its first session to expand the mandate of the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations to cover also the sessions of the Human Rights 
Council and those of human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal 5.  Follow-up to the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>:  1.<i> Notes</i> the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference, in particular its

Indigenous Peoples and which urges States to take all necessary measures to implement the 
rights of indigenous peoples in accordance with international human rights instruments without 
discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Proposes </i>to the Human Rights Council that it invite the Expert Mechanism to make

Peoples in line with the recommendation contained in paragraph 73 of the Durban Outcome 
Document.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Other proposals

means of strengthening their activities and programmes in order to promote respect for and full 
application of the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, in line with article 42 of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its second session in 
Geneva from 10 to 14 August 2009. The members who participated in the session were 
Catherine Odimba Kombe (Congo), Jannie Lasimbang (Malaysia), John B. Henriksen (Norway), 
Jos&#233; Carlos Morales Morales (Costa Rica) and Jos&#233; Mencio Molintas (Philippines).  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The participants in the session of the Expert Mechanism included representatives 
of 54 Member States, the Holy See, six United Nations organizations and programmes, 
two national human rights institutions and a large number of indigenous delegates and 
non-governmental organizations. Approximately 400 participants were accredited (see annex I). 
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, James Anaya, and a member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
Carlos Mamani, participated in the session. The Human Rights Council&#8217;s Advisory Committee 
was represented by Miguel Alfonso Mart&#237;nez. The Chairperson of the Working Group on 
Indigenous Populations of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
Musa Ngari Bitaye, and Jos&#233; Francisco Cali-Tzay, member of the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination, also participated in the session. In addition, the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations was represented by Tegegn Melakou. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/1) 
and the annotated agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/1/Add.1) as prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the draft study on lessons 
learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to 
education (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/2), prepared by the Expert Mechanism, and the OHCHR 
contribution to the study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the 
right of indigenous peoples to education (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/4).  
</p>
<p>6. In addition, two OHCHR reports were made available to the participants. One report, 
on the International Workshop on the Natural Resource Companies, Indigenous Peoples and 
Human Rights, sets a framework for consultation, benefit-sharing and dispute resolution 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/5). The second report contains the Draft Guidelines on the Protection of 
Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation and in Initial Contact of the Amazon Basin and 
el Chaco (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/6).  
</p>
<p><b>C.  OPENING OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>7. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur, John B. Henriksen, opened the second session of 
the Expert Mechanism. He gave the floor to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Navanethem Pillay, who delivered an opening speech. 
</p>
<p>8. In her statement, the High Commissioner recalled that the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples offers a framework to advance the rights of indigenous peoples 
through dialogue between States, indigenous peoples, the United Nations system and other 
stakeholders. She was pleased to note that support for the Declaration keeps expanding, with 
Australia and Colombia having recently endorsed it. She assured the participants that her Office 
was committed to be a frontline advocate of universal acceptance and implementation of the 
Declaration and will continue to support human rights mechanisms dealing with the rights of 
indigenous peoples. &#8220;These rights are, and will remain, a priority area for OHCHR&#8221; she said. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. The High Commissioner stated that the Expert Mechanism can make a significant 
contribution to the advancement of the rights of indigenous peoples by providing the Human 
Rights Council with well-grounded thematic advice, thus enabling the Council to address 
promptly situations and issues of concern by factoring in the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s advice. She 
referred to the first thematic study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the 
implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education, and said that the publication of 
the thematic studies should not be seen as the end of a process. Rather, they should be a 
launching pad for concrete follow-up activities that her Office stands ready to support. She 
concluded by saying that the participation of indigenous peoples, regional human rights 
mechanisms, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations is essential 
and so is constructive dialogue with Governments, whose engagement is a sine qua non for 
achieving true positive impact at the national level and in intergovernmental processes.  
</p>
<p>10. The Vice-President of the Human Rights Council was invited to take the floor. He recalled 
that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was the first human 
rights texts adopted by the Human Rights Council and should contribute, along with the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, to the realization of the human rights of indigenous 
peoples. He welcomed steps that have been taken by the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples to coordinate its work with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues, both of which were represented at the session. 
</p>
<p>11. The Vice-President recalled that the Council was also holding thematic discussions which 
are relevant to the rights of indigenous peoples; hence, the Expert Mechanism could be called 
upon to contribute to these discussions. He informed the participants that the Council would 
consider the study on the right to education and the report of the second session, including 
proposals the Expert Mechanism may wish to submit to the Council&#8217;s consideration, at its 
twelfth session in September 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>12. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur invited the experts to nominate a Chairperson for its 
second session. Jose Molintas announced that they had decided, by consensus, to nominate 
Jannie Lasimbang and Catherine Odimba Kombe as Chairperson-Rapporteur and 
Vice-Chairperson respectively. Thereafter, the outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur declared the 
two experts as elected by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>13. In her statement, the newly elected Chairperson-Rapporteur, Ms. Lasimbang, thanked the 
outgoing Chairperson for his leadership and called for his continued guidance. She expressed the 
view that the Expert Mechanism provides a unique space for focused multilateral discussions 
that can contribute towards a better understanding of the scope and contents of the rights 
affirmed to indigenous peoples, and how the implementation of these rights can be advanced. 
She recalled the preamble to Human Rights Council resolution 6/36, which refers to the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and highlighted the role of this 
instrument as an important framework to guide the work of the Expert Mechanism. In addition, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>article 42 of the Declaration, which calls on the United Nations, its bodies, specialized agencies 
and States to promote the respect for and effective implementation of the provisions contained in 
the Declaration, also applies to the mandate of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>14. The Chairperson-Rapporteur informed the participants that, during discussions under 
agenda item 3, the draft of the study on the right of indigenous peoples to education, which is to 
be concluded in 2009, will be presented. She acknowledged the challenges faced to complete a 
draft study which covers the diverse situation of indigenous peoples globally, and called for 
further comments on how to improve the study as well as concrete ways and means to achieve 
the right of indigenous peoples to education.  
</p>
<p>15. The Chairperson-Rapporteur further underlined the value of the existing collaboration with 
other United Nations mandates relevant to indigenous peoples. She noted that, building on the 
positive experience gained during the first session, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people will be available for separate 
consultations on cases of human rights violations during the present session. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur concluded by commending the Government of Norway for its additional 
financial contribution to the work of the Expert Mechanism and called for increased funding for 
its activities in order to discharge its mandate effectively. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, James Anaya, was given the floor. He expressed the view that the 
establishment of the Expert Mechanism marked an important milestone in the progress of the 
international movement to protect indigenous rights and the beginning of another new chapter. 
Concerning the coordination of the three mechanisms, he expressed satisfaction that 
collaboration between the respective mandates has continued and developed throughout the past 
year. For him, an important aspect of this collaboration was to provide input to the thematic 
studies of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>17. He further stated that he had started to develop methods for receiving communications 
during the sessions of the Expert Mechanism in order to maximize the impact of the participation 
of indigenous groups.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur offered some views on two of the agenda items of the session of 
the Expert Mechanism. Regarding agenda item 3 concerning the right to education, he reported 
that indigenous peoples conveyed to him their concerns, including the lack of institutional 
capacity to provide good quality education; the unavailability or inadequacy of bilingual and 
multicultural educational opportunities; and the inadequate incorporation of indigenous 
languages and cultural perspectives into educational curriculum and texts. A common problem 
also raised was the lack of participation of, or consultation with, indigenous peoples in the 
development and implementation of educational initiatives that affect them. 
</p>
<p>19. Indigenous peoples had expressed concern about the widespread use of educational 
materials reflecting solely the cultures of the dominant groups. He considered that the study of 
the Expert Mechanism was instrumental in providing States, indigenous peoples and other actors 
with a framework for identifying key issues and developing coordinated action to address them. 
The centrality of education to the effective enjoyment of other rights, including the overarching 
right of self-determination, he said, cannot be understated.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. On agenda item 4, the Special Rapporteur recalled the preamble of the Human Rights 
Council resolution establishing the Expert Mechanism, which expressly referred to the 
Declaration. This reference provides the Expert Mechanism with a clear normative framework 
for the fulfilment of its mandate to provide the Council with thematic expertise on the rights of 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>21. He stated that the Declaration does not attempt to bestow on indigenous peoples a set of 
special or new human rights, but rather provides a contextualized elaboration of general human 
rights principles and rights as they relate to the specific historical, cultural and social 
circumstances of indigenous peoples. From this perspective, he said, the standards of the 
Declaration connect to existing State obligations under general human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>22. He further stated that implementing the Declaration depends on the establishment of strong 
partnership between States and indigenous peoples, in which both must assume responsibilities. 
Most of the provisions of the Declaration, including the articles that elaborate upon the elements 
of indigenous self-determination in the areas of self-government and autonomy, cultural integrity 
and social areas, require the active, good faith engagement of indigenous peoples with States and 
the broader political and societal structures.  
</p>
<p>23. Tegegn Melakou, Member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Indigenous Populations, was given the floor. He recalled that the mandate of the Voluntary 
Fund is to assist representatives of indigenous peoples, organizations and communities to 
participate in the deliberations of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert 
Mechanism. In the light of its limited available resources, the Board was only able to recommend 
the allocation of 112 travel grants to indigenous peoples from the different regions of the world 
to attend the sessions of both bodies. The travel grants amounted to an approximate total 
US$ 412,000. This means that the Voluntary Fund was only able to support 15 per cent of the 
total number of requests.  
</p>
<p>24. Mr. Tegegn pointed out the fundamental importance of providing direct assistance to 
indigenous peoples in order for them to participate in United Nations meetings and expressed 
strong support for the recommendation made by the Expert Mechanism at its first session 
regarding the broadening of the mandate of the Fund to cover the participation of indigenous 
representatives in meetings of the Human Rights Council and the human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>25. The agenda, as contained in document A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/1, was adopted by the 
Experts, and the programme of work for the five-day session was introduced.  
</p>
<p>26. Following the adoption of the agenda, the Chairperson-Rapporteur suspended the 
meeting and invited all to participate in the celebration of the International Day of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous Peoples, organized jointly by OHCHR and ILO. Welcoming remarks were 
made by Navanethem Pillay, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Sergei Ordzhonikidze, Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, 
Birgitte Feiring, Chief Technical Advisor of PRO169 (ILO), Jannie Lasimbang, Chairperson </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and Les Malezer and 
Natalia Sarapura, representatives of the Indigenous Peoples Caucus. The celebration also 
included cultural performances by indigenous representatives.  
</p>
<p><b>IV. STUDY ON LESSONS LEARNED AND CHALLENGES TO  
ACHIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT OF  
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO EDUCATION 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited John B. Henriksen, Member of the Expert 
Mechanism, to introduce the study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the 
implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples to education (A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/2).  
</p>
<p>28. At the outset, Mr. Henriksen expressed his gratitude for the valuable documentation 
received from indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, Governments and other sources, including by 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.  
</p>
<p>29. Mr. Henriksen stressed that, although education was an indispensable means of realizing 
other human rights, the full enjoyment of the right to education was unfortunately far from 
reality for too many indigenous peoples. He noted that the deprival of access to quality education 
was a major factor in the social marginalization, poverty and dispossession of indigenous 
peoples. In some instances the content and objectives of education brought about involuntary 
assimilation of indigenous peoples into mainstream society, culture, language and way of life. 
</p>
<p>30. He drew attention to communications submitted to various United Nations bodies and 
mandates by indigenous peoples identifying concerns related to the right to education, such as 
discrimination; lack of control over education initiatives directed at indigenous children; lack of 
consultation on the development and implementation of educational services provided to 
indigenous peoples; limited consideration given to autonomy and participation of indigenous 
peoples in the delivery of educational services, including multicultural and mother-tongue-based 
bilingual education; inadequate development of culturally-appropriate curricula; and failure to 
develop educational opportunities for indigenous peoples that demonstrate respect for their 
history and cultures. He recalled that it was in the light of these concerns that the Human Rights 
Council requested the Expert Members to prepare the present study. 
</p>
<p>31. He presented the main elements of the study, stemming from the discussions held at the 
Expert Mechanism&#8217;s first session: a human rights-based analysis of the scope and content of the 
right to education; an elaboration on indigenous education systems; lessons learned with regard 
to creating national laws and policies enabling the realization of the right to education of 
indigenous peoples; identification of challenges and possible measures to achieve the 
implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education; and thematic advice on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education. 
</p>
<p>32. The Expert explained that, in cooperation with the Expert Mechanism, OHCHR had 
organized and funded a two-day workshop on 6 and 7 May 2009 to discuss the draft study. It 
brought together indigenous and government representatives, United Nations agencies and 
members of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and Expert Members of the Mechanism. The workshop </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>enabled the Expert Members to make further progress on drafting the study; the workshop thus 
proved to be an important contribution to the work of the Expert Mechanism. OHCHR submitted 
a technical report from the workshop to the second session of the Expert Mechanism 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/3). 
</p>
<p>33. Mr. Henriksen introduced the draft study&#8217;s four substantive chapters, namely the 
international human rights framework; indigenous education systems and institutions; lessons 
learned; and challenges and measures. He also stressed the importance of an annex entitled 
&#8220;Expert Advice No. 1 (2009) on the right of indigenous peoples to education&#8221;, which contained a 
comprehensive set of thematic advice. On the chapter related to the human rights framework, he 
presented the following key elements: an overview of relevant international and regional human 
rights instruments and provisions which affirmed, contextualized and elaborated upon the right 
to education; what international human rights provisions stipulated as far as the aim and 
objectives of education are concerned; provisions concerning the access to and the content of 
education; and relevant provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. 
</p>
<p>34. Moreover, Mr. Henriksen emphasized that the elimination of discrimination against 
indigenous peoples was a fundamental precondition for ensuring that indigenous individuals not 
be excluded from education. This required that States take measures to identify existing and 
potential barriers of discrimination of indigenous peoples in the education system, including 
legal, political, administrative and fiscal barriers. Hence, States should establish a method for the 
collection of disaggregated data, and develop indicators conforming to international human 
rights standards, for the purpose of identifying areas of discrimination and other barriers.  
</p>
<p>35. The Expert pointed out that indigenous individuals&#8217; right to education was not only a 
matter of access and availability to education, but also of the content of education - including 
curricula and teaching methods - which have to be culturally appropriate and acceptable to 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>36. He further highlighted the importance of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples as a normative framework for the interpretation of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
education and the need to interpret other instruments in light of the provisions of the Declaration. 
He said that the Declaration was coherent with and expands upon legally binding human rights 
instruments and international jurisprudence of international supervisory bodies and mechanisms. 
The Declaration, interpreted in conjunction with other international instruments, provided an 
authoritative normative framework for the full and effective protection and implementation of 
the rights of indigenous peoples. In the context of education, the Declaration affirmed and 
applied the right to education to the specific historical, cultural, economic and social 
circumstances of indigenous peoples. The study identified a large number of provisions of the 
Declaration, including its articles 1 to 4, 8, 12 to 14, 17, 31 and 44, that either reaffirmed and 
applied the essence of already existing human rights treaty obligations on the right to education, 
or are inseparably linked to the provisions on the right to education in the Declaration, and that 
these were applicable to both traditional and formal education. 
</p>
<p>37. Finally, he briefly introduced the annex of the study, containing a comprehensive set of 
thematic advice related to the right of indigenous peoples to education.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. The Chairperson-Rapporteur, Jannie Lasimbang, the other co-author of the study, 
introduced its chapter III related to &#8220;Indigenous educational systems and institutions&#8221;; chapter IV 
on &#8220;Lessons learned&#8221; and chapter V which covered &#8220;Challenges and measures&#8221;. Regarding the 
indigenous systems and institutions, she explained that the study distinguished traditional 
education from integration of indigenous perspectives and language in mainstream education 
systems. States are expected to equip indigenous communities by integrating their perspectives 
and languages into mainstream education systems and institutions, and also by respecting, 
facilitating and protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; right to transfer knowledge to future generations 
through traditional ways of teaching and learning.  
</p>
<p>39. Ms. Lasimbang said that traditional education could be described as a lifelong pedagogical 
process and an intergenerational transfer of knowledge aimed at maintaining a flourishing and 
harmonious society or community. It was achieved through the principles of participatory 
learning, holistic growth, nurturance and mutual trust. She highlighted indigenous ways of 
learning and transmission of traditional skills and knowledge, including through apprenticeship, 
repetitive practise and instruction, and direct observation.  
</p>
<p>40. She noted that mainstream education systems and institutions usually involved a standard 
set of curricula provided by education ministries based on the Government&#8217;s policy. However, 
the inclusion of indigenous ways of learning, instructing, teaching and training were important in 
ensuring that students/learners and teachers/instructors in mainstream institutions were able to 
benefit from education in a culturally sensitive manner that drew upon, utilized, promoted and 
enhanced awareness of indigenous perspectives and languages.  
</p>
<p>41. She highlighted key lessons learned mentioned in the draft study: creating national laws 
and policies; provision of financial and infrastructure support; international development 
assistance: establishing and controlling traditional education and institutions; interface between 
traditional and mainstream education systems and institutions; teaching of indigenous languages; 
training programmes and certification of teachers and institutions; and networking and 
participation.  
</p>
<p>42. She summarized the challenges and measures identified in the draft study as being the 
non-recognition of traditional education and institutions; discrimination and poor access; issues 
affecting women; aid effectiveness; public spending; institutionalization of educational services; 
governance and creating appropriate curriculum; gaps in educational quality and measurements 
of achievements. 
</p>
<p>43. She referred to the situation in Asia and Africa where indigenous peoples&#8217; rights were not 
always recognized or protected under the law; recognizing traditional education and institutions, 
and respecting indigenous values and knowledge systems and prohibiting discrimination on the 
grounds of ethnic origin, religion or gender provided for in national constitutions are critical. 
Small rural or nomadic communities also faced numerous difficulties in gaining access to State 
educational institutions due to their geographical isolation. She said that special temporary 
measures should also be taken to ensure access to education for internally displaced persons, 
migrant workers and refugees from indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>44. The Chairperson-Rapporteur said that in some communities, indigenous girls were 
prevented from attending schools due to societies&#8217; norms. Issues faced include girls remaining at </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>home to perform domestic chores and to care for children and siblings, being married off at a 
young age, and ongoing exclusion and discrimination. She said that instruments of dialogue to 
help mediate conflicting issues and norms within indigenous societies could include measures to 
ensure equal access to education for indigenous girls and women. She further stated that donors 
and international agencies should prioritize indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education within their 
programmes and strengthen developing countries&#8217; capacities to meet the educational needs of 
indigenous peoples. Financial support for development of materials, testing curricula and 
adequate support and incentives for teachers to teach in rural schools is limited, or unavailable. 
She noted the lack of well-trained, culturally competent teachers as a serious problem which 
could be resolved through recruitment and deployment of teachers from the community. 
</p>
<p>45. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that discrimination and prejudice against indigenous 
peoples&#8217; participation in the planning, programming and implementation of curriculum 
development posed another major challenge. Education was usually centrally controlled by 
Governments, and, in many countries, educational activities not employing government 
curriculum were scrutinized. She concluded by saying that such barriers must be reviewed, with 
an objective of reforming education laws and policies to be more inclusive and sensitive to 
indigenous values and perspectives. Reforms should also emphasize indigenous peoples&#8217; 
decision-making authority. 
</p>
<p>46. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited delegations to make general statements on the draft 
study and provide concrete suggestions to improve the draft under agenda item 3. Several States, 
including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Guatemala, Mexico, Nepal, 
New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Turkey, United States of America and Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of) took the floor to commend the Expert Mechanism for its work on the 
draft study which they found very informative, constructive and useful. Many States expressed 
the view that the Expert Mechanism contribution was helpful to their own reflections on how 
best to improve the educational opportunities available to their indigenous populations, and 
provided a useful tool for States to examine their own efforts to improve education in indigenous 
communities. They provided information on the state of implementation of the right to education 
for indigenous peoples in their respective countries while underlining the challenges in ensuring 
quality education that is culturally appropriate. 
</p>
<p>47. Some good examples were provided regarding programmes for the protection, 
conservation and development of languages or dialects of indigenous communities, including 
preparation of curricula and textbooks in languages spoken by indigenous peoples, and 
comprehensive and targeted scholarship schemes implemented to assist students from indigenous 
communities to attend tertiary-level education.  
</p>
<p>48. The Expert Mechanism was encouraged to provide examples as to how States with many 
ethnic communities could best cope with the need for enhanced resources to finance such 
endeavours, and how to strike a balance between the right to impart education in the mother 
tongues of indigenous communities and the need to impart quality education, or even learn 
mainstream international languages to empower them and to help them compete with their 
national and international counterparts.  
</p>
<p>49. Efforts to ensure quality education and bilingual education were highlighted. In some 
States, priority was being given to strengthening bilingual education through consultations with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>indigenous groups and respecting their vision and teaching materials, and also hiring bilingual 
teachers. Those initiatives revitalized the multicultural and bilingual programmes and schools, 
with teaching materials in native languages. Bilingual education was seen as a tool to promote 
cultural diversity and maintain the identity of the different communities. 
</p>
<p>50. A number of States expressed the view that the report and its theme were not only relevant 
to the Expert Mechanism and to indigenous peoples but also to the wider work of the Human 
Rights Council. They could provide the Council with the perspective and needs of indigenous 
peoples for the effective realization of the right to education. This would help mainstream the 
rights of indigenous peoples in the Council&#8217;s work and highlight the relevance of the Mechanism 
to the Council&#8217;s work. The suggestion was made that the study be considered within the context 
of the Council&#8217;s resolution and mandate on the right to education to ensure an indigenous 
perspective.  
</p>
<p>51. Through many statements, States underlined the requirement that mainstream education 
improve its approach in addressing the needs of indigenous peoples and that a sustained focus on 
indigenous education would provide more opportunities for countries with indigenous 
populations to learn from each other. 
</p>
<p>52. Carlos Mamani, member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, stressed that the 
right of indigenous peoples to self-determination was enshrined in the Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples. He further pointed out that, concerning the right to education for 
indigenous peoples, Governments should incorporate indigenous religions, customs and history 
in the curricula as these are essential to indigenous communities. This approach should be 
adopted from the primary level onwards. The importance of maintaining the languages of 
indigenous peoples was particularly significant. Indigenous peoples should have the ability to 
keep their identity through their own educational system rather than through mainstream 
education. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. Speaking on behalf of all indigenous observers, the Indigenous Global Caucus also 
commended the Expert Mechanism for its draft study and acknowledged the limited resources 
made available to the Mechanism to carry out the study. The Caucus recommended generating a 
broader and more detailed report that would include broad consultation with indigenous peoples 
as well as a body for monitoring the recommendations. It pointed out the need for a structure that 
would include all the parties involved in the matter of education; that would guarantee the 
participation of indigenous peoples; and that would pay particular attention to access to 
education for indigenous girls. The Caucus also underlined the importance and impact that the 
integration of indigenous peoples has in educational programmes, and the inclusion of their 
history as a continuity that links the present with the civilizations that existed prior to 
colonization. It pointed out the importance of emphasizing the need to maintain and perpetuate 
traditional education and the indigenous &#8220;cosmovision&#8221;, so as to recognize, encourage and use 
indigenous peoples&#8217; methodologies for teaching and learning.  
</p>
<p>54. Concerning the concept of quality education, the Caucus recommended a broader 
definition of the concept to include two fundamental elements: first, the inclusion in the 
curriculum of one&#8217;s own culture and the historical connection with civilization prior to 
colonization; and second, the development of those skills necessary to access universal 
knowledge as human rights. It considered that incorporating policies that would permit access to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>all levels of education will allow indigenous peoples to participate in all fields on an equal 
footing and to exercise their right to self-determination when making decisions on matters that 
affect them. The Caucus further recommended the need to establish funds that promote 
education at all levels and that this should benefit from the effective participation of indigenous 
peoples. States and United Nations agencies were also called upon to dedicate substantial funds 
for cultural exchanges that promote best practices.  
</p>
<p>55. Lastly, the Caucus highlighted the need to specify that indigenous peoples are entitled to 
rights that are specific to them by virtue of being indigenous peoples. It concluded by requesting 
that a mechanism, including indigenous organizations, for monitoring the follow-up to the 
recommendations of the study should be established. 
</p>
<p>56. Several indigenous representatives indicated their full support for the draft study and 
suggested that the Expert Mechanism continue to engage with indigenous peoples to promote 
indigenous ways of learning and culturally appropriate education for the realization of the right 
to education. Indigenous representatives from Africa invited the authors of the study to underline 
the particular needs and challenges faced by nomadic and transhumant peoples. Others stressed 
the need to include concrete policies and measures that should be implemented by Governments.  
</p>
<p>57. The representative of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
Musa Bitaye, introduced the work of the Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous 
Populations in Africa as it relates to the right to education. He welcomed the draft study of the 
Expert Mechanism which he found very inspirational and said that the extensive in-country or 
field work of the Working Group has enabled it to learn lessons and identify key challenges to 
the education of indigenous peoples in Africa which, he noted, were addressed in the draft study.  
</p>
<p>58. Mr. Bitaye further underlined the linkage between conflicts that affected indigenous 
communities and their access to education. In certain regions of Africa, failure to address 
conflicts and insecurity in indigenous areas had a diluting effect on efforts to respond to 
educational needs. Moreover, the displacement of indigenous communities from their ancestral 
lands affected negatively the education of their children. He concluded by highlighting that 
indigenous knowledge could contribute substantively to education in Africa. 
</p>
<p>59. In the concluding discussion, Mr. Henriksen thanked observers for their contributions and 
stated that the Expert Mechanism would take into account the comments and suggestions made 
in finalizing the study and submitting it to the Human Rights Council. However, he pointed out 
that certain elements suggested for inclusion in the study were already reflected in the draft. He 
encouraged observers to submit to the Secretariat, in writing, specific and concrete substantive 
suggestions. He said that the Expert Mechanism would review submissions received and 
consider whether it would be necessary to develop an addendum to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s 
Advice No. 1.  
</p>
<p>60. In her concluding remarks, the Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that the issues related to the 
right of indigenous peoples to education were closely linked to other issues such as poverty and 
access to resources. She added that there might be differing views on priorities to take in 
addressing the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, but that the best recourse was to 
ensure indigenous peoples themselves participated in identifying their needs, priorities and 
contributions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the discussion under the agenda item on the 
Implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and its 
sub-item (a) on &#8220;Implementation of the Declaration at the national and regional levels&#8221; and 
sub-item (b) on &#8220;Adjudication, remedies, repatriation, redress and compensation&#8221;. She asserted 
that the sole reference to the Declaration in the preamble of Council resolution 6/36 meant that 
this instrument could constitute a key normative framework in formulating thematic advice from 
the Expert Mechanism. She stressed that the consideration of agenda item 4 (a) was not meant to 
establish the Expert Mechanism as a monitoring body on the implementation of the Declaration. 
Ms. Lasimbang also provided the basis for the discussion on agenda item 4 (b) which can be 
found in articles 8, 10 to 12, 20, 27, 28, 32 and 40 of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>62. Expert Member John Henriksen recalled that, at the first session of the Expert Mechanism, 
the Indigenous Caucus had proposed several thematic issues for discussion, including the right to 
self-determination and adjudication, remedies, repatriation, redress and compensation. The 
Expert Mechanism had opted to include the latter as a sub-item. He also expressed the wish that 
the future thematic focus of the Expert Mechanism would naturally emerge from the discussions 
and informal consultations the Expert Mechanism would be pursuing with governmental 
delegations and representatives of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>63. He said that this agenda item reflects the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s wish to initiate and 
encourage discussions about possible ways and means for making the provisions of the 
Declaration a reality on the ground. He concurred with the Chairperson-Rapporteur that the 
Expert Mechanism had no intention of trying to position itself as a monitoring body for the 
implementation of the Declaration, simply because it is not mandated to do so. He declared that 
the Expert Mechanism nevertheless had a duty to promote respect for and full application of the 
provisions of the Declaration. He further declared that this followed from article 42 of the 
Declaration, which establishes a duty for the United Nations, its bodies and agencies to promote 
the respect for and full application of the Declaration and follow up the effectiveness of the 
instrument.  
</p>
<p>64. Mr. Henriksen affirmed that the main challenge for the international community and for 
Member States was to ensure that the Declaration is implemented at national and regional levels, 
in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples. He underlined that the Declaration 
represents a commitment on the part of the United Nations and its Member States, to its 
provisions, within the framework of the obligations established by the Charter of the 
United Nations to promote and protect human rights in a non-discriminatory basis. He said that 
the Expert Mechanism stands ready to contribute towards the realization of the Declaration 
within the scope of its mandate as established by the Council.  
</p>
<p>65. The Secretariat conveyed some information on the activities that OHCHR has undertaken 
to contribute to the implementation of the Declaration, including promotional, awareness-raising 
and training activities. OHCHR also referred to two documents issued by the Office: one is the 
draft guidelines on the protection of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation in the Amazon 
basin and the other is a report on the technical workshop on natural resource companies, 
indigenous peoples and human rights. These initiatives were welcomed by observers, who </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>stressed the importance of continuing to consult with a variety of stakeholders as future steps are 
undertaken in the development of these activities. In addition, some Governments provided 
information on policies and practices focused on the protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples including those living in isolation. 
</p>
<p>66. Mr. Bitaye, Chairperson of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations/Communities of 
the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights stated that the African Commission, 
through its Working Group, had issued an Advisory Opinion demonstrating that the provisions 
of the then-draft United Nations Declaration were not only consistent with African regional 
human rights standards on peoples&#8217; rights but were also vital to advance the economic, social 
and cultural development of many African communities. He further stressed that since the 
adoption of the Declaration by the General Assembly, in September 2007, the African 
Commission had taken several measures to encourage its implementation by Member States. 
</p>
<p>67. Francisco Cali, Member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD), said that the mission of the Expert Mechanism is extremely important. He went on to 
speak on the work of CERD as regards indigenous peoples. In particular, he referred to the 
Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 23, which concerns indigenous peoples. In this general 
comment CERD highlights, inter alia, the importance of recognizing the cultures and religions of 
indigenous peoples. He concluded by stating that the Declaration is a tool against racial 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>68. The delegations of the following Governments made remarks under agenda item 4: 
Australia, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Denmark, Ecuador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Norway, Paraguay, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic 
of). Representatives of several Governments provided information on their effort to implement 
the Declaration at the national level, including through institutions devoted to combat 
discrimination and through improved participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making. In 
this connection, they highlighted the achievements of effective consultation mechanisms and 
new representative bodies and other initiatives. Related training and awareness-raising activities 
were also brought to the attention of the participants by various Governments, including efforts 
deployed to disseminate the Declaration widely and in indigenous languages.  
</p>
<p>69. Furthermore, several Governments provided information on legislative developments 
aimed at contributing to the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and the 
implementation of the Declaration. The importance of concepts such as sustainable development 
for indigenous peoples was also underlined by Government delegations. Information was 
provided on positive practices regarding repatriation, including in terms of returning 
archaeological artefacts to the indigenous peoples concerned, and measures taken to recognize 
and adjudicate indigenous peoples rights to lands and resources. 
70. Some Governments reported on their recent decisions to endorse the Declaration, and steps 
undertaken to recognize a specific group as indigenous people were also highlighted. A number 
of Government delegations opined that, while the Declaration is not binding, it is nevertheless an 
important policy tool. Similarly, while the Expert Mechanism is not mandated to address 
individual human rights complaints, it can usefully focus on lessons learned and challenges to be 
tackled with a view to contributing to the implementation of the Declaration.<b> </b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>71. Many representatives of indigenous delegations welcomed the discussion on the 
Declaration and its endorsement by their respective Governments, while pointing to the 
challenges that its implementation entails at the national level. Indigenous representatives 
emphasized that the Declaration was the most comprehensive universal international human 
rights instrument explicitly addressing the rights of indigenous peoples. The significance of the 
Declaration as an instrument of reference and a basis for constructive dialogue and reconciliation 
between indigenous peoples was reiterated several times by States and international 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>72. Some indigenous representatives recalled that provisions enshrined in the Declaration 
reflect binding human rights instruments and should be used as a reference by international 
human rights mechanisms, including treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures. They also 
stressed that regional human rights mechanisms, including the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, can also use the Declaration 
in their deliberations, interpretations and decisions.  
</p>
<p>73. The incorporation of the principles of the Declaration in domestic law was viewed by a 
number of speakers as an effective way to ensure the realization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. In 
this respect, various examples were underlined including references to the Declaration in 
constitutional provisions and in domestic jurisprudence. Many observers also stressed that in 
order to ensure that violations of the rights of indigenous peoples are properly addressed, 
effective remedies must be made available for victims of violations. 
</p>
<p>74. Several speakers stressed the importance of expanding the activities that national human 
rights institutions and similar bodies undertake to promote and protect the rights of indigenous 
peoples. The importance of working with the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and regional organizations of NHRIs, such as the 
Asia-Pacific Forum, in developing educational tools and conducting technical assistance 
programmes on the rights of indigenous peoples was underscored in this context.  
</p>
<p>75. Indigenous representatives pointed to efforts to translate and disseminate the Declaration 
and the ongoing need to raise awareness about it within civil society, Governments and 
indigenous peoples at the regional and national levels. It was stressed that it is only through 
dialogue that non-governmental organizations and governmental bodies could effectively pursue 
and implement international commitments under the Declaration. The hope was expressed that 
the work of the Expert Mechanism would contribute to this dialogue and to the promotion of the 
Declaration.  
</p>
<p>76. The need to recognize indigenous peoples as rights holders, as opposed to just 
stakeholders, was underlined and the importance of the principle of free, prior and informed 
consent was highlighted by a number of indigenous representatives, including in relation to 
extractive activities. Some indigenous representatives further stated that the right to 
self-determination and the right to free, prior and informed consent constituted prerequisites for 
the enjoyment of other rights enshrined in the Declaration and called on the Expert Mechanism 
to take this into account in its work.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>77. Jos&#233; Carlos Morales thanked the participants for their important contributions to the 
debate. He provided information on some of the achievements and challenges faced in the 
implementation of the Declaration in Latin America. He noted that the region has undergone a 
constant process of evolution during recent decades, involving constitutional reforms and 
specific legislation. He stated that there is increasing recognition and support for the rights of 
indigenous peoples and the implementation of the Declaration. Mr. Morales expressed the hope 
that more Governments and indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations in the region will in the future 
submit timely information and share their experiences in the context of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s 
discussions. 
</p>
<p>78. John Henriksen stated that the discussion under item 4 had revealed once again the 
comprehensiveness and complexity of the contents of the Declaration, and that individual 
provisions cannot be interpreted nor implemented in isolation as the articles of the Declaration 
are interconnected, and connected to other international human rights instruments. He said that 
the discussion demonstrated the need for States and indigenous peoples to work together to 
achieve the goals of the Declaration and that other actors such as NHRIs have a crucial role to 
play. He stressed the importance of building training capacity and wide translation and 
distribution of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>79. Mr. Henriksen said that there appears to be broad agreement between States and 
indigenous peoples that issues related to implementation of the Declaration need to be addressed 
within the framework of the Expert Mechanism. He said that the debate demonstrated that there 
have been some positive developments in various countries, either as a consequence of the 
Declaration, or as a result of national processes undertaken in the spirit of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>80. He emphasized that the debate unfortunately also proves that indigenous peoples are still 
facing serious problems as a consequence of the continued denial of their rights and freedoms, 
including serious human rights violations, and that in some instances practically nothing has 
happened despite the fact that the Declaration now is a reality.  
</p>
<p>81. He noted that the debate also revealed the need for States and indigenous peoples to work 
together in order to achieve the goals of the Declaration. In many instances it seems extremely 
important to focus on reconciliation, as an important precondition for making the Declaration a 
reality on the ground. He concluded by stating that the Expert Mechanism would continue 
addressing the implementation of the Declaration, but that its work might need to be focused 
further.  
</p>
<p>82. He referred to the various suggestions made by observers as to which thematic issues the 
Expert Mechanism should focus on, including the right to self-determination, the resource 
dimension of the right to self-determination, the principle of free, prior and informed consent, 
consultations, indigenous peoples&#8217; rights pertaining to lands, territories and natural resources, 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to health, linguistic rights, and remedies for infringements of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. In principle, no issue or right that is addressed in the Declaration 
should be regarded as being off-limits for the Mechanism&#8217;s work and that it nevertheless needs 
to identify its thematic focus and priorities in compliance with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. Mr. Henriksen concluded by saying that the debate also indicated that one of the main 
concerns or problems seems to be related to the fact that indigenous peoples often have limited 
opportunities to determine priorities for their own development and to effectively participate in 
decision-making processes affecting their rights and lives. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  ADOPTION OF THE REPORT AND PROPOSALS 
</b></p>
<p>84. At its last meeting, the Expert Mechanism adopted the operative parts of the report on its 
second session, which include the following: a study on the right of indigenous peoples to 
education; five proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council; and one proposal 
addressed to the United Nations specialized agencies. The agreement and proposals are 
contained in section II above of the present report. All proposals were adopted by consensus by 
the members of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>85. Proposal 1 relates to a possible thematic study on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate 
in decision-making. In presenting the proposal, the Chairperson-Rapporteur said that although 
the Expert Mechanism notes that the Human Rights Council would be considering the thematic 
focus for the next session of the Expert Mechanism in 2010, the Mechanism considers that the 
acceptance of such a theme would coincide with the priorities and interest of indigenous peoples. 
Participation in decision-making is a key issue that was raised by many delegates in the course of 
the session. The elaboration by the Expert Mechanism of the scope and challenges of the right to 
participation, while using the Declaration as a framework, would be an important contribution to 
the work of the Council.  
</p>
<p>86. Proposal 2 relates to human rights institutions and mechanisms. In presenting the proposal, 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur said that human rights institutions at the national and regional levels 
have a crucial role to play in promoting and protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. Due to the 
complexity of such rights, it may be important for States to consider the establishment of specific 
national institutions on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>87. Proposal 3 relates to the Human Rights Council&#8217;s consideration of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights during its sessions. In presenting the proposal, the Chairperson-Rapporteur specified that it 
offers suggestions for better focus on the rights of indigenous peoples during Human Rights 
Council sessions.  
</p>
<p>88. Proposal 4 concerns the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations. In 
presenting the proposal, the Chairperson-Rapporteur underscored that it is a follow-up proposal 
from the first session (see A/HRC/10/56), which reiterates the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s view that 
indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in the Human Rights Council and in the work of 
United Nations treaty bodies is crucial.  
</p>
<p>89. Proposal 5 relates to the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. In 
presenting the proposal, the Chairperson-Rapporteur submitted that as a follow-up to the request 
to the Expert Mechanism to undertake a review of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, and to submit recommendations as contributions to the outcome of the Durban Review 
Conference, contained in Human Rights Council resolution 9/7. She recalled that at its 
first session, the Expert Mechanism adopted its proposal 2 on the rights of indigenous peoples 
which was submitted to the Preparatory Committee of the Durban Review Conference.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>90. Finally, the Expert Mechanism adopted a proposal addressing the responsibilities of 
United Nations specialized agencies in promoting respect for and full application of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In presenting the proposal, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur said that the proposal is self-explanatory, and hence does not require 
any further introduction.  
</p>
<p>91. The Chairperson-Rapporteur informed the participants that the narrative part of the report 
on the second session was still in draft form and would not be circulated to the participants. She 
added that the report would be finalized and adopted after the session, before being submitting to 
the Human Rights Council at its twelfth session.  
</p>
<p>92. In her closing statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed her deep appreciation to all 
participants for their excellent cooperation throughout the session and appealed for continued 
support and contribution to the work of the Expert Mechanism. She also expressed appreciation 
to the Secretariat for the organization of the session.
