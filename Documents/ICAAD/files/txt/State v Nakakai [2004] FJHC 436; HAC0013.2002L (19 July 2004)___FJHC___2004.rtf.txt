IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI

CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL CASE NO. HAC0013 OF 2002L

THE STATE

V

MATAIASI NAKAKAI

Counsel: Mr. K. Tunidau for the State
Ms. J. Nair for the Accused

SENTENCE

You have pleaded guilty to the charge of murder of your wife and you have been convicted of that offence.

The legislation imposes a statutory period of life imprisonment for a person convicted of murder.

Whilst in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for me to impose a minimum term that you should serve, I see no basis for so doing and accordingly you are sentenced to imprisonment for life and that sentence is to date from today.
