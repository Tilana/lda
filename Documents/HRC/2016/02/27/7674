</p>
<p> In the present report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights acknowledges the progress made in reconstruction and the implementation 
of some of the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission. The Government of Sri Lanka has, however, failed to ensure independent and 
credible investigations into past violations of international human rights and humanitarian 
law. The report also contains updates on the ongoing attacks on religious minorities, and 
the harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists.  
</p>
<p>The Government has not responded to the offers of technical assistance made by the 
High Commissioner and the special procedures. Meanwhile, new evidence continues to 
emerge on the events that took place in the final stages of the armed conflict. Against this 
background, the High Commissioner recommends the establishment of an independent, 
international inquiry mechanism, which would contribute to establishing the truth where 
domestic inquiry mechanisms have failed.

</b></p>
<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/1, 
in which the Council encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the 
constructive recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission,1 as 
well as those made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her 
report,2 and to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of 
violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.3  
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 22/1, the Human Rights Council also encouraged the Government of 
Sri Lanka to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and 
commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, 
accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans, and to cooperate with the special 
procedures. It also encouraged the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) and 
relevant special procedures mandate holders to provide advice and technical assistance on 
implementing the above-mentioned steps. Lastly, the Council requested OHCHR to present 
a comprehensive report on the implementation of the resolution at its twenty-fifth session, 
with input from relevant special procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Engagement of the Office of the High Commissioner and the 
special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>3. At the invitation of the Government, the High Commissioner visited Sri Lanka from 
25 to 31 August 2013. In accordance with the request made by the Human Rights Council 
in resolution 21/1, she presented an oral update on the situation to the Council at its twenty-
fourth session (A/HRC/24/CRP.3/Rev.1), in which she suggested concrete steps that the 
Government could take that could help the Council to assess progress made in the areas 
identified by the Council in resolution 22/1 by the time of its twenty-fifth session. These 
included inviting the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the 
Independent Expert on minority issues; demonstrating a credible national investigation 
process with tangible results, including the successful prosecution of individual 
perpetrators; and setting a clear timeline for disengagement of the military from activities 
that are meant to be civilian. Regrettably, none of these steps had been taken by the end of 
the period of review.  
</p>
<p>4. The Government of Sri Lanka did not respond positively to the offer of technical 
assistance made by the High Commissioner following an OHCHR technical mission to Sri 
Lanka in November 2012. On 31 October 2013, following her visit to Sri Lanka, the High 
Commissioner again addressed a letter to the Minister for External Affairs and other 
officials in which she reiterated the readiness of her Office to provide technical assistance. 
The areas of possible assistance highlighted by the High Commissioner were in line with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Commission was appointed in May 2010 by the President of Sri Lanka to investigate the facts 
</p>
<p>and circumstances that led to the failure of the 2002 ceasefire agreement, the lessons to be learned 
from those events, and to suggest institutional, administrative and legislative measures to prevent any 
recurrence of such events, and to promote national unity and reconciliation among all communities. 
The report of the Commission is available from www.llrcaction.gov.lk/reports/en/Final_LLRC_ 
Report_en.pdf.

  A/HRC/22/38. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 For the comments of the Government of Sri Lanka on the draft version of the present report, see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/G/9. </p>


<p>some of the recommendations accepted by the Government during its universal periodic 
review and with those made by the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts on Accountability 
in Sri Lanka.4 The High Commissioner regrets that she has received no response.  
</p>
<p>5. With regard to the issue of disappearances, the High Commissioner urged the 
Government to invite the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, to 
ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, and to finalize measures to criminalize disappearances in national law.  
</p>
<p>6. With regard to criminal justice and accountability, the High Commissioner offered 
technical assistance in various areas, including draft legislation on hate speech and witness 
and victim protection, to ensure compliance with relevant international standards. In 
relation to some long outstanding criminal investigations, the High Commissioner offered 
to identify international experts who could assist the national inquiries.  
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the High Commissioner offered to provide technical advice on how 
truth-seeking mechanisms and reparations policies could be developed in accordance with 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>8. On 17 December 2013, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights met with 
the Secretary of Defence of Sri Lanka, in New York, and reiterated the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s offer of technical cooperation. Subsequently, on 20 January 2014, the 
High Commissioner met with the Secretary to the President, Lalith Weerathunga, in 
Geneva. 
</p>
<p>9. There are currently nine outstanding requests to visit Sri Lanka by special 
procedures: on minority issues; freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; freedom 
of opinion and expression; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; enforced or 
involuntary disappearances; human rights defenders; independence of judges and lawyers; 
discrimination against women in law and practice; and truth, justice, reparation and 
guarantees of non-recurrence. In October 2013, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association followed up on their requests to visit or made specific 
offers of technical assistance. These requests remain pending. Since January 2012, the 
Government has transmitted responses on 842 cases to the Working Group dating back to 
the 1990s. 
</p>
<p>10. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
internally displaced persons visited Sri Lanka from 2 to 6 December 2013 (see also para. 14 
below). In August 2013, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education received an 
invitation from the Government, but had to defer his visit owing to conflicting 
engagements. The Government has since extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants to visit the country in May 2014.  
</p>
<p>11. The High Commissioner welcomes the Government&#8217;s engagement in these 
important issues, but reiterates her calls to invite the special procedures on enforced or 
involuntary disappearances and minority issues as a matter of priority, considering that 
these issues featured prominently in the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission and have also been identified by the Human Rights Council as 
key concerns.

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Recent human rights developments 
</b></p>
<p>12. In her oral update to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session, the 
High Commissioner acknowledged the achievements made by the Government, with the 
help of the international community, in demining, resettlement, reconstruction and 
rehabilitation since 2009. She welcomed the elections to the Northern Provincial Council in 
September 2013, and recommended that the Government should work with new provincial 
authorities to promote meaningful community participation in reconstruction and 
development programmes. She however also highlighted pressing concerns, including the 
lack of progress in accountability for serious human rights violations; the situation of 
detainees and former combatants, with regard to extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary 
killings; continued militarization5 and compulsory land acquisition6 (particularly in the 
north and east of the country); shrinking space for civil society and the media; rising 
religious intolerance; and the undermining of independent institutions, including the 
judiciary.  
</p><p>13. Following his visit in December 2013, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons also acknowledged the reconstruction effort, but emphasized 
the need to promote durable solutions and to address the protection of women and girls, 
access to land, and the withdrawal of the military from all civilian functions.7  
</p>
<p>14. In its comments on a draft version of the present report, the Government of Sri 
Lanka stated that, since 2009, the total strength of the military had been reduced by 
approximately 30 per cent in the Northern Province, and by 26 per cent in the Eastern 
Province, and the vast majority of checkpoints had been removed. It added that a total of 
20,011 acres of private land and 5,740 acres of State land had been released in the two 
provinces. The High Commissioner noted, however, reports that more than 6,000 acres of 
private land had been acquired by the State in Jaffna around the Palaly cantonement, and 
that more than 2,000 petitioners had taken legal action to reclaim their land.8 The 
Government stated that steps were being taken to compensate the owners.  
</p>
<p>15. The High Commissioner remains concerned that non-governmental organizations 
are still required to register and report through a secretariat under the Ministry of Defence. 
She also draws attention to concerns that women are vulnerable to sexual harassment and 
violence when there is a heavy military presence.9 For instance, in May 2013, a soldier 
attached to an army camp in Nedunkerny reportedly confessed to raping a 6-year-old child. 
In its comments on the present report, the Government reported that the military had taken 
strict action in such cases.

<p><b> A. Former combatants and detainees 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the visit of the High Commissioner, the Government informed her that more 
than 11,758 former combatants had been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society, 234 
detainees were undergoing rehabilitation, and 91 detainees were facing legal proceedings. 
The Government also reported that the files of 977 detainees who had been held for long 
periods of time without charge had been opened, and that 160 files were pending a decision 
by the end of January 2014.10  
</p>
<p>17. The High Commissioner welcomes such progress and urges the Government to 
expedite decision-making on pending cases by bringing charges, releasing or sending 
individuals for rehabilitation, and to ensure that lawyers have access to their clients. 
</p>
<p>18. The High Commissioner again urges the Government to repeal the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act and the regulations promulgated under it, which allow for arbitrary 
detention.  
</p>
<p>19. The High Commissioner notes with appreciation the Government&#8217;s report that all 
former child combatants had been reintegrated by May 2010 and been provided with formal 
education.11 At the same time, she reminds the Government that, as highlighted in Lessons 
Learnt and Reconciliation Commission recommendation 9.79, there has yet to be any 
prosecutions or trials for the war crime of child recruitment, including against former 
cadres of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and former paramilitary leaders 
now serving in the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Attacks on religious minorities, human rights defenders and freedom of 
opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>20. The High Commissioner remains deeply disturbed by the significant surge in attacks 
against religious minorities and the incitement of violence by Sinhala Buddhist nationalist 
groups, led predominantly by certain extremist Buddhist monks. She received reports from 
the Secretariat for Muslims, a non-governmental organization, according to which there 
were some 280 incidents of threats and violence against Muslims in 2013,12 as well as 
attacks on mosques and places of business. Christian groups also reported more than 103 
incidents of attacks on churches and Christians in 2013. After a lull prior to the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, five violent attacks led by Buddhist monks 
were reported against multiple churches in December 2013 and January 2014. In its 
comments on the present report, the Government cited 182 incidents affecting all religions, 
of which only 147 were reported to police. Although the Government stated that, the police 
had taken necessary action, in many cases perpetrators were readily identifiable in video 
footage, where police are seen standing as onlookers to the violence. The Government also 
reported that amending legislation to enhance existing provisions of the Penal Code and 
ICCPR Act with regard to hate speech had been prepared. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR continues to receive complaints of widespread harassment and intimidation 
targeting human rights defenders, activists, lawyers and journalists, including reprisals 
against those who engage with the United Nations human rights mechanisms and OHCHR. 
The High Commissioner expressed grave concern at the harassment and intimidation

<p>against individuals or groups who met or attempted to meet with her, even months after her 
visit. OHCHR received reports of at least 10 serious cases involving targeting individuals 
and groups between the end of October and November 2013 in the run-up to and during the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting hosted by Sri Lanka. These included the 
case of a prominent human rights defender who, on 4 November, was the target of threats 
and derogatory remarks during a radio broadcast hosted by the State-owned Sri Lankan 
Broadcasting Corporation. In another instance, on 13 November, the police blocked buses 
carrying members of families of the disappeared as they were travelling to Colombo to 
participate in a human rights event and in a demonstration calling for accountability for 
enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>22. Attacks against journalist and media outlets continued in 2013. Several incidents 
targeted the Tamil newspaper <i>Uthayan</i>: on 10 January, two distributers were attacked and 
copies of newspapers burned; on 13 April, armed men attacked employees and set fire to 
printing machines in the Jaffna office; and, on 11 July, armed men attacked the newsroom. 
On 24 August, an associate editor of the <i>Sunday Leader</i> was attacked by masked men at her 
home, and her computer was stolen in a subsequent break-in, on 8 September.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings 
</b>23. The High Commissioner and several special procedures mandate holders continued 
to follow developments in recent cases in which the apparent excessive use of force led to 
the death of unarmed protesters or of prison inmates. On 1 August 2013, approximately 
6,000 residents of Weliweriya, a small suburb of Colombo, protested against the State&#8217;s 
failure to address community concerns about the contamination of their drinking water 
supply by a local factory. Army personnel were deployed in support of the police to control 
the protest, which had turned violent and reportedly used excessive force, leaving three 
people dead and many others with critical injuries.13 On 2 August 2013, the Army 
Commander appointed a military court of inquiry into the incident. The court submitted its 
report on 21 August, but it has not been made public. On 30 August 2013, the Army 
announced that four senior officers had been relieved of their duties with immediate effect, 
although no court martial has been initiated.14 The factory has since been relocated and 
compensation offered to the families of those killed.  
</p>
<p>24. On 12 November 2012, the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms appointed 
a committee to inquire into events in Welikada prison on 9 November 2012, when Special 
Task Force personnel conducted a search operation and army personnel subsequently 
intervened to control a riot; at least 27 inmates were killed and 43 injured.15 The committee 
handed over its report to the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms on 15 January 
2014, but it has not been published. According to media reports, it concludes that the 
prisoners shot each other. The Government informed the High Commissioner that a similar 
inquiry had been carried out into custodial deaths when security forces had stormed

<p>Vavuniya prison to free officials taken hostage by prisoners in June 2012, which was 
highlighted in her previous report,16 but to date no report has been made public. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mass graves  
</b></p>
<p>25. On 26 November 2012, a mass grave with approximately 155 skeletal remains was 
uncovered in Matale, central Sri Lanka. In June 2013, a presidential commission of inquiry 
was appointed to probe the circumstances surrounding the gravesite, despite the initiation of 
a judicial process in the Matale Magistrate&#8217;s Court. There are concerns regarding the 
manner in which the remains are being preserved, the protection of the site and the 
investigation process.17 In December 2013, it was reported that another gravesite with 52 
skeletal remains, including of children, was discovered in Mannar, northern Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>26. It is vital that the integrity of the sites, and exhumation and identification 
procedures, be given due attention. The rights of families to know the fate of their missing 
loved ones is critical, and they must be actively involved in the legal and humanitarian 
efforts to locate, exhume, rebury and memorialize the dead. In this context, an 
uncompromised exhumation and investigation process is essential, and could benefit from 
international assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implementation of the recommendations of the Lessons 
Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
</b>27. In May 2012, the Cabinet appointed a presidential task force to monitor the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission. In July 2012, the task force issued a national plan of action for the 
implementation of some of the recommendations. The Government released its latest 
update on the implementation of the plan of action in January 2014.18 The High 
Commissioner had the opportunity to discuss progress with the Secretary to the President 
on 20 January 2014. 
</p>
<p>28. The High Commissioner welcomes the progress reported in implementing a number 
of recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, for 
instance giving effect to the trilingual policy, promoting the official use of the Tamil 
language, the upgrading of schools in the northern and eastern provinces, and measures to 
promote ethnic diversity in schools and equity of access to higher education.  
</p>
<p>29. Noting the breadth and depth of the full range of recommendations made by the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the High Commissioner has questioned 
the process and rationale for the Government&#8217;s selectivity in implementing only some of 
the recommendations. In some instances, as discussed below, she also observed that certain 
recommendations had been watered down in the national plan of action or during various 
stages of implementation. 
</p>
<p>30. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made approximately 285 
recommendations. In the national plan of action, the Government pledged to support the 
implementation of 92 recommendations. In August 2013, it announced that it would

<p> 
</p>
<p>16
  A/HRC/22/38, para. 21. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>17
 For instance, the Matale magistrate overseeing the inquiry was subsequently transferred &#8211; according 
</p>
<p>to the Government, on disciplinary grounds &#8211; to Colombo.  
 
</p>
<p>18
  Available from www.llrcaction.gov.lk/npoa.html. </p>


<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>implement an additional 53 recommendations,19 bringing the total to 145 recommendations. 
At the universal periodic review of Sri Lanka in November 2012, the Government stated 
that some of the remaining Commission recommendations fell under the ambit and scope of 
the national plan of action for the protection and promotion of human rights (2011-2016), 
progress reports on which are not available in the public domain.  
</p>
<p>31. In many instances, however, the specified activity in the national plan of action does 
not fully correspond to or address the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission, or the activity has been only partially completed. For instance, 
while recommendation 9.73 calls for the investigation of allegations against illegal armed 
groups, the corresponding activity is the disarming of armed groups.20 
</p>
<p>32. In other examples, recommendation 9.46 called upon the Government to direct law 
enforcement authorities to take immediate steps to ensure that allegations of abductions, 
enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention are properly investigated and perpetrators 
brought to justice. The corresponding activity identified by the Government does not 
respond to the call for investigations, but focuses on the capacity-building of police and 
community policing.21 Recommendation 9.270 called for the establishment of interfaith 
mechanisms to facilitate early warning and prevention of communal or religious violence, 
but this is being implemented by civil defence committees established by the Ministry of 
Defence during the war.22  
</p>
<p>33. Little progress has been made with other key recommendations relating to justice 
and accountability issues, a core concern for the Human Rights Council; for instance, 
recommendation 9.120 urged the Government to implement the recommendations of the 
report of the presidential commission of inquiry (the Udalagama Commission) appointed in 
2006 to investigate alleged serious violations of human rights committed since August 
2005,23 particularly the killing of five students in Trincomalee, in January 2006, and of 17 
aid workers of Action contre la Faim, in August 2006. Limited progress has been reported 
under the national plan of action on these two cases (see paras. 47 &#8211; 64 below); 
furthermore, the plan does not address any of the other 13 high-profile cases investigated by 
the Udalagama Commission, including the murder of a former Minister for Foreign Affairs 
and of other parliamentarians, and the disappearance of a Catholic priest. 
</p>
<p>34. Recommendation 9.213 called upon the Government to investigate the serious 
allegations against illegal armed groups (some of which had operated as paramilitaries), and 
to prosecute and punish perpetrators irrespective of their political links. In the national plan

<p>Chief Minister of the Eastern Province, Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (alias Pillaiyan), all 
of whom are linked to numerous allegations of serious crimes during the armed conflict.25 
Both Karuna and Pillaiyan were former LTTE commanders who subsequently formed the 
breakaway Karuna faction named in the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as 
well as successive reports of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict as being 
responsible for child recruitment, a war crime.26  
</p>
<p><b> V. Progress in accountability issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic initiatives  
</b></p>
<p>36. In its resolution 22/1, the Human Rights Council called upon the Government to 
conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law and to take all necessary additional steps 
to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent 
actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. A 
number of the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission also called for further investigation into specific cases and issues, in particular 
allegations of the indiscriminate killing of civilians and the summary execution of 
prisoners. To date, the Government has taken limited and piecemeal steps towards 
investigating serious allegations of violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law, and none of these have had the independence or credibility required.  
</p>
<p>37. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission recommended further 
investigations into, inter alia, the circumstances under which specific instances of death or 
injury to civilians could have occurred, and, that, if such investigations disclosed wrongful 
conduct, that perpetrators be prosecuted and punished, as well as into the Channel 4 video 
recordings to establish the truth of the allegations arising from them. The Commander of 
the Army convened a military court of inquiry in February 2012 to investigate and submit a 
report on the observations made by the Commission. Little, however, is known about the 
proceedings, as the court has been closed to the public and it has not issued any report.  
</p>
<p>38. In its update of the national plan of action of January 2014, the Government reported 
that the court of inquiry of the Sri Lanka Army completed in February 2013 its 
investigation into the allegation of killings of civilians, and concluded that instances of 
shelling referred to in the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission had 
not been caused by the Army, and that civilian causalities might have been due to unlawful 
acts by the LTTE. The Government reported that the second part of the investigation into 
allegations made in the Channel 4 video was under way.  
</p>
<p>39. The High Commissioner has observed that military courts of inquiry do not have the 
necessary impartiality and independence to inspire confidence. The Commander of the 
Army who established the courts was also the commander of the security forces in the main 
battle zone of the conflict, and was actively engaged in the overall military planning and

<p>operations there. In cases of alleged human rights violations by the military or armed 
forces, investigations should be carried out by civilian authorities, not by the armed forces 
themselves.27  
</p>
<p>40. According to the Government, the Census on Human and Property Damages due to 
Conflict, completed in December 2013, will shed light on the number of civilian deaths and 
injuries during the war, as well as on the fate of missing persons. The results are reportedly 
being analysed. The outcome of the census will not, however, provide a total picture of all 
those who have died or disappeared since 1982; for instance, data were collected only from 
the immediate family members of those dead or missing, thereby missing those cases where 
all family members had died, disappeared or left the country.  
</p>
<p>41. Other issues for which the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
recommended further investigation remain unaddressed by the courts of inquiry or any 
other process. For instance, in paragraph 9.114 of its report, the Commission expressed 
deep concern at the persistent reports concerning the killing of journalists and other forms 
of attacks on journalists and media institutions, and the fact that these incidents still had to 
be conclusively investigated and perpetrators brought to justice. 
</p><p>42. The High Commissioner is also concerned that legal proceedings have not begun 
against any LTTE suspect for alleged war crimes or other human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>43. In August 2013, the Government announced the appointment, by the President, of 
the new Commission of Inquiry on Disappearances. The Commission, which conducted its 
first public sittings from 18 to 21 January 2014, in Kilinochchi District, received 
approximately 13,700 complaints from all parts of the country.28 The Government has also 
sought information from other countries concerning Sri Lankans who may now be abroad. 
The High Commissioner welcomes this effort, but notes that the Commission will only 
cover disappearances in the northern and eastern provinces between 1990 and 2009. Many 
disappearances reported in Colombo and other parts of the country in recent years will 
therefore not fall within its scope.  
</p>
<p>44. In November 2013, the Government announced that the Human Rights Commission 
of Sri Lanka would conduct a national inquiry into allegations of torture committed 
between 2009 and 2013, with the support of the Human Rights Division of the 
Commonwealth Secretariat. In early December 2013, the Commission announced that the 
inquiry had been postponed indefinitely.29  
</p>
<p>45. In her previous report,30 the High Commissioner recommended that Sri Lanka 
should establish a more comprehensive truth-seeking mechanism, which would build upon 
the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. It is important 
to stress that any truth-seeking mechanism must fully comply with the State&#8217;s international 
legal obligations, and must be fully independent, including the selection of its members and

<p>budgetary considerations. It should enjoy the broadest possible mandate covering the entire 
period of the conflict and the whole territory. It should be based on a broad national 
consultation process, which should include the views of victims and survivors and of civil 
society organizations from all parts of the country. Lessons must be learned from the failure 
of past commissions of inquiry to ensure that any new mechanism enjoys the independence 
and powers necessary to be effective. For instance, any comprehensive truth mechanism 
should be established on a specific legislation meant for the mechanism, not under the 
currently flawed Commission of Inquiries Act.  
</p>
<p>46. The High Commissioner notes that it would not be permissible for any truth 
mechanism to grant amnesties that prevent the prosecution of individuals who may be 
criminally responsible for war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or gross 
violations of human rights, including gender-specific violations. A truth commission should 
consider seeking international support, for example special technical, legal and policy 
assistance, as well as the involvement of international investigators to assist the process. 
Lastly, any such truth commissions should be complemented by comprehensive and 
coherent transitional justice mechanisms and processes that include prosecution, 
reparations, vetting and other accountability or reform programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Emblematic cases 
</b></p>
<p>47. The failure of the Government to make any significant progress towards 
accountability is illustrated by the lack of independent and credible investigations into 
allegations of serious human rights violations in several emblematic cases. These cases 
have been repeatedly been drawn to the attention of the Human Rights Council by the High 
Commissioner and international human rights mechanisms. The Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel 
of Experts highlighted in its report many of these cases (paras. 149, 170 and 414), which 
were investigated by previous national commissions of inquiry and for which the Lessons 
Learnt and Reconciliation Commission also recommended further investigations. In some 
cases, the Government has repeatedly reported to the Council that progress had been made 
in investigations. None of these cases has, however, resulted in the perpetrators being 
brought to justice. These cases are only a small but representative sample of the grave 
allegations of serious human rights violations committed by the Government and the LTTE 
during the conflict that have yet to be investigated or remain unresolved. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Trincomalee five  
</b></p>
<p>48. On 2 January 2006, five students were allegedly beaten and executed by Sri Lankan 
security forces at the Trincomalee sea-front. The Trincomalee Magistrate&#8217;s Court 
concluded in its inquest that the deaths had been due to gunshot injuries, and directed the 
police to conduct further investigations and to bring the suspects to court. A number of 
special task force members at the scene were detained as suspects soon after the incident, 
but released the same year. Since then, the magistrate in Trincomalee has postponed the 
case on a monthly basis, requesting the Criminal Investigation Division to produce reports 
of its investigations. The Division has failed to do so and has not provided justifiable 
reasons for the delay. Several witnesses and their family members fled the country after 
receiving threats.31 
</p>
<p>49. In 2006 and 2007, the Trincomalee case was investigated by the Udalagama 
Commission, which was observed by an international independent group of eminent

<p>persons. The Government has never published the Commission&#8217;s report. The case was also 
investigated by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka at the time; its report, which 
concluded that security forces had been involved, first appeared in the public domain in 
January 2014.32 The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission had expressed dismay 
at the lack of follow-up to the findings of the Udalagama Commission, and recommended 
that the Government investigate the killings further.  
</p>
<p>50.  In 2013, the Government informed the Human Rights Council that the Attorney-
General had instructed the police to commence a non-summary inquiry before judicial 
authorities. At the time, the Government noted that the matter &#8220;may be brought to a 
conclusion and is concrete evidence of our commitment to accountability&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>51. In June 2013, 12 Special Task Force officers were arrested and remanded in 
connection with the murders. The Senior Superintendent of Police, who was in command at 
the time, was not among them (he has since been promoted to Deputy Inspector General 
and returned to Trincomalee). The Attorney-General informed the High Commissioner in 
August 2013 that the anticipated time frame for proceedings of this kind was three months, 
but pointed out the difficulties in convincing witnesses to come forward. The officers were 
released on bail in October 2013. On 20 January 2014, during a meeting with the Secretary 
to the President, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office informed the High Commissioner that 
evidence had been recorded from 14 witnesses, and affidavits examined from another 
seven. The Attorney-General&#8217;s Office has summonsed a further 14 witnesses, although had 
had difficulties contacting those outside the country. After eight years of investigations, 
commissions of inquiry and repeated commitments by the Government, it is of great 
concern that this case has not been brought to a conclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action contre la Faim  
</b></p>
<p>52. On 4 August 2006, 17 aid workers from Action contre la Faim were executed at their 
office premises in Muttur, when the Government and LTTE were fighting for control of the 
town.34 
</p>
<p>53. An inquest into the killings began in the Muttur Magistrate&#8217;s Court on 15 August 
</p><p>2006. In subsequent months, however, the case was transferred to Anuradhapura then to 
Kantale, and then back to Anuradhapura. In November 2007, the magistrate of 
Anuradhapura was transferred to another location and the case was sent back to the 
magistrate in Muttur (a different magistrate to the one who initially heard the case in 
August 2006), where it has since ground to a halt. Action contre la Faim lodged a complaint 
with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, later complaining of its total 
ineffectiveness and lack of cooperation.35 
</p>

substantial inquiries into the case and made serious allegations about its mishandling by the

<p>Attorney-General&#8217;s Department, the police, the Judicial Medical Officer and the Ministry of 
Justice. They noted that officials had destroyed, removed and otherwise tampered with 
evidence. The families of the victims had been intimidated, threatened and, in some cases, 
encouraged to sign statements of withdrawal.36  
</p>
<p>55. The case was also among those investigated by the Udalagama Commission in 
2007/08, although its report has never been published. The Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission recommended that the Government should complete the 
investigation and prosecute those responsible. During the High Commissioner&#8217;s visit to Sri 
Lanka, the Attorney-General informed her that he had instructed his staff to re-examine 
archived files, while pointing out that the investigation was proceeding slowly. In its 
comments on the present report, the Government stated that a team of senior prosecutors 
continued to pursue various lines of inquiry, although it has not been possible to establish 
the identity of those responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Executions of prisoners and those who surrendered 
</b></p>
<p>56. Since the end of the armed conflict in 2009, video and photographic material have 
emerged depicting scenes from the last phase of the war, in which prisoners appear to have 
been killed upon their surrender or while in the custody of the security forces.  
</p>
<p>57. In June 2011, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions presented a technical report to the Human Rights Council that demonstrated the 
authenticity of portions of the video footage first broadcast by Channel 4 in August 2009.37 
On 10 September 2009, the Government had announced the outcome of its own technical 
analysis on the basis of which it disputed the previous findings of the Special Rapporteur. 
In response, the Special Rapporteur commissioned independent experts to undertake a 
technical analysis, which confirmed his initial conclusion. While the Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission did not reach a firm conclusion on the authenticity of the 
material, it recommended that the Government should conduct further investigations. 
According to the Government, this is now the subject of a second stage of proceedings by 
the military court of inquiry, yet to be concluded.38  
</p>
<p><b>(a) Balachandran</b> <b>Prabhakaran 
</b>58.<b> </b>In February 2013, a series of photographs emerged depicting Balachandran 
Prabhakaran, the 12-year-old son of LTTE leader Villupillai Prabhakaran, sitting in a 
bunker, alive and apparently in the custody of Sri Lankan troops, then his apparently dead 
body lying on the ground, his chest pierced by bullets. The photographs were taken in May 
2009, a few hours apart and with the same camera. The authorities have maintained that the 
boy was killed in cross-fire.  
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> <b>T. Thurairajasingham (alias Colonel Ramesh)</b> 
59.<b> </b>Video and photographic material obtained by Channel 4 and other sources depict 
LTTE commander Colonel Ramesh being interrogated by Sri Lankan security forces, 
followed by still images of his mutilated dead body. According to several witness 
testimonies to the events surrounding the fate of Colonel Ramesh, he was in the custody of 
the security forces at the time of his death.

<p><b>(c)</b>  <b>Shoba (alias Isaipriya)</b> 
60.<b> </b> The analysis by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions of the Channel 4 photographic and video material of the death of a high-profile 
member of the LTTE press and communications wing, Isaipriya, revealed the likelihood of 
summary execution by the army. The video and pictures showed that her clothing had been 
pulled away to reveal her bare body.39 In November 2013, Channel 4 released new footage 
that shows her being captured alive by the army.  
</p>
<p>61. With regard to each of the above three cases, the Government stated the authenticity 
of the footage and photographs remained unsubstantiated and unverified. Whether this has 
been the subject of any further investigation is unknown.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) &#8220;White flag&#8221; incident</b> 
62.<b> </b>The Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts examined allegations of extrajudicial 
executions of high-level LTTE leaders on 18 May 2009, despite assurances from the 
Government that they could safely surrender. High-ranking government and military 
officials have provided conflicting accounts of the events in rallies and international 
forums.40 While the circumstances surrounding the incident remain uncertain, the Panel 
concluded that the LTTE leadership intended to surrender. Evidence of this incident 
continues to emerge through non-governmental sources from witnesses now located outside 
the country. In its report, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission failed to 
critically analyse or investigate the &#8220;white flag&#8221; incident, but it cited testimonies from an 
army general and a government agent, who dismissed these allegations. In its comments on 
the present report, the Government stated that no further inquiries were being conducted 
into the incident owing to lack of credible evidence. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.  Prageeth Ekneligoda 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 24 January 2010, a Sri Lankan journalist and cartoonist, Prageeth Ekneligoda, 
disappeared shortly after leaving work. A few days earlier, he had published an article 
critical of President Rajapaksa. Local residents told the Sri Lankan press that they had seen 
a white van without numbered plates close to his house around the time of his 
disappearance. In August 2009, Prageeth had already been abducted, then released the 
following day, with his abductors saying that they had made a mistake. This case is 
emblematic of the tens of thousands of cases of disappearance witnessed over the past 30 
years in Sri Lanka and remain unresolved. The Ekneligoda case has been raised by the High 
Commissioner, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Committee against Torture and the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts. While the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission did not investigate this case, it made 
general recommendations that the Government investigate abductions, enforced 
disappearances and attacks on journalists. 
</p><p>64. In June 2011, former Attorney-General (now Chief Justice) Mohan Peiris was 
ordered to appear at a habeas corpus hearing in the case after telling the Committee against 
Torture, in 2011, that Ekneligoda was living in a foreign country. At the hearing, Mohan

magisterial inquiry is in progress. This case, together with many of this kind, will not fall 
within the mandate of the new Commission of Inquiry on Disappearances, which is 
mandated to examine cases of disappearances only in the northern and eastern provinces.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>65<b>. Despite the significant progress achieved in the physical aspects of resettlement 
and recovery, and the implementation of some of the recommendations made by the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the Government of Sri Lanka has yet 
to satisfy the call made by the Human Rights Council for a credible and independent 
investigation into the allegations of serious human rights violations that persist or to 
take the necessary steps to fulfil its legal obligations to ensure justice and redress.  
</b>66.<b> It is important for the Human Rights Council to recall the magnitude and 
gravity of the violations alleged to have been committed by the Government and the 
LTTE, which left many thousands of civilians killed, injured or missing. In its report, 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of Experts concluded that, if proven, some of these acts 
would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. During her visit to Sri 
Lanka in August 2013, the High Commissioner was struck by the overwhelming sense 
of grief and trauma among victims and survivors that, if left unaddressed, will 
continue to undermine confidence in the State and reconciliation. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The Government has launched initiatives and established mechanisms, such as 
the military courts of inquiry and the Commission of Inquiry on Disappearances, but 
none of these have the independence to be effective or to inspire confidence among 
victims and witnesses. The military courts of inquiry lack independence and 
transparency and are limited in scope. Past commissions of inquiry have not always 
completed their mandate, their reports have not been published and their 
recommendations have not been implemented or followed by prosecutions. The 
Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, although handling many routine cases, has a 
poor record in responding credibly to serious violations committed by the military 
and security forces.</b>42<b>  
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> For the past several years, Sri Lankan courts have been compromised by 
politicization and interference by the executive.</b>43<b> Cases or presiding magistrates and 
judges are often transferred from one court to other, thereby delaying judicial

 In her oral update to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/24/CRP.3/Rev.1), the High Commissioner 
highlighted concerns about the degree to which the rule of law and independence of the judiciary had 
been undermined in Sri Lanka, notably by the 18th amendment and controversial impeachment of the 
43rd Chief Justice in January 2013. The 18th amendment abolished the Constitutional Council, which 
once recommended appointments to the independent bodies, such as the Elections Commission, the 
Police Commission and the Human Rights Commission.  </p>

<p><b>proceedings.</b>44<b> The High Commissioner heard from lawyers about large numbers of 
fundamental rights applications, including in cases of arbitrary detention and torture, 
that are discouraged or not given leave to proceed by the Supreme Court.</b>45<b>  
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> One consequence of this situation is the understandable reluctance of victims 
and witnesses to come forward in the absence of any effective system for their 
protection. In many cases, witnesses have been intimidated to discourage their giving 
testimony, and even killed. This has been a major constraint on criminal 
investigations, as well as on the work of previous commissions of inquiry and the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The Attorney-General himself 
informed the High Commissioner that the reluctance of witnesses to come forward 
was the main reason for the lack of progress in such emblematic cases as the ones 
concerning Trincomalee and Action contre la Faim.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> A bill on assistance and protection for victims of crime has been in preparation 
since 2007, and was tabled in Parliament in June 2008. The previous drafts contained 
many provisions that were not compliant with international human rights law. 
Although the Supreme Court recommended several amendments, it is not clear 
whether they were incorporated. According to the Government, the legislation is 
being finalized, even though the final version has yet to be released for public 
consultation.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> At the same time, new evidence -- including witness testimony, video and 
photographic material -- continues to emerge on the events that took place in the final 
stages of the armed conflict. Human remains are also still being discovered, for 
instance in Matale, in November 2012, and Mannar, in December 2013.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> As the emblematic cases highlighted above show, national mechanisms have 
consistently failed to establish the truth and achieve justice. The High Commissioner 
believes this can no longer be explained as a function of time or technical capacity, but 
that it is fundamentally a question of political will. The Secretary-General&#8217;s Panel of 
Experts and the initiatives taken by international non-governmental organizations 
have shown that witnesses are willing to come forward to testify to international 
inquiry mechanisms that they trust and can guarantee their protection. For this 
reason, the High Commissioner remains convinced that an independent, international 
inquiry would play a positive role in eliciting new information and establishing the 
truth where domestic inquiry mechanisms have failed. In the absence of a credible 
national process, she believes the international community has a duty to take further 
steps, which will advance the right to truth for all in Sri Lanka and create further 
opportunities for justice, accountability and redress.  
</b>73.<b> The High Commissioner reiterates her concern at the continuing trend of 
attacks on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, particularly 
against human rights defenders, journalists and families of victims, the rising levels of 
religious intolerance, and continued militarization, which continue to undermine the 
environment where accountability and reconciliation can be achieved. She therefore 
reiterates and updates the recommendations made in her previous report to the 
Human Rights Council, most of which remain unimplemented.

 As seen, for example, in the transfer of the magistrate overseeing the case of the Matale mass graves.

<p> For example, the Fundamental Rights application (SCFR115/2011) submitted by the parents of 
Ganeshan Nimalaruban, who died in custody following the attack on the prisoners in Vavuniya in 
June 2012. </p>


<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Human Rights Council establish 
an international inquiry mechanism to further investigate the alleged violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law and monitor any domestic 
accountability processes. OHCHR stands ready to assist in such a process.  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Finalize laws dealing with incitement to hatred, witness and victim 
protection, the right to information and the criminalization of enforced 
disappearances, and revise existing laws in accordance with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and lift the regulations 
promulgated under it that allow for arbitrary detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Arrest, prosecute and punish perpetrators of attacks on minority 
communities, media and human rights defenders, and ensure protection of victims;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Undertake independent and credible criminal and forensic investigations 
with international assistance into all alleged violations of human rights and 
humanitarian law, including recently discovered mass graves; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Establish a truth-seeking mechanism and national reparations policy in 
accordance with international standards as an integral part of a more comprehensive 
and inclusive approach to transitional justice; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Broaden the scope and tenure of the Commission of Inquiry on 
Disappearances to encompass cases from all parts of the island and all periods of the 
history of disappearances; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Publish the final report of the military courts of inquiry, the presidential 
commission of inquiry of 2006 and the more recent commissions of inquiry to allow 
the evidence gathered to be evaluated; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Take further steps in demilitarization, ensure military disengagement 
from activities that are meant to be civilian, resolve land disputes and promote 
meaningful community participation in reconstruction and development; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Engage civil society and minority community representatives more fully 
in an inclusive and consultative process to support the implementation of the 
recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Implement the Commission&#8217;s recommendation for a national day of 
commemoration, allow all citizens their right to hold individual or group 
commemorations, and hold national consultations on the design of appropriate 
memorialization for the victims of the war; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Give positive consideration to the offers of technical assistance made by 
the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Invite special procedures mandate holders with outstanding requests to 
visit the country in 2014, particularly the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances and the Independent Expert on minority issues.
