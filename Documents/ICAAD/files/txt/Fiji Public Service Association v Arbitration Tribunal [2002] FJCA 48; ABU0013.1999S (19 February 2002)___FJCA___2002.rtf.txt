JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The appeal which is brought by the appellants is f rom part of the order of the High Court of Fiji (Scott J.) made on 18 February 1999. By the order his Lordship declared that the Arbitration Tribunal (the first respondent) erred in holding that an industrial agreement described as "the Collective Agreement", insofar as it restricted an employers right summarily to dismiss an employee, was ultra vires the Employment Act (Cap.92). The only other order made by the Court was an order that all other prayers for relief by the applicants (the appellants before us) be dismissed.
