<b>Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the  
</b></p>
<p><b>High Commissioner and the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p><b>  United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the 
Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102. It presents updated information on the 
activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and in particular the 
recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund at its thirty-fifth session, 
held from 25 January to 3 February 2012, and at its thirty-sixth session, held in Geneva 
from 15 to 19 October 2012.  
</p>
<p>2. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights approved the 
recommendations on behalf of the Secretary-General. The present note complements the 
report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Fund, submitted to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-seventh session detailing the outcomes of the thirty-fifth session of 
the Board of Trustees (A/67/264, paras. 13-19). 
</p>
<p>3. Pursuant to the recommendations made by the Office of Internal Oversight Services 
in its report on the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery of 2007 (AUD/01835/07), the secretariats of both Funds were placed, on 1 of 
January 2012, within the purview of the Human Rights Treaties Division of the Office of 
the High Commissioner (OHCHR). Furthermore, the post of Secretary was established for 
both Funds. A new post of Fundraiser dedicated to humanitarian funds was also created 
within the Human Rights Treaties Division and placed in the Donors and External Relations 
Section. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and individuals. In accordance with the mandate of the Fund, outlined in 
General Assembly resolution 36/151 and the practices established by the Board of Trustees 
in 1982, the Fund provides grants to established channels of assistance, including non-
governmental organizations, associations of victims and family members of victims, private 
and public hospitals, legal clinics, public interest law firms and individual lawyers that 
submit projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian 
or other forms of assistance to victims of torture and members of their families. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through OHCHR with the advice of the 
Board of Trustees, composed of five members acting in a personal capacity and appointed 
by the Secretary-General with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in 
consultation with their Governments. On 26 October 2011, the Secretary-General 
reappointed Mercedes Doretti (Argentina) for a final period of three years, and appointed 
Natasa Kandic (Serbia), Maria Cristina de Mendonca (Portugal), Morad el-Shazly (Egypt) 
and Anastasia Pinto (India) for a three-year term, renewable once. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>6. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the Fund&#8217;s guidelines. They require a 
project to be presented by an established channel of assistance, including non-governmental </p>


<p>organizations, associations of victims and family members of victims, private and public 
hospitals, legal clinics, public interest law firms and individual lawyers. The beneficiaries 
must be direct victims of torture and/or direct family members. Priority is given to projects 
providing direct assistance to victims of torture, which may consist in medical or 
psychological assistance, help with social or financial reintegration through vocational 
training for victims, and various forms of legal assistance for victims or members of their 
families, including assistance in seeking redress or applying for asylum. Depending on the 
resources available, the Fund may finance projects to organize training programmes, 
seminars or conferences to allow health-care professionals or other service providers to 
exchange best practices. However, grant requests for projects involving investigation, 
research, studies, publications or similar activities are not admissible. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Thirty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>7. Owing to the fact that the new Board of Trustees, was appointed on 26 October 
2011, the thirty-fifth session of the Board, originally planned from 17 to 21 October 2011, 
had to be postponed to early in 2012, and was thus held from 27 January to 3 February 
</p><p>2012. At the session, Ms. Doretti was appointed by acclamation as Chairperson for a two-
year term. The Board also examined applications for funding and made recommendations 
on grants to be allotted to beneficiary organizations for the period from January to 
December 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>8. The table below shows the contributions received between 1 January

<p><b> B. Recommendations adopted by the Board at its thirty-fifth session 
</b></p>
<p>9. At its session, the Board examined information prepared by the secretariat 
concerning projects proposals for 2012, including new applications, and the analysis of 
narrative, financial and audit reports on the use of grants paid in previous years. It 
considered requests for new grants for more than 280 projects providing direct assistance to 
victims of torture and their family members in 2012, as well as requests for 15 projects 
amounting to $397,388 for training and seminars for professionals assisting victims to 
exchange information on experiences and best practices.  
</p>
<p>10. The Board of Trustees made recommendations for grants for more than 220 ongoing 
and 22 new projects providing direct assistance to 70,000 victims in more than 70 
countries, for a total amount of $7,089,471. The High Commissioner approved the Board&#8217;s 
recommendations on 16 February 2012 on behalf of the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>11. Owing to the significant decrease in the level of contributions received in 2011, at its 
thirty-fifth session the Board was compelled to make further strategic cuts to grants 
awarded to ongoing projects for 2012 in addition to those already made for the 2011 cycle. 
Consequently, a decrease of 40 per cent was applied to the grants awarded to projects 
located in Western European and other States , while the level of support of projects located 
in other regions was reduced on average by 30 per cent. 
</p>
<p>12. With a view to mitigating the effects of the cuts on small grass-roots organizations, 
in particular those located in remote regions where access to alternative funding is difficult, 
no strategic cuts were applied to grants of $20,000 or below. It should be noted that, as a 
rule, support for all grantees was capped at $80,000 instead of the usual $200,000. In 
addition, funding for training and seminars for professionals assisting victims was capped at 
$5,000 instead of the usual $30,000. Moreover, as was already the case in 2011, support for </p>


<p>direct assistance projects presented by new grantees was capped at $20,000 instead of the 
usual $50,000. 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the financial limitations, the Board recommended that $300,000 be set aside 
for urgent requests and unforeseen needs in 2012, as well as for emergencies in the 
intersessional period. Notably, in order to respond to the needs of victims in the context of 
the recent developments across the Middle East and North Africa, in June 2012 an open call 
was launched for projects aimed at assisting victims of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Thirty-sixth session of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>14. The thirty-sixth session of the Board was held from 15 to 19 October 2012. The 
Board examined applications for funding and made recommendations on grants to be 
allotted to beneficiary organizations for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2013.  
</p>
<p>15. The amount available for distribution to projects at the thirty-sixth session was 
calculated after deducting programme support costs, operating cash reserve and expenditure 
for non-grant activities from the total amount of contributions received after the thirty-fifth 
session of the Board of Trustees, held in February 2012 and the end of 2012. 
</p>
<p>16. The table below shows the contributions received between 1 January 
and 19 November 2012.

<p>17. After two consecutive years of dramatic decreases in contributions received by the 
Fund, in 2012 renewed outreach and fund-raising efforts led to the consolidation of the 
support of donors at the level reached in 2011, thus allowing the Board of Trustees not to 
have to apply further cuts to grants. 
</p>
<p>18. Notwithstanding such efforts, the diminished resources available remain a concern, 
as the Fund is still unable to meet all demands for support that it receives, in particular in 
relation to grave human rights emergencies, such as the unfolding crisis in the Syrian Arab 
Republic. For 2013, more than 280 applications were received, requesting almost $15 
million in support, against less than $7 million available for grants. 
</p>
<p>19. At its thirty-sixth session, the Board of Trustees considered a total of 266 admissible 
project proposals aimed at providing direct assistance to victims of torture and their family 
members, amounting to $14,823,044. Specifically, it considered 241 ongoing project 
proposals amounting to $14,070,066 and 19 new project proposals amounting to $633,137. 
The Board also considered requests for six projects, amounting to $119,841, for training 
and seminars for professionals assisting victims of torture. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board considered positively a total of 262 projects. It recommended approval 
for prompt disbursement of a total of 247 project grants in more than 70 countries for a total 
amount of $6,964,100. It also recommended pre-approval for 15 projects grants for a total 
amount of $227,500, to be disbursed when the relevant funds become available.  
</p>
<p>21. The Board also recommended that $300,000 be set aside for emergency grants to be 
considered in the course of 2013, through its intersessional procedure.  
</p>
<p>22. Of note, some of the restraining measures introduced by the Board at its previous 
session were reiterated by the Board. For the second consecutive year, support for ongoing 
grantees was capped, as a rule, at $80,000 (instead of the usual $200,000) and, in the case 
of first-time grantees, at $20,000 (instead of the usual $50,000). Funding for training and 
seminars for professionals assisting victims was capped at $7,500 (instead of the usual 
$30,000). 
</p>

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> Pursuant to the appeals made by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/150 
and by the Board of Trustees of the Fund, as reflected in the report of the Secretary-
</b></p>
<p><b>General submitted to the General Assembly (67/264), donors are invited to pay their 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributions to the Fund before the thirty-eighth session of the Board (to be held in 
</b></p>
<p><b>October 2013), in order to allow the Board to take them into account at that session. 
</b></p>
<p>25.<b> On the basis of the requests received for 2013, it is expected that approximately 
$15 million will be requested by organizations for 2014.  
</b></p>
<p>26.<b> In the light of the difficult financial situation faced by the Fund since 2010, the 
Board has also reiterated its call to regular donors to increase, as much as possible, 
</b></p>
<p><b>their contributions to the Fund in order to provide it with the necessary resources to 
</b></p>
<p><b>meet the growing needs of victims of torture and the members of their families 
</b></p>
<p><b>worldwide. 
</b></p>
<p>27.<b> The Board strongly encourages States that have not yet contributed to the Fund 
to do so, preferably before September 2013, to expand the donor base of the Fund.
