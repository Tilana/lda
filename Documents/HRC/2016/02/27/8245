<p> The Working Group expresses its strong objection to the decision of the United

has been the case for almost every year since such a limit was imposed by the General

</p>
<p> This year, the UN Secretariat would not grant such a waiver, more than one month

its 95th session in November 2011. That refusal means that the report is neither edited nor

<p> The regular decision over the years by the UN Secretariat to grant such a waiver was

cases are registered in a database and are followed-up every year until clarified. This year, 
the Working Group is still following up the individual cases of almost 43, 000 persons in 
82 States. 
</p>
<p> The report each year gives an account of how the Working Group is fulfilling its 
humanitarian mandate: it contains communications to and from Member States and

and whose disappearance was communicated to the Working Group during the reporting 
period. The fact that these matters and names are not recorded or made public in any other

<p>Working Group in fulfilling its humanitarian and monitoring mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group invites the Human Rights Council to consider the situation and 
urges the United Nations Secretariat to consider in future the uniqueness of the Working 
Group's annual report and to grant the waiver as it did in the past.  The Working Group 
encourages Governments and civil society organizations to translate the report in their 
national languages, so as to provide wider access to the information contained in the 
Working Group's annual report. The Working Group is concerned that many 
communications are not still translated in time, thus delaying their consideration by the 
Working Group and limiting its humanitarian mandate.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group was the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism 
to be established with a universal mandate. The original mandate derives from Commission 
on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980. This resolution followed 
General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, in which the Assembly 
expressed concern at reports from various parts of the world relating to enforced 
disappearances and requested the Commission on Human Rights to consider the question of 
missing or disappeared persons. The mandate was most recently extended by Human Rights 
Council resolution 16/16 of 24 March 2011. 
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In this 
humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
family members of victims of enforced disappearance and others connected to the 
disappeared person, and Governments.  
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption of General Assembly resolution 47/133 on 18 December 
1992 and of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
the Working Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in fulfilling their 
obligations derived from the Declaration. Human Rights Council resolution 7/12 
encouraged the Working Group to provide assistance in the implementation by States of the 
Declaration and of existing international rules. 
</p>
<p>4. Based on its experience of over thirty years, the Working Group has decided to 
amend the way in which its statistics are counted so that, in exceptional circumstances and 
for humanitarian reasons, cases may be included in the statistics of a different State from 
the one in which the enforced disappearance occurred. In addition, the Working Group has 
decided to deal with all enforced disappearances, regardless of the type of armed conflict 
that they occurred in. The revised methods of work, approved on 11 November 2011, are 
contained in annex I to the present report and will come into effect on 1 January 2012. 
</p>
<p>5. This report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group 
during its three sessions in 2011, covering the period 13 November 2010 to 11 November 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>6. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity. Where there has been no 
information from the Government or the sources, notwithstanding the annual reminder sent 
by the Working Group concerning outstanding cases, only the table is provided and a 
reference is made to the previous report dealing with those cases. 
</p>
<p>7. For States where the number of newly-reported cases is less than ten, the names of 
the persons appear in that State&#8217;s section. If the number of newly-reported cases is greater 
than ten, the list of names appears in annex V. For urgent actions, the names of all persons, 
regardless of the number, appear in the relevant State&#8217;s section. 
</p>
<p>8. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since 
its inception is 53,778. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet 
been clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,759 in a total of 82 States. The Working 
Group has been able to clarify 448 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group expresses its strong objection to the decision of the United 
Nations Secretariat not to grant a waiver to the 10,700 word limit to the present report, as 
has been the case for almost every year since such a limit was imposed by the General 
Assembly in 1993.  </p>


<p>10. This year, the UN Secretariat would not grant such a waiver, more than one month 
after the report was finalised by the independent expert members of the Working Group at 
its 95th session in November 2011. That refusal means that the report is neither edited nor 
translated into the other United Nations official languages. 
</p>
<p>11. The regular decision over the years by the UN Secretariat to grant such a waiver was 
based on the peculiarities of the Working Group's mandate. Compared to other special 
procedures (with the exception of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention) the Working 
Group is specifically mandated to deal with individual cases on a humanitarian basis. Those 
cases are registered in a database and are followed-up every year until clarified. This year, 
the Working Group is still following up the individual cases of almost 43, 000 persons in 
82 States. 
</p>
<p>12. The report each year gives an account of how the Working Group is fulfilling its 
humanitarian mandate: it contains communications to and from Member States and 
statistics on cases. Most of all, it includes the names of those people who have disappeared 
and whose disappearance was communicated to the Working Group during the reporting 
period. The fact that these matters and names are not recorded or made public in any other 
United Nations document, makes the report a unique tool in the fight against enforced 
disappearances and at the service of Governments and officials as well as civil society. The 
lack of translation of the report gravely hampers the independence and efficacy of the 
Working Group in fulfilling its humanitarian and monitoring mandate. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group invites the Human Rights Council to consider the situation and 
urges the United Nations Secretariat to consider in future the uniqueness of the Working 
Group's annual report and to grant the waiver as it did in the past.  The Working Group 
encourages Governments and civil society organizations to translate the report in their 
national languages, so as to provide wider access to the information contained in the 
Working Group's annual report.  
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group is concerned that many communications are not still translated 
in time, thus delaying their consideration by the Working Group and limiting its 
humanitarian mandate. 
</p>
<p>15. At the present time, the Working Group&#8217;s website remains inadequate. The majority 
of the content is in English only. The Working Group once again calls on the United 
Nations to provide adequate resources to make it up to date and more accessible. 
</p>
<p>16. The Working Group is grateful for the additional human resources given to it during 
part of the reporting period. However it notes that the cumulative effect of lack of adequate 
staff during the past three years has led to a backlog of more than 650 cases, for this reason 
it wishes to emphasize that the additional support needs to be sustained in the future. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 13 November 2010 to 11 November 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities

<p>17. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions: the ninety-

Geneva; and the ninety-fifth from 1 to 11 November 2011, also in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>18. As from 1 August 2009, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group is Mr. Jeremy 
Sarkin and, as from 8 July 2011, the Vice-Chair is Mr. Olivier de Frouville. The other

<p>21. During the reporting period, all the members of the Working Group carried out a 
number of activities connected to enforced disappearances which include their participation 
in seminars, trainings, workshops and lectures.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>22.  During the period under review, representatives of the Governments of Algeria, the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, the Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Guatemala, Iraq, Japan, 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Morocco, and Serbia attended the sessions of the Working 
Group. A number of other bilateral meetings were held with various States during the year. </p>


<p>The Working Group also met with the newly-established Committee on Enforced 
Disappearance, representatives of international governmental organizations, human rights 
non-governmental organizations and associations of relatives of disappeared persons and 
families of victims of enforced disappearances or witnesses thereto. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 261 new cases of 
enforced disappearance to 25 States. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group transmitted 73 of these cases under the urgent action procedure 
to Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Honduras, India, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Libya, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, and the 
United Arab Emirates.  
</p>
<p>25. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 63 cases in the following 
States: Argentina, Bahrain, Chad, China, Colombia, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Iraq, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Spain, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Turkey, 
Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Of those, 44 cases were clarified based on 
information provided by Governments and 19 cases were clarified based on information 
provided by sources. 
</p>
<p>26. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted six prompt intervention 
communications addressing harassment of, and threats to, human rights defenders and 
relatives of disappeared persons in Guatemala, Mexico, Morocco, Sri Lanka, Thailand and 
Turkey. Five of these were sent as joint communications with other special procedures 
mandates. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group transmitted 41 urgent appeals concerning persons who had been 
arrested, detained, abducted or otherwise deprived of their liberty or who had been forcibly 
disappeared or were at risk of being disappeared in Bahrain, China, Egypt, Georgia, 
Honduras, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, Mexico, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab 
Republic, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and 
Yemen. 39 of these communications were sent jointly with other special procedures 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>28. Following its ninety-second session in 2010 and its first two sessions in 2011, the 
Working Group transmitted 14 general allegations to the Governments of Bangladesh, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Egypt, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, 
Morocco, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and two to the Syrian Arab Republic, requesting them to 
comment thereon. Summaries of three additional general allegations considered during the 
ninety-fifth session, including Government responses, if any, will be included in the 2012 
annual report. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>29. At the invitation of the Governments, the Working Group visited Timor-Leste, 
Mexico and the Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>30. The visit to Timor-Leste took place from 7 to 14 February 2011. The Working 
Group was represented by Mr. Jeremy Sarkin and Ms. Jasminka Dzumhur. The purpose of 
the mission was to study the country&#8217;s efforts in dealing with the issue of enforced 
disappearances, including how it is addressing cases of enforced disappearances which 
occurred in the past. The report on the visit to Timor-Leste is contained in 
A/HRC/19/58/Add.1.  </p>


<p>31. The visit to Mexico took place from 18 March to 1 April 2011. The Working Group 
was represented by Mr. Ariel Dulitzky, Ms. Jasminka Dzumhur and Mr. Osman El-Hajj&#233;. 
The purpose of the mission was to learn about the country&#8217;s efforts in addressing cases of 
</p>
<p>past and recent enforced disappearances. The report on the visit to Mexico is contained in 
A/HRC/19/58/Add.2. 
</p>
<p>32. The visit to the Republic of the Congo took place from 24 September to 3 October 
</p><p>2011. The Working Group was represented by Mr. Osman El Hajj&#233; and Mr. Olivier de 
Frouville. The purpose of the mission was to learn about the country&#8217;s efforts in dealing 
with the issue of enforced disappearances. The report on the visit to the Republic of the 
Congo is contained in A/HRC/19/58/Add.3. 
</p>
<p>33. During the reporting period, the Working Group reiterated its request for a visit to 
Algeria, Burundi, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Nicaragua, the 
Philippines, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Zimbabwe.  
</p>
<p>34. In this regard, the Working Group would like to recall the fact that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2004, which was delayed at the 
request of the Government. The Working Group would like to call upon the Government to 
set the dates to carry out the visit.  
</p>
<p>35. During the reporting period, the Working Group also requested visits to Belarus, 
Croatia, Egypt, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab 
Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, and Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>36. In 2010, the Government of Chile invited the Working Group to undertake a visit to 
the country in 2012. During the reporting period, the Governments of Serbia and Tajikistan 
also invited the Working Group to visit their countries.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group thanks the States that have extended invitations to visit their 
countries and invites all the States that have received a request for a visit by the Working 
Group to respond to it. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Reports 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the reporting period, the Working Group prepared follow-up reports on the 
implementation of the recommendations it made following its country visits to Colombia 
and Nepal. These follow-up reports are contained in addendum 4 (A/HRC/19/58/Add.4). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Statements and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>39. On 25 November 2010, the Working Group issued a statement welcoming the 
twentieth ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance which ensured the entry into force of the international human 
rights treaty against this heinous crime. 
</p>
<p>40. On 23 December 2010, the Working Group issued a statement welcoming the entry 
into force of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. The Working Group stressed that the entry into force of the Convention is a 
new and important step in the right direction, but that is not enough and urged States to 
make all possible efforts to prevent and eradicate the heinous practice of enforced 
disappearance and to bring to justice all those believed to be responsible for the crime; 
refrain from any act of intimidation or reprisals against those persons who contribute to the 
eradication of the practice; and take effective measures to realize the rights to truth, justice 
and reparation. </p>


<p>41. On 8 March 2011, on the occasion of the International Women&#8217;s Day, the Working 
Group joined the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and nine other United Nations human rights mechanisms in a press release 
urging States to comply with their international obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>42. On 31 May 2011, the Working Group issued a statement on the occasion of the first 
meeting of State Parties to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and the election of members of the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearance. It emphasized that the Committee and the Working Group will coexist side 
by side and collaborate in their fight against enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>43. To commemorate the First United Nations International Day of the Disappeared, the 
Working Group issued a press release on 30 August 2011, reminding victims, including the 
families and associations of victims of those who disappeared, that they are not alone. In 
addition, the experts recalled that 2012 marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption by the 
UN General Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and encouraged all States and civil society to translate the Declaration into 
all languages and dialects, with no distinction, since all serve the purpose to assist in its 
global dissemination and the ultimate goal of preventing enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>44. During the reporting period, the Working Group also issued a series of press releases 
concerning China, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Sudan, and the Syrian Arab 
Republic. Reference to these press releases can be found in the relevant sections of this 
report.  
</p>
<p><b> G.  Ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>45. During the reporting period, the Working Group welcomed the entry into force of 
the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group congratulates the States that have ratified the Convention and 
encourages those that have not yet done so to accept the competence of the Committee to 
receive individual cases, under article 31, and inter-State complaints, under article 32 of the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group once again calls upon States that have not signed and/or ratified 
the Convention to do so as soon as possible and to accept the competence of the Committee 
under articles 31 and 32 of the Convention.

<p><b>  H. General Comments 
</b></p>
<p>48. In 2011, the Working Group finalized the following general comment on the right to 
recognition as a person before the law in the context of enforced disappearances, which was 
adopted at its ninety-fifth session: 
</p>
<p><b>  General Comment on the right to recognition as a person before the law in the context 
</b></p>
<p><b>of enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Preamble 
</i></p>
<p>The right to recognition as a person before the law is a widely recognized human right at 
the universal and regional levels, including article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and article 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (see also, 
at the regional level, article XVII of the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of 
Man, article 3 of the American Convention on Human Rights, and article 5 of the African 
Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights). </p>


<p>This right is central to the conception of human rights, as it expresses the right and the 
capacity of each human being to be the holder of rights and obligations under the law. It has 
often been described as the &#8213;right to have rights&#8214; and as a direct consequence of the right to 
</p>
<p>respect for human dignity.1 
</p>
<p>The Working Group has always considered that enforced disappearances infringe the right 
to be recognized as a person before the law (see the first report of the Working Group, 
E/CN.4/1435, &#167; 184). Following this conclusion, the Declaration for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides, in its article 1.2: 
</p>
<p><i>Any act of enforced disappearance places the persons subjected thereto outside the 
</i></p>
<p><i>protection of the law</i> [&#8230;] <i>It constitutes a violation of the rules of international law 
guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to recognition as a person before the law</i> [&#8230;]   
</p>
<p>There is indeed a strong link between one of the elements of the legal definition of enforced 
disappearance &#8211; the placement of the disappeared person outside the protection of the law &#8211; 
and the right to recognition as a person before the law.  
</p>
<p>Following recent developments of case law at the universal and regional levels2, the 
Working Group deems it necessary to state its interpretation of article 1.2, in order to help 
States to apply the Declaration in a way that is most conducive to the protection of all 
persons from enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the Working Group has decided to issue the following general comment: 
</p>
<p><i>  General Comment 
</i></p>
<p> 1. Enforced disappearance represents a paradigmatic violation of the right to be 
recognized as a person before the law. One of the constitutive elements of enforced 
disappearances is that the person is placed &#8213;outside the protection of the law&#8214;. This means 
</p>
<p>that not only the detention is denied, and/or the fate or the whereabouts of the person are 
concealed, but that while deprived of his/her liberty, this person is denied any right under 
the law, and is placed in a legal limbo, in a situation of total defencelessness. 
</p>
<p> 2. Enforced disappearances entail the denial of the disappeared person&#8217;s legal 
existence and, as a consequence, prevent him or her from enjoying all other human rights 
and freedoms. The disappeared person may keep his or her name, at least when the birth 
has been registered (and except in cases when the true identity of children, who have been 
taken away from their parents, is falsified, concealed or destroyed), but he/she is not shown 
in the record of detainees; neither is the name kept in the registers of deaths. The 
disappeared is <i>de facto</i> deprived of his or her domicile. His/her properties become frozen in 
a legal limbo since no one, not even the next-of-kin, may dispose of that patrimony until the 
disappeared appears alive or is declared dead, that is a &#8213;non-person&#8214;. 
</p>
<p> 3. The right to be recognized as a person before the law is also implicated in the 
case of children who were born during their mothers&#8217; enforced disappearance, and who 
were thereafter illegally adopted. As far as their biological identity is no protected, their 
very own personality is not recognized before the law. Thus, article 20 of the Declaration 
provides that such acts of abduction, as well as the act of altering or suppressing documents 
attesting to their true identity, &#8213;shall constitute an extremely serious offence, which shall be 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See in particular article 5 of the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights, where those two 
</p>
<p>rights are associated. 
 2 See in particular, Human Rights Committee, views <i>Zohra Madoui</i> v. Algeria<i>, </i>28 October 2008, &#167; 7.7, 
</p>
<p>7.8; Inter-American Court of Human Rights decision, <i>Anzualdo Castro v. Peru</i>, 22 September 2009, 
par. 90 and 101. </p>


<p>punished as such&#8214;. The same article also provides that States &#8213;shall devote their efforts to 
the search for and identification of such children and to the restitution of the children to 
their families of origin&#8214;. 
</p>
<p> 4. Even if the right to recognition as a person before the law is extinguished on 
the death of the disappeared person, its effects may last beyond his/her death, in particular 
with all matters related to inheritance. In addition, as the Working Group stated in its 
General Comment on Enforced Disappearance as a Continuous Crime, &#8213;[e]ven though the 
</p>
<p>conduct violates several rights, including the right to recognition as a person before the law, 
(&#8230;) the Working Group considers that an enforced disappearance is a unique and 
</p>
<p>consolidated act, and not a combination of acts&#8214; with the consequence that &#8213;even if some 
</p>
<p>aspects of the violation may have been completed before the entry into force of the relevant 
national or international instrument, if other parts of the violation are still continuing, until 
such time as the victim&#8217;s fate or whereabouts are established, the matter should be heard, 
</p>
<p>and the act should not be fragmented.&#8214; The violation of the right to recognition as a person 
before the law therefore lasts until the disappearance ends, that is to say when the fate or 
the whereabouts of the person have been determined. 
</p>
<p> 5. Enforced disappearances also entail violations of the rights of other persons, 
including the next-of-kin and others connected to the disappeared persons. Family members 
are prevented to exercise their rights and obligations due to the legal uncertainty created by 
the absence of the disappeared person. This uncertainty has many legal consequences, 
among others on the status of marriage, guardianship of under age children, right to social 
allowances of members of the families and management of property of the disappeared 
person. 
</p>
<p> 6. The Working Group considers that the right to be recognized as a legal 
person entails the obligation of the State to fully recognize the legal personality of 
disappeared persons and thus respect the rights of their next-of-kin and as well as others.  
</p>
<p> 7. For that reason, most domestic legal systems have institutions designed to 
deal with the impossibility of ascertaining a person&#8217;s death. Some States allow the issuance 
</p>
<p>of a &#8213;presumption of death&#8214;, others of a &#8213;declaration of absence&#8214;. Some other States, which 
</p>
<p>have been confronted in the past with a systematic or massive practice of enforced 
disappearance, have specifically created the notion of &#8213;certificate of absence by reason of 
</p>
<p>forced disappearance&#8214; (see in particular the Working Group&#8217;s study on Compensation, 
</p>
<p>presumption of death and exhumation, in E/CN.4/1998/43, p. 9 sq). 
</p>
<p> 8. The basis for such an acknowledgement should take the form of a 
&#8213;declaration of absence by reason of enforced disappearance&#8214;, to be issued, with the 
</p>
<p>consent of the family, by a State authority after a certain time has elapsed since the 
disappearance, in any case no less than one year. 
</p>
<p> 9. Such a declaration should allow the appointment of a representative of the 
disappeared person, with the mandate to exercise his/her rights and obligations for the 
duration of his/her absence, in his/her interests and those of his/her next-of-kin. The latter 
should be allowed to manage temporarily the disappeared person&#8217;s properties, for as long as 
</p>
<p>the enforced disappearance continues, and to receive due assistance from the State through 
social allowances. In most cases, the disappeared persons are men and were the family 
breadwinners and special social support should be provided to dependent women and 
children. The acceptance of financial support for members of the families should not be 
considered as a waiver of the right to integral reparation for the damage caused by the 
crime of enforced disappearance, in accordance with article 19 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 10. In parallel to the issuance of a system of declaration of absence as a result of 
enforced disappearance, States should continue to investigate all cases to determinate the 
fate and the whereabouts of the disappeared and to ensure accountability of those </p>


<p>responsible for the commission of enforced disappearances. That is, such declaration should 
not interrupt or close the investigations to determine the fate or the whereabouts of the 
victim, but should allow his/her next-of-kin to exercise on their behalf certain rights. 
</p>
<p> 11. The Working Group is committed to preserve and safeguard the right to 
recognition as a person in the implementation of its mandate. As the legal personality of the 
disappeared person is denied at the domestic level, the humanitarian mandate implemented 
by the Working Group should be understood as an international guarantee of this right.

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group transmitted 37 newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
majority of these cases concerned persons who allegedly disappeared between 1994 and 
1995, in Jijel. Most disappearances are attributed to the military and the National 
Gendarmerie.4 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Government transmitted three communications dated 1 December 2010, and 29 
March and 4 November 2011. The first includes a reply to a prompt intervention letter sent 
on 24 August 2010. In the second communication, the Government provided information 
on 11 outstanding cases. The information provided was considered insufficient to lead to 
their clarification. The third one was handed to the Working Group during its ninety-fifth 
session and was connected to outstanding cases. The information could not be processed in 
time for inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>53. Information was received from sources concerning 12 outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>54. On 1 December 2010, the Government replied to a prompt intervention letter sent 
jointly with three other Special Procedures mechanisms on 24 August 2010, concerning 
reports of a prohibition imposed on mothers of disappeared persons to assemble peacefully 
on 4, 11 and 18 August 2010, and the alleged repression suffered by the mothers and others 
demonstrating on 11 August 2010. In its communication, the Government indicated that 
during the gathering of 11 August 2010, four aggressive individuals were arrested by the 
police for usual checks without using violence. The Government stressed that Security 
Services have not, at any moment, repressed the gatherings of the mothers of the 
disappeared and that the intervention of the police officers was limited to the application of 
legal means in their capacity as public forces vested with the mission to restore order in the 
framework of the legislation in force.  The Government indicated that it has discharged its 
obligations with a certain firmness, but with much skill and tact in particular regarding 
women and elderly people.  
</p>
<p>55. The Government highlighted that the control of the demonstration was not handled 
by the Republican Security Unit, equipped for this kind of interventions, but by the public 
security services, including many female officers, thus ensuring a soft approach towards the 
demonstrators. The Government added that no complaint was submitted by the 
demonstrators and that nobody required medical assistance. In addition, the Government 
stressed that the people submitting the allegations, of the pseudo association &#8213;SOS 
</p>
<p>Disparus&#8214;, entity with no legal status, aim at harming the reputation of the security services 
and try to foster their &#8213;cause&#8214;, in decline after the enactment of the Charter for Peace and 
</p>
<p>National Reconciliation.   
</p>
<p>56. Finally, the Government highlighted that the legal basis to prohibit the gatherings of 
the families of the disappeared in front of the offices of the National Human Rights 
Commission is based on the law 91-19, of 2 December 1991, relating to public meetings 
and demonstrations, in particular its article 19, that stipulates that &#8213;Every demonstration 
</p>
<p>carried out without prior declaration &#8230; is considered an illegal gathering (attroupement).&#8214; 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See annex V for the list of names of the newly-reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>


<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 25 August 2000, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to Algeria. A reminder was sent on 21 October 2010. On 12 November 2010, the 
Government informed the Working Group that it would not be in a position to forward all 
supporting documents which had been requested concerning outstanding cases; however, 
the Government proposed that the Working Group travel to Algiers to consult the above-
mentioned documents and meet with the families of those allegedly disappeared but found 
alive. On 23 May 2011, the Working Group replied to this communication indicating to the 
Government that it would prefer to carry out a visit to the country in conformity with its 
usual practice.  
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>58. Representatives of the Government of Algeria met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>59. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 2,987 cases to the 
Government; of those, 18 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, nine cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 2,960 remain outstanding.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group thanks the Government of Algeria for its cooperation. It reminds 
the Government of its obligations under the Declaration towards the families of the 
disappeared and in particular of article 13.3 of the Declaration, according to which States 
must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations of cases of enforced 
disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting the 
investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal.

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 14 April 2010, the Government transmitted a communication referring to eight 
outstanding cases which could not be translated in time for inclusion in the 2010 annual 
report (A/HRC/16/48). On the basis of this information, the Working Group decided at its 
ninety-fourth session to apply the six-month rule to those eight cases.  
</p>
<p>66. In the same communication, the Government submitted a comprehensive report on 
the actions taken to promote and protect human rights, with particular reference to 
clarification of cases of enforced disappearances. The Government highlighted that the 
measures taken to clarify cases of enforced disappearances are not isolated measures, but 
instead part of a comprehensive policy to recover historical memory, seek the truth and 
obtain justice, which is being implemented by the legislative, judicial and executive 
branches of Government. In this respect, it described in detail the activities of these three 
branches of the Government.  Moreover, it also reported on the restitution of grandchildren 
in the context of its work with the NGO Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo and the National 
Commission for the Right to Identity. 
</p>
<p>67. On 4 November 2010, the Government transmitted a communication referring to six 
outstanding cases which could not be translated in time for inclusion in report 
A/HRC/16/48. On the basis of this information, the Working Group decided at its ninety-
fourth session to apply the six-month rule to those six cases.  
</p>
<p>68. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted one communication dated 
7 July 2011. This communication could not be translated in time for inclusion in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources

decided to clarify three cases; two following the confirmation by the source, and the third 
following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>71. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 3,449 cases to the

<p>72. On 2 September 2011, the Government transmitted a communication dated 25 
August 2009, which was not recorded in the 2009 annual report (A/HRC/13/31), replying to 
a general allegation transmitted on 15 May 2009, concerning the alleged involvement of the 
Government of Azerbaijan in a practice of renditions and secret detention (A/HRC/13/31, 
paragraphs 70 and 71).  
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>73. On 2 September 2011, the Working Group received a response from the 
Government to the general allegation stating that it was not involved in the practice of 
renditions and secret detention allegedly operated by the United States on its territory. The 
Government stated that the general allegation contained no proof of such cases and that 
should such cases be reported to it, it would investigate them. 
</p>
<p>74. The Government recalled that it is a democratic republic guided by international 
human rights law and that the individual right to freedom is enshrined in its Constitution.  
</p>
<p>75. The Government also indicated that the principle of the presumption of innocence, 
the guarantee to an effective judicial remedy and the right to a fair trial at all stages of the 
criminal proceedings were guaranteed by a series of legal provisions. 
</p>
<p>76. In addition, the Government reported that the inspection on the control over the 
execution of punishments was set up to ensure an independent investigation of appeals. The 
Government also reported that a Public Committee consisting of representatives of 
authoritative non-governmental human rights organisations was set up under the Ministry 
of Justice to monitor the situation of detainees.  </p>


<p>77. Furthermore, the Government stated that the Commissioner for Human Rights 
considers complaints formulated by citizens, stateless persons and foreigners in connection 
to human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Working Group recalls article 13.1, which states that whenever &#8213;there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that an enforced disappearance has been committed, the State 
shall promptly refer the matter to that authority for such an investigation, even if there has 
been no formal complaint. No measure shall be taken to curtail or impede the 
investigation.&#8214;

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Working Group transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. The cases concerned Messrs. <b>Jawad Fairooz Ghuloom</b> and <b>Matar Ebrahim 
Matar</b>, who were allegedly arrested on 2 May 2011 by people believed to be State agents at 
their homes located in Hamad town and Al Daih village, respectively.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Working Group transmitted three communications under its urgent appeal 
procedure.  
</p>
<p>81. The first communication, transmitted on 22 March 2011, jointly with three other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerned Messrs. <b>Abduljalil Al Singace</b> and <b>Hassan 
Mushaima</b>, who were allegedly arrested by Bahraini security forces on 17 March 2011. 
The arrest allegedly took place during a security operation with the alleged objective of 
removing protesters from Pearl Roundabout.  
</p>
<p>82. On 26 April 2011, the Government replied to this urgent appeal. It noted that the 
whereabouts of the arrested persons are not unknown, as alleged, nor that they were </p>


<p>subjected to arbitrary detention. The State noted that they were arrested by competent 
authorities for having committed prosecutable offences and they enjoyed all guarantees 
accorded to accused persons. 
</p>
<p>83. The second communication, transmitted on 12 April 2011, jointly with two other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerned Messrs. <b>Abdulhadi Alkhawaja</b>, <b>Wafi Almajid</b> 
and <b>Hussein Ahmed</b>, who were allegedly arrested by a group of masked police officers on 
9 April 2011.  
</p>
<p>84. On 7 June 2011, the Government replied to this urgent appeal. In this 
communication, the Government stated that Abdulhadi Alkhawaja was arrested and 
questioned about a series of charges brought against him including, <i>inter alia</i>, knowingly 
becoming a member of a terrorist group; attempting with the help of others to overthrow the 
monarchy and change the State Constitution; promoting political change in Bahrain through 
the use of force; and taking part in and inviting others to join unauthorized rallies. The 
Government also indicated that Mr. Alkhawaja was referred to the National Safety Court of 
First Instance, where his arraignment took place. This instance complied with international 
human rights standards and provided the guarantees afforded by law to the accused, 
including the right to contact his family and his lawyer, and the right to inform his family of 
his whereabouts and of the measures taken in his regard. Finally, the Government indicated 
that Messrs.Wafi Almajid and Hussein Ahmed were arrested but not accused of the same 
offences as Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja. 
</p>
<p>85. The third communication, transmitted on 21 April 2011, jointly with two other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerned Mr. <b>Mohammed Al-Tajir</b>,<b> </b>a prominent human 
rights lawyer, who was allegedly arrested by a group of masked and plain-clothed security 
officers on 15 April 2011, and then taken to an undisclosed location.  
</p>
<p>86. On 8 June 2011, the Government replied to this urgent appeal. In this 
communication, the Government stated that Mr. Muhammad Al-Tajir was arrested further 
to orders issued by the competent authority and that his arrest and detention were conducted 
in line with the laws in force in Bahrain, all legal safeguards were guaranteed and Mr. Al-
Tajir was permitted to contact his family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>87. On 3 November 2010, the Government transmitted a communication regarding one 
outstanding case, which could not be translated in time for inclusion in report 
A/HRC/16/48. The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the 
clarification of this case.  
</p>
<p>88. During the reporting period the Government transmitted five communications.  
</p>
<p>89. The first communication dated 15 November 2010, concerned one outstanding case. 
The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of this 
case.  
</p>
<p>90. In the second, third and fourth communications, dated 26 April 2011, 7 and 8 June 
2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeals transmitted on 22 March, 12 April and 
21 April 2011, respectively.  
</p>
<p>91. In the fifth communication, dated 8 June 2011, the Government provided 
information on two outstanding cases which was considered insufficient to lead to their 
clarification. However, the cases were later clarified by the sources. </p>


<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>92. Information was received from sources concerning two outstanding cases. As a 
result, these two cases were clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>93. Following the information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to 
clarify two cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>94. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted five cases to the 
Government; of those, four cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the source and one case remains outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>95. While the Working Group thanks the Government for its cooperation by replying to 
all the communications it received, it is concerned at the number of urgent appeals and 
urgent actions transmitted during the reporting period and that &#8213;accurate information on the 
detention of&#8214; a number of &#8213;persons and their place or places of detention&#8214; was allegedly not 
</p>
<p>&#8213;made promptly available to their family members, their counsel or to any other persons 
having a legitimate interest in the information&#8214;, as required by article 10.2 of the 
</p>
<p>Declaration.  
</p>
<p>96. The Working Group would also like to recall article 7 of the Declaration, which 
states that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal 
political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify enforced 
disappearances&#8214;.

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>97. The Working Group transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>98. The first case concerned Mr. <b>Rajkumar Sanayaima Rajkumar</b>, who was allegedly 
abducted by a combined operation of the Indian intelligence agency &#8213;RAW&#8214; (Research and 
</p>
<p>Analysis Wing) and the Bangladesh intelligence agency from Lalmatia, area of Dhaka, 
under Mohammadpur Police Station, on 29 September 2010. In accordance with the 
Working Group&#8217;s usual practice, the Government of India received a copy of the case. The 
</p>
<p>Government of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of this case. 
</p>
<p>99. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Mohammad Rafiqul Islam, </b>who was allegedly 
abducted in Dhaka on 15 February 2011, by agents of the &#8213;Rapid Action Battalion&#8214;. The 
Government acknowledged receipt of this case. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>100. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Bangladesh. This information was transmitted to the Government on 4 
May 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. 
</p>
<p>101. Sources informed the Working Group that enforced disappearance is frequently 
being used as a tool by the country&#8217;s law-enforcement agencies, paramilitary and armed 
forces to detain and even extra-judicially execute individuals. According to sources, 
enforced disappeared persons were abducted by plain-clothed armed men, who introduced 
themselves as officers of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).  They were handcuffed and 
blindfolded and taken into the RAB's custody and detained for several months in unknown 
locations without any contact. During detention, they were reportedly regularly tortured. 
The Working Group was also informed that the victims were detained for four to eight 
months without any record being kept by any of the country's institutions.  
</p>
<p>102. It was also reported, that after prolonged detention, the disappeared were driven a 
few hundred miles away from their place of detention and dropped off blindfolded at night 
in isolated rural areas. The persons were then arrested by the local police, who informed the 
relatives to fetch them. The sources further indicated that, during their disappearance, the 
victims were subjected to serious intimidation by the Rapid Action Battalion's officers, 
including being subjected to death threats. 
</p>
<p>103. The Working Group was also informed that relatives of the disappeared are 
prevented from exercising their right to register a complaint regarding the alleged 
abductions. Cases will not be registered after it is reported to the authorities that the 
abductors introduce themselves as officers of the RAB. There has not been a single 
recorded instance in which the perpetrators of the abductions and disappearances have 
shown specific documents or warrants issued by courts or referring to particular criminal 
cases against the abducted person. 
</p>
<p>104. The Government acknowledged receipt of the general allegation. However, no 
response regarding its content has been received during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>105. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted seven cases to the 
Government; of those, one case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the Government, and six remain outstanding. </p>


<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>106. The Working Group is concerned that it sent two urgent actions and received 
allegations that enforced disappearances are being used by law enforcement officers, 
paramilitary agents and armed forces. The Working Group regrets that no information has 
been received from the Government in connection with the general allegation and calls on 
the Government to cooperate in accordance with relevant Human Rights Council 
resolutions.

<p>111. In light  of the  responses received from the Government, according to which 
investigations on all outstanding cases have been extended twice during the reporting 
period, the Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration to conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8213;for as long as the fate of the 
</p>
<p>victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8214; (article 13.6) and to ensure that 
statutes of limitations, where they exist, relating to acts of enforced disappearance are 
substantial and commensurate with the extreme seriousness of the offence (article 17.3).

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>114. In a communication dated 2 September 2011, the Government transmitted 
information concerning the actions undertaken with regard to the recommendations made 
by the Working Group after its visit to the country in June 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>115. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This information was transmitted to the 
Government on 4 May 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. 
</p>
<p>  
 * In accordance with the practice of the Working Group, Jasminka Dzumhur did not participate in the 
</p>
<p>decisions relating to this section of the report. </p>


<p>116. It was reported that among the gravest violations of human rights and serious 
breaches of international humanitarian law that occurred during the armed conflict in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the massacre of &#8213;Kori&#263;anskestijene&#8214; took place on 21 August 
</p>
<p>1992, during which between 150 and 200 men were extra-judicially executed.  
</p>
<p>117. According to the sources, over the years, exhumations have been carried out at 
Kori&#263;anskestijene in order to locate, identify and return the mortal remains of the victims to 
</p>
<p>their families. It is reported that the authorities have failed to clarify the fate and 
whereabouts of all the victims and, in the most likely event of their death, to exhume, 
locate, identify and return the remains to the families, as well as to judge and sanction those 
responsible for these crimes. 
</p>
<p>118. On 31 March 2009, the trial against Mr. Zoran Babi&#263;, Mr. Milorad Radakovi&#263;, Mr. 
Milorad &#352;krbi&#263;, Mr. Du&#353;an Jankovi&#263; and Mr. &#354;eljko Stojni&#263; (known as Case Babi&#263;et al., 
</p>
<p>No.X-KR-08/549) commenced before the Trial Chamber of the War Crimes Section of the 
Bosnia and Herzegovina Court. The accused were indicted in relation to the 
Kori&#263;anskestijene massacre and formally charged with crimes against humanity pursuant to 
</p>
<p>article 172 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina.   
</p>
<p>119. Allegedly, on 29 May 2008, Mr. Du&#353;an Jankovi&#263; was arrested in Prijedor and placed 
in pre-trial detention. However, on 11 November 2009, he obtained the conditional release 
pending trial, notwithstanding that representatives of relatives of the victims of the 
Kori&#263;anskestijene massacre had repeatedly pointed out that there was a risk of flight. Mr. 
Du&#353;an Jankovi&#263; was sentenced in his capacity as Commander of the Police Station in 
</p>
<p>Prijedor and found guilty of crimes against humanity. However, he failed to appear in court 
when the verdict was delivered. Since then, he is nowhere to be found and has been 
officially declared at large.  
</p>
<p>120. It is argued that the escape of Mr. Du&#353;an Jankovi&#263; could easily have been avoided 
had the necessary precautionary measures been put in place by the competent authorities. 
Further, it is alleged that this situation is not an isolated incident, but rather seems to be part 
of a common practice. There is concern that the authorities fail to ensure that persons 
indicted or convicted for, crimes against humanity or war crimes do not flee from custody. 
</p>
<p>121. No response was received from the Government during the reporting period 
regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>122. The Working Group thanks the Government for its report on the implementation of 
the recommendations made after its visit to the country in 2010, and hopes to continue with 
the cooperation to address all the recommendations. The Working Group looks forward to 
work on a follow-up report. 
</p>
<p>123. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government to 
its general allegation sent on 15 May 2009, concerning the Government&#8217;s alleged 
</p>
<p>involvement in a practice of renditions and secret detention (A/HRC/13/31, par. 103-5), 
notwithstanding a reminder sent on 26 August 2011. The Working Group also regrets that 
no response has been received to the general allegation transmitted on 4 May 2011. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>137. The Working Group transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. The first case concerned Ms. <b>Mao Hengfeng</b>, a well know human rights 
defender who was allegedly abducted by Shanghai and Anhui police officers on 24 
February 2011 from her home in Yangpu District, Shanghai. The second case concerned 
Mr. <b>Ershidin Israel</b> who, on 30 May 2011, allegedly disappeared after being extradited 
from Kazakhstan to China.  Mr. Israel was the subject of an urgent appeal previously 
transmitted to the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>138. The Working Group transmitted seven communications under its urgent appeal 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>139. The first communication was transmitted on 2 March 2011, jointly with five other 
special procedures mechanisms, and concerned an alleged pattern of arrests, detentions, 
enforced disappearances and intimidations of human rights defenders and lawyers across 
the country following calls for protests inspired by the so-called &#8213;Jasmine Revolution&#8214;. 
Reportedly, Messrs. <b>Gu Chuan</b>,<b> Qi Zhiyong</b>,<b> Li Hai</b>,<b> Ran Yunfei</b>,<b> Huang Yanming</b>,<b> 
Tang Jingling </b>and<b> Ye Du</b>,<b> Yao Lifa</b>, <b>Chen Zhonghe</b>,<b> Xiao Shichang</b>,<b> Zhang Junjie</b>,<b>

subjects of the urgent appeal sent on 2 March 2011, were released. 
</p>
<p>141. On 14 July 2011, the Government replied: &#8213;In regard to the Urgent Appeal letter 
dated May 11, 2011 of the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention,

further investigation into the cases of the other individuals mentioned in the Urgent Appeal 
letter. The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the full text of the above be 
recorded in the relevant UN documents.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>142. The third communication was transmitted on 23 May 2011, and concerned a group 
of approximately <b>300 monks of the Ngaba Kirti Monastery</b>, located in Ngaba County, 
Sichuan, who on the night of 21 April 2011, were allegedly arrested and taken to unknown 
destinations in ten military trucks by agents from the People&#8217;s Armed Police, Public 
</p>
<p>Security Bureau and People&#8217;s Liberation Army.  
</p>
<p>143. The fourth communication was transmitted on 28 July 2011, jointly with four other 
special procedures mechanisms, and concerned the situation in Kardze County, Sichuan 
Province, and the arrest and detention of 54 individuals, between June and July 2011, 
reportedly in order to suppress the protests comprising mainly nuns and monks calling for 
&#8213;freedom of religion in Tibet&#8214;. In this regard, it was alleged that the fate and whereabouts 
of the following 47 individuals were unknown:<b> </b>Mr.<b> Tsewang Tashi</b>; Mr. <b>Gyurmey 
Sonam</b>; Mr. <b>Oser Phuntsog</b>; Ms. <b>Tseyang</b>;<b> </b>Ms.<b> Ringa</b> (Rinchen Choetso);<b> </b>Ms.<b> Jampa

Phuntsok</b>. 
</p>
<p>144. The fifth communication was transmitted on 29 July 2011, jointly with other two 
special procedures mechanisms, and concerned Messrs. <b>Ershidin Israel</b>,<b> Shemshiden 
Israel</b>,<b> Abdusalam Nasir</b>,<b> </b>and<b> Abdukerin Dihan</b>.<b> </b>According to the source, on 30 May 
2011, Mr. Ershidin Israel was allegedly extradited to China without his family and lawyers 
being informed and, on 14 June 2011, Chinese authorities allegedly confirmed that Mr. 
Ershidin Israel was in their custody but, reportedly, they failed to disclose his whereabouts.<b> 
</b>It was also reported that on 9 June 2011, Messrs. Abdusalam Nasir and Abdukerin Dihan 
were arrested by security forces in Suydung, Gulja district, and that, on 13 June 2011, Mr. 
Shemsiden Israel, one of Mr. Ershidin Israel&#8217;s brothers, was arrested by security forces in 
Urumqi. The Working Group later transmitted the allegations concerning Mr. <b>Ershidin 
Israel </b>as an urgent action. 
</p>
<p>145. The sixth communication was transmitted on 30 August 2011, jointly with three 
other special procedures mechanisms, and concerned the Buddhist monk<b> </b>Mr.<b> Jigme Guri</b> 
(also known as Akhu Jigme and Lama Jigme), who was allegedly arrested by police and 
security forces on 20 August 2011, in the hotel &#8213;Z-hong Yan&#8214; in Hezou, Kanlho prefecture. 
</p>
<p>146. The seventh communication was transmitted on 6 October 2011, jointly with three 
other special procedures mechanisms, and concerned the alleged continued harassment and 
repression of the monastic community in and around the Ngaba Kirti Monastery and the 
self-immolation of two young monks,<b> Mr. Lobsang Kalsang Harutsan</b>g and <b>Mr. 
Lobsang Kunchok</b>, on 26 September 2011. Reportedly, Chinese security forces and the 
police extinguished the fire and the two monks were taken away to an unknown location. It 
has also been alleged that one monk has died following the self-immolation.  </p>


<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>147. Information was submitted from sources concerning reported obstacles encountered 
in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. This information was transmitted to the 
Government on 21 September 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>148. Sources reported that proposed revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law will legalise 
enforced disappearances in the country. It was reported that the draft law, if enacted, would 
allow State organs, when they suspect someone of involvement in terrorism, state security, 
or major corruption, to detain this person in an ad hoc location of their choice for up to six 
months and keep this detention secret should they argue that notifying relatives might 
&#8213;impede&#8214; the investigations. 
</p>
<p>149. It was further reported that the authority nominally in charge of controlling the 
application of this measure is inadequate, as the controlling authority&#8212;&#8213;the immediately 
superior level of the People&#8217;s Procuratorate or the public security organ&#8214;&#8212;is the same as 
the one that imposes the measure, only one hierarchical level up. Further, it was reported 
that in cases of corruption &#8211; they are investigated by the Procuratorate, not by the Public 
Security Bureau and thus the Procuratorate would therefore be in the position of 
supervising itself. It was further alleged that the Communist Party&#8217;s Political and Legal 
</p>
<p>Committees are in charge of &#8213;coordinating&#8214; (xietiao) the activities of the Public Security 
Bureau, the Procuratorate, and the Courts and that these Committees are generally headed 
by the head of the Public Security Bureau and handle all politically sensitive cases. It was 
reported therefore that in practice a decision to put someone in secret detention would have 
been taken by the Political and Legal Committee, with the Public Security Bureau as the 
implementer and the Procuratorate and the Courts assisting their work, not controlling it.  
</p>
<p>150. It was further reported that there are no meaningful relief procedures for the duration 
of the secret detention as a suspect detained in a place unknown to him/her and without the 
possibility of communicating with anyone else besides the person&#8217;s captors. Thus the 
person would be unable to contest his/her detention. 
</p>
<p>151. It was also alleged that the risk of torture and ill-treatment would be considerably 
heightened if the law was enacted as permitting such detentions for up to six months in 
secret locations outside of any regulatory system is likely to lead to widespread abuses.  It 
was also reported that there is a high risk of law enforcement agencies abusing the measure, 
if it comes into force, given the current practice of detaining critics and dissidents, 
including a number of lawyers, in secret locations. It is feared that law enforcement 
agencies might be tempted to use this measure in ordinary criminal cases to circumvent the 
more onerous procedural requirements mandated by the ordinary law. 
</p>
<p>152. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation 
during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>153. The Government transmitted a communication on 4 September 2009, which could 
not be translated in time for inclusion in the 2009 and 2010 annual reports (A/HRC/13/31 
and A/HRC/16/48).  It concerned two outstanding cases and the information provided was 
not considered sufficient to lead to their clarification. Its content is as follows: &#8213;Receipt is 
</p>
<p>hereby acknowledged of communication No. G/SO 271 CHINA from the Chair of the 
United Nations Human Rights Council&#8217;s Working Group on Enforced Disappearances. The 
</p>
<p>Chinese Government has carefully looked into the matter referred to in the communication 
and wishes to make the following reply: 1. Concerning Gao Zhisheng. Gao Zhisheng is an </p>


<p>ethnic Han male born on 20 April 1964; he is originally from Shaanxi. On 15 August 2006, 
Gao Zhisheng was placed in criminal detention by the public security authorities on 
suspicion of the crime of subverting State power, and on 21 September of that year he was 
arrested by order of the procuratorial authorities. On 22 December 2006, the Beijing First 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court sentenced Gao, taking into account his meritorious service, to 
</p>
<p>three years&#8217; imprisonment and five years&#8217; probation, and to one year&#8217;s deprivation of his 
political rights. Gao served his sentence and is now on probation in Beijing; when 
necessary, he occasionally stays at another location. For example, at the end of June 2009 
he went to his family home in Shaanxi to pay his respects to deceased family members. 2. 
Concerning Choekyi Nyima. Since the reign of the Qianlong emperor during the Qing 
Dynasty in the eighteenth century, the entire process relating to the search for and 
determination of the Dalai Lama and the child reincarnation of the Panchen Lama as well as 
the sitting-in-bed ceremony of the latter has required the transmission of a detailed report 
by the local Tibetan government to the central Government, with authority for the final 
determination regarding the child reincarnation concentrated in the central Government. 
The drawing of lots from a golden urn has likewise become a historically established 
practice since that time. The Dalai Lama&#8217;s disregard for a historically established practice, 
his flouting of a religious ritual and his arrogating to himself the recognition of the so-
called reincarnated Panchen Lama are illegal and devoid of any effect. They also show 
extreme disrespect for the Dalai Lama&#8217;s historic lineage. Choekyi Nyima, who, according 
to the foreign media is just an average Chinese boy belonging to the Tibetan ethnic 
minority, is in excellent health. China is a country governed by the rule of law, and citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p>legitimate rights are protected by national legislation; Choekyi Nyima has not been placed 
under &#8213;house arrest&#8214;. He and his family are currently leading normal lives in Tibet, and he 
</p>
<p>is receiving an excellent education. They have on numerous occasions said that they do not 
wish to have their normal lives disrupted in any way, and we should fully respect their 
wishes. The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in 
its entirety in a relevant document of the United Nations.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>154. In 2010, the Government transmitted four communications which could not be 
translated in time for inclusion in the 2010 annual report (A/HRC/16/48). 
</p>
<p>155. The first communication, dated 12 February 2010, could not be translated in time for 
inclusion in the present report either. 
</p>
<p>156. In the second communication, dated 25 February 2010, the Government provided 
information concerning two outstanding cases and the information provided was not 
considered sufficient to lead to their clarification. Its content is as follows: &#8213;Zhou Yongjun, 
</p>
<p>also known as Zhou Yazhou, is an ethnic Han male born on 15 September 1967; he was 
arrested on 8 May 2009. Accusing the defendant Zhou Yongjun with the crime of fraud, the 
People&#8217;s Procuratorate of Shehong County, Sichuan Province, brought charges before the 
</p>
<p>Shehong County People&#8217;s Court; the Court held an open trial, in which it was found that:  
In May 2008, the defendant Zhou Yongjun, having learned that account No. 239-082258-
888 deposited with the Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong and belonging to one Wang 
Xingxiang contained a large sum of money, addressed letters in the name of &#8213;Wang 
Xingxiang&#8214; on three separate occasions to said bank requesting that the sum of 6 million 
</p>
<p>Hong Kong dollars should be transferred from the account of Wang Xingxiang to the Hong 
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) in Hong Kong and Citibank in Australia; 
in the three letters he altered the beneficiary&#8217;s address and telephone number. After an 
</p>
<p>employee of the Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong received the letters, an investigation 
revealed that the signature of &#8213;Wang Xingxiang&#8214; on the letters differed from the signature 
on file with the bank and that the holder of the account in question was deceased; the 
account had been frozen by the courts, thereby blocking any requested transfers and 
thwarting Zhou&#8217;s fraudulent activity. The Shehong County People&#8217;s Court in Sichuan 
Province found that Zhou, with unlawful possession as his objective, used fabrication and </p>


<p>dissemblance to fraudulently obtain other people&#8217;s property, that his actions constituted the 
</p>
<p>crime of fraud, that the number of fraudulent activities was particularly high and thus 
merited punishment. As Zhou&#8217;s attempted fraud was not successful, his punishment was 
</p>
<p>reduced, in accordance with the law. The Shehong People&#8217;s Court sentenced him to nine 
years&#8217; imprisonment and fined him 80,000 yuan renminbi. Zhou contested the verdict and 
lodged an appeal; his appeal is currently being heard in the Suining Intermediate People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Court in Sichuan Province. China is a country governed by the rule of law, and the judicial 
authorities complied strictly with the relevant legislation and legal procedures in their 
handling of this case. The hearings were open and procedures were transparent, and Zhou&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>two appointed defence lawyers were able to present a full defence. There has been no 
instance of any &#8213;enforced disappearance&#8214; in this case. Gao Zhisheng is an ethnic Han male 
</p>
<p>born on 20 April 1964; in December 2006 he was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment 
with a five-year reprieve and one year&#8217;s deprivation of his political rights. Following his 
period of probation, the public security authorities, acting in accordance with articles 75 
and 76 of the Criminal Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the Regulations of the 
</p>
<p>Public Security Authorities regarding the Supervision of Criminals under Surveillance, 
Deprived of their Political Rights, Sentenced with Reprieve, on Parole or Temporarily 
Released to Obtain Medical Treatment, placed Gao under surveillance. In 2009, following 
his release, Gao Zhisheng is working in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where he remains in contact 
with his wife, Geng He, who is in the United States, and with other family members in 
China. The public security authorities have not taken any coercive measures with regard to 
Gao, and there has been no instance of any &#8213;enforced disappearance&#8214; in the handling of his 
case.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>157. In the third communication, dated 22 April 2010, the Government provided 
information concerning one outstanding case. The information provided was not considered 
sufficient to lead to its clarification. Its content is as follows: &#8213;Receipt is hereby 
acknowledged of communication No. G/SO 217/1 and G/SO 214 (56-23) CHN 5/2010 
dated 8 March from the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief of 
the United Nations Human Rights Council, containing an urgent appeal. The Chinese 
Government has looked carefully into the matter referred to in the communication and 
wishes to make the following reply: First, Jiang Feng is an ethnic Han male, born on 14 
March 1968, whose current address is Anhui Province, Hefei, Luyangqu, Tongchenglu No. 
</p><p>136. In December 1999 he was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment for organizing and 
making use of a cult to undermine the law. In December 2002, he was released upon 
completion of his sentence. Having served his sentence, Jiang showed no repentance and 
continued to use the Falun Gong cult to carry out illegal activities. On 18 February 2010, as 
he was preparing to board flight CO 086 at Shanghai&#8217;s Pudong Airport, to go to the United 
States, he was stopped by the border inspection service and detained by the public security 
authorities on criminal charges. On 20 February he was returned to Hefei, in Anhui 
Province, for investigation. The public security authorities ascertained that he had indeed 
made use of a cult to perform illegal activities. On 9 March, the People&#8217;s Government Re-
education through Labour Committee of Hefei sentenced him to one year and six months of 
re-education through labour and so informed his father, Jiang Haichao. Jiang Feng and his 
family never appealed or challenged the decision in writing. Secondly, the Chinese 
Government wishes to reiterate that Falun Gong is not a religion. It is a cult of the worst 
kind. It makes use of the devious heresies it supplies to its practitioners to brainwash people 
into extremism, violating human rights, mutilating lives, undermining society and 
conducting a wide range of illegal and criminal activities. If the Chinese Government has, 
in accordance with the law, prohibited the Falun Gong organization, it is to protect the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the people and to uphold the Constitution and the 
sanctity of the law. For the overwhelming majority of Falun Gong followers who have been 
swindled and cheated, the Chinese Government remains committed to conducting patient </p>


<p>education activities to extricate them from Falun Gong&#8217;s mind control and to allow them to 
</p>
<p>resume a normal life. A small minority of criminals are subjected to punishment as they 
have engaged in criminal activity and broken the country&#8217;s laws. There is no direct cause-
and-effect relationship between this and whether or not they are practitioners of Falun 
Gong. China is a State governed by the rule of law. The Public Security Bureau has handled 
this case in accordance with the law. Coercive measures were taken against Jiang in 
accordance with the law because he made use of a cult to carry out illegal activities. When 
the coercive measures were applied all his rights were scrupulously respected. The Chinese 
Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in its entirety in the 
relevant United Nations documents.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>158. In the fourth communication, dated 5 July 2010, the Government replied to an 
urgent appeal transmitted on 30 April 2010, concerning Mr. Cao Du, a grantee of the 
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, who was reportedly abducted 
by the police at the Beijing Capital International Airport before boarding his flight to New 
York City to attend the ninth session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues and later taken to an unknown location. In this communication, the 
Government reported: &#8213;Receipt is hereby acknowledged of joint urgent appeal No. G/SO 
</p>
<p>218/2 G/SO 217/1 G/SO 214 (67-17) G/SO 214 (107-9) Indigenous (2001-8) CHN 12/2010 
[China] dated 30 April from the Chairman of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
the Chairman of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous peoples and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The Chinese Government has 
looked carefully into the matter referred to in the communication and wishes to make the 
following reply: Sodmongol, whose name as it appears in his passport is Cao Du, is an 
ethnic Mongolian male from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, born in January 1965, and a teacher 
at the Ethnology Research Department of the Chaoyang City Teachers College of 
Technology in Liaoning Province. Because Cao was engaged in counterfeit book 
production and illegally publishing and selling book collections, he is suspected of 
economic crimes. On 20 April he was placed in criminal detention by the Chaoyang public 
security authorities. His case is being heard at the moment. China is a State governed by the 
rule of law, and the departments concerned have handled this case in accordance with the 
law. Measures have been taken against Cao in accordance with the law because he 
committed illegal acts. His every right has been upheld in accordance with the law. The 
Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in its entirety in 
the relevant United Nations documents.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>159. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted three communications to 
the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>160. In the first communication, dated 24 February 2011, the Government provided 
information concerning one outstanding case which was not considered sufficient to lead to 
its clarification. Its content is as follows: &#8213;In regard to the Urgent Appeal letter dated 23 
March 2010 of the Special Rapporteur on Torture of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council (UA G/SO 214 (53-24) CHN 6/2010) and the Urgent Appeal letters dated 26 April 
2010, 6 August 2010 and 21 December  2010 of the Working Group on Enforced 
Disappearances of the United Nations Human Rights Council (G/SO 217/1 China), the 
Chinese Government hereby gives the following reply after a careful investigation into the 
circumstances of those letters was carried out: I.  GAO Zhisheng, male, born on 20 April 
1964, was sentenced to a jail term of three years in 2006 for inciting subversion of State 
power, for which case he was granted a five-year reprieve yet deprived of political rights 
for one year. After GAO was sentenced to probation, under &#8213;The Criminal Law&#8214; and &#8213;The 
Administrative Regulations on the Supervision of Offenders under Control, Political Rights </p>


<p>Deprivation, Probation, Parole or Medical Parole by the Public Security Organ&#8214;, GAO was 
put under inspection and supervision by the public security organ. According to the above 
laws, with approval from the public security authorities, offenders sentenced to probation 
can relocate or leave their residence. GAO used to write and meet his family, and said he 
was doing well in life and was in good health for the past few months. II. China is a country 
ruled by law. The judiciary strictly complies with the law when handling cases. In this 
respect, no torture was ever applied to GAO, let alone any &#8213;enforced disappearance&#8214;. The 
</p>
<p>Chinese Government respectfully requests that the full text of the above be recorded in the 
relevant UN documents.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>161. In the second communication, dated 14 July 2011, the Government replied to the 
urgent appeal transmitted on 11 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>162. The third communication, dated 11 October 2011, could not be translated in time for 
inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>163. Information was received from sources concerning three outstanding cases. As a 
result, one case was clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>164. Based on the information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 
one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>165. On 8 April 2011, the Working Group issued a press release showing serious concern 
at the wave of enforced disappearances that allegedly took place in China over the previous 
few months. The Working Group reminded that enforced disappearance is a crime under 
international law and that even short-term secret detentions can qualify as enforced 
disappearances. In addition, the Working Group stressed that there can never be an excuse 
to disappear people, especially when those persons are peacefully expressing their dissent 
with the Government of their country. In this press release, the Working Group also 
indicated that it continues to monitor cases which occurred in the past, including Messrs. 
Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, known as the 11th Panchen Lama, Gao Zhisheng, and Feng Jiang, 
and called on the Chinese authorities to release all those who have been disappeared and to 
provide full information on the fate and the whereabouts of the persons who have allegedly 
disappeared.5 
</p>
<p>166. On 8 June 2011, the Working Group issued a press release voicing its serious 
concern in relation to the reported enforced disappearance of more than 300 hundred 
Tibetan monks of the Ngaba Kirti Monastery, located in Ngaba County, Sichuan Province, 
in late April 2011. The Working Group called on the authorities to provide full information 
on the fate and the whereabouts of the persons who have disappeared and encouraged them 
to undertake full investigations into the on-going practice of enforced disappearances and 
ensure that those responsible are prosecuted and receive sentences appropriate to the 
gravity of the crime.6

<p>167. On 1 November 2011, the Working Group and five other special procedures 
mandate holders issued a press release voicing grave concern over reports of heavy security 
measures, in and around the area of the Tibetan Buddhist Kirti monastery - which houses 
some 2,500 monks - and other monasteries in Aba County, an area of Sichuan province 
with many ethnic Tibetans in south-west China. In this press release, the Working Group 
highlighted that any enforced disappearance is unacceptable and such practices are in 
violation of international law while expressing concern that a proposed revision to the 
Chinese Criminal Procedure Law will legalise enforced disappearances in the country. In 
addition, the Working Group stated that this heinous practice is not permitted under any 
circumstances and that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever may be invoked to justify 
an enforced disappearance.7 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>168. Representatives of the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China met with the 
Working Group at its ninety-fourth session.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>169. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 119 cases to the 
Government; of those, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 77 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 30 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>170. The Working Group welcomes the meeting held with the Government, as well as the 
several responses received. However, the Working Group remains gravely concerned about 
various reports of the high number of alleged disappearances which took place in China 
during the reporting period, as reflected in the seven urgent appeals and two urgent actions 
transmitted to the Government.  
</p>
<p>171. The Working Group is also concerned about reports that proposed revisions to the 
Criminal Procedure Law will legalise enforced disappearances in the country. In this 
connection, the Working Group would like to recall article 3 of the Declaration, according 
to which &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other 
</p>
<p>measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its 
jurisdiction.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>172. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government to 
its general allegation transmitted on 6 August 2010 (A/HRC/16/48, par. 118-21), 
concerning the unrests in Urumqi, Xinjiang in July 2009, which reportedly led to the 
detention of hundreds of Uighur young men and the disappearance of some of them; 
notwithstanding the reminder transmitted on 26 August 2011. The Working Group also 
regrets that, during the reporting period, no response has been received to a general 
allegation transmitted on 21 September 2011.

<p>182. On the last day of the Working Group&#8217;s visit to the country, on 3 October 2011, the 
Government provided a report on outstanding cases. Concerning 33 cases, the Working 
Group transmitted the information to the sources for possible closure. Regarding the 
remaining cases, the information provided was considered insufficient to lead to their 
clarification. In addition, the Government considered that six cases were duplicates. The 
Working Group decided to delete four of those cases and to further review the remaining 
two. 
</p>
<p>  
 9 The Working Group determined that 24 outstanding cases were duplicated and were subsequently

<p><b>  Press release 
</b></p>
<p>187. On 31 December 2010, the Working Group and five other United Nations human 
rights mechanisms issued a press release expressing deep concern about human rights 
violations reportedly being committed in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in relation to the presidential 
elections. In this press release, the Working Group stressed that, when committed in certain </p>


<p>circumstances, enforced disappearances may amount to a crime against humanity and that 
those who have perpetrated such horrendous acts shall be held accountable.10  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>188. On 18 February 2011, the Government extended a general invitation to visit the 
country to special procedures mechanisms, including to those mechanisms which issued the 
press release dated 31 December 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>189. The Working Group has been concerned this year by numerous reports according to 
which enforced disappearances have occurred during the unrest at the time of the 
presidential elections. It looks forward to cooperate with the new Government to deal with 
these issues in the future. All enforced disappearances should be promptly investigated and 
persons accused of having committed such violations should be arrested and prosecuted. 
Trials should only be carried out in competent civilian courts and punishment be 
commensurate with the gravity of the crime; the individual and the collective right to know 
the truth about the practice of enforced disappearance in the country should be 
implemented; and victims of enforced disappearances should obtain redress and integral 
reparations.

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>203. The Working Group transmitted three newly-reported cases to the Government.<b> </b>One

<p>204. The Working Group transmitted four communications under its urgent appeals 
procedure to the Government.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>205. The first was sent on 23 December 2010, jointly with three other special procedures

having been taken to undisclosed locations.  
</p>
<p>208. The fourth was sent on 4 February 2011, jointly with four other special procedures

</p>
<p><b>  General Allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>209. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Egypt. This information was transmitted to the Government on 4 May 
2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. 
</p>
<p>210. It was reported that the practice of enforced disappearances by the State Security 
Investigations (SSI) was used routinely before 2011. It has been alleged that SSI officers 
summon individuals or arrest them, after which the person disappears for a period of time, 
for up to two or three months. 
</p>
<p>211. It was further alleged that the disappeared persons were secretly detained at offices in 
local governorates for a few weeks, whereas longer-term detention occurs at SSI 
headquarters in Cairo, although reportedly, Egyptian law prohibits detention in SSI 
facilities, which are not recognized as official places of detention. 
</p>
<p>212. Allegedly, when families of the disappeared made informal enquiries with the police or 
prosecutor&#8217;s office, officials either denied knowing the whereabouts of their relative, or 
</p>
<p>informed them verbally, and informally, that SSI was detaining the person. 
</p>
<p>213. Sources alleged that SSI officers in late June - early July 2009 detained 24 persons in 
connection with the armed robbery of a Cairo jewellery shop in May 2008, and their 
alleged plans to carry out attacks on shipping in the Suez Canal, and held them in 
incommunicado for up to two months. Sources further reported that, in what is known as 
the Hizbollah case, SSI officers detained 22 defendants in incommunicado detention from 
the time of their arrest in late 2008 and early 2009 until they appeared before the State 
security prosecutor in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>214. No response was received from the Government during the reporting period regarding 
this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>215. The Government transmitted three communications to the Working Group, dated 28 
May, 4 June and 12 August 2010, which could not be translated in time for inclusion in the 
2010 annual report (A/HRC/16/48).  
</p>
<p>216. In the first communication, the Government submitted a reply with regard to 18 
outstanding cases, and requested additional information on six of them. Based on the 
information provided by the Government, the Working Group decided, at its 95 th session, to 
apply the six-month rule to one case. The information provided concerning the remaining 
cases was considered insufficient to lead to their clarification.  
</p>
<p>217. The second and third communications concerned two outstanding cases which had 
been previously clarified by the sources.  
</p>
<p>218. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted one communication dated 11 
October 2011. This communication concerned two outstanding cases, and the information 
provided was considered insufficient to lead to their clarification. </p>


<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>219. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a mission to 
the country. A reply has not yet been received. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>220. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 66 cases to the 
Government; of those, 18 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, seven cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 41 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>221. The Working Group is concerned by the fact that, during the reporting period, it sent 
two cases under its urgent action procedure and four urgent appeals.  Furthermore, the 
Working Group notes that after the general allegation was sent to the Government 
numerous changes have taken place in Egypt. The interim and new Governments should 
secure the fulfilment of the duties under the Declaration to ensure that cases of enforced 
disappearance are promptly investigated and persons accused of having committed these 
violations are arrested and prosecuted; that trials are only carried out in competent civilian 
courts and punishments are commensurate with the gravity of the crime; the individual and 
collective right to know the truth about the practice of enforced disappearance in the 
country and finally that the victims of enforced disappearance obtain redress and integral 
reparations. 
</p>
<p>222. The Working Group also regrets that no response has been received to the general 
allegation transmitted to the Government on 4 May 2011.

<p><b>  Urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>230. On 20 June 2011, the Working Group, jointly with three other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the alleged 
disproportionate use of force by law enforcement authorities to disperse a demonstration by 
opposition supporters, on 26 May 2011. According to allegations, the fate and whereabouts 
of dozens of protesters who were detained during the demonstrations were unknown. 
</p>
<p>231. On 7 July 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal. It provided information 
on the reasons and legal basis of the dispersal of demonstrations and indicated that all of the 
detainees have been promptly brought before a judge within twelve hours as required by 
Georgian law. Moreover it indicated that most of the detainees were visited by legal 
attorneys speedily, and by the public defender of the country almost immediately. In 
addition it indicated that the International Committee of the Red Cross was given full 
opportunity to visit the detainees freely. It further stressed that no family approached the 
police to register a missing individual and/or start a search investigation. In this regard it 
also mentioned that the Ministry of Internal Affairs, on 27 May 2011, released a list of 
detainees and that since then no formal notification of missing demonstrators was submitted 
to the same ministry. Moreover, the Government reported that the Ministry scrupulously 
checked the information on missing persons made by the Public Defender as well as 
available in the media and that the allegation proved untrue. Finally, the Government 
indicated that it is closely inspecting all allegations of possible excessive use of force. </p>

<p><b>  Prompt intervention letter 
</b></p>
<p>240. On 18 August 2011, the Working Group, jointly with two other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning death 
threats and acts of intimidation made against Messrs. <b>Fredy Peccerelli, Jos&#233; Suasnavar, 
Leonel Paiz </b>and<b> Omar Gir&#243;n, </b>members of the Forensic Anthropology Foundation of 
Guatemala (Fundaci&#243;n de Antropolog&#237;a Forense de Guatemala), after the judicial decision 
in the case of the Dos Erres massacre in El P&#233;ten in 1982. 
</p>
<p>241. On 14 October 2011, the Government replied to the prompt intervention letter. In its 
communication, the Government reported that it is currently investigating the exact facts 
and informed the Working Group about the investigative measures currently underway.  In 
addition, the Government reported that it is currently providing personal security to Mr. 
Peccerelli and his family, and that there is a permanent security officer at the premises of 
the Foundation located in the capital and in a project carried out in La Verbena cemetery, 
also in the capital. Finally, the Government reported that it provides security to the staff of 
the Foundation as they carry out their work in different parts of the country.  </p>


<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>242. The Working Group received information from sources concerning reported obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in Guatemala. This information was transmitted to the 
Government on 9 September 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>243. It was alleged that there are obstacles in the advancement in criminal courts of cases of 
enforced disappearance and that, despite significant efforts and repeated calls upon 
Congress to make the necessary budgetary allocations, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
continues to lack the capacity and resources to advance in investigations of thousands of 
cases of enforced disappearance which, as a result, remain pending.  
</p>
<p>244. It was further reported that the extensive use by defendants and acceptance by the 
Courts of the recourse of amparo frequently constituted an obstacle to justice and delayed 
the criminal processes.  
</p>
<p>245. Detailed information has been received concerning the case of the enforced 
disappearance of Efra&#237;n B&#225;maca in 1992. Despite the sentence of the Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights in 2000, and its repeated orders of compliance between 2003 and 2010 
ordering the re-opening of the case, and a 2005 request by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to 
open the investigation, it is reported that the judicial investigation remains to be re-initiated. 
It is claimed that this delay of justice could set a worrying precedent in similar cases, 
effectively denying victims the rights to truth and justice.  
</p>
<p>246. Information has been further received concerning the lack of a National Search 
Commission, as was recommended by the Working Group in its report following its visit to 
Guatemala in 2006. Although an initiative has been discussed in Congress since 2007, it 
still has not been adopted. As a result, the fate and whereabouts of the large majority of the 
purported 45,000 cases of enforced disappearance from the armed conflict remain 
unknown. As these cases were not investigated, victims are left without knowing the truth 
and without access to an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>247. It is further alleged that obstacles are encountered by the organizations and individuals 
involved in forensic investigations aimed at identifying victims of enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>248. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation 
during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>249. The Government transmitted five communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>250. In the first communication, dated 16 December 2010, the Government transmitted 
information on the activities undertaken in the follow-up to the recommendations made by 
the Working Group following its visit to the country in 2006, which were reflected in 
A/HRC/16/48/Add.2. 
</p>
<p>251. In the second communication, dated 25 January 2011, the Government transmitted a 
copy of a letter that the Coordinator of the Historic Archives of the National Police (AHNP) 
sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In this letter, the Coordinator of the AHNP 
reflected some of the contributions that the institution could do with regard to the 
clarification of the whereabouts of the thousands of detained-disappeared in Guatemala. In 
addition, he highlighted that the capacity and compromise of this institution to submit 
information, archival analysis and technical expertise to contribute to the clarification of </p>


<p>many of the cases of victims of enforced disappearance that are registered with the 
Working Group are clearly established.  
</p>
<p>252. In the third communication, dated 9 August 2011, the Government transmitted a report 
on the measures it is taking to determine the whereabouts of the 2,899 persons who were 
victims of enforced disappearance. The report provided detailed information on the 
progress made with regard to investigations.   
</p>
<p>253. In the fourth communication, dated 14 October 2011, the Government replied to the 
prompt intervention letter transmitted on 18 August 2011. In the fifth communication, dated 
21 October 2011, the Government retransmitted the information provided on 14 October 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>254. Representatives of the Government of Guatemala met with the Working Group at its 
ninety&#8211;third session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>255. The Working Group thanks the Government of Guatemala for the information 
provided including that which originated from the Historic Archives of the National Police. 
As the Working Group stated in its report on its visit to Guatemala, the historic archives 
may possess crucial information that can clearly determine the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared people. It wishes to recall its General Comment on the right to the truth in 
relation to enforced disappearances, which states that &#8213;archives &#8230; should be preserved and 
made fully accessible to the public&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>256. In addition, the Working Group acknowledges with thanks the information provided by 
Government with regard to the prompt intervention letter transmitted during the reporting 
period and recalls article 13.3 of the Declaration, according to which States must take steps

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>260. The Working Group transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. The first case concerned Mr. <b>Oscar El&#237;as L&#243;pez Mu&#241;oz</b>, who was allegedly 
arrested by agents of the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation in San Pedro Sula, 
Department of Cort&#233;s, on 21 August 2011. Mr. L&#243;pez Mu&#241;oz was the subject of an urgent 
appeal previously transmitted to the Government. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Jos&#233; 
Reinaldo Cruz Palma</b>, who was allegedly arrested by individuals believed to be agents of 
the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation and of the National Preventative Police 
when travelling from La Lima to San Pedro Sula, on 30 August 2011<b>. </b>Allegedly, a police 
patrol witnessed the arrest and, after the events, it left in a different direction.<b> </b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeals  
</b></p>
<p>261. On 27 September 2011, the Working Group, jointly with another special procedures 
mechanism, transmitted an urgent appeal concerning Mr. <b>Oscar El&#237;as L&#243;pez Mu&#241;oz</b>.<b> </b>He 
was allegedly arrested by agents of the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation in 
San Pedro Sula, Department of Cort&#233;s, on 21 August 2011.  The Working Group later 
transmitted the allegations concerning Mr. Oscar El&#237;as L&#243;pez Mu&#241;oz as an urgent action. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>262. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 209 cases to the 
Government; of those, 37 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the Government, 43 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
source, and 129 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>263. The Working Group notes with concern that, during the reporting period, it transmitted 
two cases under its urgent action procedure, one of them also as an urgent appeal. The 
Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states that &#8213;No State shall 
practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, which provides 
</p>
<p>that &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to 
</p>
<p>prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction.&#8214;   </p>

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>264. The Working Group sent two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. The first case concerned Mr.<b> Suresh Singh Longjam</b>, who was allegedly 
abducted on 18 February 2011, from his home located at Top Siphai, Mayai Leikai, by 
Indian State agents in military uniforms. The Government acknowledged receipt of this 
case. 
</p>
<p>265. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Gurumayum Jeetseshwor Sharma</b>,<b> </b>also known as<b> 
G.M. Changjou </b>or<b> Gypsy</b>,<b> </b>who was allegedly arrested at his house located in Duncan, 
Dimapur on 18 August 2011, by a combined team of unidentified Indian Security Forces 
and Manipur Police Commandos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication from the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>266. According to the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, the Government of India 
received a copy of the case of Mr.<b> Rajkumar Sanayaima Rajkumar</b>, which is recorded 
under the Government of Bangladesh (see paragraph 98). 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>267. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in India. This information was transmitted to the Government on 
11 February 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-second session. 
</p>
<p>268. It was reported that between 1989 and 2009 the actions of military and paramilitary 
forces in Kashmir have resulted in more than 8,000 enforced and involuntary 
disappearances. It was reported that in the majority of instances related to enforced 
disappearances, civilians have been detained during cordon and search operations. In </p>


<p>certain instances, non-combatant persons were extra-judicially executed following 
detention, and labeled afterwards by the Government of India, and the authorities in Jammu 
and Kashmir as militants who emigrated to Azad Kashmir in Pakistan to seek arms training. 
It was reported that acts of oppression and violence towards presumed insurgents were 
deemed as acts of service, which were rewarded and compensated. 
</p>
<p>269. It was alleged that security forces personnel selected local male residents or 
professional gravediggers, usually those respected within the local community, and asked 
that graves be prepared to bury the dead. The graveyards were constructed on local 
religious or community owned or used land and dug by local residents at the coercion of 
security personnel. In instances where the number of bodies brought by security personnel 
exceeded the initial count given by security personnel, more than one body was buried in 
each grave. The bodies examined were routinely delivered at night, and some of them were 
bearing marks of torture and burns. Photographs of the dead were reportedly documented 
by local police stations, while identification occurred through clothing and distinguishing 
features or numbering. 
</p>
<p>270. According to the source, between April 2008 and November 2009, a total of 2,700 
graves were examined by civil society organisations in three provinces, encompassing a 
total of 55 villages. It was documented that in the Baramulla province 1,321 bodies were 
found; in the Kupwara province 1,487 bodies were found; and in the Bandipora province 
135 bodies were found. In 177 cases, a grave contained more then one body, resulting in the 
discovery of more than 420 bodies. It was alleged that approximately 99 percent of those 
buried were men. Gravediggers and caretakers were unable to give an exact number of 
bodies, given the extent of defacement of some of them. 
</p>
<p>271. The source alleges that numerous exhumed bodies that were found in unknown graves 
were identified as local inhabitants, both civilian and militant, who were victims of 
extrajudicial executions. According to the source, it was found that civilian residents from 
one geographic area in Kashmir were killed in another area and, at times, transferred to a 
third area for burial. There are allegations that some people were killed in the state of 
Gujarat in India, outside of Kashmir. It was alleged that security forces manufactured the 
identities of victims and their records of weapons possession.  
</p>
<p>272. The source further alleges that the persons who were forced to bury the dead in 
unmarked and unknown graves suffered psychological health impact as a consequence. 
Also, it is reported that, in some cases, these graveyards are placed next to schools and 
homes, impacting on women and children. 
</p>
<p>273. The Government has not responded to the general allegation during the reporting 
period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>274. The Government transmitted six communications to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>275. In the first communication, dated 30 November 2010, the Government provided 
information on one outstanding case, which was considered insufficient to lead to its 
clarification.  
</p>
<p>276. In the second communication, dated 6 December 2010, the Government replied to the 
prompt intervention letter transmitted on 21 July 2010, regarding the arrests and detentions 
of Mr. Ghulam Nabi Shaheen and Mr. Mian Abdul Qayoom reportedly based on, <i>inter alia</i>, 
their work on alleged human rights violations including enforced disappearances in 
Kashmir. The Government reported that the individuals, who were involved in 
secessionist&#8217;s activities and other acts highly prejudicial to the security of the State, were </p>


<p>arrested following due procedure as laid down by the law and produced before the Court. 
This matter is <i>sub judice.</i> 
</p>
<p>277. In the third, fourth, fifth and sixth communications, dated 17 December 2010, 16 and 
17 May 2011, and 11 August 2011, the Government provided information on five, one, 33, 
and one outstanding case respectively. The information provided in relation to all of these 
cases was considered insufficient to lead to their clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>278. Sources provided information on two outstanding cases. One case was clarified as a 
result. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>279. Following the information provided by the source, the Working Group decided to 
clarify one case. 
</p>
<p>280. Following the expiration of the six-month rule, the Working Group decided to clarify 
16 cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>281. On 16 August 2010, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a mission 
to the country. On 18 August 2010, the Government acknowledged receipt of the request. A 
reminder letter was transmitted on 18 August 2011. On 29 August 2011, the Government 
replied that the request was conveyed to the relevant authorities in India. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>282. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 433 cases to the 
Government; of those, 12 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 68 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 353 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>283. The Working Group remains concerned about allegations of a widespread practice of 
enforced disappearances between 1989 and 2009 and the existence of mass graves. 
According to the Declaration, the Government is under obligation to investigate those 
allegations and bring to justice those responsible. Additionally, the right to know the truth 
about the fate and the whereabouts includes, when the disappeared person is found to be 
dead, the right of the family to have the remains of their loved one returned to them, and to 
dispose of those remains according to their own tradition, religion or culture. The remains 
of the person should be clearly and indisputably identified, including through DNA analysis 
securing the full participation of the family and without fully informing the general public 
of such measures.   
</p>
<p>284. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government of 
India to its general allegation sent on 16 January 2009 (A/HRC/13/31, par. 260-6), 
concerning legal provisions in India that may hamper the right to a prompt and effective 
remedy, notwithstanding the reminder transmitted on 26 August 2011. The Working Group 
also regrets that no response was received from the Government regarding the general 
allegation transmitted on 11 February 2011. </p>

<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>286. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in Indonesia. This information was transmitted to the Government 
on 13 January 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-second session. 
</p>
<p>287. It was reported that, between 1997 and 1998, a number of students and other activists 
who opposed the former President Suharto&#8217;s New Order regime were victims of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance in Indonesia. According to the source, while nine of the students originally 
abducted were released later (Pius Lustrilanang, Desmon J Mahesa, Haryanto Taslam, 
Mugiyanto, Aan Rusdianto, Faisol Reza, Rahardja Waluya Jati, Nezar Patria and Andi 
Aref), 13 remain disappeared: Suyat, Yani Afri, Sonny, M. Yusuf, Noval Alkatiri, Dedy 
Hamdun, Ismail, Bimo Petrus, Abdun Naser, Hendra Hambali, Ocok Siahaan, Yadin 
Muhidin and Wiji Thukul. However, according to the source, no effective measures are 
being undertaken to investigate these cases. 
</p>
<p>288. Reportedly, in October 2006, the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas 
HAM) released the results of an inquiry that made reference to numerous human rights 
violations against these activists, including torture and enforced disappearance, and 
requested reparations for the victims and their families. The report was later submitted to 
the Attorney General, to investigate the alleged crimes. 
</p>
<p>289. The source informed the Working Group that the Attorney General did not follow up 
the recommendations made by Komnas Ham because he argued that, according to article 43 
of Law No. 26/2000, the establishment of an ad hoc Human Rights Court by the Parliament 
was a precondition to any investigation. However, the source indicated that, in previous </p>


<p>opportunities, ad hoc courts were established only after the Attorney General had conducted 
investigations. The source also indicated that, on 21 February 2008, the Constitutional 
Court issued Decree No. 18/PUU-V/2007 which interpreted article 43 of Law 26/2000 in 
the sense that mere allegations of gross violations of human rights are not a sufficient basis 
for the Parliament to establish an ad-hoc Human Rights Court. Instead, the Attorney 
General has to conduct an investigation to give the Parliament the necessary information to 
enable it to establish an ad hoc Human Rights Court.  
</p>
<p>290. In this context, the source alleged that it is not necessary to establish an ad hoc Human 
Rights Court for the Attorney General to conduct investigations. On the contrary, the source 
sustains that the legislation requires that after the Attorney General concluded the 
investigation and the Parliament recommended the establishment of an ad-hoc Human 
Rights Court, the President issues a decree to enable the formal establishment of the ad hoc 
Human Rights Court. 
</p>
<p>291. In addition, the source informed the Working Group that to move the case forward, on 
27 February 2007, the House of Representatives established a Special Committee regarding 
cases of abductions and enforced disappearances of student activists in 1997 and 1998. As 
this Committee proved ineffective, the House of Representatives established a new Special 
Committee in October 2008. It was reported that this Committee issued the following 
recommendations: first, the President should establish an ad hoc Human Rights Court; 
second, the President and other relevant Government institutions should take appropriate 
steps to immediately locate the whereabouts of the 13 people that are still disappeared; 
third, the President should facilitate the rehabilitation and satisfactory compensation to the 
victims and their families; and fourth, the Government should ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance. On 28 
September 2009, the plenary of the House of Representatives agreed with the 
recommendations of the Special Committee and recommended that the President establish 
an ad hoc Human Rights Court to deal with the 1997-1998 disappearances. However, 
according to the source, no concrete actions have been taken so far.  
</p>
<p>292. No response was received from the Government during the reporting period regarding 
this general allegation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>293. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to Indonesia. The Government responded that it would not be possible to receive 
the Working Group during 2007 and that greater benefit would be derived from a visit at a 
later date. Reminder letters were sent on 16 August 2010 and 18 August 2011. No reply has 
been received during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>294. The Working Group would like to recall article 4.1 of the Declaration, which states that 
&#8213;All acts of enforced disappearance shall be offences under criminal law punishable by 
</p>
<p>appropriate penalties which shall take into account their extreme seriousness.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>295. The Working Group considers that the right to obtain redress (article 19 of the 
Declaration) cannot be satisfied unless judicial decisions are properly implemented. In this 
sense, it recalls that effective decisions constitute an instrument thought which States 
comply with its obligation under the Declaration, &quot;to contribute by all means to the 
prevention and eradication of enforce disappearance&quot; (article 2). The Working Group 
further recalls that &quot;enforced disappearances render their perpetrators and the State or State 
authorities which organize, acquiesce in or tolerate such disappearances liable under civil 
law, without prejudice to the international responsibility of the State concerned&#8214; (article 5). </p>


<p>296. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government to the

</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>301. The Working Group transmitted three communications under its urgent appeals 
procedure to the Government.  
</p>
<p>302. The first communication was transmitted on 11 January 2011, jointly with four other 
special procedures mechanisms, and concerned reports regarding the pattern of executions, 
arrests and detentions carried out and which may be carried out in the country. In this 
regard, it was reported, <i>inter alia</i>, that Mr. <b>Reza Sharifi Bukani </b>was allegedly transferred </p>


<p>from Cellblock 4 at Rajayi Shahr (Gohardasht) Prison in Karaj to an undisclosed location 
on 27 December 2010.  
</p>
<p>303. On 4 February and 21 June 2011, the Government transmitted a reply with regard to 
certain allegations contained in this urgent appeal. However, no information was provided 
with regard to Mr. Reza Sharifi Bukani. 
</p>
<p>304. The second communication was transmitted on 22 February 2011, jointly with four 
other special procedures mechanisms, and concerned reports of arrests and detention of

Baha&#8217;i faiths. It was reported, <i>inter alia</i>, that Mr. <b>Leonard Keshishian</b>, who is pastor with 
the Assemblies of God Church in Isfahan, was arrested on 31 December 2010 and his place 
of detention remained undisclosed.  
</p>
<p>305. The third communication was transmitted on 19 October 2011, jointly with seven other 
special procedures mechanisms, and concerned the situation of human rights defenders in 
Iran. In this regard, it was reported, <i>inter alia</i>, that on 31 July 2011, Messrs. <b>Kouhyar 
Goudarzi</b> and <b>Behnam Ganji</b> were arrested in Teheran by plain-clothed security forces. 
They were reportedly brought, along with a third individual, to an undisclosed location and 
later transferred to Teheran&#8217;s Evin prison. It is further reported that a few days after the 
arrest, Mr. Goudarzi&#8217;s friends and family requested information regarding his whereabouts 
but the Tehran Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Evin prison denied the 
</p>
<p>arrest. Furthermore, it is alleged that requests by Mr. Goudarzi&#8217;s lawyer to the Government 
for information regarding his whereabouts and condition have been denied. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communications from the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>306. According to the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran received a copy of the case concerning Mr. <b>Taher Eslambolipoor</b>, an 
Iranian citizen, which is recorded under the Government of Iraq (see paragraph 315). 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>307. The Government transmitted two communications dated 4 February and 21 June 2011, 
regarding the urgent appeal transmitted on 11 January 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>308. Sources provided information on four outstanding cases. As a result, one case was 
clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>309. Following the information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 
one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>310. The Government of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2004, which was 
delayed at the request of the Government. Reminder letters were sent on 20 July 2009, 16 
August 2010 and 18 August 2011, asking the Government to set a date for the proposed 
visit. The Government has not yet set a new date for the visit despite the fact that more than 
six years have elapsed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>311. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 536 cases to the 
Government; of those, five cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided </p>


<p>by the source, 14 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 517 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>312. The Working Group notes with concerned that it sent four urgent actions and three 
urgent appeals during the reporting period. The Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the 
Declaration which states that &#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, which provides that &#8213;Each State shall take effective 
</p>
<p>legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of 
enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction.&#8214; 
</p>

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>314. The Working Group transmitted one case under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government concerning Mr. <b>Qussai Abdelraouf Nasser</b>, who was allegedly abducted by 
three armed men wearing the black uniforms of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior forces on the 
edge of Al Baladyat, on 21 September 2011. Mr. Qussai Abdelraouf Nasser was the subject 
of an urgent appeal previously transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>315. The Working Group transmitted two newly-reported cases to the Government. The first 
case concerned Mr. <b>Taher Eslambolipoor</b>, an Iranian citizen, who was allegedly abducted 
on 14 November 2006. The sources alleged that Mr. <b>Eslambolipoor</b> fell from the boat he 
was travelling on between the Port of Mahshahr and Bandar-Abbas in Iran, and that he was 
allegedly rescued by a United States&#8217; ship and taken to Buka Prison in Iraq. He was 
</p>
<p>allegedly last seen between April and May 2009 in a prison known as &#8213;Motar Prison&#8214;, in </p>


<p>Baghdad&#8217;s Airport, Iraq. In accordance with the Working Group&#8217;s usual practice, the 
</p>
<p>Governments of Iran and United States received a copy of the case. 
</p>
<p>316. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Hassan Al Ani</b>, who was allegedly abducted at his 
neighbour&#8217;s house in Baghdad by agents of the Ministry of the Interior, on 6 September 
</p>
<p>2005.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>317. The Working Group sent two communications under its urgent appeals procedure to 
the Government. 
</p>
<p>318. The first one was transmitted on 27 April 2011, jointly with four other special 
procedures mechanisms, and concerned the alleged excessive use of force against peaceful 
protesters by Iraqi security forces during the peaceful demonstrations, which have been 
taking place in Baghdad since early February 2011. More specifically, it was reported that 
Mr. <b>Haidar Shihab Ahmad Abdel Latif</b> had been detained by Iraqi security forces during 
a demonstration in Tahrir Square, Baghdad, on 1 April 2011.  
</p>
<p>319. The second one was transmitted on 10 October 2011, jointly with another special 
procedures mechanism, and concerned Mr. <b>Qussai Abdelraouf Nasser</b>, who was allegedly 
abducted by three armed men wearing the black uniforms of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior 
forces on the edge of Al Baladyat, on 21 September 2011. The Working Group later 
transmitted the allegations concerning Mr. Qussai Abdelraouf Nasser as an urgent action. 
</p>
<p><b>  General Allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>320. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Iraq. This information was transmitted to the Government on 4 May 
2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. 
</p>
<p>321. It was reported that Iraqi security forces have been operating secret detention facilities 
in Baghdad. It was further alleged that one secret detention site was located in a Justice 
Ministry detention facility at Camp Justice, known as Justice 2 (Sijn al-Adaleh 2).  
</p>
<p>322. It was reported that in November 2010, Iraqi authorities transferred more than 280 
detainees to a secret site within Camp Justice, a military base in northwest Baghdad just 
before an international inspection team was to examine conditions at the detainees' previous 
location at Camp Honor in the Green Zone. 
</p>
<p>323. It was alleged that about 80 of the 280 detainees were being held by the 56th Brigade 
at the secret site and have had no access to lawyers or family members. It is also reported 
that prison inspectors were not permitted to conduct visits to the section of the facility. It is 
also alleged that the Counter-Terrorism Service was holding the rest of these detainees.  
</p>
<p>324. It was alleged that detainees are held incommunicado and in inhumane conditions, 
often for months at a time. It is alleged that interrogators beat the detainees, hung them 
upside down for hours at a time, administered electric shocks to various body parts, 
including the genitals, and asphyxiated them repeatedly with plastic bags put over their 
heads until they passed out. 
</p>
<p>325. It has also been reported that another secret prison was being run by the 54th Brigade, 
with the assistance of the 56th Brigade, in the old Muthanna airport in Western Baghdad. It 
is alleged that this secret prison held about 430 detainees who were denied access to their 
families or lawyers and were tortured. </p>


<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>326. The Government replied to the general allegation on 19 July 2011. 
</p>
<p>327. Regarding the allegation that a secret detention site was located in one of the Ministry 
of Justice&#8217;s detention facilities at Camp Justice, known as Justice 2, the Government 
responded that Justice 2 is under the authority of the Iraqi Department of Corrections in the 
Ministry of Justice and is subject to regular periodic visits by prisons and detention centres 
inspections teams from the Ministry of Justice. With regard to Camp Honour, the Iraqi 
Ministry of Justice officially declared that the camp would be closed in mid-May of this 
year. The High Council of the Judiciary has confirmed that Camp Honour detainees were 
relocated to [other] sections of the Iraqi Department of Corrections by means of a phased 
transfer, rather than a simultaneous transfer. 
</p>
<p>328. The Government noted that its Ministry&#8217;s annual reports pointed to shortcomings in the 
prisons and detention centre and indicated that there was overcrowding. The Ministry 
recommended that the situation should be tackled by expediting the cases of detainees and 
avoiding prolonged periods of detention.  
</p>
<p>329. With regard to the allegation that another secret prison was being run by the 54th 
Brigade, with the assistance of the 56th Brigade, in the old Muthanna airport in Western 
Baghdad, the Government noted that its teams frequently visit the 54th Brigade site at Al-
Muthanna military airport and have not found any secret prison there. The Government 
indicated that it was informed by the administration that the 56th Brigade&#8217;s policy is to 
</p>
<p>transfer persons detained by members of the Brigade immediately to its detention centre. 
</p>
<p>330. In conclusion, the Government stated that its Ministry plays a positive role in the 
monitoring and documentation process with regard to alleged or observed violations. The 
Government shared with the Working Group statistics for 2008, 2009 and 2010 on the 
outcomes of actions taken in relation to acts of torture, indicating actions taken, in addition 
to follow-up actions with the judicial authorities and the administrations of prisons and 
detention centres. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>331. The Government submitted two communications dated 15 March and 11 November 
2010, which were not reflected in the 2010 annual report (A/HRC/16/48). 
</p>
<p>332. In the first communication, the Government provided information on 16 outstanding 
cases. Based on this information, the Working Group decided to apply to six-month rule to 
nine cases at its ninety-fourth session. Concerning one case, the information provided was 
considered insufficient to lead to its clarification. The remaining six cases had been 
previously clarified by the source. In this communication, the Government also provided 
information with regard to the processing of cases of enforced disappearances of Iraqi 
nationals and non-nationals under the former regime. 
</p>
<p>333. In the second communication, the Government provided information on one case 
which had previously been clarified by the source and provided a copy of the instrument of 
accession to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>334. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted one communication dated 19 
July 2011, replying to a general allegation transmitted on 4 May 2011, concerning the 
existence of secret detention facilities in Baghdad. </p>


<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>335. Information was received from sources concerning one outstanding case, confirming 
the information provided by the Government and, consequently, leading to its clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>336. On the basis of the information provided by the Government, the Working Group 
decided to clarify one case following the confirmation from the source. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meeting 
</b></p>
<p>337. Representatives of the Government of Iraq met with the Working Group at its ninety-
fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding  
</b></p>
<p>338. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 16,548 cases to the 
Government; of those, 30 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 108 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 16,410 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>339. The Working Group notes with concern that, during the reporting period, it transmitted 
two urgent appeals and that the allegations on one of them were later transmitted as an 
urgent action.  The Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states that 
&#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, 
which provides that &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or 
</p>
<p>other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory 
under its jurisdiction.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>340. In addition, the Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the 
Declaration that &#8213;any person deprived of liberty shall be held in an officially recognized 
</p>
<p>place of detention and, in conformity with national law, be brought before a judicial 
authority promptly after detention&#8214; (article10).

<p><b>  Communication from the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>343. According to the Working Group&#8217;s usual practice, the Government of Italy received a 
copy of the general allegation that was transmitted to the Government of Morocco on 13 
January 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-second session (see paragrahs 442-446). 
</p>
<p>344. It was reported that, in the context of the application of law 03-03 in the fight against 
terrorism, in force since 5 June 2003, there have been several cases of people arrested and 
held in secret detention for several days and, on some occasions, months.  It was further 
reported that some of the individuals were arrested by Italian police officers while they 
were residing in Italy. In particular, it was reported that Mr. Ahmed Arrahmouni, born in 
1988, and Mr. Mohamed Hilal, both university students usually residing in Parma, Italy,  
were allegedly arrested by the Italian police on 19 April 2010, and turned over to the 
Moroccan authorities the same day. On 27 January 2011, the Government acknowledged 
receipt of this communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>345. On 28 September 2011, the Government of Italy replied to a general allegation 
transmitted on 15 May 2009, concerning its alleged involvement in a practice of renditions 
and secret detention (A/HRC/13/31, par. 310-4), of which a reminder was sent on 26 
August 2011. 
</p>
<p>346. It reported that in connection to the case of Mr. Nasr Osama Mustafa Hassan, it replied 
on several occasions, including during the discussion before the Committee against Torture 
in May 2007 and following the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention mission&#8217;s report to 
Italy in January 2009. The Government stated that it also replied on related issues, 
including on the role of the Italian Intelligence and Military Security Service (SISMI), in 
December 2007, on the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, in October 2008, and on secret detention and extraordinary 
rendition, in July 2009.  
</p>
<p>347. The Government reported that at the conclusion of the judicial investigation (Inquiry 
No. 10838/05.21) on 5 December 2006, the State&#8217;s Public Prosecutor Office in Milan 
requested the referral for trial of approximately 26 people serving at the time of the event at 
SISMI. The request was later confirmed by the Milan Tribunal on 16 February 2007. 
</p>
<p>348. The Government indicated that during the proceedings, Mr. L.P., a marshal of the 
Carabinieri Corps based in Milan, admitted his involvement in the abduction of Mr. Nasr 
Osama Mustafa Hassan. He was sentenced to a one-year-nine-months-and-ten-days 
detention penalty pursuant to article 444 of the penal code on 16 February 2007. The </p>


<p>marshal was also suspended from his service within Carabinieri Corps, in accordance with 
the internal disciplinary proceeding.  
</p>
<p>349. The Government reported that it filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court on 
14 March 2007, alleging a conflict of competence between the Government and the judicial 
authorities in Milan, due to the use by the latter of evidence obtained by violating the State 
secrecy law. Following a decision by the Constitutional Court issued in April 2009 that 
partially granted the request from the Government, the judicial authorities in Milan resumed 
the trial.  
</p>
<p>350. On 4 November 2009, the Tribunal in Milan released a verdict, by which almost all the 
defendants were convicted, save the charges of abduction brought against Mr. Niccol&#242; 
Pollari, the former Director of the SISMI at the time, Mr. Marco Mancini, a former SISMI 
officer, and three Italian officers. Three members of the CIA were deemed protected by the 
Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Government indicated that the Tribunal decided that a 
compensation amounting to one million Euros and 500,000.00 Euros should be paid 
respectively to Mr. Nasr Osama Mustafa Hassan and his wife.  
</p>
<p>351. The Court of Assise of Appeal later confirmed the conviction of 25 individuals 
including 22 CIA agents, on 15 December 2010.  
</p>
<p>352. The Government recalled that according to articles 24 -25 -27 &#8211; 101 - 111 and 112 of 
the Constitution, the presumption of innocence remains until a definitive verdict is issued 
by the Court of Cassation, at the conclusion of a fair trial. Such approach is strictly linked 
to the enforcement of the so-called &#8213;principle of the double level of adjudication&#8214; 
characterised by three possible levels of trial, the last of which is before the Court of 
Cassation.  
</p>
<p>353. The Government therefore indicated that as long as the proceedings before the Milan 
Court continue, it cannot draw any conclusions, prior to a definitive verdict by the Court 
and reiterated its commitment to provide updates and clarifications on the case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>354. On 28 September 2011, the Government transmitted one communication to the

<p><b>  General Allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>360. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Kenya. This information was transmitted to the Government on 9 
September 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session.  
</p>
<p>361. The source informed the Working Group that, between 2006 and 2008, hundreds of 
enforced disappearances were perpetrated in the Mt. Elgon district. These enforced 
disappearances took place in the context of the conflict that occurred between State 
authorities and the Sabaot Land Defence Forces (SLDF). It was reported that most of the 
disappearances were carried out in 2009 when the Government launched a joint military-
police operation, called &#8213;Okoa Maisha&#8214;, against the SDLF. According to sources, most 
males in Mt. Elgon district, sometimes even children, were arrested and detained by 
security forces and often subjected to torture. It appears that those who died were thrown 
into mass grave sites. Reportedly, those grave sites are not protected and have not been 
exhumed for the purpose of identifying the remains contained therein.  
</p>
<p>362. It was alleged that no serious investigations of those disappearances were conducted. 
The events of Mt. Elgon are excluded from the mandate of both the Commission of Inquiry 
into the Post Election Violence Experience in Kenya after the General Election (CIPEV) 
and the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC). Furthermore, it was also 
alleged that the court summons delivered by a pre-trial chamber of the International 
Criminal Court against six individuals does not encompass the events that occurred at Mt. 
Elgon.  
</p>
<p>363. The source alleged that the Criminal Code of Kenya does not contain an autonomous 
crime of enforced disappearance. It also supports the view that the criminal code does not 
exclude statutory limitations as far as enforced disappearances. Reportedly, the families of 
the persons subjected to enforced disappearances were threatened to not report violations </p>


<p>and were therefore afraid to participate as witnesses in proceedings due to harassment and 
threats by security personnel. Finally, it was reported that no reparation has been provided 
to the victims.  
</p>
<p>364. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>365. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration 
to investigate matters concerning enforced disappearances, to punish those responsible, and 
to provide reparations to victims (articles 3 and 19).  
</p>
<p>366. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government 
concerning the general allegation transmitted on 9 September 2011.

specifically, it was reported that four brothers, Messrs. <b>Al Mahdi Saleh Hmeed</b>, <b>Sadek 
Saleh Hmeed</b>, <b>Ali Saleh Hmeed</b>, and <b>Fredj Saleh Hmeed</b>, were allegedly arrested in their 
home in Tripoli and taken to an undisclosed location by the Libyan security forces, on 16 
February 2011.  
</p>
<p>380. On 4 March 2011, sources informed that the four brothers had been released. 
</p>
<p>381. The second communication was transmitted on 14 March 2011, jointly with four other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</b> and <b>Andrei 
Netto</b>, who were reportedly abducted by Government forces while travelling in the area 
called Zawiyah in western Libya, on 10 March 2011. Moreover it was reported that the 
Libyan authorities admitted holding these two individuals but refused to inform about their 
whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>382. The third communication was transmitted on 18 March 2011, jointly with three other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>Safa Aldin Hilal Mohamed Al 
Shareef</b>, who was allegedly arrested by Internal Security Forces agents at his workplace in 
Ras Lanouf, on 15 February 2011; <b>Adel Abdallah Almadaa Salah</b>, who was allegedly 
arrested by Internal Security Forces agents in a hotel in Tripoli on 18 February 2011; 
<b>Abdalsalem Alqanashi</b>, who was allegedly arrested by internal security forces agents at 
the Libyan-Egyptian border on 19 February 2011; <b>Ali Mubarak Omran</b>, who was 
allegedly arrested by a group of persons supporting the central military troops at Al Abrak 
airport on 19 February 2011; <b>Alsadek Almabrouk Hamada Bridan</b>, who allegedly 
disappeared from Abu Slim prison when internal security forces were evacuating the 
prisoners on 16 February 2011. In addition, the urgent appeal concerned Messrs. 
<b>Abdalkarim Mohamed Abdalkarim</b>,<b> Salah Almabrouk Saad</b>,<b> Abdallah Abdalsilam 
Khalifa</b>,<b> Nasser Amar Ali</b>,<b> Farj Amar Ali</b>,<b> Assam Mohamed Abdalrazak Shahat</b>,<b> Ali 
Mohamed Salah</b>,<b> Souad Ali Boumbrika</b>,<b> Abdessalam Youness</b>,<b> </b>and<b> Adam Masaoud 
Mohamed Idrisswere</b>, who were allegedly abducted by a group of people supporting the 
central military troops in Al Abrak airport where they were last seen on 19 February 2011. </p>


<p>Finally, the urgent appeal made reference to reports that hundreds of recruits of the Air 
Force Academy allegedly disappeared. It further referred to an alarming figure of hundreds 
of persons allegedly detained in unknown places. 
</p>
<p>383. The fourth communication was transmitted on 31 March 2011, jointly with four other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerning fourteen journalists who may have been 
subjected to enforced disappearance while reporting in Libya, namely: Messrs. Ahmand 
<b>Val Wald-Eddin, Lufti Al-Massoudi, Ammar Al-Hamdan, Kamil Al-Tallou, Dave 
</b></p>
<p><b>Clark, Joe Raedle, Roberto Schmidt, Atef al-Atrash, Mohamed al-Sahim, Mohamed 
</b></p>
<p><b>al-Amin, Idris al-Mismar, Salma al-Shaab, Suad al-Turabouls, </b>and<b> St&#233;phane Lehr</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>384. On 28 October 2011, the Working Group requested the Government to undertake a 
visit to the country. On 31 October 2011, the Government replied that it will extend an 
invitation to the Working Group once the situation in the country returns to normal and 
once a Government is formed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Press Releases 
</b></p>
<p>385. On 24 March 2011, the Working Group issued a press release expressing deep concern 
about allegations received according to which hundreds of enforced disappearances had 
been committed over the previous few months in Libya. The Working Group recalled that 
enforced disappearances may amount to a crime against humanity when perpetrated in 
certain circumstances.11 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>386. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 16 cases to the 
Government; of those, seven cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the source and nine remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>387. The Working Group has been gravely concerned about the number of allegations of 
enforced disappearances received during the reporting period, as reflected in the urgent 
action and the four urgent appeals transmitted to the Government, which make reference to 
several individuals.  
</p>
<p>388. The Working Group welcomes the willingness shown by the new Government to 
consider the possibility of extending an invitation for a visit in the future.  
</p>
<p>389. The Working Group encourages the new Government to secure the fulfilment of its 
obligations under the Declaration to ensure that cases of enforced disappearance are 
promptly investigated and persons accused of having committed these violations are 
arrested and prosecuted; that trials are only carried out in competent civilian courts and 
punishments are commensurate with the gravity of the crime; the individual and collective 
right to the truth about the practice of enforced disappearance in the country; and finally 
that the victims of acts of enforced disappearance obtain redress and integral reparations, 
including the means for as complete a rehabilitation as possible (articles 3, 13, 18, and 19). 
</p>

<p>390. The Working Group would also like to recall article 7 of the Declaration, which states 
that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal political 
instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify enforced 
disappearances.&#8214;

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>392. The Working Group sent 31 cases under its urgent action procedure to the

</p>
<p>393. The first four cases concerned Messrs. <b>Juan Carlos Chavira Soprano</b>,<b> Dante Castillo

</b>Reportedly, the detention took place a few hours after one of the family members had an 
argument with the municipal police. 
</p>
<p>397. The following four cases concerned the alleged detention of Messrs. <b>Adri&#225;n Nava 
Cid</b>,<b> Israel Arenas Dur&#225;n</b>,<b> Javier Garc&#237;a &#193;lvarez</b>,<b> </b>and<b> Reynaldo Garc&#237;a &#193;lvarez</b>, by

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>402. The Working Group transmitted 45 newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
majority of these cases occurred in 2009, in Coahuila.12 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>403. The Working Group transmitted two communications under its urgent appeal 
procedure to the Government.  
</p>
<p>404. The first communication was transmitted on 19 January 2011, jointly with three other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerning the alleged disappearance of a <b>group of 
migrants </b>and the subsequent harassment and threats against <b>Father Solalinde </b>and<b> his 
collaborators</b> in &#8213;Albergue de Migrantes hermanos en el Camino de la Esperanza,&#8214; a 
shelter for migrants in Oaxaca.  
</p>
<p>405. On 7 February 2011, the Government replied to this urgent appeal and reported that the 
train in which the migrants were travelling was stopped by an operation of the National 
Institute of Migration (INM), which in coordination with the Federal Police and members 
of the Mexican Army resulted in the detention of 92 persons. It was further reported that 
thereafter, the train continued its journey and was boarded by other migrants who managed 
to evade the operation. Later, the train was stopped because the track was obstructed with 
timber and the driver heard shots in the back of the train, without verifying what was 
happening. The Government provided information on the investigations underway as well 
as on other measures taken with regard to these events, including the reinforcement of the 
security for Father Solalinde and his shelter. In addition, it reported that the INM in 
coordination with several Government agencies began, in April 2010, a series of meetings 
in order to develop an Integral Strategy for the Combat of the Kidnapping of 
Undocumented Migrants that travel through the country. Finally, it informed on the 
guarantees to the effective protection of the human rights of the migrants who transit the 
territory where the facts occurred. 
</p>
<p>406. The second communication was transmitted on 2 September 2011, jointly with another 
special procedures mechanism, concerning the alleged detention and ill-treatment of a 
minor by agents of the National Defence Secretariat (Secretar&#237;a de la Defensa Nacional) on 
25 July 2011. According to the source, the minor was at risk of being subjected to enforced 
disappearance. Reportedly, he has been taken to the detention center (Centro Nacional de 
Arraigo) and threatened to confess his alleged participation in an armed confrontation in 
Nuevo Laredo.  Reportedly, the circumstances of his case were similar to those related to 
another minor who had been allegedly arrested, forced to pledge guilty for the charges 
against him, and who had later disappeared.  
</p>
<p>407. On 3 September 2011, the source reported that the minor who had been the subject of 
the urgent appeal had been released. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>408. On 2 November 2011, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the 
Government regarding the alleged acts of intimidation and threats against the <b>Mu&#241;oz 
family</b> after they filed a criminal complaint at the Attorney General's Office regarding the 
alleged disappearance of eight members of their family by agents of the Federal Police on 
19 June 2011. On 27 September 2011, the Working Group had transmitted those eight cases 
under its urgent action procedure (see par. 396). 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See annex V for the list of names of the newly-reported cases of disappeared persons.  </p>


<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>409. The Government transmitted five communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>410. In the first communication, dated 7 February 2011, the Government replied to the 
urgent appeal dated 11 January 2011. 
</p>
<p>411. In the second communication, dated 18 May 2011, the Government submitted 
comments on the preliminary observations made by the Working Group at the end of its 
visit to the country.  
</p>
<p>412. In the third communication, dated 16 June 2011, the Government provided additional 
information concerning reported disappearances in Coahuila in follow-up to the mission 
undertaken by the Working Group in March 2011. 
</p>
<p>413. In the fourth communication, dated 27 June 2011, the Government informed the 
Working Group that on 22 June 2011, the decree promulgating the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was published 
in the official gazette thus making this instrument binding in the whole country. 
</p>
<p>414. In the fifth communication, which was received by the Working Group during the 
meeting held with representatives of the Government on 4 November 2011, the 
Government provided comments regarding the draft visit report. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources</b> 
</p>
<p>415. Sources provided information on eight outstanding cases. As a result, four cases were 
clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>416. Following information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify four 
cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>417. Representatives of the Government of Mexico met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b>  Visit 
</b></p>
<p>418. The Working Group visited Mexico from 18 March to 1 April 2011 (see 
A/HRC/19/58/Add.2). The visit was preceded by its ninety-third session, held in Mexico 
City from 15 to 18 March 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>419. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 488 cases to the 
Government; of those, 28 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 134 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, 16 cases have been discontinued and 310 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>420. The Working Group thanks the Government for the cooperation extended before and 
during its visit to the country and for hosting its ninety-third session.  
</p>
<p>421. The Working Group again expresses concern that, during the period under review, 31 
urgent actions and two urgent appeals, concerning several people, were transmitted to the 
Government. The Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states that 
&#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, </p>


<p>which provides that &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or 
other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory 
under its jurisdiction.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>422. The Working Group would also like to recall article 7 of the Declaration, which states 
that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal political 
instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify enforced 
disappearances&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>423. The Working Group would also like to remind the Government of its obligations under 
the Declaration towards the families of the disappeared and in particular of article 13.3 
according to which States must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations 
of cases of enforced disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those 
conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal.

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>424. The Working Group transmitted seven cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>425. The first two cases concerned Messrs.<b> Abdellatif Kouibaat </b>and <b>Badr Kounine</b>, who 
were allegedly arrested in Sidi Moumem by three agents of the &#8213;Direction de la 
</p>
<p>Surveillance du Territoire&#8214; wearing civilian clothing on 27 October 2010.   
</p>
<p>426. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Azdine Braik</b>, who was allegedly arrested in a public 
place at Ain Smen Street, Fez, by four agents of the Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la Surveillance 
du Territoire in civilian clothing on 30 October 2010. 
</p>
<p>427. The fourth case concerned Mr. <b>Ahmad Daftare</b>, who was allegedly arrested in Al 
Mohammadia by people who identified themselves as security agents on 31 October 2010.  </p>


<p>428. The fifth case concerned Mr. <b>Rachid Tayane</b>, who was allegedly abducted at his 
parents&#8217; home, located in Al Mohammadia, by two persons who identified themselves as 
Security Service agents wearing civilian clothing on 31 October 2010.  
</p>
<p>429. The sixth case concerned Mr. <b>Said Azzame</b>, who was allegedly arrested in Al 
Mohammadia, by persons who identified themselves as Security Service agents on 1 
November 2010. 
</p>
<p>430. The seventh case concerned Mr. <b>Hicham El Hachimi</b>,<b> </b>who was allegedly abducted 
from his home, located in Al Mohammadia, by police agents in civilian clothing on 30 
November 2010, and then taken to an unknown destination.  
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>431. The Working Group transmitted three newly-reported cases to the Government.  
</p>
<p>432. The first case concerned Mr. <b>Mustafa Saleh Hnini</b>, who was allegedly abducted on 6 
November 1975, in Zbara (nearby Amgala), by the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces under 
the command of El Ghajdami. 
</p>
<p>433. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Omar Abdelouahed S&#233;noussi</b>,<b> </b>a political activist, 
who was allegedly abducted from his workshop in Kenitra by Government forces, at<b> </b>the 
beginning of the 70s (between 1973 and 1974). 
</p>
<p>434. The third case concerned Mr.<b> Omar El Ouassouli (or Wassouli)</b>, who was allegedly 
last seen in June 1988, at the headquarters of the Security Services, at Tetouan.  
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>435. On 31 May 2011, the Working Group, together with four other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government regarding the 
alleged use of force by the police against peaceful demonstrators, including during a 
demonstration held on 15 May 2011, to denounce the existence of a secret place of 
detention in Temara.  
</p>
<p>436. On 29 July 2011, the Government replied to this communication and reported that 
there have been more than 717 protests and only 77 have been forbidden by the competent 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>437. Concerning the allegations of ill-treatment during the demonstration in front of the 
Direction Gen&#233;rale de la Sureveillance du Territoire (DGST), the Government noted that 
this demonstration was not permitted on the basis of a notification to the organisers in 
conformity with the legislation in force (article 17 of the Code of Public Liberties and 20 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>438. The Government highlighted that, following the instructions by the judiciary and the 
Government, the alleged place of detention was visited by the Attorney General to Rabat&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Appeal Court on 18 May 2011, who affirmed not having verified the existence of any place 
that could be considered a secret place of detention or aimed at immoral or illegal practices. 
The Government further indicated that, the same day, a Parliamentary Commission of 
representatives of political parties and of the National Human Rights Council, visited this 
place and concluded that no such detention place existed. 
</p>
<p>439. Regarding the legal basis for the use of force, the Government stressed that, although it 
values the use of dialogue, the employment of security forces is aimed at maintaining order 
and public security in situations when demonstrators carry out uncivilised acts. Therefore, 
the intervention of public forces was dictated by the obligation of the application of the law, 
the preservation of public order and the protection of common property, in conformity with 
domestic laws and the ICCPR. </p>


<p>440. Finally, the Government stressed that the public forces acted with the supervision of 
the judiciary and in total respect of the law in force for the dispersion of demonstrations 
that constitute a violation of the general laws in force. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>441. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in Morocco. This information was transmitted to the Government 
of Morocco on 13 January 2011, after the Working Group ninety-second session. 
</p>
<p>442. It was reported that, in the context of the application of law 03-03 in the fight against 
terrorism, in force since 5 June 2003, there have been several cases of people arrested and 
held in secret detention for several days and, on some occasions, for a few months. 
</p>
<p>443. In this connection, the source reported that the last wave of arrests without disclosing 
the whereabouts of the detainees took place in Casablanca between 12 March and 3 May 
</p><p>2010. During this period, the source alleges that at least 11 people were abducted on the 
streets or from their homes by officials of the General Directorate of Territorial 
Surveillance and then taken to unknown places of detention. 
</p>
<p>444. Four of these cases were brought to the attention of the Government under the Working 
Group&#8217;s urgent action procedure in 2010: Mr. Otman Babi, Mr. Abderahim Lahjouli, Mr. 
Adnan Zakhbat, and Mr. Younes Zarli. The other cases concern: Mr. Sa&#239;d Ezziouani, was 
allegedly arrested on 12 April 2010, in the proximity of the Assunna Mosque, located at 2 
March Avenue, Casablanca, by Security Services agents; Mr. Abdelaziz Janahe, was 
allegedly arrested on 19 April 2010, at his home, by Security Services agents; Mr. Mahdi 
Maliani, was allegedly abducted on 19 March 2010, in the area Hay Al-Ousra, Ain-Chock 
district, Casablanca, by Security Services agents; Mr. Mohamed Boutarfas, was allegedly 
arrested on 1 May 2010, at his home, by State agents in civilian clothing and then taken to 
an unknown place; Mr. Zouhair Benkassou, was allegedly arrested on 1 May 2010, at his 
home, by State agents in civilian clothing and then taken to an unknown location; Mr. 
Ahmed Arrahmouni and Mr. Mohamed Hilal, both usually residing in Parma, Italy were 
allegedly arrested by the Italian police on 19 April 2010, and turned over to the Moroccan 
authorities the same day.  
</p>
<p>445. According to the source, these individuals were presented before a judge on 6 May 
</p><p>2010. Mr. Mohamed Bouterfas, Mr. Zouhair Benkassou and Mr. Ahmed Rahmouni were 
released following their presentation before the judge. 
</p>
<p>446. According to the Working Group&#8217;s usual practice, the Government of Italy received a 
copy of the general allegation. 
</p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>447. On 14 October 2011, the Government provided information on seven individuals 
mentioned in the general allegation stating that they were prosecuted as a result of their 
belonging to terrorist groups.  
</p>
<p>448. Regarding Messrs. Said Essiouani and Abdelaziz Janahe, the Government noted that 
they were members of a structure linked to Al-Qaida and to its affiliates and planned to 
commit terrorist attacks in the Kingdom, capped from France by Mr. Ahmed Sahnouni 
Yaacoubi, French of Moroccan origin. Messrs. Essiouani and Janahe were taken before the 
Investigative Judge at the Appeal Court of Sal&#233; on 6 May 2010, concerning an illegal </p>


<p>association created to commit terrorist attacks and attempt of voluntary homicide, who 
ordered their detention at the Civil Prison of Sale.  
</p>
<p>449. Regarding Mr. Mahdi Maliani, the Government reported that he was arrested in the 
context of the dismantling of a terrorist structure in April 2010, and that he was detained at 
the Civil Prison of Sal&#233;.  
</p>
<p>450. Concerning Messrs. Mohamed Boutarfas and Zouhair Benkassou, the Government 
stated that they were arrested in the context of the dismantling of a terrorist structure in 
April 2010 and that they were prosecuted in liberty.  
</p>
<p>451. In relation to Mr. Ahmed Arrahmouni, it noted that he was repatriated to Morocco on 
29 April 2010, because of his contacts with international networks of radical Islamist 
movements. It further noted that Mr. Arrahmouni was acquitted after examination of the 
situation by the BNPJ of Casablanca.  
</p>
<p>452. Finally, regarding Mr. Mohamed Hilal, the Government noted that he was a student in 
Italy, who was extradited to Morocco on 29 April 2010, for reasons related to the Security 
of the State and the public order. It further noted that Mr. Hila was acquitted after the 
consideration of the situation by the police authorities. 
</p>
<p>453. The Government also noted that Messrs. Said Essiouani, Abdelaziz Janahe and 
Mohamed Hilal were arrested by the national brigade of the judicial police (Brigade 
Nationale de la Police Judiciaire) with strict respect of the law and the legal procedures in 
force and under the effective control of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>454. On 29 May 2008, the Government transmitted a communication which could not be 
translated in time for inclusion in previous reports. It concerned 12 outstanding cases. 
Based on this information, the Working Group decided, at its ninety-fifth session, to apply 
the six-month rule to two of those cases.  In the meantime, one of the remaining cases had 
already been clarified by information provided by the Government. Concerning the 
remaining nine cases, the Working Group decided to continue their consideration during its 
forthcoming sessions. In this communication, the Government also requested additional 
information on 22 cases, 21 of which had been discontinued in 2009 (A/HRC/13/31, para. 
368) and the remaining one was clarified in 2010 on the basis of the information provided 
by the Government (A/HRC/16/48). 
</p>
<p>455. On 2 October 2009, the Government transmitted a communication concerning 15 
outstanding cases. Information concerning five of those cases could not be translated in 
time for inclusion in previous reports (A/HRC/16/48, para. 324). At its ninety-fifth session 
the Working Group decided to continue consideration of these five cases during its 
forthcoming sessions. 
</p>
<p>456. During the reporting period, the Government of Morocco transmitted eleven 
communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>457. In the first communication, dated 21 December 2010, the Government submitted 
information concerning one case which had been previously clarified by the source. 
</p>
<p>458. In the second communication, dated 10 February 2011, the Government provided 
information on three cases. In the sixth communication, dated 10 June 2011, the 
Government transmitted a rectified response with regard to these cases. Based on this 
information, the Working Group decided at its ninety-fifth session to apply the six-month 
rule to these three cases. </p>


<p>459. In the third communication, dated 16 February 2011, the Government provided 
information pertaining to the recommendations made by the Working Group following its 
visit to the country in 2009. 
</p>
<p>460. In the fourth communication, dated 26 April 2011, the Government transmitted 
information concerning four outstanding cases. In the ninth communication, dated 12 
October 2011, the Government rectified some of the information provided in its 
communication dated 26 April 2011. Based on the information provided, the Working 
Group decided at the ninety-fifth session to apply the six-month rule to these cases. 
</p>
<p>461. In the fifth communication, dated 9 June 2011, the Government provided information 
on two outstanding cases. At its ninety-fifth session, the Working Group decided to 
consider them at later. 
</p>
<p>462. The seventh communication was received by the Working Group from representatives 
of the Government during a meeting held on 8 July 2011. This communication was a report 
on the progress of the cooperation between the Moroccan authorities and the Working 
Group, and on the implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group. 
The Government also provided information on the new Moroccan Constitution, the reform 
of the National Council on Human Rights and the establishment of the inter-ministerial 
delegation on human rights. In addition, the Government made reference to the problems 
encountered with the treatment of some outstanding cases. Moreover, it reported on 45 
outstanding cases. On one case, the Government requested the Working Group to outline 
the reasons for its retransmission if it had been clarified by the Working Group in 1995. In 
addition, the Government requested additional information on six cases and provided 
information on the remaining 38 cases. The Working Group decided, at its ninety-fifth 
session, to apply the six-month rule to seven of these 38 cases based on the information 
provided on 26 April and 10 June 2011. The information provided was not considered 
sufficient to lead to the clarification of 14 of these 38 cases. As indicated above, the 
Working Group decided to continue the consideration of the remaining 17 cases during its 
forthcoming sessions. 
</p>
<p>463. In the eighth communication, dated 29 July 2011, the Government replied to a prompt 
intervention letter transmitted on 31 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>464. In the tenth communication, dated 14 October 2011, the Government reported on the 
45 outstanding cases it had also addressed in its communication dated 8 July 2011. In this 
connection, with regard to one case, the Government rectified information it had previously 
provided. Furthermore, the Government requested additional information on six cases and 
provided information on the remaining 38 cases. The Working Group decided, at its ninety-
fifth session, to apply the six-month rule to seven of these 38 cases based on the 
information provided on 26 April and 10 June 2011. The information provided was not 
considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of 14 of these 38 cases. As indicated above, 
the Working Group decided to continue the consideration of the remaining 17 cases during 
its forthcoming sessions. In addition, the Government provided information on seven of the 
persons mentioned in the general allegation transmitted on 13 January 2011. 
</p>
<p>465. In the eleventh communication dated 26 October 2011, the Government provided the 
original documents supporting the information provided on 14 October 2011.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>466. Sources provided information on 15 outstanding cases. As a result, one case was 
clarified by the Working Group. In addition, concerning another case, sources confirmed 
the information provided by the Government leading to its clarification. </p>


<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>467. Following the information provided by the sources, the Working Group decided to 
clarify one case. 
</p>
<p>468. On the basis of the information provided by the Government, the Working Group 
decided to clarify three cases; one of these, following the confirmation by the source, and 
the remaining two, following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>469. Representatives of the Government of Morocco met with the Working Group at its 
ninety-fourth session.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

Government; of those, 53 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 150 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, 21 cases have been discontinued and 61 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>471. The Working Group is concerned by the fact that it transmitted seven urgent actions 
and a prompt intervention letter during the reporting period. The Working Group would 
like to recall that, in its resolution 7/12, the Human Rights Council urged Governments to 
take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced disappearances and the 
lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any intimidation or ill-treatment to 
which they might be subjected.       
</p>
<p>472. The Working Group welcomes the continuous efforts made by the Government to 
clarify outstanding cases. In addition, the Working Group thanks the Government for its 
report on the implementation of the recommendations made after its visit to the country in 
2009, and hopes to continue with the cooperation to address all the recommendations. The 
Working Group looks forward to work on a follow-up report.

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>479. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group dated 20 June 
</p><p>2011. In this communication, it replied to the annual reminder concerning outstanding cases 
transmitted by the Working Group on 20 April 2011. The Government reported that under 
article 33 (s) of the Interim Constitution of Nepal of 2007, the responsibility of the State 
includes the constitution of a High-Level Truth and Reconciliation Commission to 
investigate the facts and about those persons involved in serious violations of human rights 
and crimes against humanity committed during the course of the conflict. Similarly, article 
33 (q) stipulates the provision of relief of the families of the victims on the basis of the 
report of the Investigation Commission constituted to investigate the cases of persons who 
were subjected to enforced disappearance during the conflict. Likewise, clause 5.2.5 of the 
Comprehensive Peace Accord concluded between the then Government and the Nepal 
Communist Party on 21 November 2006, states that both parts agree to constitute a High-
Level Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the truth about those who have 
seriously violated human rights and those who were involved in crimes against humanity in 
the course of the armed conflict and to create an environment of reconciliation in the 
society. The Government informed the Working Group that it has presented two bills in the 
Legislature Parliament for the formation of the said commissions which are the final stage 
of approval following discussions at the Legislative Committee of the Parliament. The two 
Commissions to be formed after the approval of these bills by the Parliament shall 
investigate into the 458 cases referred to by the Working Group and bring the truth to the 
surface about them.  
</p>
<p>480. The Government highlighted that the proposed commissions would facilitate the 
management of the conflict smoothly through, among other things, investigating actual 
facts on the grave violations of human rights during the armed conflict, finding the truth 
about those who disappeared or made disappeared, identifying perpetrators, collecting facts 
and evidences, making recommendations as to the actions to be taken against the guilty, 
and recommending relief to the family of those who are disappeared or made disappeared. 
The Government further indicated that it remains fully committed to implement the 
directions of the Supreme Court to make a separate law on disappeared persons and form a 
commission on disappeared persons to investigate into the matter. In this context, the 
Government indicated that the commissions would have a prominent role in the 
investigation and evaluation of the said 458 cases. 
</p>
<p>481. The Government informed the Working Group that the National Human Rights 
Commission has carried out the exhumations of the remains of five persons whose cases are 
outstanding with the Working Group and that their DNA tests are under way. 
</p>
<p>482. The Government also indicated that the 458 reported cases appear to have occurred 
during the ten year long conflict, which is a special kind of situation. In order to address 
such a situation, the Government indicated that the truth and reconciliation commission and 
the disappearance commission are in the process of being formed. Hence, the Government 
reassured that the necessary steps would be taken following the proposed bills take legal 
form. 
</p>
<p>483. Finally, the Government reiterated that it is committed to investigating into the grave 
violations of human rights during the armed conflict, find the truth about the disappeared or 
forcefully disappeared persons, and respect, protect and promote the rights guaranteed by 
national and international instruments with reference to the disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>484. On 12 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a follow-up mission to 
Nepal. A reminder letter was transmitted on 20 July 2009. On 2 October 2009, the </p>


<p>Government informed the Working Group that, due to the limited capacities of the country 
and other engagements, it was unable to extend an invitation to visit the country. A new 
reminder letter was transmitted on 30 June 2011. No reply has been received so far. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>485. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 672 cases to the 
Government; of those, 79 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 135 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 458 remain outstanding. 
</p>

<p><b>  Urgent Actions 
</b></p>
<p>489. The Working Group transmitted two cases to the Government under its urgent action 
procedure. The first concerned Mr. <b>Muzaffar Bhutto</b>, who was allegedly abducted by State 
intelligence agents in civilian clothes escorted by police forces in Hyderabad City, Sindh 
province, on 25 February 2011. The second concerned Mr. <b>Al Sharkawy Abdullah 
Mohammed Abdelrahim</b>, a university student who was last seen in the Hostel of the AIR 
University, located at F/8 Markaz, Islamabad, before allegedly being abducted by Pakistani 
Security Forces on 25 May 2011. The Government acknowledged receipt of these two 
cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>490. The Working Group transmitted three newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
first case concerned Mr. <b>Mir Sohrab Khan</b> <b>Marri</b>, who was allegedly abducted by 
Pakistani State Agents from the Hotel Syed Mohammad Agha, located in Quetta, Province 
of Balochistan, on 8 November 2009. The second case concerned Mr. <b>Ali Asghar</b> <b>Ali 
Asghar Bangulzai</b>, who was allegedly arrested in front of the Government Boys Degree 
College, located in Quetta, Province of Balochistan, by Pakistani Intelligence agents in 
plain clothes on 18 October 2001. The third case concerned Mr. <b>Khan Mohammad</b> <b>Marri</b>, 
who was allegedly abducted by plain-clothed Inter-Services Intelligence Agency officials 
and local police in Metroville West N&#176;. 1 on 7 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>  
 13 One of the urgent actions had been transmitted as a case in the past and it remained outstanding. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the Working Group decided, at its 94th session, to merge the two cases as they both 
referred to the same person.  </p>


<p><b>  Urgent Appeals  
</b></p>
<p>491. The Working Group transmitted two communications under its urgent appeals 
procedure to the Government. The first communication was sent on 30 December 2010, 
together with two other Special Procedures mechanisms, and concerned Messrs. <b>Siddique 
Eido </b>and <b>Yousaf Baloch</b>, who were allegedly abducted in Pasni by men in civilian clothes 
and others wearing the uniform of the Federal Paramilitary Force of Pakistan Frontier 
Constabulary on 21 December 2010. The second was sent on 5 May 2011, together with 
three other Special Procedures mechanisms, and concerned Messrs. <b>Riaz Kakepoto</b>, <b>Shah 
Nawaz Bhutto</b>, <b>Ali Nawab Mehar</b>, and <b>Jam Bhutto</b>, members of Jeay Sindh Mutehda 
Mahaz, a Sindhi speaking nationalist group based in Pakistan, who were allegedly arrested 
and taken to an unknown destination by Pakistani security forces in plain clothes on 11 
April 2011. The Government acknowledged receipt of these two communications. 
</p>
<p><b>  General Allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>492. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Pakistan. This information was transmitted to the Government on 9 
September 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>493. The source informed that many activists, teachers, journalists, and lawyers disappeared 
in Balochistan, Pakistan. The disappearances were attributed to the security forces of the 
Government of Pakistan, in particular to the frontier corps and intelligence agencies. It was 
alleged that these security forces were often accompanied by men in plain clothes. It was 
alleged that, since October 2010, every month saw an increase in the number of cases of 
alleged disappearances and that these acts were carried out with impunity.  
</p>
<p>494. The sources also indicated that these human rights abuses created a climate of fear for 
the families of the disappeared and that they were inhibited to speak out in fear that security 
agents would kill their loved ones or abduct other family members in reprisal. It was 
alleged that the Government of Pakistan was failing to meet its obligation under 
international law, as reflected in the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, to take effective measures to prevent and end acts of enforced 
disappearance, to ensure that those responsible for those violations were brought to justice 
and that surviving victims and families were provided with reparations in accordance with 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>495. It was alleged that the Judicial Commission, created by the Government of Pakistan in 
March 2010 to investigate cases of enforced disappearances across Pakistan, including 
Balochistan, had a narrow mandate and was failing to record statements of released 
individuals to gain information about the circumstances of their disappearances and to use 
this information to bring perpetrators to justice. The Commission was also criticised for its 
failure to investigate the role of the intelligence agencies, the main organs accused of 
involvement in acts of enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>496. It was reported that the Commission had been able to trace 134 missing persons, of 
whom 23 detainees had so far been released. However, the list of traced and released 
persons was not publicly available and the names of the missing persons on the list were 
not known in Balochistan. In addition, the list of traced individuals did not contain the 
names of those who disappeared during the Musharraf era, or at least governmental 
agencies had not admitted that those individuals were in custody. </p>


<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>497. On 4 November 2011, the Government replied to the general allegation. It stated that 
the allegations made were baseless, general in nature and unsubstantiated and reiterated the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect human rights of all citizens, including 
</p>
<p>those who have reportedly disappeared.  
</p>
<p>498. The Government noted that a Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, 
which registers all cases received from any quarter alleging enforced disappearance, was 
constituted in May 2010 and another one in March 2011 as the tenure of the first 
commission expired in December 2010. It further noted that cases of disappearance could 
be registered, through four different fora: the Human Rights Cell of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan; the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances; the National Crisis 
Management Cell of the Ministry of Interior; and the Special Desk at Home and Tribal 
Affairs Department. In addition, the Government noted that it is considering paying some 
financial assistance to families of the missing persons, purely on humanitarian grounds.  
</p>
<p>499. The Government also noted that there are no political prisoners in Pakistan of any 
political party, including those based in Balochistan and Sindh. 
</p>
<p>500. The Government further reiterated that its law enforcement and intelligence agencies 
were fully cognizant of the human rights issue of enforced disappearances and recalled that 
efforts were being undertaken at the highest level to address the problem. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>501. The Government transmitted six communications to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>502. In the first communication, dated 31 December 2010, the Government replied to the 
urgent appeal transmitted on 9 November 2010, concerning Mr. Imran Jokhio, aged 17, 
who was allegedly abducted by police officials on 20 May 2010, when riding his three-
wheeler auto rickshaw on the Mafi Faqir bridge at the Rohri canal (see report 
A/HRC/16/48, para. 382). The Government reported that the kidnapping of Mr. Jokhio was 
registered on 4 June 2010, at the Phull Police Station and that, after the registration of a 
First Information Report, two police constables were arrested and the case handed to the 
Investigation Branch for further investigation. It also stated that a team was constituted for 
the recovery of Mr. Jokhio and the arrest of the remaining accused. Thereafter, the relatives 
of Mr. Jokhio filed a petition with the Honourable Court of Sindh Bench at Sukkur which is 
under judicial trial. The Honourable Court has ordered the Superintendent of Police 
Investigation to constitute a team for the interrogation of the arrested police constables and 
for the recovery of Mr. Jokhio. 
</p>
<p>503. In the second communication, dated 8 February 2011, the Government provided 
information on eight outstanding cases. Based on this information, the Working Group 
decided, at its ninety-third session, to apply the six-month rule to these cases. 
</p>
<p>504. In the third communication, dated 10 June 2011, the Government provided information 
on 16 outstanding cases. Based on this information, the Working Group decided, at its 
ninety-fourth session, to apply the six-month rule to 13 cases. With regard to the remaining 
three cases, the six-month rule had been applied earlier to one of them and the other two 
were clarified following the source&#8217;s confirmation of the information provided by the 
Government.   
</p>
<p>505. In the fourth communication, dated 2 August 2011, the Government provided 
information on one outstanding case. Based on this information, the Working Group 
decided, at its ninety-fifth session, to apply the six-month rule to the case. </p>


<p>506. In the fifth communication, dated 4 August 2011, the Government provided 
information on one outstanding case, which was considered insufficient to lead to its 
clarification. 
</p>
<p>507. In the sixth communication, dated 4 November 2011, the Government replied to the 
general allegation sent on 9 September 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>508. Sources provided information on four outstanding cases. For two cases, the sources 
validated the information provided by the Government leading to their clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>509. Following the information provided by the Government, which was confirmed by the 
source, the Working Group decided to clarify two cases. 
</p>
<p>510. Following the expiration of the period provided by the six-month rule, the Working 
Group decided to clarify eight cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>511. On 29 September 2010, the Working Group requested the Government to extend an 
invitation to undertake a mission to the country. On 3 October 2010, the Government 
acknowledged receipt of the request. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>512. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 143 cases to the 
Government; of those, seven cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the source, 28 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, one has been deleted, and 107 remain outstanding.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>513. The Working Group is concerned by the fact that, during the reporting period, it 
transmitted two cases under its urgent action procedure and two urgent appeals.  The 
Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states that &#8213;No State shall 
practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 3, which provides 
</p>
<p>that &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to 
prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction.&#8214;

<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>523. On 2 November 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to visit the country. 
The Working Group reiterated its interest to undertake the visit to the Russian Federation 
on 4 June 2008, 20 July 2009, 16 August 2010 and 18 August 2011. On 4 August 2009, the 
Government informed the Working Group that, due to limited capacities of the country and 
other engagements, it was unable to extend an invitation to visit the country. On 30 August 
2011, the Government replied that it did not have any substantial objections but, due to the 
heavy schedule of visits by international and regional human rights mechanisms already 
planned, it suggested to revisit the question in mid-2012.

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>533. The Working Group transmitted one newly-reported case to the Government. It 
concerned Mr. <b>Miguel Garc&#237;a Mu&#241;oz</b>, who allegedly disappeared while traveling to 
Valencia on 20 December 1949.  The source alleged that State agents were responsible for 
the disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>534. The Government transmitted three communications dated 15 November 2010, 16 
February 2011, and 15 June 2011. 
</p>
<p>535. In the first communication, the Government submitted information and documentation 
concerning three outstanding cases, one of which was under the six-month rule. Based on 
the information provided by the Government, the Working Group decided, at its ninety-
fourth session, to apply the six-month rule also to the second case. The information 
provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of the remaining case. 
</p>
<p>536. In the second communication, the Government submitted information and 
documentation concerning four outstanding cases, two of which were under the six-month </p>


<p>rule. The information provided was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of 
the remaining cases. In addition, the Government submitted information in relation to the 
general activities carried out by the Government of Spain with regard to the victims of the 
civil war and the dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>537. In the third communication, the Government submitted information concerning four 
outstanding cases, one of which was under the six-month rule. The information provided 
was not considered sufficient to lead to the clarification of the remaining cases. In addition, 
the Government requested additional information about the newly-reported case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>538. Sources provided information concerning one outstanding case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>539. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the Working 
Group decided, at its ninety-fourth session, to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>540. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted five cases to the

<p><b>  Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p>541. The Working Group transmitted 59 newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
majority of these cases concerned persons who allegedly disappeared in 2009, in 
Mullaitivu.16   
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>542. On 23 August 2011, the Working Group, together with three other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, sent a prompt intervention letter to the Government regarding alleged threats 
against individuals, including relatives, related to the case of Mr. <b>Pattani Razeek</b>, a human 
rights defender who was reportedly disappeared and killed. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation 
</i></p>
<p>543. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance in Sri Lanka during the last phase of the war against the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam from 2006 until 2009. This information was transmitted to the Government on 
4 May 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. 
</p>
<p>544. The source informed the Working Group about serious allegations of human rights 
violations in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, in particular the Mannar district. 
Allegations were that enforced or involuntary disappearances, as well as other serious 
human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, rapes 
and other forms of sexual violence, discrimination based on religion or belief and ethnic 
origin, as well as serious limitations to the exercise of other civil and political and 
economic, social and cultural rights, occurred.  
</p>
<p>545. According to sources, more than 500 persons disappeared in the Jaffna district between 
January and August 2007. Similarly, information was received that approximately 100 
people disappeared in the Mannar district between 2008 and 2009.  
</p>
<p>546. Allegations were made about the absence of impartial investigations, prosecution, trial 
and sentence of alleged perpetrators of human rights violations. According to the sources, 
existing mechanisms such as police and existing human rights commissions, among others, 
have proved unable to assist the families of the victims of enforced or involuntary 
disappearances in their search for their beloved ones. It was alleged that families did not 
have access to relevant information and that there was no centralised list of detainees in 
each detention centre to which relatives could refer.  
</p>
<p>547. Sources also reported that there was a lack of substantial progress on the several 
reconciliation initiatives that were set, which have allegedly failed to provide the victims 
with answers on the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared and to provide accountability 
of alleged perpetrators of human rights violations; among other obligations incumbent upon 
States where enforced or involuntary disappearances have occurred. In this connection, it 
was alleged that few had been prosecuted, subjected to trial and sentenced, despite the 
almost three years that have elapsed between the end of the war against the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  
</p>
<p>  
 16 See annex V for the list of names of the newly-reported cases of disappeared persons.  </p>


<p>548. Sources alleged that there was a lack of transparency in the practice of various 
commissions of inquiry, the lack of public character of their reports and the denial of their 
access to the victims, families and civil society. 
</p>
<p>549. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>550. On 7 July and 2 September 2009, the Government submitted two communications in 
which it provided two lists with a total of 459 possible duplicate cases. During its eighty-
ninth session, the Working Group reviewed 171 cases and concluded that they were 
duplicates and therefore they were deleted from its records. During its ninety-fifth session, 
the Working Group continued reviewing these cases and concluded that 41 were also 
duplicates and decided to also delete them from its records. For the remaining cases, the 
Working Group continues to check the original submissions. 
</p>
<p>551. No communications concerning outstanding cases were received during the reporting 
period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>552. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested the Government of Sri Lanka to 
extend an invitation to undertake a mission to the country. The Government replied that it 
would not be possible to schedule a visit during the proposed dates, and that the interest of 
the Working Group would be given due consideration. Reminder letters were sent on 20 
July 2009, 16 August 2010 and 20 July 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>553. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 12,460 cases to the 
Government; of those, 40 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 6,535 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, 214 cases were found to be duplications and were therefore deleted, and 5,671 
remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>554. The Working Group has been able to deal with most of the backlog concerning Sri 
Lanka; however, a considerable number of cases have been received during the reporting 
period but have not yet been dealt with because of a lack of resources. The Working Group 
hopes to deal with these cases as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>555. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration 
towards the families of the disappeared.  
</p>
<p>556. The Working Group regrets that no response has been received to the general 
allegation transmitted on 4 May 2011. </p>

who was allegedly arrested by NISS agents in Khartoum, on 3 November 2010. At the time 
of the communication, the fate and whereabouts of these nine persons were unknown. 
</p>
<p>559. The second one was transmitted on 28 March 2011, jointly with four others special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning the alleged detention in an unknown location of Mr.<b> 
</b>Suleiman Wida&#8223;a, Ms.<b> Fatima Bashir</b> and Ms.<b> Fathia Ting </b>as well as Mr.<b> Jaafar 
Alsabki Ibrahim</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>560. On 18 May 2010, the Government transmitted a communication concerning two 
outstanding cases which could not be translated in time for inclusion in the 2010 annual 
report (A/HRC/16/48). The information provided was considered insufficient to lead to 
their clarification. 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Following the independence of South Soudan on 9 July 2011, and its admission as a United Nations 
</p>
<p>Member State on 14 July 2011, the Working Group has started reviewing the cases recorded under 
Sudan to determine whether these should be transferred to the records of South Soudan in accordance 
to the Working Group&#8217;s working methods. </p>


<p>561. During the reporting period, the Government transmitted one communication to the 
Working Group dated 16 August 2011, in which it provided its comments on United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights thirteenth periodic report on the situation of 
human rights in the Sudan, titled &#8213;Preliminary report on violations of international human 
rights and humanitarian law in Southern Kordofan from 5 to 30 June 2011&#8214;. The 
Government indicated that the comments provided constituted as well a response to the 
content of the press statement issued on 22 July 2011 (see par. 564). Concerning enforced 
disappearances, the Government indicated that the Sudanese Armed Forces cannot be 
responsible for the disappearances of any person during the incidents and that they never 
targeted Christians or their churches. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>562. Sources provided information on one outstanding case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Press release 
</b></p>
<p>563. On 22 July 2011, the Working Group, jointly with two other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, issued a press release expressing alarm over reports of atrocities in Southern 
Kordofan region of <b>Sudan</b>, including killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and enforced 
disappearances perpetrated against Nubans and other dark-skinned people.18  
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>564. A request for a visit was sent to the Government of the Sudan on 20 December 2005. 
On 3 April 2008, 20 July 2009, 16 August 2010 and 18 August 2011, the Working Group 
reiterated its interest to undertake the mission. However, no reply has yet been received. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>565. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 383 cases to the 
Government; of those, four cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the source, 205 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 174 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>566. The Working Group is concerned by the fact that, during the reporting period, it 
transmitted two urgent appeals, one concerning nine individuals and the other concerning 
three individuals.  The Working Group recalls article 2.1 of the Declaration which states 
that &#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances&#8214;, as well as article 
</p>
<p>3, which provides that &#8213;Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or 
other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory 
under its jurisdiction.&#8214;

<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>590. The Working Group transmitted seven urgent appeals to the Government concerning 
the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic in relation to demonstrations that took place 
across the country since March 2011. </p>


<p>591. The first one was transmitted on 30 March 2011, jointly with five other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning a number of protesters, some of whom were under the 
age of 18 years old, who were allegedly arrested in the cities and towns of Aleppo, Banias, 
Dera&#8217;a, Douma, Hama, Homs, Latakia, Ma&#8217;aran Nu&#8217;man and Al-Malkyiah between 8 and 
23 March 2011, and whose fates and whereabouts remained unknown. 
</p>
<p>592. On 6 July 2011, the Government replied to this urgent appeal. The Government 
emphasized that, since the beginning of the events in March 2011, the competent Syrian 
authorities have dealt with peaceful demonstrations by those whose demands and goals are 
reform and combating corruption in a civilized manner reflecting the nature and substance 
of the relationship between society and state, and have safeguarded those demonstrations 
until such time as they ended and all the participants had returned to their homes. However 
the Government also stressed that armed terrorist gangs are appearing on the ground, 
attacking, terrorizing and killing peaceful demonstrators in order to discredit the public 
authorities of Syria by portraying them as undertaking bloody operations to suppress the 
demonstrators. The Government also reported that all those who were detained for 
perpetrating unlawful acts have been transferred to the judicial authorities in accordance 
with the provisions of the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedure and in complete conformity 
with the legislation promulgated in terms of lifting the state of emergency, so that there is 
no longer any scope in Syria for unofficial detention: suspects are referred to the competent 
public prosecutor within 24 hours and come under the protection and guardianship of the 
Syrian judiciary. In most of the cases referred to the courts, the suspects have been released 
immediately. As for those who have committed acts of sabotage, arson or murder, the 
competent judicial authorities have prosecuted them in accordance with the provisions of 
the law, and those who are proven innocent are declared not guilty by judicial judgment, 
while those whom the courts find have committed such acts are punished in accordance 
with the provisions of the Syrian Criminal Code. In addition, the Government submitted the 
principles the measures the Syrian Government has taken and the legislation it has 
promulgated recently in the framework of promoting and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>593. The second one was transmitted on 26 May 2011, jointly with four other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>Wael Al-Hamada</b>, who was allegedly 
arrested at his workplace in Damascus on 11 May 2011; <b>Abdel Rahman Al-Hamada</b>, who

<b>Mohammed Hasan al-Labwani</b>, who was allegedly arrested at his home on 2 May 2011, 
in al-Zabadani, near Damascus; <b>Hassan Abd al-Adhim</b>, who was allegedly arrested at his 
office in Damascus by State Security agents on 28 April 2011; <b>Omar Qashaash</b>, who was 
allegedly arrested in Aleppo on 30 April 2011; and <b>Yasser Al-Khayyat</b>, who was allegedly 
taken to a security detention centre on 11 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>594. The third one was transmitted on 17 June 2011, jointly with six other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>George Sabra</b>,<b> Ahmed Maetouk</b>, 
<b>Abdulrahman Al-Hamada </b>and<b> Fayez Sarah</b>, who were allegedly arrested by security 
forces between 9 April and 2 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>595. The fourth one was transmitted on 3 August 2011, jointly with three other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>Bashar, Mohamed </b>and<b> Ghassan Al Sahyoni</b>, 
who were allegedly arrested at their home in Mafrak Al Kal&#8217;a, Banias, and then taken to an 
unknown destination by uniformed agents belonging to the Military Intelligence Service, on 
12 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>596. The fifth one was transmitted on 10 August 2011, jointly with five other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning Mr.<b> Al Tahhan</b>, who was allegedly arrested at his 
home, located in Aleppo, by two agents of the Aleppo Air Intelligence Branch in civilian 
clothing, on 19 July 2011.  </p>


<p>597. The sixth one was transmitted on 16 August 2011, jointly with one other special 
procedures mechanism, concerning Mr. <b>Abdel Karim Rihaoui,</b> who was allegedly arrested 
on 11 August 2011, by Air Intelligence officials at the Havana Cafe, located in Damascus, 
where he was meeting with a journalist. 
</p>
<p>598. On 24 August 2011, sources reported that Mr. Rihaoui had been released. 
</p>
<p>599. The seventh one was transmitted on 30 August 2011, jointly with five other special 
procedures mechanisms, concerning Messrs. <b>Walid Al-Bunni</b> and his two sons, <b>Mu'ayad 
Al Bunni </b>and<b> Iyad Al Bunni</b>, who were allegedly arrested by members of the Intelligence 
Agency at their home in Al Tal, Damascus, on 8 August 2011. It was reported that Iyad was 
released the same day. However, the fate and whereabouts of Mr.<b> Al Bunni </b>and his son<b> 
Mu'ayad</b> remained unknown at the time of the urgent appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>  General Allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegations 
</i></p>
<p>600. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. This information was transmitted to the Government through two general 
allegations, on 9 September 2011, after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>601. On the first general allegation, sources reported that there have been systematic human 
rights violations committed by the Syrian authorities against its population, including 
enforced disappearances. It was alleged that possibly thousands of people have disappeared. 
It was further alleged that those arrested were being detained by the security services, rather 
than by the judicial police who normally have the jurisdiction to do so. It was reported that 
these arrests were taking place without arrest warrants, and those detained were subjected 
to a period of enforced disappearance as their families were not able to obtain information 
regarding the place of detention or fate. It was also alleged that many of those subject to 
being disappeared are subject to ill-treatment and were often tortured. 
</p>
<p>602. On the second general allegation, sources reported that a mass grave containing the 
remains of at least 13 bodies including women and children (possibly including members of 
the Abazied and al-Mahmaed families), was discovered on 16 May 2011 near Daraa in an 
area called Talit Mohammed Assarie. It was alleged that these families lived together in a 
house that was targeted by the army during the attack on Daraa at the beginning of May and 
that many civilians were killed by the military when the military attacked the city's old 
quarter. It was further alleged that the authorities cordoned off the area after the bodies 
were discovered and that the authorities have prevented those who discovered the bodies 
from identifying them. It was also alleged that during the siege of Daraa security personnel 
prevented residents from leaving their homes and from removing dead bodies from the 
streets. It was alleged that the bodies on the streets disappeared. Finally, sources urged that 
the Syrian authorities stop further killings of civilians; uncover mass graves and respect the 
right of families to know the fate of their relatives. 
</p>
<p>603. No response was received from the Government during the reporting period regarding 
these two general allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>604. The Government transmitted four communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>605. In the first and third communications, dated 1 December 2010 and 31 May 2011, the 
Government provided information on one outstanding case. Based on the information </p>


<p>provided on 31 May 2011, the Working Group decided, at its ninety-fourth session, to 
apply the six-month rule to that case. 
</p>
<p>606. In the second communication, dated 9 March 2011, the Government provided 
information concerning 16 outstanding cases. Based on this information, the Working 
Group decided to apply, at its ninety-third session, the 6-month rule to one case. However, 
this information was contested by the source of the case and therefore the Working Group 
decided, at its ninety-fourth session, to suspend the application of the 6-month rule. 
Concerning the remaining cases, the Government stressed that the relevant sources had not 
provided information for many years and therefore requested the Working Group to apply 
its working methods.  
</p>
<p>607. In the fourth communication, dated 6 July 2011, the Government replied to the urgent 
appeal dated 30 March 2011.  
</p>
<p>608. On 30 March 2010, the Government of Lebanon provided information on a case 
registered under the Syrian Arab Republic which had already been clarified by the source.  
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>609. Information was received from sources concerning three outstanding cases. On the 
basis of the information provided by one of the sources, the Working Group decided, at its 
ninety-fourth session, to suspend the application of the six-month rule to one case and to 
clarify another case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>610. Following the information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 
one case. 
</p>
<p>611. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the Working 
Group decided to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>612. On 19 September 2011, the Working Group requested the Government to extend an 
invitation to visit the country. No reply has been received during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press Release 
</b></p>
<p>613. On 5 August 2011, the Working Group and six other special procedures mandate 
holders issued a press release warning that the scale and gravity of the violent crackdown in 
the Syrian Arab Republic continued unabated, and reiterated their call for an immediate end 
to the violent strategies adopted by the Government to quash the on-going demonstrations.19 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>614. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 82 cases to the 
Government; of those, 27 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 14 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 41 remain outstanding. 
</p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>615. The Working Group is gravely concerned about the number of allegations of enforced 
disappearances received during the reporting period, as reflected in 11 urgent actions, seven 
urgent appeals and two general allegations, one of which makes reference to reports that 
thousands of individuals may have disappeared.  
</p>
<p>616. The Working Group would like to recall article 2 of the Declaration, which states that 
&#8213;No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced&#8214;; article 3, which states that &#8213;Each 
</p>
<p>State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent 
and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8214;; and 
article 7, which states that &#8213;No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state 
of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to 
justify enforced disappearances&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>617. In light of the above, the Working Group would like to stress its interest in undertaking 
a visit to the country.

<p><b>  Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>626. The Working Group sent two cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government. They concerned Messrs. <b>Ibroheng Karhong </b>and<b> Dulhami Marae</b>, who 
allegedly disappeared in Bannangsta District, Yala Province, on 30 April 2011.  According 
to the source, they were reportedly last seen entering the Border Patrol Police camp at Ban 
Santi 1. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt interventions 
</b></p>
<p>627. On 16 February 2011, the Working Group jointly with another special procedure 
mechanism, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning the </p>


<p>alleged threats received by Ms. <b>Angkhana Neelaphaijit</b>, President of the Justice and Peace 
Commission and wife of Mr. Somchai Neelaphaijit, a human rights lawyer who 
disappeared in 2004. According to the source, the threats coincide with the on-going legal 
procedures concerning the case of Mr. Neelaphaijit. 
</p>
<p>628. On 5 July 2011, the Government replied to the prompt intervention letter. It reported 
that it had always provided Ms. Neelaphaijit with protection in response to her safety 
concerns. It further reported that the concerns related to her safety, which were raised 
earlier by relevant special procedures mechanisms, were promptly and duly investigated, as 
previously informed. The Government stated that, although the threats may coincide with 
on-going legal proceedings involving Ms. Neelaphaijit&#8217;s husband and with her role as a 
human rights defender, it would be presumptuous to draw any conclusion at this stage, 
especially before the authorities concerned have completed all relevant investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>629. The Government transmitted three communications to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>630. In the first communication, dated 10 February 2011, the Government provided 
information on six outstanding cases and requested clarifications from the Working Group 
with regard to the 2010 Annual Report. Concerning one outstanding case, the Government 
brought to the Working Group&#8217;s attention that, notwithstanding that in its 2009 Annual 
</p>
<p>Report (A/HRC/13/31, par. 552) it had been indicated that the six-month rule had been 
applied to this case, the said case had not yet been clarified. The Working Group replied 
that, due to a technical error, the letter informing the source about the implementation of the 
six-month rule had not been sent. Therefore the six-month rule started to apply after the 
Working Group&#8217;s ninety-third session. In addition, based on the information provided, the 
Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule to two other cases. Regarding the 
remaining three cases, the information provided was considered insufficient to lead to their 
clarification. 
</p>
<p>631. In the second communication, dated 5 July 2011, the Government replied to the prompt 
intervention letter sent on 16 February 2011.  
</p>
<p>632. In the third communication, dated 17 October 2011, the Government requested 
clarifications concerning the suspension of the six-month rule with regard to a case. In 
addition, it provided information to the Working Group concerning the remedies provided 
to 28 persons who appear on the records of the Working Group, and noted that the 
Government has taken all cases of alleged disappearances very seriously, especially in 
addressing the plights of the families whose members had allegedly disappeared, thereby 
providing them with appropriate remedies. Furthermore, the Government requested the 
assistance of the Working Group in obtaining more specific information on the outstanding 
cases. It also asked the Working Group whether the six-month rule could be applied to 
seven cases for which the Thai Court had ruled to be disappearances. Finally, it replied to 
the request for a visit, as well as informed the Working Group that the Cabinet of the Royal 
Thai Government had approved the signing the Convention and its ratification is being 
finalized. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>633. Sources provided information on five outstanding cases. Regarding one case, the 
source confirmed the information provided by the Government and, consequently, the case 
was clarified. In addition, the sources contested the information provided by the 
Government with regard to two cases to which the six-month rule had been applied. 
Consequently, the Working Group decided, at its ninety-fourth session, to suspend the 
application of the six-month rule to these two cases.  </p>


<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>634. Following the information provided by the Government, which was later confirmed by 
the source, the Working Group decided to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>635. On 30 June 2011, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a mission to 
the country. On 17 October 2011, the Government of Thailand replied that given the high 
number of requests received, a further communication would be conveyed to the Working 
Group when an agreeable time can be arranged.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>636. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 62 cases to the 
Government; of those, two cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided 
by the Government, two cases have been discontinued, three cases were found to be 
duplications and were therefore deleted, and 55 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>637. The Working Group recalls article 13.3 of the Declaration according to which States 
must take steps to ensure that persons involved in investigations of cases of enforced 
disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting the 
investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal.

<p><b>  Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>646. On 28 October 2011, the Working Group, jointly with two other special procedures 
mechanisms, transmitted a prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning the 
alleged arrests, in October 2011, of representatives of member associations of the Euro-
Mediterranean Federation Against Enforced Disappearances (FEMED), Mr. <b>Kemal Aydin</b>, 
Mr. <b>Selahattin Tekin</b> and Mr. <b>Cemal Bektas</b> from Yakay-der, and Ms. <b>Nahide Ormani</b> 
from Mothers for Peace. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>647. The Government transmitted three communications to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>648. In the first communication, dated 18 March 2011, the Government replied to a prompt 
intervention letter transmitted on 7 January 2010, regarding the reported harassment 
suffered by Mr. Muharrem Erbey, a human rights defender who works, <i>inter alia</i>, on cases 
of enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>649. The Government reported that the Chief Public Prosecutor initiated an investigation 
pertaining to the activities of the Koma Civaken Kurdistan terrorist organization. It further 
reported that, as a result of the operations carried out by several public authorities, 37 
people, including Mr. Erbey, taken into custody and immediately before a judge on 25 
December 2009. Moreover, the Government informed the Working Group that Mr. Erbey 
was brought before the Chief Public Prosecutor within 24 hours, without his statement </p>


<p>being taken or being accused of any charges. Following the statement taken and the 
investigation carried out by the Chief Public Prosecutor, he was heard by the Diyarbakir 
Penal Court and taken in detention for being a member of a terrorist organization. Finally, 
the Government reported that, in the framework of the investigation, the premises of the 
Human Rights Association were searched, nine hard disks were seized and copies of these 
disks were given to a registered lawyer according to instructions obtained from the Chief 
Prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>650. In the second communication, dated 22 June 2011, the Government provided 
information on four outstanding cases. Based on this information, the Working Group 
decided, at its ninety-fifth session, to apply the six-month rule to three of these cases. The 
information provided was considered insufficient to lead to the clarification of the 
remaining case. 
</p>
<p>651. In the third communication, dated 7 July 2011, the Government provided information 
on six cases. The information provided was considered insufficient to lead to their 
clarification. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>652. Following the expiration of the period prescribed by the six-month rule, the Working 
Group decided to clarify one case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>653. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 182 cases to the 
Government; of those, 49 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 72 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, one case was discontinued, and 60 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>654. The Working Group would like to recall that, in its resolution 7/12, the Human Rights 
Council urged Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of 
enforced or involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced 
disappearances and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any 
intimidation or ill-treatment to which they might be subjected.

<p><b>  Urgent Actions  
</b></p>
<p>661. The Working Group sent one case to the Government under its urgent action 
procedure, concerning Mr. <b>Jamshid Abdurasulov</b>, who allegedly disappeared after going 
to the headquarters of the Dubai Criminal Investigation Department on 15 March 2011. 
Reportedly, on 24 March 2011, Mr. Abdurasulov called his family and told them that he 
believed, as he was blindfolded, that he was being held at the Al Bateen Air Base Airport in 
Abu Dhabi where he was subjected to interrogation. He did not contact his family again 
after this conversation. Mr. Jamshid Abdurasulov was the subject of an urgent appeal 
previously transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>662. On 1 April 2011, the Working Group transmitted one urgent appeal to the Government, 
jointly with two other special procedures mechanisms, concerning Mr. <b>Jamshid 
Abdurasulov</b>, who allegedly disappeared after going to the headquarters of the Dubai 
Criminal Investigation Department on 15 March 2011. The Working Group later 
transmitted the allegations concerning Mr. Jamshid Abdurasulov as an urgent action.

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>687. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group dated 8 
February and 20 June 2011, concerning one outstanding case. The information provided 
was considered insufficient to lead to its clarification. However, it was transmitted to the 
source for possible closure.  
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>688. On 20 July 2009, the Working Group requested the Government for an invitation to 
undertake a mission to Zimbabwe. Reminder letters were sent on 16 August 2010, and 18 
August 2011. The Permanent Mission acknowledged receipt on 18 August 2010, and 29 
August 2011, informing that the request had been transmitted to the relevant authorities. No 
reply has yet been received. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>689. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted six cases to the 
Government; of those, one case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, one case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and four cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>690. The Working Group regrets that no response was received from the Government to its 
general allegation on the escalating phenomenon of enforced or involuntary disappearances 
of political party members and human rights defenders (A/HRC/13/31, par. 631-6), 
notwithstanding a reminder sent on 26 August 2011. </p>

E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>692. <b>In 2011, the Working Group transmitted 261 newly-reported cases of 
disappearance to 25 Governments. The Working Group used the urgent action 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure in 73 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months 
</b></p>
<p><b>preceding the receipt of the report by the Working Group. During the reporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>period, the Working Group was able to clarify 63 cases of enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>693. <b>Over 40,000 cases still remain unclarified by the Working Group, many going 
back decades. In spite of this large number, underreporting remains a major problem. 
</b></p>
<p><b>It occurs for various reasons, including poverty, illiteracy, fear of reprisals, weak 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems of 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity, language barriers, a practice of silence and restrictions on the work of civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. More assistance should be provided to family members and members of civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society in order for them to be in a position to report cases to the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>694. <b>The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received from a number of 
States: it is indispensable for discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons around the globe.  Nevertheless, it remains concerned that of the 82 States 
</b></p>
<p><b>with outstanding cases, some Sta</b>tes have never replied to the Working Group&#8223;s 
</p>
<p><b>communications and some States provide responses that do not contain relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>information. The Working Group urges those States to fulfil their obligations under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Declaration and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council. 
</b></p>
<p>695. The Working Group acknowledges the efforts of States, of victims&#8223; associations, 
<b>of many human rights defenders, non-governmental organizations, lawyers and others </b></p>


<p><b>who untiringly work to know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons in very 
</b></p>
<p><b>adverse circumstances in all parts of the world and reiterates its solidarity with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of enforced disappearance and their families. 
</b></p>
<p>696. <b>Unfortunately, the Working Group continues to note a pattern of threats, 
intimidation and reprisals against victims of enforced disappearances, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>family members, witnesses and human rights defenders working on such cases. Again, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group calls upon States to take specific measures to prevent such acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to punish the perpetrators and protect those working on enforced disappearances.   
</b></p>
<p>697. <b>The Working Group notes that, regrettably, enforced disappearances continue to 
be used by some States as a tool to deal with situations of conflict or internal unrest. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group ha</b>s also witnessed the use of &#8222;short term disappearances,&#8223; where 
</p>
<p><b>victims are placed in secret detention or unknown locations, outside the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the law, before being released weeks or months later, sometimes after having been 
</b></p>
<p><b>tortured and without having been brought in front of a judge or other civil authority. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This very worrisome practice, whether it is used to counter terrorism, to fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized crime or suppress legitimate civil strife demanding democracy, freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression or religion, should be considered as an enforced disappearance and as such 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately investigated, prosecuted and punished.  
</b></p>
<p>698. <b>In a general comment adopted this year, the Working Group concluded that 
enforced disappearance represents a paradigmatic violation of the right to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognized as a person before the law. It stated that enforced disappearances entail 
</b></p>
<p>the denial of the disappeared person&#8223;s legal existence and, as a consequence, prevent 
</p>
<p><b>him or her from enjoying all other human rights and freedoms. It further concluded 
</b></p>
<p><b>that States should acknowledge and respect the right of every disappeared person to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be recognized as a person before the law, and that the basis of this acknowledgement 
</b></p>
<p>should take the form of a &#8220;declaration of absence by reason of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance&#8221;<b>. The Working Group is committed to preserve and safeguard the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to recognition as a person in the implementation of its mandate. As the legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>personality of the disappeared person is denied at the domestic level, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian mandate implemented by the Working Group should be understood as 
</b></p>
<p><b>an international guarantee of this right. 
</b></p>
<p>699. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to take specific legislative, administrative, 
judicial or other measures, including the establishment of specific investigating bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>700. <b>The Working Group reminds States that enforced disappearance is a continuous 
crime for as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim remains unclarified. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should take specific measures under their criminal law to define enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances as an autonomous criminal offence and to bring their existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation in line with the Declaration.  In this regard, the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages States to consult its study on best practices on enforced disappearances in 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic criminal legislation (A/HRC/16/48/Add.3). 
</b></p>
<p>701. <b>States are encouraged to take all possible measures to prevent enforced 
disappearances. These include: accessible and updated registries of detainees at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>places of detention and confinement; guaranteed access to appropriate information 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to all such places for relatives as well as lawyers; bringing arrested persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>promptly before a judicial authority; and strengthening civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b>that deal with the issue of enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>702. <b>The Working Group reminds States of their obligations under the Declaration to 
ensure that cases of enforced disappearance are promptly investigated and persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>accused of having committed these violations are arrested and prosecuted. Trials </b></p>


<p><b>should only be carried out in competent civilian courts and punishments should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>commensurate with the gravity of the crime. The Working Group also reminds States 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they have an obligation to ensure that every person having knowledge of, or a 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate interest in, an enforced disappearance has the right to complain to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>competent and independent authority to have their complaint promptly, thoroughly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and impartially investigated.  
</b></p>
<p>703. <b>Since its first report in 1981, the Working Group has acknowledged the right to 
the truth as an autonomous right.  The right to the truth is both an individual and a 
</b></p>
<p><b>collective right: each victim has the right to know the truth about violations that have 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected him or her, but the truth also has to be told at the level of society to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recurrence of such violations.  
</b></p>
<p>704. <b>The Working Group reminds States of article 18 of the Declaration, as well as of 
its general comment thereon, according to which persons who have or who are alleged 
</b></p>
<p><b>to have committed acts of enforced disappearance shall not benefit from any special 
</b></p>
<p><b>amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from 
</b></p>
<p><b>any criminal proceedings or sanction.  
</b></p>
<p>705. <b>The Working Group encourages States to apply the most comprehensive 
</b>definition of &#8220;victim&#8221;, with no distinction between direct and indirect victims.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>706. <b>The Working Group emphasizes that the right to the truth includes, when the 
disappeared person is found to be dead, the right of the families to have the remains of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their loved ones return to them. The remains of the persons should be clearly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>indisputably identified, including through DNA analysis. States should take the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate steps to use forensic expertise and scientific methods of identification to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the maximum of their available resources, including through international assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>707. <b>The Working Group recalls its general comment on article 19 of the Declaration 
on the right of all victims of acts of enforced disappearance, including their families, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to obtain redress and integral reparation, including as complete a rehabilitation as 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible. States should adopt legislative and other measures to enable victims, and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>case of death of the victim their dependents, to claim reparations.   
</b></p>
<p>708. <b>The Working Group notes the importance of reconciliation, as a logical 
continuation of the implementation of an integral process of the rights to truth, justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reparation. The process of reconciliation must be based on the principle of 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with civil society, particularly with victims associations and cannot be 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieved at the expense of the right of victims of enforced disappearances to justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reparation.  
</b></p>
<p>709. <b>Women are particularly affected by enforced disappearances as the consequences 
at economic, social and psychological levels, are most often borne by them. If they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>the victims of disappearance, they are particularly vulnerable to sexual and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of violence. In addition, as they are at the forefront of the struggle to resolve the 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearances of members of their families, they are subject to intimidation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>persecution and reprisals.  
</b></p>
<p>710. <b>The Working Group notes that children are also victims of disappearances. The 
disappearance of a child, his/her wrongful removal, and the loss of a parent through 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappearance are serious violations of children's rights.  
</b></p>
<p>711. Country visits are an integral part of the fulfilment of the Working Group&#8223;s 
<b>mandate. They allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforced disappearances, assist States in reducing obstacles to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration, and ensure direct contact with the family members of the victims. There </b></p>


<p><b>are, however, a number of States from which the Working Group has requested 
</b></p>
<p><b>invitations to visit and which have not been forthcoming. There are others which have 
</b></p>
<p><b>informally invited and/or confirmed invitations, but for which specific dates to visit 
</b></p>
<p><b>have not been agreed. The Working Group therefore calls upon all States with 
</b></p>
<p><b>pending requests for visits and those that have agreed to visits to respond as soon as 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible with specific dates.  
</b></p>
<p>712. <b>The Working Group once again calls upon Governments that have not signed 
and/or ratified the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Enforced Disappearance to do so as soon as possible and to accept the competence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Committee to receive individual cases, under article 31, and inter-State complaints 
</b></p>
<p><b>under article 32 of the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>713. <b>The Working Group welcomes that the United Nations declared 30 August 
International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances. It further notes that 
</b></p>
<p><b>2012 marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages all States to translate it with no distinction between languages and dialects 
</b></p>
<p><b>since all serve the purpose of assisting in its global dissemination and the ultimate goal 
</b></p>
<p><b>of prevention of enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>714. <b>The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Argentina and France for 
their financial and human resource contributions, which allowed the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>to have enhanced support. The Working Group reminds the United Nations of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited regular budget made available to it and calls for greater assistance to allow it 
</b></p>
<p><b>to accomplish its mandate.  </b></p>


<p><b>Annexes 
</b></p>
<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Revised methods of work of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Adopted on 11 November 2011. Applicable as from 1 January 2012. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  The mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal basis for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances&#8217; methods of work 
are based on its mandate as stipulated originally in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 20 (XXXVI) and as developed by the Commission and its successor the Human 
Rights Council in numerous further resolutions.  The parameters of its work are laid down 
in the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights, Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1235 (XLI) and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 (hereinafter referred to as &#8213;the Declaration&#8214;).  
</p>
<p><b>  Humanitarian mandate 
</b></p>
<p>2. One of the mandates of the Working Group is aimed at assisting families in 
determining the fate and whereabouts of their disappeared relatives who are placed outside 
the protection of the law. To this end, the Working Group endeavours to establish a channel 
of communication between the families and the Governments concerned, with a view to 
ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified individual cases which 
families, directly or indirectly, have brought to the Working Group&#8217;s attention are 
investigated with a view to clarifying the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons.  
In transmitting cases of disappearance, the Working Group deals exclusively with 
Governments, basing itself on the principle that Governments must assume responsibility 
for any violation of human rights on their territory.   
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring mandate   
</b></p>
<p>3. In addition, the Working Group has been entrusted to monitor States&#8217; compliance 
with their obligations deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and of existing international rules and to provide to Governments 
with assistance in their implementation  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group reminds the Governments of their obligations not only in the 
context of clarifying individual cases but also that of taking action of a more general nature.  
It draws the attention of Governments and non-governmental organizations to general or 
specific aspects of the Declaration, it recommends ways of overcoming obstacles to the 
realization of the Declaration, it discusses with representatives of Governments and non-
governmental organizations how to solve specific problems in the light of the Declaration, 
it assists Governments by carrying out on-the-spot visits, organizing seminars and 
providing similar advisory services. The Working Group also makes observations on the 
implementation of the Declaration when the concerned Government has not fulfilled its 
obligations related to the rights to truth, justice and reparation. The Working Group adopts </p>


<p>general comments whenever it considers that a provision of the Declaration requires further 
clarification or interpretation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>5. As defined in the preamble of the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when 
persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their 
liberty by officials of different branches or levels of Government or by organized groups or 
private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts 
of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which 
places such persons outside the protection of the law.   
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of Perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group operates for purposes of its work on the basis that, in 
accordance with the definition contained in the Preamble of the Declaration, enforced 
disappearances are only considered as such when the act in question is perpetrated by State 
actors or by private individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on 
behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the 
Government. Based on the above, the Working Group does not admit cases when they are 
attributed to persons or groups not acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or 
indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, such as terrorist or insurgent 
movements fighting the Government in its own territory. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Handling of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent procedures 
</b></p>
<p>7. Cases of enforced disappearances that occurred within the three months preceding 
receipt of the report by the Working Group are transmitted to the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs of the country concerned by the most direct and rapid means.  Their transmission 
can be authorized by the Chair-Rapporteur on the basis of a specific delegation of power 
given to him by the Working Group.  Cases which occurred prior to the three month limit, 
but not more than one year before the date of their receipt by the Secretariat, provided that 
they had some connection with a case which occurred within the three-month period, can be 
transmitted between sessions by letter, upon authorization by the Chair-Rapporteur.  The 
Working Group notifies sources that an urgent action has been sent to the concerned 
Government, thus helping it to enter into communication with the authorities about the 
specific case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. Cases of enforced disappearances that are reported after three months are placed 
before the Working Group for detailed examination during its sessions.  Those which fulfil 
the requirements outlined above are transmitted, upon the Working Group&#8217;s specific 
</p>
<p>authorization, to the Governments concerned with the request that they carry out 
investigations in order to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, and 
inform the Working Group of the results.  These cases are communicated by letter from the 
Working Group&#8217;s Chair-Rapporteur to the Government concerned through the Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>9. Any substantive additional information which the sources submit on an outstanding 
case is placed before the Working Group and, following its approval, transmitted to the 
Government concerned.  </p>


<p><b>  Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>10. Reports of disappearances are considered admissible by the Working Group when 
they originate from the family or friends of the disappeared person.  Such reports may, 
however, be channelled to the Working Group through representatives of the family, 
Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other 
reliable sources. They must be submitted in writing with a clear indication of the identity of 
the sender; if the source is other than a family member, it must have direct consent of the 
family to submit the case on its behalf, and it must also be in a position to follow up with 
the relatives of the disappeared person concerning his or her fate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Elements for admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>11. In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful investigations, the Working 
Group provides them with information containing at least a minimum of basic data.  In 
addition, the Working Group constantly urges the senders of reports to furnish as many 
details as possible concerning the identity of the disappeared person and the circumstances 
of the disappearance.  The Working Group requires the following minimum elements:  
</p>
<p>(a) Full name of the disappeared person and, if possible, age, gender, nationality, 
and occupation or profession; 
</p>
<p>(b) Date of disappearance, i.e. day, month and year of arrest or abduction, or day, 
month and year when the disappeared person was last seen.  When the disappeared person 
was last seen in a detention centre, an approximate indication is sufficient (for example, 
March or spring 1990); 
</p>
<p>(c) Place of arrest or abduction, or where the disappeared person was last seen 
(indication of town or village, at least); 
</p>
<p>(d) Parties, acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, presumed to have carried out the arrest or abduction or to 
be holding the disappeared person in unacknowledged detention;  
</p>
<p>(e) Steps taken by the family to determine the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, or at least an indication that efforts to resort to domestic remedies were 
frustrated or have otherwise been inconclusive.  
</p>
<p>(f) A case should be submitted to the Working Group by a reliable source, 
which, if other than a family member, must indicate whether the reported victim's family 
has given their direct consent that this case be submitted to the Working Group on their 
behalf. 
</p>
<p>12. If a case is not admitted, the Working Group sends a response to the source 
indicating that the information received did not fulfil the established requirements, in order 
to permit the source to provide all relevant information. 
</p>
<p><b>  Situations of vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p>13. With respect to reported cases of disappearances, the Working Group highlights the 
condition of people in situations of vulnerability, including women, children, the elderly, 
persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pregnancy 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the case of the disappearance of a pregnant woman, the child presumed to have 
been born during the mother&#8217;s captivity should be mentioned in the description of the case 
of the mother.  The child would be treated as a separate case when witnesses reported that 
the mother had actually given birth to a child during detention. </p>


<p><b>  Cases concerning two or more countries 
</b></p>
<p>15. Reports on a disappearance indicating that officials from one country are directly 
responsible for or involved in a disappearance in another country, or in cases where 
officials from more than one country were directly responsible for or involved in the 
disappearance would be communicated to all Governments concerned. However, the case 
would only be counted in the statistics of the country in which the person was reportedly 
arrested, detained, abducted or last seen. The same principles are applied with respect to the 
transmission of all communications. In exceptional circumstances, and if the humanitarian 
mandate of the Working Group so requires, cases may be counted in the statistics of a 
different country. However, the State upon whose territory the disappearance occurred will 
be copied on all communications so that it could also play a role, where possible, to gather 
all available information which could lead to the clarification of the cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Outstanding cases 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Working Group considers cases as outstanding for as long as they have not been 
clarified, closed or discontinued in accordance with the present methods of work.  This 
principle is not affected by changes of Government in a given country nor in the event of 
State succession. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reminders 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Working Group reminds every Government concerned once a year of the cases 
which have not yet been clarified and three times a year of all urgent action cases 
transmitted since the previous session.  On request, the Working Group provides to the 
Government concerned or the source, to the extent possible, updated information on 
specific cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Government replies 
</b></p>
<p>18. All replies received from Governments concerning reports of disappearances are 
examined by the Working Group and summarized in the Working Group&#8217;s annual report to 
the Human Rights Council.  Any information given on specific cases is forwarded to the 
sources of those reports, who are invited to make observations thereon or to provide 
additional details on the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  The six-month rule 
</b></p>
<p>19. Any reply of the Government containing detailed information on the fate or 
whereabouts of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source.  If the source does not 
respond within six months of the date on which the Government&#8217;s reply was communicated 
</p>
<p>to it, or if it contests the Government&#8217;s information on grounds which are considered 
unreasonable by the Working Group, the case is considered clarified and is accordingly 
listed under the heading &#8213;Cases clarified by the Government&#8217;s response&#8214; in the statistical 
</p>
<p>summary of the annual report.  If the source contests the Government&#8217;s information on 
reasonable grounds, the Government is so informed and invited to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification  
</b></p>
<p>20. Clarification occurs when the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons are 
clearly established and detailed information is transmitted as a result of an investigation by 
the Government, inquiries by non-governmental organisations, fact-finding missions by the 
Working Group or by human rights personnel from the United Nations or from any other 
international organization operating in the field, or by the search of the family, irrespective </p>


<p>of whether the person is alive or dead. In these circumstances the six-month rule, provided 
in article 19, applies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Closed cases 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Working Group may decide stop pursuing a case when the competent authority 
specified in the relevant national law issues a declaration of absence as a result of enforced 
disappearance or, alternatively, a declaration of presumption of death, and the relatives or 
other interested parties have manifested, freely and indisputably, their desire not to pursue 
the case any further. These conditions should at all times respect the right to integral 
reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>22. In exceptional circumstances, the Working Group may decide to discontinue the 
consideration of cases where the families have manifested, freely and indisputably, their 
desire not to pursue the case any further, or when the source is no longer in existence or is 
unable to follow up the case and steps taken by the Working Group to establish 
communication with other sources have proven unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reopening of cases 
</b></p>
<p>23. If sources provide well-documented information that a case has been considered 
clarified, closed or discontinued erroneously, because the Government&#8217;s reply referred to a 
different person, does not correspond to the reported situation or has not reached the source 
within the six-month period referred to above, the Working Group transmits the case to the 
Government anew, requesting it to comment.  In such instances, the case in question is 
again listed among the outstanding cases and a specific explanation is given in the Working 
Group&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council, describing the above-mentioned errors or 
discrepancies. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Other protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeals  
</b></p>
<p>24. When credible allegations are received that a person has been arrested, detained, 
abducted, or otherwise deprived of his liberty and has been enforcedly disappeared or is at 
risk of being disappeared, the Working Group will transmit those allegations to the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs of the Government concerned by the most direct and rapid means 
requesting said Government to carry out investigations to clarify the fate or whereabouts of 
the person(s) concerned and to inform the Working Group about the results The 
transmission of urgent appeals is authorized by the Chair-Rapporteur on the basis of a 
specific delegation of power given to him by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>25. Urgent appeals will be reflected in the annual report of the Working Group, but will 
not be counted in the statistics of the Government concerned. However, should the 
information contained therein be provided in accordance with the requirements listed under 
&#8213;Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances&#8214; and &#8213;Elements for 
</p>
<p>admissibility&#8214;, the urgent appeal will become a standard or urgent case as appropriate in 
</p>
<p>which case the Government concerned will be informed by separate communication.   
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt interventions 
</b></p>
<p>26. Cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of disappeared 
persons, witnesses to disappearances or their families, members of organizations of 
relatives and other non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders or individuals </p>


<p>concerned with disappearances are transmitted to the pertinent Governments, with the 
appeal that they take steps to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected.  
Cases of that nature, which require prompt intervention, are transmitted directly to the 
Ministers for Foreign Affairs by the most direct and rapid means.  To that end, the Working 
Group has authorized its Chair-Rapporteur to transmit such cases between sessions.  
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Working Group regularly transmits to the Governments concerned a summary 
of allegations received from relatives of disappeared persons and non-governmental 
organizations with regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration 
in their respective countries, inviting them to comment thereon if they so wish. 
</p>
<p><b>Cooperation with other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>28. If a case or allegation contains information relevant to other thematic mechanisms of 
the Human Rights Council, the information is transmitted to the mechanism concerned.  
</p>
<p>29. Where appropriate, the Working Group may join other mechanisms in the actions 
they take within the scope of their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Activities of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Working Group carries out visits to countries on invitation, but also takes the 
initiative of approaching Governments with a view to carrying out visits to countries, when 
considered appropriate.  Such visits are intended to enhance the dialogue between the 
authorities most directly concerned, the families or their representatives and the Working 
Group, and to assist in the clarification of the reported disappearances. The Working Group 
also undertakes visits to examine the practices carried out by Governments to clarify cases 
of enforced disappearances, as well as the programmes and measures adopted to implement 
the Declaration and to guarantee the rights of the victims, including the right to integral 
reparation. The Working Group reports to the Council on its country visits in an addendum 
to its annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>31. With regard to countries in which visits have been carried out, the Working Group 
periodically reminds the Governments concerned of the observations and recommendations 
formulated in the respective reports, requesting information on the consideration given to 
them, and the steps taken for their implementation or the constraints which might have 
prevented their implementation. The Working Group may also take the initiative to carry 
out follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sessions 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Working Group meets three times a year to consider the information brought to 
its attention since its previous session.  Its sessions are held in private.  However, the 
Working Group works intersessionally and regularly meets with representatives of 
Governments, non-governmental organizations, family members and witnesses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reports 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Working Group reports annually to the Human Rights Council on the activities 
which it has carried out from the end of the Council&#8217;s previous session up until the last day 
of the Working Group&#8217;s third annual session. It informs the Council of its communications </p>


<p>with Governments and non-governmental organizations, its meetings and missions.  
Reports on missions are contained as addenda to the main report.  The Working Group 
reports on all cases of disappearance received by the Group during the year, on a country by 
country basis, and on the decision it has taken thereon.  It provides the Council with a 
statistical summary for each country of cases transmitted to the Government, clarifications, 
and the status of the person concerned on the date of clarification.  It includes graphs 
showing the development of disappearances in countries with more than 100 transmitted 
cases as of the date of the adoption by the Working Group of its annual report.  The 
Working Group includes conclusions and recommendations in its report and makes 
observations on the situation of disappearances in individual countries.  The Working 
Group further reports on the implementation of the Declaration and the obstacles 
encountered therein, and periodically reports on broader issues surrounding the 
phenomenon of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Participation of experts 
</b></p>
<p>34. When the information under consideration concerns a country to which one of the 
members of the Working Group is a national, that member does not participate in the 
discussion. 
</p>
<p><b>  Titles
