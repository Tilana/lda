<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth session from 24 
January to 4 February 2011. The review of Saint Kitts and Nevis was held at the 10th 
meeting on 28 January 2011. The delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis was headed by 
Delano Bart. At its 14th meeting, held on 1 February 2011, the Working Group adopted the 
report on St. Kitts and Nevis. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Saint Kitts and Nevis: Gabon, Kyrgyzstan, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Saint Kitts and Nevis: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/10/KNA/1 and Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/KNA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/10/KNA/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, 
Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom was transmitted to Saint Kitts and Nevis 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Saint Kitts and Nevis stated that the national consultations conducted in the 
preparation of the national report had provided insight into the possibilities of how the 
universal periodic review could create an engine for wider civil participation, greater 
corporate responsibility and a deeper commitment to partnership. The exchanges with intra-
governmental agencies and a broad section of civil society, including a wide cross section 
of organizations advocating for the rights of, amongst others, children, youth, women and 
persons with disabilities, had taken place in both Saint Kitts and Nevis. The national report 
opened with an overview of the commitment of Saint Kitts and Nevis to the promotion and 
protection of human rights as enshrined in the Constitution, which guaranteed that every 
person in Saint Kitts and Nevis was entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms, 
irrespective of race, place of origin, birth, political opinion, colour, creed or sex, but all 
subject to the respect of the rights of others. Saint Kitts and Nevis, as a member of the 
United Nations, adhered to the organization&#8217;s Charter and reaffirmed its commitment to the 
fundamental rights, dignity of the persons, and the equal rights of men and women.  
</p>
<p>6.  Saint Kitts and Nevis was a twin island federation located in the Eastern Caribbean 
with a size of 261 km2 and a total population of roughly 52,000. It had attained 
independence on 19 September 1983 and maintained a democratic form of government. </p>


<p>The most recent elections, in January 2010, returned the Government of Denzil Douglas for 
a fourth consecutive term.   
</p>
<p>7. Saint Kitts and Nevis was a party to various core international human rights treaties. 
It had also given consideration to other conventions to which it was not yet a party, 
however, it had faced challenges with respect to resources and constitutional hurdles. The 
process of Constitutional reform or adjustment required not only a two-thirds majority in 
the House, but at a referendum, there had to be a two-thirds majority in each individual 
island. Nevertheless, the Government remained committed to open consultations with its 
citizens on constitutional, judicial and legal reforms. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation stated that the reporting obligations to the relevant treaty bodies had 
been affected by human resource constraints and the difficulty of collecting and 
consistently maintaining accurate data. As a result of the process for the universal periodic 
review, a recommendation had been put before the Cabinet for the establishment of a treaty 
division that would be dedicated to reviewing the relevant instruments to be ratified and 
advising on the respective obligations thereunder. An example of difficulties was the 
submission of reports under the relevant articles of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW). In the case of CRC, the report was in its final stages of completion. 
The CEDAW report was still in its draft stage, but it was hoped that it would be submitted 
in the first quarter of 2011. 
</p>
<p>9. Saint Kitts and Nevis accepted that the retention of the death penalty for offences of 
murder was controversial and would continue to be so. However, having considered the 
matter, the Government had decided to retain it as one of the sentences available to the 
Court, which it could use at its discretion. Saint Kitts and Nevis accepted, from the outset, 
that there might be some evidence that the death penalty was not necessarily a deterrent. 
However, within the context of its society and the increasing crime rate, the Government 
would have great difficulty in justifying to its citizenry a decision to deprive the Court of 
that optional punishment. 
</p>
<p>10. The jurisprudence surrounding the death penalty had been highly developed and 
refined by the Courts to the extent that the Courts themselves would not pass such a 
sentence except in the most heinous crimes, which had been even further refined to being 
&#8220;the worst of the worst&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. Although the death penalty remained as a punitive measure on the books, it was not 
frequently carried out. In the last 30 years, the death penalty had been carried out in only 
three instances. During that period of time, others had been sentenced to death but those 
sentences had either been commuted by the Court or by the Mercy Committee &#8211; a feature of 
the Constitution &#8211; which intervened when justice ended and mercy began. In cases where 
the death penalty had been implemented, the legal procedure as set out in the Constitution 
had been followed. 
</p>
<p>12. Where an accused was found guilty of a crime punishable by death, the penalty of 
death was no longer mandatory. There was a compulsory hearing by the court, dedicated 
solely to the question of sentence. That meant that the judge had before him an array of 
options in respect of the sentence. The law required that a social inquiry report, psychiatric 
report, and any other report that the defence deemed necessary must be submitted to the 
court for such a hearing. The convicted person was allowed to call witnesses to speak on his 
behalf and his counsel was at liberty to try and persuade the Court against the imposition of 
the death penalty. If he was so sentenced, he still had the right to appeal against that 
sentence to the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean and ultimately to the Judicial 
Committee of the Privy Council in London. If the convicted person failed to have his </p>


<p>sentence commuted, he could petition the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy 
before which he had the right to make representation.    
</p>
<p>13. On the matter of corporal punishment, the delegation indicated that Saint Kitts and 
Nevis adhered to the belief that discipline in a society was an integral aspect of the 
development of responsibility and maturity. Traditionally, its people had supported the 
view that corporal punishment was an acceptable means of instilling discipline in children. 
However, in an effort to reduce or remove any arbitrary infliction, the Education Act of 
2005 clearly outlined restrictive methods for its use. There were also provisions for its 
abolition within the Act, and the Government would continue to explore alternative and 
effective measures. The procedures were designed in such a way as to ensure that the 
infliction of the corporal punishment would not cross the line into the abuse.   
</p>
<p>14. Saint Kitts and Nevis accepted that the criminalization of sexual relations between 
consenting adults under sections 56 and 57 of the Offences against the Person Act was 
controversial. While it was aware of the many arguments advanced by those who would 
wish to see them repealed, the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis had no mandate to do 
so. In fact, there was strong opposition to them being repealed. However, despite their 
existence on the books, there had been no known prosecution of sexual activity between 
consenting adults in private within recent years. 
</p>
<p>15. Saint Kitts and Nevis had signed the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, the Inter-American Convention 
on the Granting of Civil Rights to Women and the Inter-American Convention on the 
Granting of Political Rights to Women. It was also signatory to the Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Platform for Action, the United 
Nations Millennium Declaration, and Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, 
peace and security. It had also enacted the Domestic Violence Act of 2000 to promote and 
protect the rights of all women. 
</p>
<p>16. Saint Kitts and Nevis was aware that, although many women occupied senior 
positions in its society, where more than 50 per cent of households were managed by single 
women, the problem of domestic violence against women persisted. The Department of 
Gender Affairs continued its intense awareness-raising programme, including training for 
police, nurses and counsellors, and also implemented an intervention programme in order to 
educate those who batter. There was recognition that there was a need for social 
transformation on an even deeper level that necessitated not only an examination of the root 
causes of that evil but also a cultural re-education to build healthy relationships between 
families and the sexes. The Government was willing to buttress the law with supporting 
infrastructure to facilitate most effective forms of implementation. However, a lack of 
resources was a continuing constraint on all activities.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation indicated that, when CRC was first opened for signature on 26 
January 1990, Saint Kitts and Nevis was among the first to sign and ratify it, demonstrating 
its commitment thereto. The care and protection of children was provided for under the 
Probation and Child Welfare Board Act. Saint Kitts and Nevis had also been involved in 
the development of the model legislation for the protection of the family, which was 
intended to replace the existing laws concerning the family. The Department of Probation 
and Child Protection Services was charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the rights 
of children were protected. The Probation and Child Welfare Board Act provided for the 
protection of children whose health and welfare were adversely affected and further 
threatened.   
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the question on prisons, the Government had mandated the 
implementation of a rehabilitation programme to reduce recidivism. As regards 
overcrowding of prisons, prisoners had been relocated from the main prison in Basseterre to </p>


<p>the Prison Farm on the neighbouring island of Nevis. In addition, approximately ten acres 
of land had already been allocated for the construction of a new facility; the Government 
was awaiting funding from the European Commission to begin construction, which would 
be completed in phases. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that Saint Kitts and Nevis, although not yet a party to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), recognized the 
Convention&#8217;s benefit to society. Thus the Building Code catered to the needs of persons 
with disabilities so that they could access services.  
</p>
<p>20. The majority of households in Saint Kitts and Nevis were headed by women. The 
powerful role of women in society continued to be underscored by their presence and 
impact. They continued to achieve extremely high levels and  attain senior positions in their 
workplace, including in the public sector. The statistics showed that 66 per cent of the posts 
of Permanent Secretary were occupied by females, 25 per cent of police staff were female, 
20 per cent of Departments were headed by females, and females represented 73 per cent of 
teaching staff. In the Federal Parliament, the Minister who represented the largest 
constituency within the Federation and the Deputy Clerk were also female. The Director of 
Public Prosecutions and all three Magistrates were women.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 36 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the commitment of Saint Kitts and Nevis to the universal periodic 
review and its participation in the process. They also welcomed the quality of the national 
report and the State&#8217;s commitments to human rights in general despite the many challenges 
it faced. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the 
present report.  
</p>
<p>22. Algeria welcomed the candid description by Saint Kitts and Nevis of its challenges 
and vulnerabilities. It welcomed the adoption of more than 22 human rights-related laws 
and was convinced that the limited number of ratifications of international instruments was 
due to limited resources for their implementation rather than to the lack of commitment. It 
welcomed measures taken to enhance prisons&#8217; conditions. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Brazil noted protection of the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS, universal 
education from primary to secondary level and policies for the elderly. It asked for more 
information on the Social Security Act and on the Social Protection Programme. Brazil 
noted that Saint Kitts and Nevis recognized the need to redouble its efforts against gender-
based violence, particularly domestic violence. Brazil expressed its readiness to provide 
technical assistance and capacity-building in coordination with OHCHR at the request of 
Saint Kitts and Nevis. Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>24. Slovenia welcomed the commitment expressed by Saint Kitts and Nevis to ratify the 
core human rights instruments in spite of limited resources. Slovenia expressed concerns 
that the death penalty was maintained and had been applied in 2008 after a 10-year de facto 
moratorium. Slovenia welcomed the measures taken aimed at better protecting children and 
inquired about measures taken to prevent violations of the physical integrity of children. 
Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. France deplored that the death penalty was kept in the legislation of Saint Kitts and 
Nevis and had been applied in 2008. France noted with satisfaction that Saint Kitts and 
Nevis supported the inclusion of a reference to sexual orientation in the General Assembly 
resolution on extrajudicial executions but noted that current legal provisions criminalized 
sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex. France made recommendations. </p>


<p>26. Cuba highlighted that, in Saint Kitts and Nevis, all essential primary health-care 
services were available free of charge. Cuba also acknowledged the protection of persons 
affected with HIV/AIDS. Regarding persons with disabilities, Cuba noted that the 
Government had implemented mechanisms to meet their needs, as evidenced through the 
existence of special education units across the country providing educational services at all 
levels for children with developmental difficulties. Cuba made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>27. Turkey welcomed the ratification of Saint Kitts and Nevis of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, CEDAW and CRC. 
Turkey praised the efforts of Saint Kitts and Nevis to further accede to international human 
rights treaties. It was pleased to note that Saint Kitts and Nevis enacted important national 
legislation to fulfil its international human rights obligations. In this regard, Turkey 
commended the enactment of the 2005 Education Act. Turkey made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>28. Morocco welcomed Saint Kitts and Nevis&#8217; commitment to promote social, economic 
and social rights based on social and human development. Morocco also noted the various 
existing programmes for the protection of people infected by HIV/AIDS, including the 
establishment of the Human Rights Desk in 2007. Morocco noted the limited resources of 
Saint Kitts and Nevis, in particular for the ratification of new instruments and their 
incorporation in national law, and stated that it was prepared to provide its assistance in this 
regard. Morocco made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. The United Kingdom acknowledged challenges faced by small island developing 
States in implementing human rights obligations and noted the request for assistance in 
drafting new national legislation towards that end. While welcoming measures towards 
supporting youth, the United Kingdom remained concerned at the high levels of reported 
gang activity and encouraged the Government to continue its outreach programmes and to 
provide viable employment opportunities and alternatives. The United Kingdom called on 
the Government to abolish the death penalty and expressed concerns at the execution 
carried out in 2008. It also encouraged the Government to consider signing the two 
Optional Protocols to CRC. The United Kingdom asked what actions the Government 
planned to take to end discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
(LGBT) people. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>30. Spain noted with satisfaction measures taken by Saint Kitts and Nevis in the 
education and health areas, notably through the White Paper on Education Development 
and Policy 2009-2019 and the National Health Plan 2008-2010. Spain expressed concern at 
the maintenance of the death penalty. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. The United States of America noted the establishment of a Human Rights Desk to 
respond to human rights abuses against persons living with HIV/AIDS. It noted that the 
adoption of the Domestic Violence Act was a positive development but that violence 
against women still remained a seriously underreported problem. Many women were 
reluctant to file complaints or pursue them in courts. The United States also remained 
concerned about the continued criminalization of homosexual conduct and societal 
discrimination against LGBT persons. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Slovakia acknowledged various challenges faced by Saint Kitts and Nevis and 
positively noted efforts in the area of primary health care. Slovakia expressed concerns at 
the end of the 10-year de facto moratorium on the death penalty and the very low minimum 
age of criminal responsibility. Slovakia made reference to the need to expand the diversion 
of youth from the court and custodial systems. Slovakia inquired about measures taken to 
better protect children from pornography and child prostitution. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Germany noted that the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
reported that, in 1999, the Committee on the Rights of the Child had expressed deep </p>


<p>concern regarding the low legal age for criminal responsibility (8 years) and that the clauses 
on prevention of cruelty and protection of juveniles of the Juvenile Act did not provide 
special protection for children between the ages of 16 and 18. Germany wished to receive 
information on steps Saint Kitts and Nevis may have taken since the addressing of those 
questions. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to social security, the delegation indicated that that was one of the 
strongest areas in the federation. Saint Kitts and Nevis had sought to maintain a system that 
could provide social security to as many areas of the society as possible. A social services 
levy had been increased in recognition that assistance must be provided not only in terms of 
a national infrastructure but also as a safety net for persons who fell ill and could not work, 
the elderly, children, and those who lost the main breadwinners in their family owing to 
debilitating accidents or death. Because of the high priority placed on health care and 
education within the federation, a great emphasis was placed on social security and its 
dependent services. For at least the last 25 years, those who had learning disabilities or 
were physically challenged had been provided with free education.  
</p>
<p>35. As to HIV/AIDS and facilities made available to men who had sex with men, the 
delegation responded that Saint Kitts and Nevis did not deny such persons access to 
facilities and services; on the contrary, it assisted them with their health issues. Concerning 
discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the delegation stated 
that the reality was that, despite the existence of a piece of legislation, in terms of the 
society at large, such persons did enjoy the same rights and privileges as everyone else. No 
instances of denial of job opportunities or attacks against such people took place. There was 
a culture of tolerance in respect of those individuals in the society.   
</p>
<p>36. On the matter of the death penalty, the delegation stated that, while it appreciated the 
position of the members of the international community, Saint Kitts and Nevis worked in 
the context of practical realities on the ground. Though there might not necessarily be 
evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent, it was one of the sentences still available to 
the court, and there was a great demand by the society for it to remain.   
</p>
<p>37. As for the question of criminal responsibility, children over the age of 8 were not 
automatically deemed capable of such responsibility. With regard to children aged 8 to 16, 
the law stated that, before any individual could be put on trial, an exercise must be 
conducted to address his or her ability to understand the difference between right and 
wrong and the procedures that he or she was facing before any trial could start. However, 
Saint Kitts and Nevis had a society where serious crimes had increasingly been committed 
by younger individuals. While it had to respect the rights and appreciate the difficulties 
faced by the youth, it had to take into account the practical realities. Gang members were 
becoming younger, and the situation was becoming more and more complex and difficult to 
address.   
</p>
<p>38. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acknowledged the efforts by Saint Kitts and 
Nevis to achieve basic education for all children and adolescents by establishing free and 
compulsory education in 1967 for children aged 5 to 16. Venezuela stressed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to address the issue of quality education, accessible to everyone 
despite severe economic difficulties. Venezuela also welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to comply with human rights obligations. Venezuela made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Chile noted that the laws of Saint Kitts and Nevis guaranteed broad freedom of 
expression and the press, along with full freedom of association and participation in 
political life. Chile also noted efforts made by the Government to achieve human and social 
development indicators and its strategy to strengthen the social coverage of its population. 
It also noted Saint Kitts and Nevis&#8217; limited resources for its timely submissions of reports 
to various treaty bodies. Chile made recommendations.  </p>


<p>40. Maldives noted that Saint Kitts and Nevis faced enormous challenges in fully 
promoting and protecting human rights because of its small size and because of its capacity 
constraints. Maldives invited the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review to 
understand and appreciate this fact. Maldives made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Canada expressed concerns at the implementation of the death penalty after a 10-
year de facto moratorium and at the exercise of legal rights by prisoners condemned to 
death. Canada noted efforts to reduce domestic violence and violence against children. 
Canada applauded Saint Kitts and Nevis for its support of Organization of American States 
(OAS) resolutions on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity and referred to 
encouragement by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to study the 
human trafficking phenomenon. Canada looked forward to continuing to support Saint Kitts 
and Nevis in addressing human rights challenges it faced. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Poland applauded Saint Kitts and Nevis for its vibrant democracy which guaranteed 
basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and 
religion, as well as freedom of association and assembly. It also welcomed the consultations 
with civil society in the preparatory process for the UPR. Poland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Hungary welcomed the achievements related to education and health. Hungary 
expressed concerns at the resumption of execution after a 10-year de facto moratorium. 
Hungary noted that the country was affected by the transhipment of drugs, which resulted 
in a high incidence of drug abuse among youth and juvenile delinquency. Hungary 
welcomed recent developments to promote women&#8217;s rights but expressed concerns at 
discriminatory attitudes against women and at the high rate of rape. It encouraged the 
Government to follow up on its work related to the Millennium Development Goals. 
Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Mexico acknowledged the efforts made by Saint Kitts and Nevis to improve the 
level of development, particularly those regarding education and immunization coverage. 
Mexico also noted the need for technical assistance to expedite the process of accession to 
the international human rights standards and instruments. Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. Argentina expressed its appreciation for the initiatives taken by Saint Kitts and 
Nevis in the area of education, notably for the universal access to secondary education. 
Argentina inquired on other measures taken or planned to enhance women&#8217;s participation in 
the political and economic spheres. It noted the limited resources of the country preventing 
it from acceding to new international instruments. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Latvia noted that basic education for all children from aged 5 to 16 was free of 
charge and that virtually all essential services at the primary health-care level were offered 
free of charge. It also noted that no requests had been made by special procedures to visit 
the country. Latvia made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>47. Sweden expressed concerns at the maintenance of the death penalty. While 
welcoming the proposal of revisiting discriminatory laws, Sweden expressed concerns over 
the decision to continue to criminalize same-sex relations. It noted that violence against 
women was a serious problem and that women still faced discrimination in a number of 
areas and also noted the efforts taken to eliminate violence against women. Sweden made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>48. South Africa noted that despite challenges the Government continued to make 
progress in the promotion and protection of human rights. It therefore encouraged the 
international community to provide Saint Kitts and Nevis with the technical assistance 
required to overcome those challenges. South Africa appreciated the commitment to 
prioritize issues such as education, health, safety and security and encouraged the </p>


<p>Government to continue to prioritize those issues and to take all necessary steps to ensure 
that those sectors were improved. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>49. Uruguay noted Saint Kitts and Nevis&#8217; commitment to renew its efforts to participate 
in the human rights protection system. Uruguay took note of the institutional, legislative 
and programmatic efforts to reduce domestic violence, which continues to severely affect 
women and girls. Uruguay congratulated Saint Kitts ands Nevis for its support of OAS 
resolutions on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. Uruguay made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Concerning the period between detention and trial, the delegation provided 
information on the legislation that would convert the existing procedure from an oral 
process to a paper one in order to shorten the pretrial detention period.  
</p>
<p>51. As for human trafficking, the delegation reported that Saint Kitts and Nevis had 
passed the Trafficking in Persons Act, which criminalized trafficking in human beings with 
special provisions set out for children. The Electronic Crimes Act was passed in 2009, 
which addressed the electronic media being used to perpetrate crimes. The Department of 
Probation and Child Protection Services, with assistance from the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), was working to develop a child protection protocol. The 
protocol was expected to address trafficking, especially in so far as children were 
concerned.  
</p>
<p>52. In relation to the question about increased mobilization of women in politics, the 
delegation stated that, in paragraph 52 of the national report, Saint Kitts and Nevis had 
indicated that over 100 women and young persons from various political parties and non-
affiliated women had been trained in areas such as community mobilization, international 
instruments for the advancement of women, the Constitution, protocol and grooming for 
public life. This training was an ongoing process.  
</p>
<p>53. As for an invitation to special procedures and the establishment of a national human 
rights institution, the delegation would take the issue back to the capital and seek guidance 
from the Government. Addressing an invitation to the special procedures might not be 
difficult, however, it might have financial implications.   
</p>
<p>54. As to gang crimes and drug trafficking, Saint Kitts and Nevis had undertaken a 
number of initiatives. There was an increase of 7.2 per cent in the budget allocation for the 
Ministry of National Security, Immigration and Labour, which handled crime issues. Saint 
Kitts and Nevis had also passed an amendment to the Firearms Act, which provided that, if 
an individual was found in possession of more than one illegal firearm, that would 
automatically raise the presumption of trafficking.   
</p>
<p>55. Australia commended the Government for its stance against anti-personnel 
landmines and its full support to the Ottawa process. Australia remained concerned that 
Saint Kitts and Nevis retained the death penalty. It noted that at least half a dozen people 
remained on death row and that death sentences continued to be imposed as recently as 
December 2008. Australia commended the commitment to safeguard the rights of persons 
with disabilities, and encouraged the Government to continue with its initiatives in the 
education area. Australia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. Ghana commended Saint Kitts and Nevis for being party to the core international 
human rights instruments and for its human rights educational campaigns. Ghana noted the 
challenges faced by Saint Kitts and Nevis in implementing human rights obligations, 
notably in submitting reports to treaty bodies, and supported its call for international 
technical assistance. Ghana noted efforts undertaken in the area of education and that the 
country was Millennium Development Goal Plus in education. Ghana echoed concerns 
expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women related </p>


<p>to stereotypes affecting women and their promotion to senior positions despite their level of 
education. Ghana made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. Barbados recognized that Saint Kitts and Nevis had yet to sign the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and urged the Government to do so. 
Barbados acknowledged that the reporting obligations to treaty bodies were challenging and 
called upon OHCHR to help in this regard. It noted that providing security and maintaining 
law and order in a small island developing State with a porous border presented a unique 
dilemma and called for greater international cooperation in addressing the illicit 
proliferation of small arms. Barbados made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. China noted the efforts undertaken by Saint Kitts and Nevis to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals in the fields of education and health and efforts to improve 
the situation of women, elderly and persons with disabilities. China noted the challenges 
faced by the country in stepping up social and economic development and protecting 
human rights. China called upon the international community to provide assistance to Saint 
Kitts and Nevis. 
</p>
<p>59. Guatemala noted the need of Saint Kitts and Nevis for technical assistance for 
accession and ratification of international human rights instruments. It acknowledged the 
efforts of the Government to improve social and human development indicators. It 
encouraged Saint Kitts and Nevis to raise the status of the Office of the Ombudsman in 
accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). It shared concerns raised by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding corporal punishment and many other 
acts of violence and abuse of children. Guatemala made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>60. Botswana commended Saint Kitts and Nevis for the positive measures adopted in 
the field of human rights, including the establishment of the Human Rights Desk in the area 
of HIV/AIDS. Although that body faced difficulties in realizing its mandate, Botswana 
noted that its relocation to the Legal Aid Clinic might address this issue. Botswana 
recognized other positive measures, including the establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office and expressed its hope that the international community would provide its support. 
Botswana made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>61. Trinidad and Tobago supported Saint Kitts and Nevis&#8217; call for assistance in the 
drafting of relevant appropriate legislation to implement international human rights 
obligations. It noted that key strides had been made in the provision of universal education 
from primary to secondary levels, the development of the National Health Plan 2008-2012 
and the establishment of the Human Rights Desk. It noted the 2000 Domestic Violence Act, 
the 1999 Social Development Assistance Act and the development of the Draft Policy on 
the Care of Older Persons. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Costa Rica welcomed the establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office. Costa Rica 
noted that the effectiveness of the Office would depend on its independence, and urged 
Saint Kitts and Nevis to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the Office complied 
with the Paris Principles. It welcomed the adoption of the Education Act, which included 
human rights. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Jamaica noted the sustainable development challenges faced by Saint Kitts and 
Nevis. Jamaica welcomed the achievement of Millennium Development Goals Plus in 
education, offering universal education from pre-primary to the secondary level, and that 
virtually all essential services at the primary health-care level were offered free of charge. It 
noted the obstacles related to the timely submission of reports to treaty bodies, and in 
drafting and enacting legislation to comply with those treaties to which the country is a 
party. Jamaica made recommendations. </p>


<p>64. Mauritius stated that the population, including young generations, was the greatest 
asset of Saint Kitts and Nevis and welcomed that the State had ratified CRC and 
strengthened its policy efforts to enhance child welfare. Mauritius noted Saint Kitts and 
Nevis&#8217; commitment in promoting human rights in its national legislation despite challenges, 
notably in meeting reporting obligations. Mauritius made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. Ecuador noted the efforts of Saint Kitts and Nevis to comply with international 
human rights obligations, in particular to harmonize its legislation with those instruments 
despite its limited economic and human resources. Ecuador made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>66. Norway noted the maintenance of the death penalty and its application. It welcomed 
training programmes to educate youth on gender equality. It was concerned at the high rate 
of teenage pregnancy but welcomed measures to secure the right of education for teenage 
mothers. Norway noted that Saint Kitts and Nevis had ratified CEDAW, and that 
consensual sexual relations between adults of the same sex were still criminalized. Norway 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. With regard to equal pay for equal work, the delegation reported that Saint Kitts and 
Nevis was passing a relevant act in 2011. As for compulsory education, the Education Act 
of 2005 made it compulsory for every child to attend school up to the age of 16.   
</p>
<p>68. The delegation stated that whether Saint Kitts and Nevis would accept States&#8217; 
recommendations or not would largely depend on its ability to specifically address them in 
terms of economic and human resources capacity. The economic climate was adversely 
affected by the fact that Saint Kitts and Nevis was one of the world&#8217;s heavily indebted 
countries. The debt ratio was 185 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009, having 
declined by 15 percentage points in the same year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
had indicated that, as fallout of the financial crisis, the tourism industry had decreased by 
5.5 per cent in 2009, with a projection for further decline in 2010. Moreover, the 
geographical location of the islands, being in the path of tropical storms, hurricanes and 
cyclones that crossed the Atlantic Ocean, increased the State&#8217;s vulnerability to those natural 
disasters.   
</p>
<p>69. Since achieving independence, Saint Kitts and Nevis had continued to make 
significant strides in multiple areas, thus graduating from a low-income to a middle-income 
economy. Its GDP per capita had exceeded US$ 10,000 by late 2010, and IMF reported 
signs of economic turnaround with a growth rate of at least 1.5 per cent. 
</p>
<p>70. That was due in part to the Government&#8217;s decision to embark upon a rigid campaign 
of prudence in the management of its expenditure, ever mindful of the challenges that 
confronted it as a small island developing State such as susceptibility to natural disasters 
and other shocks. It continued to implement fiscal policies to deal with the risks and 
economic challenges to ensure that the limited resources were allocated to areas with the 
greatest potential for economic growth. However, the debt service burden allowed little 
room for fiscal manoeuvring and for adequate responses to some of those demands.  
</p>
<p>71. The Government over the past decade had been committed to meeting the 
Millennium Development Goals by 2015. To date, it had made great strides towards their 
achievement, having developed programmes to address the most disadvantaged members of 
the society.   
</p>
<p>72. It must be emphasized that, although the Government was intent on fulfilling its 
obligations in the area of human rights under international treaties, efforts and resources 
had been focused on poverty reduction initiatives and strategies, sustainable economic 
growth and international competitiveness, which in the long term would stimulate and 
sustain overall social development. With the upsurge in crime, the Government had had to </p>


<p>channel additional funds to the relevant ministries and departments tasked with preventing 
and combating crime.   
</p>
<p>73. The delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore made an appeal to the donor 
countries and international partners to support the efforts of developing countries in 
building capacity and strengthening human resources, specifically in the area of data 
collection, statistical analysis and reporting to the international treaty bodies pertaining to 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>74. The challenges and constraints which Saint Kitts and Nevis faced as a small island 
developing State were many, but not insurmountable. The delegation believed that Saint 
Kitts and Nevis had shown the world on many fronts that its people were resilient. Its 
presence and participation in the universal periodic review was part of the maturing process 
of a sovereign and democratic State. It hoped that the universal periodic review would not 
only highlight areas in which the State needed to improve but also to provide opportunities 
for exchanges of best practices that could enable countries such as Saint Kitts and Nevis to 
make significant advancement towards achieving a high level of promotion and protection 
of human rights on the ground.
