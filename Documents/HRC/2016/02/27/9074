to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized 
agencies, international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international 
humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on the matter to 
the Council at its tenth session. Pursuant to that request, the Secretary-General, in a note verbale 
dated 17 December 2008, brought Council resolution 7/30 to the attention of all Governments, 
including those that are members of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied

People. The resolution was also transmitted to all the specialized agencies, competent regional 
intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations.

<p>3. In a note verbale dated 13 January 2009 addressed to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Permanent Mission of Egypt to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva stressed that Egypt regarded the Syrian Golan as an occupied 
territory, in violation of international law. It did not recognize the annexation of the Golan by 
Israel or any other Israeli administrative decision to impose Israeli identity on the residents of the 
Golan. Egypt also denounced the policy of confiscating the land of Syrian citizens and the 
construction of Israeli settlements, which it stressed were illegal. Egypt reaffirmed the right of 
Syrian citizens to freedom of movement, as well as their right to receive medical treatment and 
to education. Lastly, it demanded that the occupying Power release all Syrian detainees and 
captives held in Israeli jails. 
</p><p>4. In a note verbale dated 27 January 2009, the Permanent Mission of South Africa to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva informed OHCHR that South Africa believed that the 
occupation by Israel of the Golan Heights was inconsistent with, and in contravention of, the 
basic principles of international law. The Government of South Africa stressed that the 
occupation of the Golan Heights was illegal in terms of international law and could not be 
justified. Lastly, it indicated that it would continue to support the resolutions of the 
General Assembly and Council calling on Israel to end its illegal occupation of the Syrian Golan.
