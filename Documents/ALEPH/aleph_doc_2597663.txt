Actinogen Medical Limited 
2016 Shareholders’ Annual Report 
Message from the Chairman 
 
Dear Shareholder, 
 
It is a great pleasure on behalf of the Board to present the 2016 Actinogen Medical Annual Report. This year’s 
many  achievements  are  the  result  of  careful  and  prudent  long-term  strategic  planning  and  our  strong 
commitment  to  bring  our  distinctive  novel  drug  Xanamem™  to  market  with  a  commercial  focus  on  treating 
Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
Xanamem™ represents a new approach to treating Alzheimer’s disease  – a condition with a significant unmet 
medical  need  that  threatens  to  place  a  huge  burden  on  society.  Xanamem  works  by  blocking  the 
development  and  regeneration  of  cortisol  –  the  “stress  hormone”  –  which  appears  to  contribute  to  the 
cognitive impairment, amyloid plaques and neural death, that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
Alzheimer’s disease  is one of the nation’s largest public health crises and has a debilitating effect on  patients 
and their loved ones. Currently, Alzheimer’s is the second-leading cause of death in Australia according to the 
ABS,  and sixth-leading cause of death in the United States.  As baby boomers reach the age of greater risk of 
Alzheimer’s,  it  can  be  expected  that  –  barring  a  treatment  breakthrough  –  millions  of  people  will  spend  their 
retirement years living with Alzheimer’s, or caring for a loved one that has the disease.  
 
There are four different drugs on the market that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s to some degree. However, 
there are currently no drugs that can significantly alter the course of the disease and one is badly needed. With 
the development of Xanamem™, we are hopeful of finding an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease in its 
earlier stages, when patients first start to demonstrate early symptoms of the disease.  
 
I  am  pleased  to  report  that  in  the  2016  financial  year  Xanamem™  Phase  I  clinical  trial  was  successfully 
completed with positive results. The results confirm, amongst others,  that Xanamem™ crosses  the blood-brain-
barrier and is effectively delivered to the brain, its primary site of action in Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
These  results  are  particularly  encouraging  as  they  confirm  that  following  oral  administration,  Xanamem™, 
reaches the brain in concentrations that are predicted to very effectively inhibit the 11beta-HSD1 enzyme in the 
brain. This enzyme activates cortisol in the brain. 
 
These  results  followed  on  from  the  earlier  Phase  I  results  that  demonstrated  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
Xanamem™, even at the highest dose of 35mg twice daily. These data will be used to define the optimum daily 
dose for Xanamem™ to take forward into the Phase II clinical trial. The total participants in Phase I studies was 
n=88. 
 
The unique mechanism of action around cortisol inhibition and the validation that the drug clinically crosses the 
blood-brain-barrier gives us great confidence as we advance into the next stages of development. 
 
This year, good progress has also been made towards securing final US FDA approval under an Investigational 
New  Drug  (IND)  for  the  Phase  II  study.  After  agreement  with  the  US  FDA,  the  enhanced  protocol  will  be 
harmonised with both Australian and UK regulators and hospital sites, with patients expected to be enrolled in 
the second half of 2016. 
 
Importantly,  a  US-focused  study  and  protocol  design  will  allow  for  a  broader  value  creation,  as  the  US  is  the 
largest market for Alzheimer’s drugs. Since initiating the trial the relevance of this phase II trial and its design has 
increased, given the changing competitive and regulatory landscape in Alzheimer’s drugs in development. 
 
As part of the US-focused strategy, in July 2016 we presented our positive Xanamem™ results at the Alzheimer’s 
Association International Conference  (AAIC), the world’s largest  Alzheimer’s Dementia meeting. In a separate 
study  also  presented  at  the  same  conference,  the  Australian  Imaging,  Biomarker  &  Lifestyle  Flagship  Study  of 
Ageing  (AIBL),  sponsored  by  the  CSIRO  and  a  number  of  Australian  universities,  showed  a  clear  correlation 
between  elevated  cortisol  in  the  blood  of  a  healthy  aged  population  and  the  subsequent  development  of

CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Alzheimer's disease in these individuals. When individuals also evidenced o brood buildup of beta-amyloia
plaques In the brain, their chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease increased even further. The AIEL study
(n:4l6l concluded that targeting ways to lower excess cortisol should be undertaken in battling Alzheimer's
disease in the elderly.
We plan on publishing these results in peer-reviewed medical journals over the second half of 2016. This is an
important part of communicating results of promising new therapies such as ><onomemTM to the wider medical
and scientiﬁc community, globally.
Concurrent to initiating the Alzheimer's Phase ll study, Actinogen Medical is evaluating additional clinical
indications for XanamemWI that are evident through the underlying mechanism of action (inhibition of cortisol
production]. These include a number of commercially promising new indications such as cognitive decline in
type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease dementia and potentially even post-myocardial infarction.
During the year I was present at a number of meetings between the Company's senior management and
pharmaceutical companies with existing or potential interest in the Alzheimer's dementia market. The genuine
interest in our XanamemTM program from multiple parties was encouraging, We have every reason to be
confident that good progress with the current trial should result in a competitive and rewarding partnering
process during, or on the completion of, this study,
We have a world class management team and clinical advisors headed by Dr Bill Ketelbey. Together, they lead
a team at hardworking, highly experienced and dedicated staff who have a clear sense of purpose and are
guided by a Clear set of values - to help drive the commercialisation of research behind Xanamemw for those
suffering from the dreaded disease of Alzheimer's dementia.
On your behalf, i thank all of our team and thank you for your continued support as investors behind this
exciting venture.

_____________________________________________________________ 
 
This Corporate Governance Statement (“Statement”) outlines the key aspects of Actinogen Medical 
Limited’s  (‘Actinogen  Medical’  or  ‘the  Company’  or  “ACW”)  governance  framework  and  main 
governance  practices.    The  Company’s  charters,  policies,  and  procedures  are  regularly  reviewed 
and updated to comply with law and best practice. These charters and policies can be viewed on 
Actinogen Medical’s website located at www.actinogen.com.au. 
 
This  Statement  is  structured  with  reference  to  the  Australian  Securities  Exchange  Corporate 
Governance  Council’s  (“the  Council’s”)  “Principles  of  Good  Corporate  Governance  and  Best 
Practice Recommendations 3rd Edition” (“the Recommendations”). 
 
The Board of Directors has adopted the Recommendations to the extent that is deemed appropriate 
considering  current  the  size  and  operations  of  the  Company.    Therefore,  considering  the  size  and 
financial  position  of  the  Company,  where  the  Board  considers  that  the  cost  of  implementing  a 
recommendation  outweighs  any  potential  benefits,  those  recommendations  have  not  been 
adopted.  
 
This Statement was approved by the Board of Directors and is current as at 26 August 2016. 
 
Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight 
 
Roles of the Board & Management  
 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  evaluating  and  setting  the  strategic  direction  for  the  Company,

and approval of their remuneration;
•  Determining,  in  conjunction  with  management,  corporate  strategy,  objectives,  operations, 
plans and approving and appropriately monitoring plans, new investments, major capital and

•  Satisfying itself that the financial statements of the Company fairly and accurately set out the
financial position and financial performance of the Company for the period under review;

Board  that  proper  operational,  financial,  compliance,  risk  management  and  internal  control 
processes are in place and functioning appropriately;
•  Ensuring  that  appropriate  internal  and  external  audit  arrangements  are  in  place  and

_____________________________________________________________
•  Ensuring that the Company acts legally and responsibly on  all matters and assuring itself that 
the  Company  has  adopted,  and  that  its  practice  is  consistent  with,  a  number  of  guidelines 
including:
−  Code of Conduct;  
−  Continuous Disclosure Policy;  
−  Diversity Policy;  
−  Performance Evaluation Policy; 
−  Procedures for Selection and Appointment of Directors; 
−  Remuneration Policy;  
−  Risk Management and Internal Compliance and Control Policy.  
−  Securities Trading Policy; and 
−  Shareholder Communications Policy.
Subject  to  the  specific  authorities  reserved  to  the  Board  under  the  Board  Charter,  the  Board  has 
delegated to the Managing Director responsibility for the management and operation of Actinogen 
Medical.  The Managing Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations, financial performance 
and  administration  of  Actinogen  Medical  within  the  powers  authorised  to  him  from  time-to-time  by 
the Board.  The Managing Director may make further delegation within the delegations specified by 
the  Board  and  is  accountable  to  the  Board  for  the  exercise  of  those  delegated  powers.  Further 
details  of  Board  responsibilities,  objectives  and  structure  are  set  out  in  the  Board  Charter  on  the 
Actinogen Medical Website. 
 
Board Committees 
 
The Board considers that the Company is not currently of a size, nor are its affairs of such complexity 
to  justify  the  formation  of  separate  committees  at  this  time,  including  audit,  risk,  remuneration  or 
nomination  committees,  preferring  at  this  stage  of  the  Company’s  development,  to  manage  the 
Company  through  the  full  Board  of  Directors.  The  Board  assumes  the  responsibilities  normally 
delegated to the Audit, Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. If the Company’s activities 
increase, in size, scope and nature, the appointment of separate committees will be reviewed by the 
Board and implemented if appropriate. 
 
Board Appointments  
 
The Company undertakes comprehensive reference checks prior to appointing a director, or putting 
that person forward as a candidate to ensure that person is competent, experienced, and would not 
be  impaired  in  any  way  from  undertaking  the  duties  of  director.  The  Company  provides  relevant 
information  to  shareholders  for  their  consideration  about  the  attributes  of  candidates  together  with 
whether the Board supports the appointment or re-election. 
 
The terms of the appointment of a non-executive director, executive directors and senior executives 
are agreed upon and set out in writing at the time of appointment.  
 
The Company Secretary 
 
The Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chairman, on all matters 
to  do  with  the  proper  functioning  of  the  Board,  including  agendas,  Board  papers  and  minutes, 
advising the Board and its Committees (as applicable) on governance matters, monitoring that the 
Board and Committee policies and procedures are followed, communication with regulatory bodies 
and the ASX and statutory and other filings. 
 
Diversity 
 
The Company has adopted a formal Diversity Policy and is committed to workplace diversity, with a 
particular focus on supporting the representation of women at the senior level of the Company and 
on the Company Board.

_____________________________________________________________ 
 
The Company is currently in an early stage of its development and given that it currently has a limited 
number  of  employees,  the  application  of  measurable  objectives  in  relation  to  gender  diversity,  at 
various levels of the Company’s business, is not considered to be appropriate nor practical. 
 
The  Board  will  review  this  position  on  an  annual  basis  and  will  implement  measurable  objectives  as 
and when they deem the Company to require them. 
 
The proportion of women in the Company as at 31 August 2016 is as follows:
  Women on the board: 0 of 4 (0%) 
  Women in senior executive positions: 0 of 2 (0%)  
  Women in the organisation: 4 of 10 (40%)
The Company’s Diversity Policy is available on its website. 
 
Board & Management Performance Review 
 
On an annual basis, the Board conducts a review of its structure, composition and performance 
 
The annual review includes consideration of the following measures:
  comparing the performance of the Board against the requirements of its Charter; 
  assessing  the  performance  of  the  Board  over  the  previous  12  months  having  regard  to  the
corporate strategies, operating plans and the annual budget; 
reviewing the Board’s interaction with management; 
reviewing the type and timing of information provided to the Board by management; 
reviewing management’s performance in assisting the Board to meet its objectives; and 
identifying any necessary or desirable improvements to the Board Charter.
 
 
 

The method and scope of the performance evaluation will be set by the Board and may include a 
Board  self-assessment  checklist  to  be  completed  by  each  Director.    The  Board  may  also  use  an 
independent adviser to assist in the review. 
 
The  Chairman  has  primary  responsibility  for  conducting  performance  appraisals  of  Non-Executive 
Directors, in conjunction with them, having particular regard to:
  contribution to Board discussion and function; 
  degree of independence including relevance of any conflicts of interest; 
  availability for and attendance at Board meetings and other relevant events; 
  contribution to Company strategy; 
  membership of and contribution to any Board committees; and 

suitability to Board structure and composition.
The  Board  conducts  an  annual  performance  assessment  of  the  Managing  Director  against  agreed 
key performance indicators. Board and management performance reviews were conducted during 
the financial year in accordance with the above processes. 
 
Independent Advice  
 
Directors have a right of access to all Company information and executives.  Directors are entitled, in 
fulfilling  their  duties  and  responsibilities,  to  obtain  independent  professional  advice  on  any  matter 
connected with the discharge of their responsibilities, with prior notice to the Chairman, at Actinogen 
Medical’s expense. 
 
Principle 2: Structure the board to add value 
 
Board Composition  
 
During the financial year and to the date of this report the Board was comprised of the following 
members:
6
Chairman (appointed 1 December 2014); 
Managing Director (appointed 18 December 2014); 
Non-Executive Director (appointed 1 December 2014) 
Non-Executive Director (appointed 16 December 2013)

_____________________________________________________________ 
 
Mr Martin Rogers 
Dr Bill Ketelbey 
Dr Jason Loveridge 
Dr Anton Uvarov 
 
The  Board  consisted  of  two  Executive  Directors  until  5  July  2016,  when  the  executive  Chairman,  Mr 
Martin Rogers, reverted to Non-Executive Chairman role. The Company currently has one executive 
Director, the Managing Director, and three Non-Executive Directors. 
 
Actinogen  Medical  has  adopted  a  definition  of  'independence'  for  Directors  that  is  consistent  with 
the Recommendations. 
 
The Company’s Chairman, Mr Martin Rogers, is not an independent director by virtue of the fact that 
he  is  a  substantial  shareholder  and  that  he  was  Executive  Chairman  until  5  July  2016.    The  Board 
values  the  insight  and  advice  provided  by  Mr  Rogers  and  considers  that  the  materiality  of  his 
relationship is such that it does not interfere with his capacity to bring an independent judgement on 
issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of Actinogen Medical and its security holders 
generally. 
 
The Board does not currently consist of a majority of independent directors.  Dr Jason Loveridge and 
Dr Anton Uvarov are the only current directors considered to be independent.  Given the size of the 
Board  and  the  nature  and  scale  of  the  Company’s  current  operations  the  Board  believes  the 
presence of two independent directors on the Board is sufficient. 
 
Board Selection Process 
 
The  Board  considers  that  a  diverse  range  of  skills,  backgrounds,  knowledge  and  experience  is 
required  in  order  to  effectively  govern  Actinogen  Medical.    The  Board  believes  that  orderly 
succession  and  renewal  contributes  to  strong  corporate  governance  and  is  achieved  by  careful 
planning and continual review.  
 
The Board is responsible for the nomination and selection of directors.  The Board reviews the size and 
composition of the Board regularly and at least once a year as part of the Board evaluation process.  
The Board has a skills matrix covering the competencies and experience of each member.  When the 
need for a new director is identified, the required experience and competencies of the new director 
are defined in the context of this matrix and any gaps that may exist. 
 
Generally  a  list  of  potential  candidates  is  identified  based  on  these  skills  required  and  other  issues 
such  as  geographic  location  and  diversity  criteria.    Candidates  are  assessed  against  the  required 
skills  and  on  their  qualifications,  backgrounds  and  personal  qualities.    In  addition,  candidates  are 
sought  who  have  a  proven  track  record  in  creating  security  holder  value  and  the  required  time  to 
commit to the position. 
 
Induction of New Directors and Ongoing Development 
 
New  Directors  are  issued  with  a  formal  Letter  of  Appointment  that  sets  out  the  key  terms  and 
conditions  of  their  appointment,  including  Director's  duties,  rights  and  responsibilities,  the  time 
commitment  envisaged,  and  the  Board's  expectations  regarding  involvement  with  any  Committee 
work.  
 
An  induction  program  is  in  place  and  new  Directors  are  encouraged  to  engage  in  professional 
development  activities  to  develop  and  maintain  the  skills  and  knowledge  needed  to  perform  their 
role as Directors effectively.

_____________________________________________________________ 
 
Principle 3: Act ethically and responsibly 
 
The  Company  has  implemented  a  Code  of  Conduct,  which  provides  guidelines  aimed  at 
maintaining high ethical standards, corporate behaviour and accountability within the Company. 
 
All employees and Directors are expected to:
respect the law and act in accordance with it;
respect confidentiality and not misuse Company information, assets or facilities;
 
  maintain high levels of professional conduct; 
 
  avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest; 
  act in the best interests of shareholders; 
  by  their  actions  contribute  to  the  Company’s  reputation  as  a  good  corporate  citizen  which
seeks the respect of the community and environment in which it operates;
  perform  their  duties  in  ways  that  minimise  environmental  impacts  and  maximise  workplace
safety;
  exercise  fairness,  courtesy,  respect,  consideration  and  sensitivity  in  all  dealings  within  their
workplace and with customers, suppliers and the public generally; and
  act with honesty, integrity, decency and responsibility at all times.
An  employee  that  breaches  the  Code  of  Conduct  may  face  disciplinary  action  including,  in  the 
cases of serious breaches, dismissal.  If an employee suspects that a breach of the Code of Conduct 
has  occurred  or  will  occur,  he  or  she  must  report  that  breach  to  the  Company  Secretary.    No 
employee will be disadvantaged or prejudiced if he or she reports in good faith a suspected breach.  
All reports will be acted upon and kept confidential. 
 
Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting 
 
The Board as a whole fulfills the functions normally delegated to the Audit Committee as detailed in 
the Audit Committee Charter.  
 
The Board is responsible for the initial appointment of the external auditor and the appointment of a 
new external auditor when any vacancy arises.  Candidates for the position of external auditor must 
demonstrate  complete  independence  from  the  Company  through  the  engagement  period.    The 
Board may otherwise select an external auditor based on criteria relevant to the Company’s business 
and circumstances.  The performance of the external auditor is reviewed on an annual basis by the 
Board.  
 
The Board receives regular reports from management and from external auditors.  It also meets with 
the external auditors as and when required. 
 
The external auditors attend  Actinogen Medical's  AGM  and are available to answer questions from 
security holders relevant to the audit. 
 
Prior  approval  of  the  Board  must  be  gained  for  non-audit  work  to  be  performed  by  the  external 
auditor.    There  are  qualitative  limits  on  this  non-audit  work  to  ensure  that  the  independence  of  the 
auditor is maintained.  
 
There is also a requirement that the audit partner responsible for the audit not perform in that role for 
more than five years. 
 
CEO Certifications 
 
The  Board  has  received  certifications  from  the  CEO  in  connection  with  the  financial  statements  for 
the Actinogen Medical for the Reporting Period.  The Company does not currently have a CFO.  The 
certifications  state  that  the  declaration  provided  in  accordance  with  Section  295A  of  the 
Corporations  Act as to the integrity of the financial statements is founded on a sound system of risk 
management and internal control which is operating effectively.

Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure 
 
The  Company  has  a  Continuos  Disclosure  Policy  which  outlines  the  disclosure  obligations  of  the 
Company  as  required  under  the  ASX  Listing  Rules  and  Corporations  Act.    The  policy  is  designed  to 
ensure  that  procedures  are  in  place  so  that  the  market  is  properly  informed  of  matters  which  may 
have a material impact on the price at which Company securities are traded.   
 
The Board considers whether there are any matters requiring disclosure in respect of each and every 
item of business that it considers in its meetings.  Individual Directors are required to make such a 
consideration when they become aware of any information in the course of their duties as a Director 
of the Company. 
 
The  Company  is  committed  to  ensuring  all  investors  have  equal  and  timely  access  to  material 
information concerning the Company. 
 
The Board has designated the Company Secretary as the person responsible for communicating with 
the ASX.  The Chairman, Managing Director and the Company Secretary are responsible for ensuring 
that:
a)  Company  announcements  are  made  in  a  timely  manner,  that  announcements  are  factual 
and do not omit any material information required to be disclosed under the ASX Listing Rules 
and Corporations Act; and
b)  Company  announcements  are  expressed  in  a  clear  and  objective  manner  that  allows
investors to assess the impact of the information when making investment decisions.
Principle 6: Respect the rights of security holders 
 
The Company recognizes the value of providing current and relevant information to its shareholders. 
 
The Company respects the rights of its shareholders and to facilitate the effective exercise  of those 
rights the Company is committed to:
•  communicating  effectively  with  shareholders  through  releases  to  the  market  via  ASX,  the 
company website, information emailed or mailed to shareholders and the general meetings of 
the Company;
•  giving  shareholders  ready  access  to  clear  and  understandable  information  about  the
Company; and

Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk 
 
The  Board  is  committed  to  the  identification,  assessment  and  management  of  risk  throughout 
Actinogen Medical's business activities. 
 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  oversight  of  the  Company’s  risk  management  and  internal 
compliance and control framework.  Responsibility for control and risk management is delegated to 
the  appropriate  level  of  management  within  the  Company  with  the  Managing  Director  having 
ultimate  responsibility  to  the  Board  for  the  risk  management  and  internal  compliance  and  control 
framework.    Actinogen  Medical  has  established  policies  for  the  oversight  and  management  of 
material business risks.  
 
Actinogen Medical's Risk Management and Internal Compliance and Control Policy recognises that 
risk  management  is  an  essential  element  of  good  corporate  governance  and  fundamental  in 
achieving  its  strategic  and  operational  objectives.    Risk  management  improves  decision  making, 
defines opportunities and mitigates material events that may impact security holder value. 
 
Actinogen  Medical  believes  that  explicit  and  effective  risk  management  is  a  source  of  insight  and 
competitive advantage.  To this end, Actinogen Medical is committed to the ongoing development 
of  a  strategic  and  consistent  enterprise  wide  risk  management  program,  underpinned  by  a  risk 
conscious culture. 
 
Actinogen  Medical  accepts  that  risk  is  a  part  of  doing  business.    Therefore,  the  Company’s  Risk 
Management  and  Internal  Compliance  and  Control  Policy  is  not  designed  to  promote  risk 
avoidance.    Rather  Actinogen  Medical's  approach  is  to  create  a  risk  conscious  culture  that 
encourages the systematic identification, management and control of risks whilst ensuring we do not 
enter into unnecessary risks or enter into risks unknowingly. 
 
Actinogen Medical assesses its risks on a residual basis; that is it evaluates the level of risk remaining 
and considering all the mitigation practices and controls.  Depending on the materiality of the risks, 
Actinogen Medical applies varying levels of management plans. 
 
The  Board  has  required  management  to  design  and  implement  a  risk  management  and  internal 
compliance  and  control  system  to  manage  Actinogen  Medical's  material  business  risks.   It  receives 
regular reports on specific business areas where there may exist significant business  risk or exposure.  
The  Company  faces  risks  inherent  to  its  business,  including  economic  risks,  which  may  materially 
impact the Company’s ability to create or preserve value for security holders over the short, medium 
or  long  term.    The  Company  has  in  place  policies  and  procedures,  including  a  risk  management 
framework (as described in the Company’s Risk Management and Internal Compliance and Control 
Policy), which is developed and updated to help manage these risks.  The Board does not consider 
that the Company currently has any material exposure to environmental or social sustainability risks 
 
The Company’s process of risk management and internal compliance and control includes:


identifying  and  measuring  risks  that  might  impact  upon  the  achievement  of  the  Company’s 
goals  and  objectives,  and  monitoring  the  environment  for  emerging  factors  and  trends  that 
affect those risks. 
formulating  risk  management  strategies  to  manage  identified  risks,  and  designing  and 
implementing appropriate risk management policies and internal controls.
  monitoring  the  performance  of,  and  improving  the  effectiveness  of,  risk  management  systems 
and  internal compliance  and  controls,  including  regular  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  risk 
management and internal compliance and control.
The  Board  review’s  the  Company’s  risk  management  framework  at  least  annually  to  ensure  that  it 
continues  to  effectively  manage  risk.  Management  reports  to  the  Board  as  to  the  effectiveness  of 
Actinogen Medical's management of its material business risks at each meeting.

Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly 
 
Actinogen Medical’s Remuneration  Policy was designed to recognise  the competitive environment 
within which Actinogen Medical operates and also emphasise the requirement to attract and retain 
high caliber talent in order to achieve sustained improvement in Actinogen Medical’s performance.  
The  overriding  objective  of  the  Remuneration  Policy  is  to  ensure  that  an  individual’s  remuneration 
package accurately reflects their experience, level of responsibility, individual performance and the 
performance of Actinogen Medical.   
 
The key principles are to:
link executive reward with strategic goals and sustainable performance of Actinogen Medical; 
 
  apply  challenging  corporate  and  individual  key  performance  indicators  that  focus  on  both
short-term and long-term outcomes;
  motivate and recognise superior performers with fair, consistent and competitive rewards; 
 

remunerate fairly and competitively in order to attract and retain top talent; 
recognise  capabilities  and  promote  opportunities  for  career  and  professional  development; 
and 
through  employee  ownership  of  Actinogen  Medical  shares,  foster  a  partnership  between 
employees and other security holders.

The  Board  determines  the  Company’s  remuneration  policies  and  practices  and  assesses  the 
necessary  and  desirable  competencies  of  Board  members.    The  Board  is  responsible  for  evaluating 
Board  performance, 
reviewing  Board  and  management  succession  plans  and  determines 
remuneration packages for the CEO, Non-Executive Directors and senior management based on an 
annual review. 
 
Actinogen  Medical’s  executive  remuneration  policies  and  structures  and  details  of  remuneration 
paid to directors and senior managers are set out in the Remuneration Report. 
 
Non-Executive Directors receive fees (including statutory superannuation where applicable) for their 
services, the reimbursement of reasonable expenses and, in certain circumstances options.  They do 
not receive any termination or retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation. 
 
The  maximum  aggregate  remuneration  approved  by  shareholders  for  Non-Executive  Directors  is 
$500,000  per  annum.    The  Directors  set  the  individual  Non-Executive  Directors  fees  within  the  limit 
approved by shareholders. 
 
The total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors during the reporting period were $108,339. 
 
Executive  directors  and  other  senior  executives  are  remunerated  using  combinations  of  fixed  and 
performance  based  remuneration.    Fees  and  salaries  are  set  at  levels  reflecting  market  rates  and 
performance based remuneration is linked directly to specific performance targets that are aligned to 
both short and long term objectives.  
 
In accordance with the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, participants in an equity based incentive 
scheme  are  prohibited  from  entering  into  any  transaction  that  would  have  the  effect  of  hedging  or 
otherwise  transferring  the  risk  of  any  fluctuation  in  the  value  of  any  unvested  entitlement  in  the 
Company’s securities to any other person.  
 
Further  details  in  relation  to  the  company’s  remuneration  policies  are  contained in the  Remuneration 
Report, within the Directors’ report.

Investor Relations
This  past  year  has  been  particularly  productive  for  Actinogen  Medical,  focussed  on  setting  the 
business  up  to  take  on  the full  development  of  XanamemTM  in  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  other  major 
indications,  with  the  expectation  of  major  commercial  Big  Pharma  partnerships  within  the  next  few 
years.

ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T  
_____________________________________________________________
(i)  XanADu – Phase 2 trial in mild Alzheimer’s disease
Over  2015,  all  the  required  clinical,  pre-clinical  and  safety  trials  were  successfully  completed  for 
XanamemTM, in preparation for initiating XanADu, the Phase 2 trial in mild Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”). 
A second Phase 1 trial with 40 participants was successfully completed at the Linear Institute in Perth. 
This was a multiple ascending dose study that included a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic sub-
study  of  24  participants,  a  fed/fasted  sub-study  of  12  participants  and  a  central  nervous  system 
(“CNS”) pharmacokinetic sub-study of 4 participants. The studies confirmed the safety and tolerability 
of XanamemTM and the ADME profile of the drug, including that XanamemTM was efficiently delivered 
to the brain in concentrations adequate to inhibit the 11BHSD1 enzyme in the brain, its primary site of 
action.  
 
Additionally we completed a rodent toxicology and toxicokinetic study in Melbourne, and undertook 
an extensive array of laboratory based safety and drug interaction studies in the UK and Europe. We 
also  commissioned  the  manufacturing  of  XanamemTM  active  in  the  UK  and  encapsulation,  and 
stability and quality testing of the final product in Australia.  
 
Data from all these trials helped confirm the optimum dose for  XanamemTM in the XanADu trial, and 
importantly  confirmed  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  XanamemTM  even  at  the  highest  does  of  35mg 
twice daily. 
 
With  the  completion  of  all  the  necessary  preliminary  research,  and  the  protocol  and  supportive 
regulatory  and  ethical  documentation,  everything  is  well  on  track  to  recruit  the  first  patients  in  the 
second  half  of  the  2016  calendar  year.  The  study  is  expected  to  read  out  in  2018.  As  XanADu  is  a 
double blind placebo controlled randomised study, no results will be known until the trial completes 
in 2018. 
 
The  XanADu  study  is  particularly  notable  through  design  elements  that  place  it  at  the  forefront  of 
Alzheimer’s  research.  For  example:  ADCOMS  is  the  latest,  and  most  sensitive  measurement  tool  for 
assessing  cognitive  ability  in  very  early  Alzheimer’s  disease.  It  has  been  developed  by  a  global 
collaboration  of  Alzheimer’s  researcher  specialists,  medical  regulators  and  pharmaceutical  industry 
experts,  under  the  direction  of  the  FDA  and  NIH  in  the  US  and  EMEA  in  Europe.  The  results  of  this 
collaboration have recently been published (Wang J, et al. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2016;0:1–7.) 
Most significantly for XanADu, ADCOMS has been incorporated into the panel of assessment tools for 
the  study.  In  fact,  ADCOMS  is  included  as  a  co-primary  endpoint,  along  with  ADAS-Cog,  making 
XanADu only the second clinical trial in the world to use ADCOMS for endpoint assessment. We can 
comfortably claim that XanADu is at the cutting edge of Alzheimer’s clinical research! 
 
A  further  significant  design  feature  is  the  CSF  sub-study  that  will  be  run  on  a  cohort  of  the  XanADu 
patients  to  ascertain  whether  we  are  able  to  replicate  the  amyloid  plaque  clearance  seen  in  the 
animal studies. If we can demonstrate that amyloid and tau proteins are mobilised from the human 
brain by XanamemTM, we will have shown the potential for XanamemTM to be both a disease modifier 
as well as a symptomatic AD therapy. Successful disease modification of AD is seen as the optimum 
goal for any AD therapy, and to date no treatment has demonstrated such an outcome. 
 
We look forward to announcing recruitment of the first patients in the next few months and updating 
investors of the progress of XanADu over the next couple of years.
(ii)  XanamemTM Pipeline
While the link between excess cortisol and metabolic and endocrine diseases has been known about 
for many years,  the association  with diseases of the central nervous system has only been relatively 
recently  recognised.  Excess  cortisol  has  been  shown  to  cause  neurodegenerative  damage  to  the 
hippocampus, the area of the brain central to recent memory formation and retention. Decreasing 
this  excess  cortisol  to  a  more  normal  level  has  been  shown  to  prevent  and  even  reverse  this 
neurodegenerative  damage.  This  principle  led  to  the  development  of  XanamemTM  as  a  potential 
therapy for Alzheimer’s disease.

is  the  potential
ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T  
_____________________________________________________________ 
 
for  XanamemTM  to  benefit  a  number  of  other 
Equally,  however,  there 
neurodegenerative  diseases  associated  with  elevated  cortisol.  Strategically  we  have  elected  to 
target  two  key  diseases  –  the  cognitive  decline  associated  with  Diabetes  and  Parkinson’s  disease 
dementia.  While Alzheimer’s disease is the primary development priority, these two other indications 
are  being  developed  in  parallel  and  will  provide  a  very  significant  pipeline  of  indications  in  the 
development of XanamemTM 
 
Both  diseases  present  substantial  unmet  clinical  need,  and  both  represent  sizable  addressable 
markets - XanamemTM s potential peak annual sales in these three markets alone are estimated to be 
>$6bn.  We expect The  Alzheimer’s XanADu study to start recruiting patients in 2H2016, the Diabetes 
study in 1H2017 and Parkinson’s disease, later in 2017.  
 
(iii)  Regulatory and Research outsourced contracts – ERA Consulting and ICON Clinical Research
Early  on  it  was  recognised  that  the  key  support  functions  for  any  drug  development  program, 
research operations and regulatory affairs, would need to be outsourced. To that end we contracted 
ICON  Clinical  Research  (ICON)  as  our  CRO  (Clinical  Research  Organisation)  and  ERA  Consulting 
(ERA) as our Regulatory Affairs partners. 
 
ERA  initially  undertook  an  extensive  Gap  Analysis  to  identify  any  clear  gaps  in  our  research  data 
package  pending  submission  to  the  various  regulatory  bodies  for  approval  to  initiate  our  various 
clinical studies. ERA have since authored and compiled the extensive documentation necessary for 
the various regulatory submissions. 
 
ICON,  with  its  global  research  resources,  is  managing  the  planning,  deployment  and  operations  of 
XanADu, our Phase 2 trial in mild Alzheimer’s disease. Following Actinogen’s successful drafting of the 
research protocol, with the extensive input for the XanamemTM Clinical Advisory Board, it was passed 
on to ICON for final drafting and operational enactment. ICON is currently identifying and recruiting 
appropriate research sites in Australia, the UK and USA to run the trial, and ensuring all the necessary 
ethical, regulatory and logistical details are in place, prior to the first patients being recruited to the 
trail later this year. 
 
(iv)  Manufacturing
The  manufacture of  XanamemTM  active was contracted to High Force in the UK, ensuring we have 
adequate supplies for a number of clinical studies, including XanADu.  A  portion  of this  XanamemTM 
active has since been formulated and encapsulated for the XanADu study, along with a matching 
placebo, by a contract manufacturer in Australia.  
 
(v)
IP review and patent approvals
We  continue  to  solidify  our  IP  protection  of  XanamemTM,  with  the  granting  of  our  most  definitive 
patent, Webster-7, in a number of key jurisdictions including the EU, USA, Australia, Japan and China. 
This patent provides comprehensive composition of matter patent protection out to 2031. Trademark 
protection for XanamemTM has been applied for, and granted in most key geographies. 
 
(vi)  Resources
A  resource  review  defined  the  internal  resources  necessary  to  support  our  research  and  business 
development initiatives, resulting in the recruitment of 3 additional heads over the year  –  A Strategy 
and  Business  Development  Director,  a  Clinical  Research  Manager  and  a  Clinical  Trials  Associate. 
Strategically,  however,  Actinogen  will  continue  to  outsource  all  specialist  research  and  regulatory 
functions  as  the  predominant  business  model  to  ensure  our  lean  agility  and  to  retain  the  ability  to 
selectively access resources on an as-needs basis.

(vii)  Operations
On  1 July 2015,  Actinogen Medical moved  to new offices  on  Pitt St in the Sydney CBD, allowing for 
adequate  expansion  and  growth  of  the  business  over  the  next  three  years.  We  are  now  fully 
operational and resourced. 
 
We  moved  our  investor  registry  services  to  Link  Market  Services,  to  enhance  the  efficacy  and 
effectiveness  of  the  service  we  are  able  to  provide  to  our  shareholders.  We  trust  that  a  noticeable 
improvement in shareholder interaction has been experienced.  
 
(viii) Budget, cash-flow and R&D rebate
Our  cash-flow  and  budget  projections  for  the  financial  year  confirmed  that  we  expect  to  have 
adequate capital to fund the Phase 2 Alzheimer’s disease program through  into 2018. These budget 
projections  include  the  expected  Commonwealth  Government  R&D  tax  rebates  for  the  2016  and 
2017 financial years. On 8 June 2016 we announced the harmonisation of the XanADu protocol. This 
may require an upward revision  of the trial budget and announcements in this regard will made at 
the appropriate time.  
 
ACW  has  been  approved  for  the  R&D  tax  rebate  for  three  years,  with  the  first  rebate  of  $1.32m 
received in early 2016. We expect to receive the 2015/2016 rebate in September/October 2016, with 
the second and third rebates expected to be substantially larger than the first one. 
 
(ix)  Investor Relations
With ACW so relatively new to Alzheimer’s Research and Biotech Investors, significant resources have 
been  deployed  on  Investor  Relations initiatives,  to  ensure  we  achieve  appropriate  recognition  as  a 
mainstream  neuroscience biotech company.  To  this  end  multiple  investor  presentations  have  been 
given, a major symposium “Understanding Alzheimer’s” was hosted, our communications and social 
media infrastructure was upgraded and resourced, and 4 editions  of our Investor Newsletter issued. 
Additionally  research  was  initiated  by  Baker  Young  in  August  2015  with  the  publication  of  a 
comprehensive  report:  Actinogen  Medical  –  Best  Risk  vs  Reward  Play  in  Alzheimer’s  Dementia 
detailing  the  investment  opportunity  presented  by  ACW.  The  Company’s  target  share  price  was 
quoted at $0.35, on a current share price of around $0.075. An update report is due early in the new 
financial year. 
 
Going  forward  we  will  be  enhancing  these  Investor  Relations  initiatives  with  our  publications  and 
presentations  program  and  participating  aggressively  in  global  biotech  partnering  symposia  and 
meetings

FINANCIAL POSITION
9.
The financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2016 is as follows:
(a)  At the end of the prior year ended 30 June 2015, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents totalled $9,805,610. 
Since  then  the  Group  has  invested  $6,000,225  in  available-for-sale  listed  investments  comprising  securities 
from  major  banks  which  are  considered 
to 
cash.   Approximately  $2,000,000  of  these  investments  have  been  sold,  so  that  as  of  30  June  2016,  the 
balance  of  the  Group’s  investments  were  valued  at  $4,025,987.  The  Group  received  $98,638  in  dividends 
during the year from holding these investments and as at 30 June 2016 the Group recognised an unrealised 
gain  of  $22,272.  Refer  to  Financial  Statements,  Note  10:  Available-for-sale  Listed  Investments  for  further 
information.

Combining  the  $4,025,987  in  available-for-sale  listed  investments  with  the  $751,978  in  cash  and  cash 
equivalents  held  at  year  end,  equates  to  $4,777,965.  The  decrease  from  prior  year-end  balance  of 
$9,805,610  is  in  line  with  the  anticipated  working  capital  budgeted  spend  as  set  out  in  various 
announcements issued on the stock exchange during the financial year and previous financial year. Funds 
have been applied primarily to support the Phase 2 study of XanamemTM, and to support general working 
capital.
Post year-end the Company is due to receive up to approximately $2.6 million in other income which relates 
to the research and development rebate receivable recognjsed at year end.
(b)  Accumulated losses increased due to a significant level of spending on research and development related 
expenditure plus a prorated share-based payment expense was recognised based on loan shares granted 
to  Key  Management  Personnel  in  the  prior  year.  Although  an  overall increase in  accumulated  losses  from 
prior year, the movement was partly reduced by $2,605,395 which relates to the research and development 
tax rebate receivable recognised at year end.
10.  DIVIDENDS
No  amounts  have  been  paid  or  declared  by  way  of  dividend  since  the  date  of  incorporation.  The 
Directors recommend that no final dividend be paid. 
 
 
11.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
  On 23 February 2016, Corticrine Limited was deregistered and dissolved. Corticrine was entirely
dormant for the entire financial year up to its deregistration date.
Other  than  what  is  noted  above,  there  were  no  significant  changes  in  the  state  of  affairs  of  the 
Company during the year.

_____________________________________________________________
12.  EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
  On  7  July  2016,  1.7  million  options  with  an  exercise  price  of  $0.103  each,  exercisable  on  or 
before  7  July  2020  were  issued  to  employees  of  the  Company.  These  options  will  vest  on 
achieving  FDA  IND  approval  for  the  XanADu  trial,  and  for  achieving  the  first  patient  enrolled 
into the study in the US and Australia, and for achieving MHRA regulatory approval for the study 
in the UK, by the end of 2016; and
  On  7  July  2016,  Mr  Martin  Rogers  reverted  from  Executive  Chairman  to  Non-Executive
Chairman.
Other than what has been mentioned above, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end 
of  the  financial  year  which  significantly  affected  or  may  significantly  affect  the  operations  of  the 
Company, the results of those operations, or the state of the Company in subsequent financial years. 
 
 
13.  OUTLOOK & BUSINESS STRATEGY
The  year  ahead  for  ACW  is  focussed  on  achieving  solid  progress  with  XanADu  patient  recruitment, 
initiating  additional  XanamemTM  studies  in  the  pipeline  indications,  and  communicating  our 
impressive  research  findings  widely  in  the  research,  biotech  and  commercial  partner  communities. 
This will all happen against a backdrop of significantly increasing interest in Alzheimer’s disease as an 
investment opportunity. 
 
A recent JP Morgan investment report concluded that  “We see Alzheimer’s as representing one of 
the  most  attractive  potential  new  categories  in  Major  Pharma  &  Biotech  (>$10bn  in  peak  sales 
potential)”  and  “With  a  number  of  key  catalysts  anticipated  in  2016,  we  expect  investor  focus  on 
Alzheimer’s to increase throughout the year”. This optimism is driven by the significant advances in β-
Amyloid  research, but equally in biomarker and imaging research which allows us to diagnose and 
treat much earlier in the disease process. Of particular significance to ACW has been the  volume of 
recent research supporting excess cortisol and its association with the development and progression 
of Alzheimer’s disease.  
 
A  major frustration  with  Alzheimer’s research is not understanding the primary drivers of the disease. 
It’s clear that about 15% of Alzheimer’s has a genetic basis – the problem is the underlying cause of 
the  other  85% is  currently  unknown.  Over  the  years  dozens  of  theories  have  been  investigated  and 
disproven  and  it’s  becoming  clearer  that  no  one  single  cause  will  be  uncovered  –  it’s  likely  that 
Alzheimer’s  is  caused  by  a  number  of  underlying  factors,  and  that  treatment  will  equally  have  to 
utilise a combination of therapies. 
 
One of the most compelling recent discoveries is that elevated cortisol appears to be  linked to the 
development  and  progress  of  Alzheimer’s  disease.  This  cortisol  hypothesis  underpins  the  discovery 
and development of  XanamemTM  by the University of Edinburgh, and in the past  year a number of 
strongly  supportive  epidemiological  studies  have  been  published  that  provide  further  evidence 
confirming this cortisol hypothesis.  
 
Three  of  the  four  major  publications,  published  in  highly  prestigious  journals  (Geerlings  et  al  2015, 
Neurology;  Popp  et  all  2015,  Neurobiology  of  Aging;  Lehallier et  al  2015,  JAMA  Neurology),  provide 
impressively solid support. However, it’s the most recent paper that is still under review by Neurology, 
which  provides  the  most  compelling  supportive  evidence.  This  publication,  from  the  AIBL  Research 
Group  in  Australia  –  a  Research  Group  funded  by  various  Australian  government  agencies  and 
universities,  including  the  CSIRO,  concludes  with  “These  results  suggest  that  therapies  targeted 
toward  lowering  plasma  cortisol  and  β-Amyloid  levels  may  help  mitigate  cognitive  decline  in  the 
preclinical  phase  of  AD”.  Actinogen  Medical  could  not  have  asked  for  a  more  solid,  compelling 
endorsement of the work currently underway in developing XanamemTM for Alzheimer’s disease!

_____________________________________________________________ 
 
The XanaADu Phase 2 trial in mild Alzheimer’s disease is our flagship clinical development trial, as it’s 
the primary driver of the value of ACW. Having initiated XanADu earlier in 2016, the clear focus over 
the  next  2  years  is  on  patient  recruitment,  data  integrity  and  budget  management  –  the  speed, 
quality  and  cost  of  the  study.  Regulatory  and  ethical  approval,  and  patient  recruitment  in  all 
geographies, is expected within the second half of 2016, following the protocol harmonisation across 
the US, UK and  Australia. Importantly, a US focused study and protocol design will allow for broader 
value creation, as the US is the largest market for Alzheimer’s drugs.  
 
The phase II clinical trial initiation increases the attractiveness of XanamemTM as this novel approach 
to treating Alzheimer’s is backed by pre-clinical and clinical data strongly supporting the mechanism 
around the suppression of the “stress” hormone, cortisol. We remain on track for a 2018 data readout 
of  this  landmark  study.  We  will  continue  to  regularly  update  the  market  on  the  ongoing  clinical 
progress with XanamemTM. 
 
In tandem with the ongoing XanADu trial, we are also developing a pipeline of other indications for 
XanamemTM  that will value-add to  the product and spread the risk of focussing only on  Alzheimer’s 
disease.  
 
The  two  lead  indications  under  development  are  DCI  (diabetes  related  cognitive  impairment)  and 
PDD  (Parkinson’s  disease  dementia).  The  DCI  Phase  2  study  design  has  been  agreed  with  the 
research team and various non-dilutive funding sources are being investigated. We hope to have this 
study  initiated  before  the  end  of  the  year.  The  PDD  study  plans  are  under  evaluation,  with  the 
expectation  that  a  definitive  Phase  2  study  proposal  will  be  formulated  before  the  year  end,  with 
study  initiation  expected  in  2017.  These  two  indications  are  expected  to  add  a  50%  incremental 
value XanamemTM, if they prove out.  
 
The second major strategic priority is optimising the commercial opportunities presented through the 
XanamemTM  development  program.  This  will  evolve  through  the  development  of  our  Business 
Development  program.  Key  elements  of  this  initiative  will  involve  extensive  communication  of  our 
research to biotech and Big Pharma, and engaging with them in potential partnering discussions at 
the various global biotech partnering meetings such as JP Morgan, Bio-US, Bio-Europe BioEquity and 
AusBiotech. 
 
A  central  principle  behind  any  research  program  is  communicating  the  results  to  the  research, 
academic  and  medical  community,  so  the  findings  and  recommendations  can  be  factored  into 
future  medical  research  or  patient  management.  Importantly,  for  an  investor,  research  results  also 
provide  an  ongoing  objective  measure  of  the  potential  value  of  the  investment.  It’s  particularly 
pleasing therefore, that in the past year we have undertaken a raft of research that will generate at 
least one journal publication and a number of presentations at major international congresses.  
 
Over  the  second  half  of  2016  we  expect  to  publish  our  Phase  1  research  on  XanamemTM  and  to 
present at least four papers at major international congresses, including at the Alzheimer Association 
International  Conference  (AAIC)  in  Toronto  in  July,  the  International  Conference  of  Endocrinology 
(ICE) in Beijing in September, the International Symposium on Medicinal Chemistry (ISMC) in Lisbon in 
November  and  Clinical  Trials  in  Alzheimer  Disease  (CTAD)  in  San  Diego  in  December.  The  medical 
research and investor news-flow generated by these  data presentations  will be  substantial, and  will 
go a long way to cementing  Actinogen Medical as a major player in the  Alzheimer’s research and 
development  space.  We  expect  this  to  generate  a  significant  increase  in  potential  partnering 
enquiries from Big Pharma and the biotech investors. 
 
As  would  be  expected,  the  news-flow  will  be  significant  over  the  2016  financial  year.  This  will  be 
driven  by  the  regulatory  approval  and  recruitment  of  patients  to  XanADu  across  all  3  geographies, 
and  by  the  extensive  publications  and  presentation  program  we  have  in  place  to  present  the 
research  data  being  generated  by  ACW  and  on  the  cortisol  hypothesis.  Additionally  we  have  the 
pipeline  development  program  for  XanamemTM  that  is  expected  to  come  on  line  over  the  next  12 
months.

Importantly, cash-flow projections and budgets continue to appear to be adequate for the current 
research  program  through  into  2018.  On  8  June  2016  we  announced  the  harmonisation  of  the 
XanADu protocol. This may require an upward revision of the trial budget and announcements in this 
regard will made at the appropriate time.  
 
Monthly  operational  expense  are  not  expected  to  increase  over  last  financial  year.  Only  one 
additional  permanent  headcount  will  be  required  –  a  Head  of  Business  Development.  The  new 
offices are fully resourced and operational. 
 
The  next  12  months  hold  huge  promise  for  ACW,  and  we  look  forward  to  regularly  updating 
shareholders  and  the  market  on  the  progress  we  are  making,  in  the  lead  up  to  announcing  the 
XanADu study results in 2018.

Introduction
1. 
 
The  remuneration  report  details  the  remuneration  arrangements  for  key  management  personnel 
(KMP)  who  are  defined  as  those  having  authority  and  responsibility  for  planning,  directing  and 
controlling the major activities of the Company, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether 
executive or otherwise).  Key management personnel of Actinogen comprise the Board of Directors 
and the Vice President of Clinical Research.  
 
The performance of the Company depends upon the quality of its key management personnel.  To 
prosper  the  Company  must  attract,  motivate  and  retain  appropriately  skilled  Directors  and 
Executives.
The Company’s broad remuneration policy is to ensure the remuneration package properly reflects 
the  person’s  duties  and  responsibilities  and  that  remuneration  is  competitive  in  attracting,  retaining 
and motivating people of the highest quality.  The remuneration arrangements detailed in this report 
are  for  the  Directors  of  the  Board  and  the  Vice  President  of  Clinical  Research  during  the  financial 
year and are as follows:

The table below sets out the performance of the Company and the consequences of performance on 
shareholders’ wealth over the past five years:
Remuneration Governance
2. 
 
Remuneration of Directors is currently set by the Board of Directors. The Board has not established a 
separate Remuneration  Committee  at  this point in the Company’s development  nor has the Board 
engaged  the  services  of  a  remuneration  consultant  to  provide  recommendations  when  setting  the 
remuneration received by Directors.  
 
It is considered that the size of the Board along with the level of activity of the Company renders this 
impractical  and  the  full  Board  considers  in  detail  all  of  the  matters  for  which  the  Directors  are 
responsible.  
 
All  matters  of  remuneration  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  Corporations  Act  requirements, 
especially in respect of related party transactions. Refer to the Corporate Governance Statement for 
further information. 
 
Actinogen Medical Limited received 99.5% of votes in favour of its Remuneration Report for the 2015 
financial year. The Company did not receive any specific feedback at the Annual General Meeting 
or throughout the year on its remuneration practices. 
 
 
3. 
 
(A) Remuneration principles and strategy 
 
The Company aims to reward Executives with a level and mix of remuneration commensurate with their 
position and responsibilities within the Company and aligned with market practice.  
 
Executive remuneration must be:
Executive Remuneration Arrangements
  aligned with the Company’s vision, values and overall business objectives; and 
  must be designed to motivate management to pursue the Company’s long term growth and
success.
The nature and amount of remuneration of Executives are assessed on a periodic basis by the Board (in 
the absence of a Remuneration Committee) for their approval,  with the  overall objective of ensuring 
maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high performing Executives.  
 
The main objectives sought when reviewing executive remuneration is that the Company has:
  coherent remuneration policies and practices to attract and retain executives;
24
ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T  
_____________________________________________________________

Executives who will create value for shareholders;
  competitive remuneration offered benchmarked against the external market; and

fair  and  responsible  rewards  to  Executives  having  regard  to  the  performance  of  the
Company, the performance of the Executives and the general pay environment.
(B) Approach to setting remuneration 
 
The  Company  aims  to  reward  executives  with  a  level  and  mix  of  remuneration  appropriate  to  their 
position and responsibilities, while being market competitive. The  Company’s remuneration structure 
for  Executives  can  include  a  mix  of  fixed  remuneration,  short  term  incentive  (STI)  and  long  term 
incentive (LTI) as outlined below.  
 
Fixed remuneration component: 
Fixed  Remuneration  is  represented  by  total  employment  cost  and  comprises  base  salary,  statutory 
superannuation  contributions  (where  applicable)  and  other  benefits.   It is  paid  by  the  Company  to 
compensate  fully  for  all  requirements  of  the  Executives  employment  with  reference  to  the  market 
and the individual’s role and experience. It is subject to annual review considering market data and 
the performance of the  Company and individual. The  Company benchmarks the fixed component 
against  appropriate  market  comparisons  with  the  comparator  group  criteria  being  market 
capitalisation. 
 
STI component: 
 
The  STI  component  is  in  the  form  of  a  cash  bonus  to  KMP.  Payment  of  the  cash  bonus  is  entirely 
discretionary  and  rewards  the  KMP  for  their  contribution  to  achievement  of  business  goals.  The 
business goals are determined annually by the Board and are linked to the strategic and operational 
plans of the Company, including budgets agreed for each financial year.  
 
A specific STI component is also provided for within the Managing Director’s remuneration package. 
Currently  this  includes  a  performance  condition  whereby  at  the  annual  review  of  the  Managing 
Directors’ salary, one of the factors to be considered by the Board when granting an increase will be 
the  Company’s  market  capitalisation  against  appropriate  ASX  benchmarks  with  an  aim  for  50th 
percentile  pay  on  ASX  market  capitalisation.  The  Managing  Director  and  the  rest  of  the  Board  will 
agree benchmarks for each year of the term.  
 
LTI component: 
 
The  LTI  component  is  in  the  form  of  Employee  Loan  Shares  and  Employee  Options.  The  Board  feels 
that  the  shares  and  options  currently  on  issue  provide  a  sufficient  long  term  incentive  to  align  the 
goals  of  the  KMP  with  those  of  the  shareholders  to  maximise  shareholder  wealth.  The  Board  will 
continue to monitor this policy to ensure that it is appropriate for the Company in future years. 
 
(C) Details of incentive plans  
 
Short term incentive 
 
During the year, a $24,700 bonus fee incentive was put in place by the Board of Directors, payable to 
Mr Ruffles on the achievement of a number of various short term performance conditions being met. 
The  key  performance  indicators  (KPI’s)  included  delivery  of  the  final  preclinical  report,  the  XanADu 
protocol, a gap analysis and the manufacture of new Xanamem™.   These  performance conditions 
were  chosen  because  they  are  significant  milestones  that  had  to  be  accomplished  prior  to 
activation of the XanADu study.   
 
During the quarter ended March 2016, Mr Ruffles met a certain portion of these milestones and  was 
paid a $9,880 Bonus Fee which represents 40% of his 2016 bonus fee incentive.
25
ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T  
_____________________________________________________________ 
 
During the year, a $75,000 bonus fee incentive was put in place by the Executive Chairman and the 
rest  of  the  Board  members,  payable  to  Dr  Ketelbey  dependent  on  achieving  a  KPI  of  the  first  10 
patients into the XanADu study, with the possibility of an additional stretch bonus to be determined at 
a  future  date.  The  KPI  of  starting  patient  recruitment  into  XanADu  is  one  of  the  most  significant 
milestones  for  the  company.  The  KPI  of  the  first  10  was  chosen  as  this  reflects  a  higher  hurdle,  with 
achievement  of  a  steady  patient  recruitment  pattern  to  the  study.  This  milestone  has  not  yet  been 
met. 
 
Long term incentive 
 
(a) Employee Options 
 
Subsequent to year end, on 7 July 2016, remuneration in the form of Employee Options were issued to 
employees  of  the  Company  pursuant  to  the  Employee  Option  Plan.  Directors  are  not  eligible  to 
receive options under this plan. Mr Ruffles is an employee of the Company and he received 1,000,000 
employee options  at  an exercise price of $0.103 each, exercisable on or before 7 July 2020.  Refer to 
Section 12 – Events Subsequent to the end of the Financial Year for further information.  
 
(b) Employee Loan Shares 
 
During  the  prior  year ended 30 June 2015, remuneration in the form of Employee Loan Shares  were 
issued to the majority of KMP upon certain performance conditions being met. 
 
The performance conditions consist of a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) covering both 
financial  and  non-financial  measures  of  performance.  Typically  included  are  measures  such  as 
contribution to research & development success, share price appreciation and tenure. 
 
The  Loan  Shares  represent  an  option  arrangement.  Due  to  the  vesting  conditions  attached  to  the 
loan  shares,  these  shares  will  be  expensed  over  the  vesting  period.  The  key  terms  of  the  Employee 
Share Plan and of each limited recourse loan provided under the Plan are as follows:
(i) 
(ii)
(iii)
(iv) 
(v)
the loan may only be applied towards the subscription price for the Loan Shares; 
the loan will be interest free, provided that if the loan is not repaid by the repayment date set by 
the Board,  the loan will incur interest at 9% per  annum  after that  date  (which will accrue on a 
daily basis and compound annually on the then outstanding loan balance); 
by signing and returning a limited recourse loan application, the participants of the Plan (each a 
Participant)  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Loan  Shares  will  not  be  transferred, 
encumbered, otherwise disposed of, or have a security interest granted over it, by or on behalf 
of the Participant until the loan is repaid in full to the Company; 
the Company has security over the Loan Shares as security for repayment of the loan; 
the loan becomes repayable on the earliest of: 
a)  five years from the date on which the loan is advanced to the Participant; 
b)  one month after the Participant resigns or ceases to be employed by the Company  other 
than  (i)  where the Participant is removed from office by shareholders of the Company, or 
(ii)  where  the  Company  does  not  renew  the  Participant's  executive  employment 
agreement or (iii) where the Company dismisses the Participant other than for cause; and
c)  (by  the  legal  personal  representative  of  the  Participant)  six  months  after  the  Participant
ceases to be an employee of the Company due to their death.
Repayment Date 
 
(vi)
notwithstanding paragraph  (v) above, the Participant may repay all or part of the loan at any 
time before the Repayment Date; and
26
ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
D I R E C T O R S ’   R E P O R T  
_____________________________________________________________ 
 
(vii)
the  loan  will  be  limited  recourse  such  that  on  the  Repayment  Date  the  repayment  obligation 
under the limited recourse loan will be limited to the lesser of (i) the outstanding balance of the 
limited  recourse  loan  and  (ii)  the  market  value  of  the  Loan  Shares  on  that  date.    In  addition, 
where  the  Participant  has  elected  for  the  Loan  Shares  to  be  provided  to  the  Company  in  full 
satisfaction  of  the  loan,  the  Company  must  accept  the  Loan  Shares  as  full  settlement  of  the 
repayment obligation under the limited recourse loan.
Rights attaching to Loan Shares 
 
(viii)
The Loan Shares will rank equally with all other fully paid ordinary shares on issue in the capital of 
the Company. Holders of Loan Shares issued under the Plan will be entitled to exercise all voting 
rights  attaching  to  the  Shares  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  constitution.  In  addition, 
holders of Loan Shares issued under the Plan will be entitled to participate in dividends declared 
and paid by the Company in accordance with the Company's constitution.
Vesting conditions 
 
Under the Employee Share Plan, the Directors may issue the Loan Shares subject to vesting conditions 
(including performance milestones and time based retention hurdles), such that the holder of the Loan 
Shares  is  only  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  Loan  Shares  once  the  vesting  conditions  are  met.    If  the 
vesting  conditions  are  not  met,  the  holder  will  lose  their  entitlement  to  the  Loan  Shares  and  the 
Company  may  buy-back  or  arrange  for  the  sale  of  those  Loan  Shares.    This  enables  the  Board  to 
attract,  incentivise  and  retain  key  personnel  and  to  align  the  interests  of  those  personnel  and 
Shareholders through equity participation. The vesting conditions are summarised in the table below.

CORPORATE INFORMATION
The  financial  statements  of  Actinogen  Medical  Limited  (“the  Company”  or  “Actinogen”)  and  its 
subsidiary  Corticrine  Limited  (collectively,  “the  Group”)  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  were 
authorised in accordance with a resolution of Directors on 31 August 2016.  
 
Actinogen  Medical  Limited  is  a  for  profit  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  and  domiciled  in 
Australia  whose  shares  are  publicly  traded  on  the  Australian  Stock  Exchange.  The  nature  of 
operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors’ Report. Information on 
other related party relationships is provided in Note 21.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out 
below.  These  policies  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless  otherwise 
stated. The financial statements of the Group are for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.
(a)
Basis of preparation
These  general  purpose  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting  Standards,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards 
Board,  and  the  Corporations  Act  2001.  The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going 
concern basis.
(b)  Compliance with IFRS
The  financial  statements  of  the  Group  also  comply  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards 
(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
(c)
Historical cost convention
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  under  the  historical  cost  convention,  except  for 
available-for-sale financial investments which have been measured at fair value.
(d)  Critical accounting estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires  the  use  of  certain  critical  accounting  estimates.  It 
also  requires  management  to  exercise  its  judgement  in  the  process  of  applying  the  Company’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
(e)
Foreign currency translation
The  Group’s  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Australian  dollars,  which  is  also  the  Group’s 
functional  currency.  For  each  entity,  the  Group  determines  the  functional  currency  and  items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.  
 
Transactions and balances 
Transactions  in  foreign  currencies  are  initially  recorded  by  the  Group’s  entities  at  their  respective 
functional  currency  spot  rates  at  the  date  the  transaction  first  qualifies  for  recognition.  Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot 
rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary 
items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part 
of  the  hedge  of  the  Group’s  net  investment  of  a  foreign  operation.  These  are  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount 
is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those 
monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income. 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign  currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined.  The  gain  or  loss  arising  on  translation  of  non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  is 
treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation

_________________________________________________________________
differences  on  items  whose  fair  value  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  or 
profit or loss are also recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively).
(f)
Plant & equipment
Each  asset  of  plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation  and 
impairment losses, if any. Assets are depreciated from the date the asset is ready for use.
Items  of  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  using  the  diminishing  value  method  over  their 
estimated useful lives to the Group. The depreciation rates used for each class of asset for the current 
period are as follows:
Plant and Equipment
 
  Office and Equipment 
  Computer Equipment 
  General Pool Assets >$1,000
7.5% to 37.5%
40%
25% to 66.67%
37%
An  asset’s  carrying  amount  is  written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount  if  the  asset’s 
carrying  amount  is  greater  than  its  estimated  recoverable  amount.  The  recoverable  amount  is 
assessed on the basis of expected net cash flows that will be received from the assets continual use or 
subsequent  disposal.  The  expected  cash  flows  have  been  discounted  to  their  present  value  in 
determining the recoverable amount.   
 
An asset is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its 
use  or  disposal.  Any  gain  or  loss  arising  on  de-recognition  of  the  asset  (calculated  as  the  difference 
between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset)  is  included  in  the 
statement of comprehensive income when the asset is de-recognised. 
 
The  assets’  residual  values,  useful  lives  and  methods  of  depreciation  are  reviewed,  and  adjusted  if 
appropriate, at each balance date.
(g)
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its assets to determine whether there 
is  any  indication  that  those  assets  have  been  impaired.  If  such  an  indication  exists,  the  recoverable 
amount  of  the  asset,  being  the  higher  of  the  asset’s  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  value  in  use,  is 
compared to the assets carrying value.  Any excess of  the assets carrying value over its recoverable 
amount is expensed to the statement of comprehensive income.  
 
Where  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific  to  the  asset.  In  determining  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell,  recent  market  transactions  are  taken 
into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations  are  corroborated  by  valuation  multiples,  quoted  share  prices  for  publicly  traded 
companies or other available fair value indicators.
(h)
Intangible assets
Intangible  assets  acquired  separately  are  measured  on  initial  recognition  at  cost.  The  cost  of 
intangible  assets  acquired  in  a  business  combination  is  their  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition. 
Following  initial  recognition,  intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortisation 
and  accumulated 
intangibles,  excluding  capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the 
period in which the expenditure is incurred.
Internally  generated

The  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets  are  assessed  as  either  finite  or  indefinite.    Intangible  assets  with 
finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is 
an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method  for  an  intangible  asset  with  a  finite  useful  life  are  reviewed  at  least  at  the  end  of  each 
reporting  period.  Changes  in  the  expected  useful  life  or  the  expected  pattern  of  consumption  of 
future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or 
method,  as  appropriate,  and  are  treated  as  changes  in  accounting  estimates  and  adjusted  on  a 
prospective  basis.  The  amortisation  expense  on  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  is  recognised  in  the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either  individually  or  at  the  cash-generating  unit  level.  The  assessment  of  indefinite  life  is  reviewed 
annually  to  determine  whether  the  indefinite  life  continues  to  be  supportable.  If  not,  the  change  in 
useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
 
Gains  or  losses  arising  from  derecognition  of  an  intangible  asset  are  measured  as  the  difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised. 
 
Research and development costs 
Research  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Development  expenditures  on  an  individual  project  are 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate:

The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for 
use or sale 
Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset
 
  How the asset will generate future economic benefits 
 
 

The availability of resources to complete the asset 
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development 
The ability to use the intangible asset generated
Following  initial recognition of  the  development  expenditure  as  an  asset,  the  asset  is carried  at  cost 
less  any  accumulated  amortisation  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.  Amortisation  of  the  asset 
begins  when  development  is  complete  and  the  asset  is  available  for  use.  It  is  amortised  over  the 
period  of  expected  future  benefit.  During  the  period  of  development,  the  asset  is  tested  for 
impairment annually. 
 
Patents  
The  Company  made  upfront  payments  to  purchase  patents.  The  patents  have  been  granted  for  a 
period of 20 years by the relevant government agency with the option of renewal at the end of this 
period. As a result, those patents are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the patent.
(i)
Income tax
The charge for current income tax expense is based on the profit for the year adjusted for any non-
assessable  or  disallowed  items.  It  is  calculated  using  the  tax  rates  that  have  been  enacted  or  are 
substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 
Deferred  income  tax  is  accounted  for  using  the  liability  method  on  temporary  differences  arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.   
 
However, the  deferred income tax from the initial recognition of an asset or liability,  in a transaction 
other than a business combination is not accounted for if it arises that at the time of the transaction 
affects either accounting or taxable profit or loss. 
 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or 
liability is settled. Deferred tax is credited in the statement of comprehensive income except where it 
relates  to  items  that  may  be  credited  directly  to  equity,  in  which  case  the  deferred  tax  is  adjusted 
directly against equity.

_________________________________________________________________
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if 
it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and 
losses.
(j)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  when  the  deferred  tax  balances  relate  to  the  same  taxation  authority. 
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset 
and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current  and  deferred  tax  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss,  except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates  to  items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
 
The  Company’s  entitlement  to  the  Research  and  Development  tax  rebate  is  recognised  as  a  tax 
benefit upon receipt from the Australian Taxation Office.
Employee benefits
Provision  is  made  for  the  Group’s  liability  for  employee  benefits  arising  from  services  rendered  by 
employees to balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have 
been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs. 
Employee  benefits  payable  later  than  one  year  have  been  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the 
estimated  future  cash  outflows  to  be  made  for  those  benefits  discounted  using  the  interest  rate  on 
corporate bonds with terms to maturity approximating the terms of the liability.
(k)
Share-based payments
The  Group  provides  benefits  to  employees  (including  directors)  of  the  Group  in  the  form  of  share-
based  payment  transactions,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights 
over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees 
is  measured  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  at  the  date  at  which  they  are  granted.  The  fair  value  is 
determined by an internal valuation using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over  the  period in  which  the  performance  conditions  are  fulfilled,  ending  on  the date  on  which  the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). 
 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting 
date reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, 
in  the  opinion  of  the  directors  of  the  Group,  will  ultimately  vest.  This  opinion  is  formed  based  on  the 
best  available  information  at  balance  date.  No  adjustment  is  made  for  the  likelihood  of  market 
performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination 
of fair value at grant date. 
 
No expense  is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is 
conditional upon a market condition.  Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it 
had  vested  on  the  date  of  cancellation,  and  any  expense  not  yet  recognised  for  the  award  is 
recognised  immediately.  However,  if  a  new  award  is  substituted  for  the  cancelled  award,  and 
designated  as  a  replacement  award  on  the  date  that  it  is  granted,  the  cancelled  and  new  award 
are treated as if they were a modification of the original award.
(l)
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose  of the  Statement of Cash Flows, cash  and cash  equivalents includes cash  on  hand, 
deposits  held  at  call  with  financial  institutions,  other  short  term,  high  liquid  investments  with  original 
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash  and  which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and bank overdrafts.

_________________________________________________________________
(m)
Revenue recognition
Revenue  is  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefits  will  flow  to  the 
entity and the revenue can be reliably measured.  The following specific recognition criteria must also 
be met before revenue is recognised: 
 
Interest revenue is  recorded using the effective interest rate method  (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly 
discounts  the  estimated  future  cash  payments  or  receipts  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial 
instrument, or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or 
liability. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of comprehensive income.
Research  &  development  tax  rebates  are  recognised  when  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the 
rebate will be received. The rebate is recognised as income over the period necessary to match on a 
systematic basis the costs that it is intended to compensate.
(n)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effect interest method, less allowance for impairment. Trade receivables are generally due 
for settlement within 30 days. 
 
Collectability  of  trade  receivables  is  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Debts  which  are  known  to  be 
uncollectible  are  written  off  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  directly.  An  allowance  account 
(provision  for  impairment  of  trade  receivables)  is  used  when  there  is  objective  evidence  that  the 
Company  will  not  be  able  to  collect  all  amounts  due  according  to  the  original  terms  of  the 
receivables.  Significant  financial  difficulties  of  the  debtor,  probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter 
bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments  (more than 30 days 
overdue)  are  considered  indicators  that  the  trade  receivable  is  impaired.  The  amount  of  the 
impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to 
short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
 
The  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income  within 
impairment  losses  –  financial  assets.  When  a  trade  receivable  for  which  an  impairment  allowance 
had  been  recognised  becomes  uncollectible  in  a  subsequent  period,  it  is  written  off  against  the 
allowance  account.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts  previously  written  off  are  credited  against 
impairment losses – financial assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
(o)  Goods and services tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount 
of  GST  incurred  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Tax  Office.  In  these  circumstances  the  GST  is 
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and 
payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST. Cash flows are presented in 
the  statement  of  cash  flows  on  a  gross  basis,  except  for  the  GST  component  of  investing  and 
financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.
(p)  Contributed equity
Ordinary  issued  share  capital  is  recognised  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  by  the 
Group. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as 
a reduction in share proceeds received.
(q)
Trade and other payables
Liabilities  for  trade  creditors  and  other  amounts  are  carried  at  cost  which  is  the  fair  value  of  the 
consideration  to  be  paid  in  the  future for  goods  and  services  received,  whether  or  not  billed  to  the 
Group.  Interest, when charged by the lender, is recognised as an expense on an accrual basis.

_________________________________________________________________
(r)
Provisions
Provisions  for  legal  claims  and  make  good  obligations  are  recognised  when  the  Company  has  a 
present  legal  or  constructive  obligation  as  a  result  of  past  events,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of 
resources  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation  and  the  amount  has  been  reliably  estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
 
Where  there  are  a  number  of  similar  obligations,  the  likelihood  that  an  outflow  will  be  required  in 
settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised 
even  if  the  likelihood  of  an  outflow  with  respect  to  any  one  item  included  in  the  same  class  of 
obligations may be small. 
 
Provisions  are  measured  at  the  present  value  of  management’s  best  estimate  of  the  expenditure 
required  to  settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  reporting  date.  The  discount  rate used  to  determine 
the  present  value  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks 
specific  to  the  liability.  The  increase  in  the  provision  due  to  the  passage  of  time  is  recognised  as 
interest expense.
(s)
Earnings per share
(i) Basic earnings per share 
 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  attributable  to  owners  of  the  Group, 
excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number 
of  ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  financial  year,  adjusted  for  bonus  elements  in  ordinary 
shares issued during the year. 
 
(ii) Diluted earnings per share 
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take  into  account  the  after  income  tax  effect  of  interest  and  other  financing  costs  associated  with 
dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  and  the  weighted  average  number  of  additional  ordinary  shares 
that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(t)
Investments and other financial assets
Classification 
 
The  Group  classifies  its  financial  assets  in  the  following  categories:  loans  and  receivables  and 
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments 
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition. 
 
Recognition 
 
Financial  instruments  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value  on  trade  date,  which  includes  transaction 
costs, when the related contractual rights or obligations  exist. Subsequent to initial recognition  these 
instruments are measured as set out below. 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale  financial  assets,  comprising  principally  marketable  equity  securities,  are  non-
derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They  are  included  in  non-current  assets  unless  management  intends  to  dispose  of  the  investment 
within 12 months of the reporting period. 
Loans and receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets initially recognised at fair value with fixed or 
determinable  payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market  and  are  stated  at  amortised  cost 
using the effective interest rate method.

_________________________________________________________________
Subsequent measurement 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. 
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Details of how the fair value of financial instruments is determined and disclosed in Note 3. 
 
Impairment 
 
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset 
or Group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, 
a  significant  or  prolonged  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  a  security  below  its  cost  is  considered  as  an 
indicator  that  the  securities  are  impaired.  If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-sale  financial 
assets, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current 
fair  value,  less  any  impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income - is removed from equity and recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income.  Impairment  losses  recognised  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income  on  equity 
instruments classified as available-for-sale are not reversed. 
 
If there is evidence of impairment for any of the Company’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, 
the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred. The cash flows 
are  discounted  at  the  financial  asset’s  original  effective  interest  rate.  The  loss  is  recognised  in  the 
statement of comprehensive income.
(u)
Segment reporting
Operating segments  are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the  Board of 
Directors.
(v)  Government grants
Government  grants  are  recognised  where  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the  grant  will  be 
received  and  all  attached  conditions  will  be  complied  with.  When  the  grant  relates  to  an  expense 
item,  it  is  recognised  as  income  on  a  systematic  basis  over  the  periods  that  the  costs,  which  it  is 
intended  to  compensate,  are  expensed.  When  the  grant  relates  to  an  asset,  it  is  recognised  as 
income in equal amount over the expected useful life of the related asset.

Summary
AASB 9
Financial 
Instruments
AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces AASB 139. 
This new version supersedes AASB 9 issued in December 2009 (as 
amended) and AASB 9 (issued in December 2010) and includes a model 
for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected 
loss’ impairment model and a substantially-reformed approach to hedge 
accounting.
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. However, the Standard is available for early adoption. The own 
credit changes can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise 
changing the accounting for financial instruments.
Classification and measurement
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for classification 
and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements of 
AASB 139. There are also some changes made in relation to financial 
liabilities.
The main changes are described below.
Financial assets
a.
Financial assets that are debt instruments will be classified based on 
(1) the objective of the entity's business model for managing the 
financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.
b.  Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains 
and losses on investments in equity instruments that are not held for 
trading in other comprehensive income. Dividends in respect of 
these investments that are a return on investment can be 
recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling 
on disposal of the instrument.
c.
Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or

significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency 
that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising 
the gains and losses on them, on different bases.
Financial liabilities
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities are 
limited to the measurement of liabilities designated at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.  
Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the change in 
fair value is to be accounted for as follows:
►
The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented 
in other comprehensive income (OCI)
►
The remaining change is presented in profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was caused by 
changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to be measured at fair 
value. This change in accounting means that gains or losses attributable 
to changes in the entity’s own credit risk would be recognised in OCI.  
These amounts recognised in OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if the 
liability is ever repurchased at a discount.
Impairment
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss impairment 
model that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses. 
Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected 
credit losses from when financial instruments are first recognised and to 
recognise full lifetime expected losses on a more timely basis.
Hedge accounting
Amendments to  AASB 9  (December 2009 & 2010 editions and AASB 
2013-9)  issued in December 2013 included the new hedge accounting 
requirements, including changes to hedge effectiveness testing, 
treatment of hedging costs, risk components that can be hedged and 
disclosures.
Consequential amendments were also made to other standards as a 
result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB 2009-11 and superseded by AASB 
2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 – Part E.
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments arising from 
the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014.
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of AASB 9 (AASB 
9 (December 2009) and AASB 9 (December 2010)) from 1 February 2015 
and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on after 1 January 
2015.
AASB 14 permits first-time adopters to continue to account for amounts 
related to rate regulation in accordance with their previous GAAP when 
they adopt Australian Accounting Standards. However, to enhance 
comparability with entities that already apply Australian Accounting 
Standards and do not recognise such amounts, AASB 14 requires that the 
effect of rate regulation must be presented separately from other items. 
An entity that is not a first-time adopter of Australian Accounting 
Standards will not be able to apply AASB 14.
AASB 2014-1 Part D makes amendments to AASB 1 First-time Adoption of 
Australian Accounting Standards, which arise from the issuance of AASB 
14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts in June 2014.

of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers,  
Interpretation  131 Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising 
Services and Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the 
Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates the requirements of 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and developed jointly 
with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers (except for contracts within the scope of other 
accounting standards such as leases or financial instruments).The core 
principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the 
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognises revenue in 
accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:
(a)   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
(b)  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
(c)   Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
(d)  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
(e)  Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation
AASB 2015-8 amended the AASB 15 effective date so it is now effective 
for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. 
Early application is permitted.
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to a number 
Australian Accounting Standards (including Interpretations) arising from 
the issuance of AASB 15.

AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:
•
Servicing contracts  - clarifies how an entity should apply the 
guidance in paragraph 42C of AASB 7 to a servicing contract 
to decide whether a servicing contract is ‘continuing 
involvement’ for the purposes of applying the disclosure 
requirements in paragraphs 42E–42H of AASB 7.
•  Applicability of the amendments to AASB 7 to condensed
interim financial statements - clarify that the additional 
disclosure required by the amendments to AASB 7 Disclosure–
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities is not 
specifically required for all interim periods. However, the 
additional disclosure is required to be given in condensed 
interim financial statements that are prepared in accordance 
with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting when its inclusion 
would be required by the requirements of AASB 134.
AASB 119 Employee Benefits:
•  Discount rate: regional market issue - clarifies that the high
quality corporate bonds used to estimate the discount rate for 
post-employment benefit obligations should be denominated 
in the same currency as the liability. Further it clarifies that the 
depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds should be 
assessed at the currency level.
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting:
•  Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial
report’ - amends AASB 134 to clarify the meaning of disclosure 
of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’ and to 
require the inclusion of a cross-reference from the interim 
financial statements to the location of this information.
This Standard inserts scope paragraphs into AASB 8 and AASB 133 in 
place of application paragraph text in AASB 1057. This is to correct 
inadvertent removal of these paragraphs during editorial changes made 
in August 2015. There is no change to the requirements or the

•
Lessees are required to recognise assets and liabilities for all 
leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the 
underlying asset is of low value.
•  A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-
financial assets and lease liabilities similarly to other financial 
liabilities.
•  Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured
on a present value basis. The measurement includes non-
cancellable lease payments (including inflation-linked 
payments), and also includes payments to be made in optional 
periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option 
to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate 
the lease.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, (including interest rate risk and 
price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk in these areas is not significant enough to 
warrant a formalised specific risk management program. 
 
Risk management is carried out by the Board of Directors in their day to day function as the overseers 
of the business.   
 
Set out below is an overview of the financial instruments held by the Group as at 30 June 2016:
55

_________________________________________________________________
Set out below is an overview of the financial instruments held by the Group as at 30 June 2015:
(a)  Market Risk
(i)  Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency and net investments in foreign 
operations. 
 
During  the  prior  year  ended  30/6/2015,  Actinogen  Medical  Limited  acquired  100%  of  the  issued 
capital  in  Corticrine  Limited;  a  company  located  in  the  United  Kingdom;  however,  on  23  February 
2016  Corticrine  Limited  was  deregistered  and  dissolved.  The  subsidiary’s  cash  and  cash  equivalents 
were denominated in Great British Pounds. 
 
(ii)  Price risk
Equity price risk represents the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of 
changes  in  market  prices,  whether  those  changes  are  caused  by  factors  specific  to  the  individual 
instrument  or  its  issuer  or  factors  affecting  all  instruments  in  the  market.    Equity  price  risk is  minimised 
through ensuring that investment activities are undertaken in accordance with the Board established 
mandate limits and investment strategies. 
 
During the year the  Group’s main equity price risk exposure related to the  Group’s available-for-sale 
financial  assets  which  comprised  of  various  ASX-listed  investments.  All  the  investment  assets  were 
securities from major banks and are considered low risk investments. 
 
(iii) Interest  rate risk
The  Group’s  main interest  rate  risk  exposure  relates  primarily  to  the  Group’s  cash  at  bank  and  funds 
held  on  deposit  that  are  both  held  with  variable  interest  rates.  The  Group  does  not  rely  on  the 
generation of interest on cash and cash equivalents to provide for working capital and as result does 
not  consider  this  to  be  material.  The  Group  therefore  has  not  undertaken  any  further  analysis  of 
exposure other that the analysis in the table below:
56
ACTINOGEN MEDICAL LIMITED 
N O T E S   T O   T H E   C O N S O L I D A T E D   F I N A N C I A L   S T A T E M E N T S  
3 0   J U N E   2 0 1 6  
_________________________________________________________________
(b)  Credit risk
Credit  risk is  the  risk  of  financial  loss  to  the  Group  if  a  counter  party  to  a  financial  instrument  fails  to 
meet its contractual obligations. The Group’s main credit risk exposure relates to the financial assets of 
the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group’s 
exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counter party, with the maximum exposure 
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.  
 
The carrying amount of financial assets included in the statement of financial position represents the 
Group’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  in  relation  to  those  assets.  The  Group  does  not  hold  any 
credit  derivatives  to  offset  its  credit  exposure.  The  Group  trades  only  with  recognised,  credit  worthy 
third  parties  and  as  such  collateral  is  not  requested  nor  is it  the  Group’s  policy  to  securitise  its  trade 
and other receivables. Receivable  balances are monitored on  an ongoing basis with the result that 
the  Group  does  not  have  a  significant  exposure  to  bad  debts.  The  Group  has  no  significant 
concentrations of credit risk except for cash held with National Australia Bank and various receivables 
with recognised third parties. 
(i)  Cash
The Directors believe that there is negligible credit risk with the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, as 
funds are held at call with National Australia Bank, a reputable Australian Banking institution.
(ii)  Trade and other receivables
While  the  Group  has  policies  in  place  to  ensure  that  transactions  with  third  parties  have  an 
appropriate credit history, the management of current and potential credit risk exposures is limited as 
far as is considered commercially appropriate. Up to the date of this report, the Board has placed no 
requirement for collateral on existing debtors.
(c)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial liabilities as and when they 
fall  due.  Prudent  liquidity  risk  management  implies  maintaining  sufficient  cash  and  marketable 
securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and 
the ability to close out market positions. The  Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring 
forecast  and  actual  cash  flows.  Surplus  funds  are  generally  only invested  at  call or  in  bank  bills  that 
are highly liquid and with maturities of less than six months. 
 
(i)  Financing arrangements:
The Group does not have any financing arrangements. 
 
(ii)  Maturities of financial liabilities:
The Group’s only debt relates to trade payables, where payments are generally due within 30 days.

(d)
Fair Value Measurements
The  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  must  be  estimated  for  recognition  and 
measurement or for disclosure purposes. 
 
Accounting  standards  require  disclosure  of  fair  value  measurements  by  level  of  the  following  fair 
value measurement hierarchy: 
 
(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 
 
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2); and 
 
(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) 
(level 3). 
 
The following tables present the  Group’s assets and liabilities measured and recognised at fair value 
at 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as available-for-sale securities) is 
based  on  quoted  market  prices  at  the  reporting  date.  The  quoted  market  price  used  for  financial 
assets held by the Group is the current bid prices at the end  of the financial year. These instruments 
are included in Level 1.
(e)
Fair Values
Set out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments as at 30 
June 2016. The carrying value of trade receivables and trade payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair value due to their short-term nature.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Key estimates: Impairment
 
 
The  Company  assesses  impairment  at  each  reporting  date  by  evaluating  conditions  specific  to  the 
Company that may lead to impairment of non-financial assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the 
recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  is  determined.  Value-in-use  calculations  performed  in  assessing 
recoverable amounts incorporate a number of key estimates. 
 
The Company follows the guidance of  AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
on  determining  when  an  available-for-sale  financial  asset  is  impaired.  This  determination  requires 
significant  judgement.  In  making  this  judgement,  the  Company  evaluates,  among  other  factors,  the 
duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost and the financial health 
of  and  near  term  business  outlook  for  the  investee,  including  factors  such  as  industry  and  sector 
performance, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flows. 
 
 
The Group initially measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the 
fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-
based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is 
dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.  
 
This  estimate  also  requires  determination  of  the  most  appropriate  inputs  to  the  valuation  model 
including  the  expected  life  of  the  share  option,  volatility  and  dividend  yield  and  making  assumptions 
about  them.  The  assumptions  and  models  used  for  estimating  fair  value  for  share-based  payment 
transactions are disclosed in Note 22.
Key estimates: Share-based payments
5.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The  Group’s  sole  operations  are  within  the  biotech  industry  within  Australia.  Given  the  nature  of  the 
Group, its size and current operations, the Group’s management does not treat any part of the Group 
as a separate operating segment. Internal financial information used by the  Group’s decision makers 
is  presented  on  a  “whole  of  entity”  manner  without  dissemination  to  any  separately  identifiable 
segments.  Accordingly,  the  financial  information  reported  elsewhere  in  this  financial  report  is 
representative of the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which it engages and the 
economic  environments  in  which  it  operates.  All  non-current  assets  are  held  in  Australia  and  all 
revenue is derived in Australia.

The  tax  benefit  of  tax  losses  and  other  temporary  differences  will  only  arise  in  the  future  where  the  Group 
derives sufficient net taxable income and is able to satisfy the carried forward tax loss recoupment rules. The 
Directors  believe  that  the  likelihood  of  the  Group  achieving  sufficient  taxable  income  in  the  future  is  not 
probable  and  the  tax  benefit  of  these  tax  losses  and  other  temporary  differences  have  not  been

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
At the end of the prior year ended 30 June 2015, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents totalled $9,805,610.

cash.   Approximately  $2,000,000  of  these  investments  have  been  sold,  so  that  as  of  30  June  2016,  the 
balance  of  the  Group’s  investments  were  valued  at  $4,025,987.  The  Group  received  $98,638  in  dividends 
during the year from holding these investments and as at 30 June 2016 the Group recognised an unrealised 
gain  of  $22,272.  Refer  to  Financial  Statements,  Note  10:  Available-for-sale  Listed  Investments  for  further 
information. 
 
Combining  the  $4,025,987  in  available-for-sale  listed  investments  with  the  $751,978  in  cash  and  cash 
equivalents  held  at  year  end,  equates  to  $4,777,965.  The  decrease  from  prior  year-end  balance  of 
$9,805,610  is  in  line  with  the  anticipated  working  capital  budgeted  spend  as  set  out  in  various 
announcements issued on the stock exchange during the financial year and previous financial year. Funds 
have  been applied primarily to support the Phase  2 study of XanamemTM, and to support general working 
capital. 
 
Post year-end the Company is due to receive up to approximately $2.6 million in other income which relates 
to the research and development tax rebate receivable recognjsed at year end. Refer to Note 9(c) below. 
 
 
Reconciliation of net cash flows from operating activities
Non cash financing & investing activities 
No non-cash financing and investing activities occurred during the year ended 30 June 2016.  
 
Financing facilities available 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had no financing facilities available. For the purposes of the statement of cash 
flows,  cash  includes  cash  on  hand  and  in  banks  and  investments  in  money  market  instruments,  net  of 
outstanding bank overdrafts.  
 
Interest rate risk exposure 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is discussed in Note 3. 
 
Credit risk exposure 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of 
cash and cash equivalents mentioned above.

Intellectual property totalling $5,196,954 comprises patents and licences initially acquired through Corticrine 
Limited. On 8 December 2014, Actinogen entered into an Assignment of Licence Agreement with Corticrine

The intellectual property is supported by seven patent families, the most recent of which will expire in 2031. 
The patent useful life has been aligned to the patent term and as a result, those patents are amortised on a

(a)
Share Capital
Ordinary shares: These shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proposed winding up of 
the Group in proportion to the number and amount paid on the share held. Effective 1 July 1998 the 
Corporations legislation in place abolished the concepts of authorised capital and par share values. 
Accordingly, the Group does not have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued shares.

(d)
Share Options
As at the date of this report, there were 55,700,000 unissued ordinary shares under option:
  48,500,000 unlisted options with an exercise price of $0.02 per share and an expiry date of 30 November
2018 (fully vested);
  5,500,000 unlisted Facilitator options at $0.02 per share exercisable on or before 30 November 2018 (fully
vested); and
  1,700,000 unlisted options with an exercise price of $0.103 per share exercisable on or before 7 July 2020. 
These  options  were  issued  to  employees  of  the  Group  and  are  subject  to  vesting  conditions  (refer  to 
Subsequent Events note).

  9,103,177 listed options on issue post-consolidation. These options were exercisable at 40 cents each (20
cents pre-consolidation) with an expiry date of 30 September 2015.
(e)
Terms and Conditions of Issued Capital
Ordinary shares participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the  Company in proportion to 
the  number  of  shares  held.    At  shareholders’  meetings  each  ordinary  share is  entitled  to  one  vote  when  a 
poll  is  called,  otherwise  each  shareholder  has  a  vote  on  a  show  of  hands.  Ordinary  shares  have  no  par 
value.
(f)
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, 
so it can provide returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders. The Group considers capital to 
consist of cash reserves on hand and available-for-sale listed investments. 
 
Consistent  with  the  Group’s  objective,  it  manages  working  capital  by  issuing  new  shares,  investing  in  and 
selling assets, submitting Research and Development rebates from the Australian Tax Office or modifying its 
planned research and development program as required.
Given  the  stage  of  the  Company’s  development  there  are  no formal  targets  set  for  return  on  capital.  The 
Company  is  not  subject  to  externally  imposed  capital  requirements.  The  net  equity  of  the  Company  is 
equivalent to capital.  Net capital is obtained through capital raisings on the Australian Securities Exchange 
and receipt of Research and Development rebates from the Australian tax Office.

The  fair  value  of  share  options  granted  have  been  valued  using  a  Black  Scholes  methodology,  taking  into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted.  
 
The approximate interest rate over a five year term was used. The assumed dividend payable in the next five 
years  was  deemed  to  be  nil.  A  volatility  of  the  share  price  fluctuation  was  calculated  by  considering  the 
historical movement of the share price over period of time as well factoring market conditions of its competitors 
to predict the distribution of relative share performance.  
 
The  exercise  price  of  the  share  options  is  equal  to  the  market  price  of  the  underlying  shares  on  the  date  of 
grant. The contractual term of the share options is five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives for 
the employees. The Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these awards. 
 
The fair value of options granted during the prior year ended 30 June 2015 was estimated on the date of grant 
using the following assumptions:
  Dividend yield (%) nil 
 
 
 
  Weighted average share price ($) 0.04
Expected volatility (%) 100 
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.0 
Expected life (years) 5.0

Independent auditor's report to the members of Actinogen Medical 
Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Actinogen Medical Limited, which comprises the 
statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of 
changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true

such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 2, the directors also 
state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the 
financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation of the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a 
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
