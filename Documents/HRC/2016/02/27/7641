<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 23/12, welcomed the report of the 
Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity, Virginia Dandan 
(A/HRC/23/45), whom it had appointed as mandate holder for human rights and 
international solidarity on 1 August 2011. It also welcomed the work conducted by the 
Independent Expert, including her consultations with States, civil society organizations and 
other stakeholders, her participation in the 2012 Social Forum and the seminar on the 
enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights, held in Geneva in 
February 2013.  
</p>
<p>2. The Council reiterated its requests to the Independent Expert contained in previous 
resolutions, including that she continue to engage actively in the post-2015 process, and 
participate in relevant international forums and major events with a view to promoting the 
importance of international solidarity in the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) and in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.  
</p><p>3. The Council further requested that the Independent Expert, in accordance with her 
workplan, continue the preparation of a draft declaration on the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity and further develop guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting that right by addressing, inter alia, 
existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; and consider holding regional 
consultations on those issues. It requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to assist the Independent Expert in the organization and 
holding of those consultations, including through the allocation of sufficient budgetary 
resources. 
</p>
<p>4. Notably, the Council requested the Independent Expert to conduct in-depth research 
and intensive consultations with a view to preparing and sharing with Member States and 
all other relevant stakeholders a preliminary text of the draft declaration, to continue 
consultations with States, and to submit a report on the implementation of resolution 23/12 
at the its twenty-sixth session.  
</p>
<p>5. The previous report of the Independent Expert covered a period of five months, her 
interactive dialogue with the Human Rights Council having been moved forward by 
approximately four months in conformity with a revised schedule for special procedures 
mandate holders&#8217; reports and interactive dialogues with the Council. The present report thus 
reflects the activities undertaken by the Independent Expert between 31 May 2013 and 31 
January 2014.  
</p>
<p>6. The notable feature of the present report is the proposed draft declaration on the 
right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, contained in the annex. In 
section V of the report, the Independent Expert offers her insights and recommendations 
regarding the next steps forward. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert has undertaken a number of activities since submitting her 
previous report (A/HRC/23/45). </p>


<p><b> A. Interactive dialogue with the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the twenty-third session of the Human Rights Council, held in May 2013, the 
Independent Expert presented her report to the Council (A/HRC/23/45). She informed the 
Council that the reporting cycle of her mandate had been modified, moving her interactive 
dialogue with the Council forward by almost four months. As a consequence, her work on a 
preliminary text of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, as requested by the Council in its resolution 21/10, was still in 
progress at the time of the interactive dialogue. The Independent Expert stated that the 
preliminary text would be ready by August 2013. It would then be transmitted to Member 
States, the Geneva-based United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), experts, academics and other stakeholders, with a view to eliciting comments and 
inputs to be considered in the preparation of the draft declaration. 
</p>
<p>9. In her concluding remarks, the Independent Expert stated that, as previously 
promised during the eighteenth session of the Council, held in September 2011, the draft 
declaration would be submitted in time for the consideration of the Human Rights Council 
during its twenty-sixth session, to be held in June 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Vienna+20 international conference 
</b></p>
<p>10. The international conference entitled Vienna+20: Advancing the Protection of 
Human Rights, held in Vienna on 27 to 28 June 2013, marked the twentieth anniversary of 
the World Conference on Human Rights that had adopted the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action. The 2013 conference was hosted by the Government of Austria in 
cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
The twentieth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights 
Council was also held in Vienna during the three days preceding the Conference in order to 
enable the mandate holders to participate in the conference and contribute to its outcomes.  
</p>
<p>11. The conference was a gathering of high-level human rights stakeholders from 
around the world, including the special procedures mandate holders and human rights treaty 
body members, representatives of regional and national human rights institutions, human 
rights defenders and representatives of civil society and academia. The conference was 
immediately preceded by a two-day international human rights civil society conference. 
</p>
<p>12. During the conference, there were three simultaneous working groups on: the rule of 
law; realizing the human rights of women universally; and a human rights-based approach 
to the post-2015 development agenda. The three working groups were to develop action-
oriented recommendations on how to further strengthen the human rights system, giving a 
voice to human rights defenders and civil society organizations as crucial agents for global 
human rights protection.  
</p>
<p>13. The Independent Expert participated in the working group on the post-2015 
development agenda, an area in which international solidarity is of critical relevance. The 
working group discussed the key challenges for ensuring that human rights were fully 
integrated in the post-2015 development agenda, and examined how the new framework 
could ensure that human rights principles would be consistently taken into account in all 
development measures. It also considered how to ensure that the contributions of the human 
rights system and its various mechanisms were systematically integrated into the 
development discussion, and how the accountability of States, the United Nations system, 
international financial institutions, the private sector and other duty bearers could be better 
defined and ensured. </p>


<p>14. In follow-up to the conference, it was decided that recommendations from the three 
working groups would be pursued by participants in their respective fields to inspire further 
work undertaken in the framework of international organizations. Together with papers 
presented at the conference, the recommendations were to be subsequently published by the 
organizers as a conference outcome. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Report to the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Independent Expert presented the first report under the mandate on human 
rights and international solidarity to the General Assembly in October 2013, during its 
sixty-eighth session. In her statement, she briefly introduced her mandate and outlined the 
salient milestones that had been reached since the establishment of the mandate in 2005, 
beginning with her predecessor&#8217;s activities and continuing with her own activities to date.  
</p>
<p>16. She described the three stages in her workplan and pointed out how international 
solidarity had already been sufficiently defined and redefined in the course of Stage One. 
Stage Two of the workplan had therefore shifted the focus to building up the momentum 
necessary to move beyond the issue of international cooperation and assistance, which for 
too long has constrained the elaboration of a right to international solidarity. She had 
recently embarked on Stage Three of her workplan, fast-tracking it in response to a 
resolution of the Human Rights Council at its twenty-first session, held in 2012, requesting 
her to prepare a preliminary text of the draft declaration on the right to international 
solidarity, to be shared with Member States and all other relevant stakeholders with a view 
to eliciting comments and inputs prior to finalizing the text of the draft declaration.  
</p>
<p>17. She pointed out that the preliminary text of the draft declaration had been circulated 
via a note verbale among Member States, the Geneva-based United Nations agencies and 
NGOs, experts, academics and other stakeholders, and that it was also at that time being 
circulated among States party delegations in New York, the New York-based United 
Nations agencies, NGOs and other actors. The aim was to disseminate the draft as widely as 
possible so as to achieve a broad consultation base. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert thanked the General Assembly for its support and its 
cooperation with the work of her mandate, and looked forward to a continuing and 
meaningful collaboration. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Media releases</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the first week of November 2013, the Independent Expert released a statement to 
the media, calling on Member States to place international solidarity at the heart of the 
post-2015 development agenda. She said that, through international solidarity, peoples and 
individuals would have the freedom to enjoy the benefits of a harmonious international 
society in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms would be fully realized. She 
also announced the availability of the preliminary text of a draft declaration on the right of 
peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and that the draft declaration itself would 
be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-sixth session, to be held in June 
</p><p>2014.  
</p>

<p><b> 2. Second anniversary of the Maastricht Principles 
</b></p>
<p>20. In a joint statement dated 28 September 2013, the Special Rapporteurs on extreme 
poverty and human rights, on the right to food, on the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation and the Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity 
urged States worldwide to take into account a set of guidelines known as the Maastricht 
Principles on the Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of Economic, Social and 
Cultural rights. The Principles had been adopted on 28 September 2011 by leading 
specialists in international law and human rights in Maastricht, the Netherlands. In the joint 
statement, the Independent Expert pointed out that principles 26 to 35 clearly spelled out 
the conduct of States in their relations with each other, taking into account their shared 
human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert addressed a message to States attending the nineteenth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (COP19) and the ninth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as 
the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP9), held in Warsaw from 11 to 23 
November 2013. She encouraged them to ground their discussions on the principle of 
international solidarity and echoed calls for United Nations talks not to stall over the issue 
of compensation for the effects of climate change. She stated that time was too short and 
the consequences too great to risk those negotiations being caught up in entrenched political 
positions and economic self-interest. She stressed that the Warsaw Conference was the 
moment for genuine collaboration among States to establish safeguards for minimizing the 
adverse effects of climate change on the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all 
peoples, especially those in the most vulnerable countries. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. International Human Solidarity Day 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Independent Expert issued a statement to mark International Human Solidarity 
Day, celebrated every year on 20 December in recognition of the imperative to come 
together as one human family to address the contemporary global challenges confronting all 
peoples and countries, and unify in peace to preserve and save our planet not only for 
ourselves but also for future generations. The Independent Expert noted that many global 
challenges and mass human rights violations, including global poverty, have persisted 
because of the pervasive gaps that exist in communities, between countries, and in 
international policy frameworks, and which allow the world&#8217;s most vulnerable people to 
fall through the cracks. International solidarity is the bridge across those gaps in 
understanding, action and accountability. She stressed that the post-2015 development 
agenda was an opportunity to close the gaps that persist, and create a global development 
framework based on a genuine global partnership between States with human rights at its 
heart. She urged all stakeholders currently building the agenda to be true to their promises 
in the Millennium Declaration, to hold up solidarity and shared responsibility as the 
&#8220;fundamental values &#8230; essential to international relations in the twenty-first century&#8221; and 
to anchor the next global development agenda in international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Participation in human rights education and training programmes  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Diplomacy Training Program 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Independent Expert was invited by Diplomacy Training Program twice during 
the past year to give keynote speeches and facilitate two of its training programmes. The 
first was on Indigenous Peoples, Human Rights Advocacy and Development, a programme 
for indigenous advocates of the Asia-Pacific region, held in Phnom Penh from 10 to 19 </p>


<p>June 2013. The second was the twenty-third Annual Human Rights and Peoples&#8217; 
Diplomacy Training Program held in Dili from 18 to 19 November 2013. In both 
programmes, the Independent Expert spoke at the opening ceremonies and facilitated 
modules on economic, social and cultural rights, the right to development, using human 
rights to analyse development challenges, and transnational human rights and the rise of 
extraterritorial obligations in economic, social and cultural rights. A special feature of the 
two training programmes was a three-hour session to provide information and raise 
awareness about human rights and international solidarity. In addition, during the Annual 
Training Program in Dili, she had the opportunity to present to participants the preliminary 
text on the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity, and elicit comments and generate discussion on that right. 
</p>
<p>24. Diplomacy Training Program is an independent NGO dedicated to a vision of the 
world in which all States meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. It 
pursues that vision through education in human rights advocacy for human rights defenders 
and community advocates through its range of training programmes throughout the Asia-
Pacific region and in Australia. Established in 1989, Diplomacy Training Program is 
affiliated with the University of New South Wales in Australia. Since 1990, over 2,200 
human rights defenders from the Asia-Pacific region have benefited from its specialized 
and general training programmes. The benefits, including skills in advocacy, diplomacy and 
communication, together with a sound knowledge of internationally agreed human rights 
standards and intergovernmental systems, are some of the most effective tools human rights 
defenders can use to peacefully achieve improved human rights outcomes. The benefits are 
shared with the participants&#8217; organizations, widening the positive impact on their 
communities and societies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Seoul National University Human Rights Center International Course on Human 
Rights and Asia 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Independent Expert was invited to lecture on &#8220;Poverty and Human Rights in 
Asia,&#8221; and &#8220;Cultural Rights in Multi-cultural Society: the Asian Context&#8221; during the 
International Course on Human Rights and Asia organized by Seoul National University 
Human Rights Center. In her lecture on poverty, she characterized poverty as a deprivation 
of the resources, capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an 
adequate standard of living and other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. 
She drew attention to the sectors of Asian societies more likely to suffer the adverse 
impacts of poverty in human rights terms, as well as the links between poverty, inequality 
and human rights worldwide, not just in Asia. It was during that lecture that the 
Independent Expert introduced the notion of international solidarity and explained why it is 
an imperative to ending poverty, hunger, inequality and a range of other issues, pointing out 
the human rights dimension of each issue. The role of international solidarity was also 
highlighted in her lecture on cultural rights, as were its significance and application in 
essentially multicultural societies such as those in Asia.  
</p>
<p>26. The International Course on Human Rights and Asia was held from 6 to 17 January 
</p><p>2014. The Course attracted participants from Asia, Europe and the United States of 
America, who were either professionals or postgraduate students in the fields of 
international law, international studies, development studies, political science, health care, 
or human rights. The eleven international lecturers for the Course were human rights 
experts from the Asian region, who were each requested to deliver two lectures covering 
their respective fields of expertise. 
</p>
<p>27. Seoul National University Human Rights Center was established in 2012 with the 
purpose of fostering a culture of mutual respect and contributing to the promotion of human 
rights through academic research, education and consultation. Since its establishment, the </p>


<p>Center has participated, created and led various activities for the promotion of human 
rights, including hosting its first international course on International Development and 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of international solidarity among States in 
outcomes of selected global and regional summits 
</b></p>
<p>28. In this section of the report, the Independent Expert presents a summary of the 
outcomes of selected global and regional summits, in accordance with the request of the 
Council in its resolution 23/12. This section illustrates the activities undertaken by States to 
promote international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation: Uluwatu Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>29. Foreign ministers of the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation 
(FEALAC) member countries met in Bali, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 June 2013 and adopted 
the Uluwatu Declaration. They recognized that addressing new and emerging challenges in 
today&#8217;s globalized and interdependent world requires efficient collaboration, cooperation 
and coordination among nations and other actors. They agreed to facilitate and strengthen 
interregional cooperation and collaboration between East Asia and Latin America, to work 
to reduce inequalities and gaps within and among member countries and to support the 
attainment of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and development, 
including the attainment of the MDGs in East Asian and Latin American countries.  
</p>
<p>30. The Uluwatu Declaration covers a broad range of issues, including the belief that 
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the FEALAC economies 
and the largest source of domestic employment, providing opportunities for women and 
youth to participate in economic development; the commitment to strengthen sociocultural 
cooperation and promote greater people-to-people interactions through increasing cultural 
education, sports and academic exchange, and interaction between parliamentarians and 
civil societies; the intention to achieve universal health coverage and to strengthen disaster 
risk reduction, preparedness and management; and the determination to continue engaging 
constructively in the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol towards a post-2020 ambitious climate change 
regime. 
</p>
<p>31. The FEALAC countries reaffirmed their commitment to develop closer 
collaboration in preventing and combating transnational organized crime, including illicit 
traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, corruption, smuggling of migrants, 
trafficking in persons, particularly women and children, which has grave impacts on human 
rights, the rule of law, security and social economic development. They further 
acknowledged the importance of creating a safe cyberspace, including by enhancing 
international cooperation to combat cybercrime.  
</p>
<p>32. The Declaration recognized the potential of South-South and triangular cooperation 
as mechanisms that allow the sharing and promotion of the strengths and institutional 
capabilities of the countries of both regions, based on solidarity and guided by the 
principles of respect for national sovereignty and free from any conditionalities, to 
contribute to their social and economic development. The FEALAC countries reaffirmed 
their commitment to fight against poverty, achieve all the MDGs and work towards an 
ambitious and implementable post-2015 development agenda that has at its centre poverty 
eradication, the promotion of sustainable development, and equitable and inclusive growth. </p>


<p><b> B. Asia-Pacific Ministerial Dialogue: Bangkok Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Asia-Pacific Ministerial Dialogue, held in Bangkok from 26 to 28 August 2013, 
was the first regional ministerial conference to discuss the United Nations development 
agenda beyond 2015 after the release of the report of the United Nations High-level Panel 
of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. As well as government 
representatives, the event was attended by representatives of civil society, the private 
sector, international organizations and United Nations agencies. The Independent Expert on 
human rights and international solidarity also attended, engaging with representatives of 
States and with NGOs, and participating in side events and group discussions. 
</p>
<p>34. The Bangkok Declaration was adopted as the outcome document at the end of the 
Ministerial Dialogue. It recommended that the United Nations Development Agenda 
beyond 2015 should carry forward the spirit of the Millennium Declaration with: (a) a 
determination to build upon and further carry on the MDGs, particularly with the aim of 
eradicating poverty; (b) a balanced integration of the economic, social, and environmental 
dimensions of sustainable development; (c) an emphasis on inclusive, equitable and 
sustainable development and economic growth aiming to effectively address all forms of 
inequalities and the factors underpinning them; (d) a focus on the global, regional and 
national dimensions of sustainable development in addressing the special needs and 
particular challenges of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and 
small island developing States, in the context of their respective plans and programmes of 
action; and (e) a strengthened global partnership for the enhanced implementation of 
internationally agreed development goals and objectives. 
</p><p>35. The Declaration reaffirmed the need to strengthen a multilateral trading regime that 
is fair, just and open, advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, remove 
trade and investment barriers and oppose and resist all forms of protectionism. It also 
reiterated that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social 
development. 
</p>
<p>36. The Declaration stressed that poverty reduction and education must remain at the 
core of global development and proposed that the post-2015 framework should incorporate 
goals to ensure universal access to health care and education, promotion of disaster risk 
reduction and preparedness, and that it should also be supportive of climate change 
adaptation and environmental sustainability. In particular, it stressed the critical need to 
ensure gender equality and promote women&#8217;s empowerment as a fundamental precondition 
and central component of sustainable development. It underscored the importance of 
technology transfer to developing countries and recalled the provisions on technology 
transfer, finance, access to information and intellectual property rights as agreed in the 
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.  
</p>
<p>37. The Declaration reiterated the importance of the urgent fulfilment of aid 
commitments by developed countries, noting with concern that the gap between actual aid 
disbursements and commitments has widened and aid flows to developing countries have 
also declined in real terms. 
</p>
<p><b> C. United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw 
</b></p>
<p>38. The nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP19) and the ninth session of the 
Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP9) 
met in Warsaw from 11 to 23 November 2013. The following paragraphs summarize some </p>


<p>of the key features of essential decisions reached during the Conference towards securing a 
universal climate change agreement in 2015.  
</p>
<p>39. The objective of the forthcoming 2015 agreement is to bring nations together in a 
binding global commitment and action to reduce emissions rapidly enough to avoid the 
danger zone of the changing climate while humanity builds adaptation capacity, and to 
stimulate faster and broader action immediately. The idea is to successfully conclude 
negotiations and forge a universal agreement by December 2015, which will enter into 
force in 2020. Governments agreed to put forward their nationally determined contributions 
by the beginning of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima at the end of 
</p><p>2014. It was also decided that nationally determined contributions would be put forward in 
a clear and transparent manner, and developed countries were urged to provide support to 
developing countries in that important domestic process. 
</p>
<p>40. The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was established to 
address the loss and damage caused by the effects of long-term climate change in 
developing countries, which are especially vulnerable to such effects. The mechanism will 
facilitate the exchange of information and best practices for dealing with loss and damage 
induced by climate change and will strengthen action and support, including by facilitating 
the mobilization of finance. The interim implementation of the Mechanism will be guided 
by an executive committee, which will report to the Conference of the Parties and be 
reviewed in 2016.  
</p>
<p>41. The rulebook for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation was 
agreed along with measures to bolster forest preservation and a results-based payment 
system to promote forest protection. Additionally, the framework for measuring, reporting 
and verifying mitigation efforts, including by developing countries, is now fully 
operational. The agreement is important because it means that the mitigation, sustainability 
and support efforts of countries can now be measured more accurately.  
</p>
<p>42. The Green Climate Fund, which aims to be a major channel for financing global 
action, will be ready for capitalization in the second half of 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Third Africa-Arab Summit: Kuwait Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Third Africa-Arab Summit, held from 19 to 20 November 2013 in Kuwait City, 
was a gathering of leaders of the countries of the two regions. They came together with a 
common resolve to strengthen South-South cooperation and the solidarity and friendship 
between the countries and their peoples with a view to consolidating Africa-Arab relations 
based on the principles of equality, mutual interests and respect. The theme of the summit 
was &#8220;Partners in Development and Investment.&#8221; Highlights of the Kuwait Declaration, 
adopted as the outcome document of the summit, are outlined in the paragraphs that follow.  
</p>
<p>44. The Declaration urged all relevant stakeholders to find peaceful settlements to 
political crises in the two regions and support the progress made in peacebuilding and post-
conflict reconstruction and development. It condemned terrorism in all its forms and 
manifestations, and transnational organized crime such as hostage-taking, human 
trafficking, piracy and proliferation of arms, and called upon all African and Arab countries 
to support the implementation of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel.  
</p>
<p>45. The Declaration also called upon States to formulate the necessary laws to protect 
youth and women, enhance their economic empowerment, ensure their participation in the 
decision-making process on an equal footing with men, and guarantee their full 
participation in all aspects of political, economic and social activities; and to support 
strategies and initiatives aimed at the elimination of discrimination against women in order </p>


<p>to achieve equality and equity and to raise public awareness of the human rights, values and 
principles that guarantee women&#8217;s rights and their role in society. 
</p>
<p>46. The Declaration reiterated the commitment of the African and Arab countries to 
ensure that vulnerable groups have access to primary and essential medicines and therefore 
support initiatives to integrate policies on combating epidemic diseases (malaria, 
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS) and non-communicable diseases in education, information and 
public awareness programmes; to strengthen cooperation in the field of education and 
scientific research programmes and share best practices in those two fields; to facilitate 
investment in the field of energy aimed at jointly developing new and renewable energy 
sources and expanding access to reliable and affordable modern energy services; to 
encourage governments, the private sector and civil society to strengthen cooperation on 
issues concerning rural development, agricultural development and food security; to 
promote interaction between African and Arab civil society organizations to enhance 
people-to-people relationships; and to develop policies to support economic growth and 
adopt financial policies that guarantee sustainability in order to enhance poverty eradication 
policies, including the MDGs and the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>47. The Declaration also reaffirmed the strong commitment of the countries of the two 
regions to comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, including the Security 
Council, to reflect current global realities and make it more regionally representative, 
balanced, democratic, effective and fair. It welcomed the decision of the League of Arab 
States (LAS) Council at the level of the Summit to establish an Arab Court of Human 
Rights with headquarters in Bahrain, which is regarded as a support to the common Arab 
system in the field of human rights in a legislative framework based on international 
agreement, the principles of international law and the International Bill of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Second summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean 
States: Havana Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Second summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States 
(CELAC) convened in Havana from 28 to 29 January 2014 and brought together the Heads 
of State and Government of the Latin American and the Caribbean States. The Havana 
Declaration, the outcome document, declared the CELAC region a nuclear-free zone of 
peace, based on respect for the principles and rules of international law, including the 
international instruments to which member States are a party, and the purposes and 
principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>49. The Havana Declaration contains specific commitments on the part of the CELAC 
countries to resolve disputes through peaceful means with the aim of definitively 
eliminating the threat or actual use of force in the region; to abide by their obligation not to 
intervene, directly or indirectly, in the internal affairs of any other State; to uphold the 
commitment of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean to foster cooperation and 
friendly relations with each other and with other nations; to practise tolerance and live 
together in peace with each other as good neighbours; to fully respect the inalienable right 
of every State to choose its political, economic, social, and cultural system; to promote a 
culture of peace in the region, based, inter alia, on the principles of the Declaration on a 
Culture of Peace; to be guided by the Declaration in their international relations; and to 
continue promoting nuclear disarmament as a priority. 
</p>
<p>50. The CELAC countries accorded the highest priority to strengthening food and 
nutritional security, literacy and post-literacy, free universal public general education, 
quality technical, vocational and higher education with a social purpose, fostering land 
tenure, agricultural development, including peasant and family farming, decent and </p>


<p>permanent jobs, support for small farmers, unemployment insurance, universal public 
health, the right to adequate housing for all and productive and industrial development as 
decisive factors to eradicate hunger, poverty and social exclusion. In the Declaration, they 
reiterated their commitment to the eradication of child labour at the earliest possible date.  
</p>
<p>51. The CELAC countries recognized that indigenous peoples and local communities 
play a significant role in economic, social and environmental development and also 
recognized the valuable contributions of the private sector, civil society, social movements 
and society as a whole. They pledged to continue consolidating sound regional concepts 
acknowledging the rights of migrants, and to increase coordination on regional policies on 
migration and common positions in global and interregional negotiations on migration, 
especially regarding the promotion of the global debate on the link between migration, 
development and human rights.  
</p>
<p>52. The Declaration stressed the crucial importance of the intergovernmental process for 
formulating the post-2015 development agenda, which should be open, transparent and 
inclusive. It emphasized that the new development agenda should be formulated on the 
basis of full respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in 
the light of the principles enshrined in the final document adopted at Rio+20, entitled &#8220;The 
Future We Want&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Constructing the draft declaration on the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert, mindful of word limit guidelines, provides a brief outline 
of the process leading to the proposed draft declaration, which is contained in the annex to 
the present report. References to full reports and further details relating to the process are 
provided in the footnotes of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>54. The groundwork for the development of a right to international solidarity began with 
the submission of a working paper on human rights and international solidarity by Rui 
Baltazar Dos Santos Alves (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/43) to the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights of the Commission on Human Rights, as 
requested in its resolution 2002/73. One of the conclusions of the working paper was that 
international solidarity as an instrument for the attainment of human rights was a fact of 
international life that needed new development. In paragraph 37 (c), Mr. Baltazar proposed 
a preliminary workplan, in which he recommended &#8220;studying the new international context, 
the new challenges and the need to define principles, objectives and priorities conducive to 
clarifying responsibilities in the field of international solidarity and human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. Subsequently, during its sixty-first session, the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 2005/55, established the mandate on human rights and international solidarity, 
decided to appoint an independent expert on human rights and international solidarity for a 
period of three years and requested the independent expert to study the issue and prepare a 
draft declaration on the right. Rudi Muhammad Rizki was appointed as the first 
independent expert on human rights and international solidarity.  
</p>
<p>56. In his first report (E/CN.4/2006/96), Mr. Rizki presented an overview of his 
approach to the mandate, including objectives, methodology, preliminary considerations to 
be refined and developed in subsequent reports and possible main areas of focus. Mr. Rizki 
was appointed for a further three years after his first term. During his second term, he 
circulated a questionnaire on human rights and international solidarity to States, United </p>


<p>Nations departments and bodies, specialized agencies, other international organizations, 
NGOs and special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council. In his last 
report (A/HRC/15/32), he identified elements of a conceptual and normative framework for 
human rights and international solidarity, drawing from the responses to the questionnaire 
and his review of and observations on them, and highlighted significant areas of focus and 
emerging approaches in international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>57. In her first report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/21/44), the current 
Independent Expert outlined the work of the mandate towards the elaboration of a draft 
declaration. Stage One was the work done by her predecessor, Stage Two involved in-depth 
examination of the relevant issues, principles, standards and norms that would shift the 
focus from the principle of international solidarity to the right to international solidarity. 
Consultation with States and various stakeholders, including civil society and grass-roots 
representatives, was intensified throughout Stage Two. Stage Three was devoted to 
consolidating and analysing the results of the previous two Stages, writing and circulating 
the preliminary text of the draft declaration, consolidating additional comments and inputs 
that were received, and finalizing the draft declaration for submission to the Human Rights 
Council by 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gathering and consolidating data 
</b></p>
<p>58. The working paper written by Rui Baltazar Dos Santos Alves and the work of the 
previous Independent Expert were inspired by the historical and philosophical foundations 
and, to a certain extent, the link to international law, of the principle of international 
solidarity and its value in international relations that would lay the basis for the right to 
international solidarity. 
</p>
<p>59. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 9/2, 12/9, 15/13 and 18/5, the Human 
Rights Council Advisory Committee, working in close cooperation with the current 
Independent Expert, prepared and submitted a final paper (A/HRC/21/66) in contribution to 
the work of the Independent Expert on the draft declaration on human rights. In addition, 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights held an expert 
workshop in Geneva in June 2013 in response to Human Rights Council resolution 18/5. 
The workshop was convened under the auspices of the Independent Expert who gathered 26 
experts from all regions. Representatives of States, United Nations agencies and NGOs 
attended the public segment of the workshop as observers and were invited to participate in 
its working groups. The discussions in the workshop focused on issues including the 
content, nature and added value of international solidarity; the definition of international 
solidarity and a right to international solidarity; the relationships between international 
solidarity and international cooperation; and looking beyond the MDGs. The workshop 
participants freely expressed their thoughts based on their individual expertise and 
exchanged views, as summarized by the Independent Expert (A/HRC/21/44/Add. 1).  
</p><p>60. Convinced that the most effective and appropriate way to understand the policy and 
practice of international solidarity was through empirical methods of study and observation 
on the ground, the Independent Expert conducted her first official country study mission to 
Brazil in June 2012 in order to exchange views with the Government and other actors, and 
gather information on the so-called &#8220;solidarity diplomacy&#8221; experiences of Brazil, 
particularly in the context of its international cooperation activities. As the Independent 
Expert explained in her report (A/HRC/23/45/Add.1), the country study mission supported 
the value of best practices as portals to the inherent interface between the policy and 
practice of international solidarity and the realization of human rights, and how such 
practices ineluctably lead to desirable outcomes towards the realization of human rights. </p>


<p>61. The Independent Expert conducted formal and informal consultations with State 
delegations, United Nations officials, bodies and specialized agencies, independent experts, 
national human rights institutions, NGOs, academics and local communities, listening to as 
many people as possible, including those who did not share her views regarding human 
rights and international solidarity. 
</p>
<p>62. In addition to the activities described above, the Independent Expert conducted in-
depth research, participated in relevant forums and major events, and maximized her time 
in human rights education and training programmes to exchange views, observe and better 
understand and promote the right to international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Writing the preliminary text 
</b></p>
<p>63. In response to resolution 21/10 of the Human Rights Council, the Independent 
Expert prepared and shared with Member States and all other relevant stakeholders a 
preliminary text of a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, with a view to eliciting comments and inputs before she finalized 
the draft. 
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert expresses her deep gratitude to all the representatives of 
States, individuals, groups and institutions who have supported and contributed to the 
process described above, and looks forward to further collaboration with them until the 
process is completed.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>65. <b>The Independent Expert acknowledges with gratitude and appreciation the 
work of her predecessor, who achieved important milestones during his two terms as 
Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity. His work provided 
the basis from which she proceeded and continued towards the fulfilment of the 
mandate, guided by the requests contained in a number of Human Rights Council 
resolutions and in earlier resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The current Independent Expert has the honour of submitting for the 
consideration of the Human Rights Council the proposed draft declaration on the 
right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, contained in the annex to 
the present report. In preparing the draft declaration, she has strived to follow closely 
all requests from the Council, and has been ably assisted by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>As described in the present and in previous reports, the Independent Expert 
has been continuously consulting with delegations of Member States in Geneva and, to 
a limited extent, in New York. Regrettably, it has not been possible to date to hold the 
regional consultations requested in paragraph 14 of Council resolution 23/12 of June 
2013, owing to budgetary constraints.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Independent Expert, determined to meet the target date of June 2014 for 
submitting the draft declaration to the Council, had no choice but to finalize the draft 
declaration in the absence of comments or inputs from States, except for those 
received from Guatemala and Qatar. The Independent Expert expresses her sincere 
thanks to the Governments of Guatemala and Qatar for their valuable insights and 
comments.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The insights, comments and inputs from United Nations agencies, independent 
experts, non-governmental organizations, academics, national human rights </b></p>


<p><b>institutions and local communities on the preliminary text, which was circulated in 
2013 and has now been issued in the addendum to the present report 
(A/HRC/26/34/Add.1), were of great benefit in the preparation of the proposed draft 
declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>However, the Independent Expert recognizes that the draft declaration must be 
informed by the insights, comments and direct inputs of as many Member States as 
possible. Hence the use of the word &#8220;proposed&#8221; in the title of the draft declaration.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>In that regard, the Independent Expert strongly recommends that the request 
to hold regional consultations in Human Rights Council resolution 23/12 should be 
implemented, this time not on the preliminary text but on the proposed draft 
declaration, contained in the annex to the present report. The regional consultations 
should be conducted with the Independent Expert as the resource person, in a 
workshop format in which working groups composed of relevant policymakers, 
decision makers and representatives of Governments, regional United Nations 
agencies, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations can 
effectively examine and discuss the proposed draft declaration. The outputs from the 
regional consultations would thus be well-informed by direct inputs and comments on 
the proposed draft declaration. At the end of the consultation cycle, the Independent 
Expert will consolidate and consider the outputs from all the regional consultations, 
revise the proposed draft declaration as appropriate, and submit the amended draft 
declaration for the consideration of the Human Rights Council. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Proposed draft declaration on the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The General Assembly, 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the Charter of the United Nations, and in particular the determination of 
States expressed therein to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and 
worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and 
small, to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising 
from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. to promote social 
progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to employ international 
machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,2 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that one of the pillars upon which international solidarity is built is the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which the equal and inalienable rights of all 
members of the human family are recognized3 and which states that all human beings are 
born free and equal in dignity and rights4 and affirms that everyone is entitled to a social 
and international order in which rights and freedoms can be fully realized,5  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the overwhelming manifestation of international solidarity expressed by 
States6 in the multitude of commitments and promises relating to human rights and 
development, most notably the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 
1948, the Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986, the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action in 1993, the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the 
Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, the Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action in 1995 and the Millennium Declaration in 2000, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> also that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the 
World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, contains various references to international 
cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that international solidarity is a broad principle not limited to international 
assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance, and that it includes 
sustainability in international relations, especially international economic relations, the 
peaceful coexistence of all members of the international community, equal partnerships and 
the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens,7 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful </i>that, while globalization has opened up new opportunities for economic 
growth and development, particularly in developing countries, it has also been accompanied 
by a widening of the gap between developed and developing countries, widespread poverty 
and inequality, unemployment, social disintegration and environmental risks, and that the 
challenge is how to manage those processes so as to enhance their benefits and mitigate 
their negative effects upon people,

<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that the ongoing globalization of trade and capital contributes to the 
interconnectedness and interdependence of individuals and States, presenting challenges 
that demand increased coordination and collective decision-making at the global level, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that international solidarity is a fundamental concept of mutually 
reinforcing relations among persons, groups and nations, an essential binding element that 
underpins global partnerships, a key approach to poverty eradication, and an indispensable 
component of the efforts to realize all human rights, including the right to development, as 
well as the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that the worldwide response to HIV/AIDS led by States joining 
together is one example of how international solidarity can overcome global challenges 
such as reducing global warming, eradicating poverty and hunger, especially among 
children, and combating diseases and violence against women,  
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> the emphasis placed by the General Assembly on the 
importance of cooperation in its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, recognizing that the 
promotion and protection of human rights should be based on the principles of cooperation 
and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of Member States to comply 
with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all human beings, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that States are developing consensus around the notion of mutual 
accountability,8 described as the need for accountability to the intended beneficiaries of 
cooperation, and to their respective citizens, organizations, constituents and stakeholders,9 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> the affirmation of States, expressed in the last paragraph of the 
Millennium Declaration, that the United Nations is the indispensable common house of the 
entire human family, through which they will seek to realize their universal aspirations for 
peace, cooperation and development, and their pledge of unstinting support for those 
common objectives and their determination to achieve them,10 
 <i>Convinced </i>that overcoming the current global challenges and moving forward to 
achieve the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015, and achieving the full 
realization of human rights for all, critically rest on international solidarity,

</p>
<p>2. International solidarity shall be made evident in the collective actions of States that 
have a positive impact on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by peoples and 
individuals within and outside of their respective territories, notably in the ratification of 
the United Nations international human rights treaties and international labour standards 
and the adoption of commitments and decisions agreed upon voluntarily between and 
among States at the regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 2 
</b></p>
<p> International solidarity shall be founded on the following principles: 
</p>
<p>(a) The purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in the true 
spirit of unity and fraternity; 
</p>
<p>(b) Justice, equity, peaceful coexistence, non-interference, self-determination, 
mutual respect and accountability in international relations; 
</p>
<p>(c) The permanent sovereignty of each State over its own natural wealth and 
resources and to determine freely, with its peoples, their own objectives of social 
development, to set their own priorities and to decide, in conformity with the principles of 
the Charter of the United Nations, the means and methods of achieving those objectives, 
without any external interference;12 
</p>
<p>(d) The right to development as a common concern of humanity; 
(e) Equitable, just and fair partnerships of States as the basis of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation; 
</p>
<p>(f) Good practices of collective action on the ground, whether among peoples, 
individuals or States, that give rise to desirable outcomes in advancing respect for and 
protection and fulfilment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all individuals, 
without distinction as to sex, age, ethnicity, disability or other status; 
</p>
<p>(g) The accountability of States to their peoples with regard to the 
implementation of their foreign policy and their bilateral, regional and international

</p>
<p>the highest attainable standard of health, para. 50. </p>


<p>(a) Preventive solidarity, characterized by collective actions to safeguard and 
ensure the fulfilment of all human rights, implies for States to fully respect and comply 
with their obligations under international law, and in the case of peoples, individuals, civil 
society and their organizations, to complement the efforts of States through their activities 
in that regard. Preventive solidarity is essential to achieving both intergenerational and 
intra-generational solidarity and is a vital component of the duty of States to provide and 
seek international cooperation and assistance in the implementation of their human rights 
obligations, particularly their core obligations; 
</p>
<p>(b) International cooperation rests on the premise that some members of the 
international community may not possess the resources necessary for the full realization of 
the rights set forth in international human rights treaties. States in a position to do so should 
provide international assistance, acting separately and jointly, to contribute to the fulfilment 
of human rights in other States in a manner consistent with the fundamental principles of 
international law and international human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 4 
</b></p>
<p>1. International solidarity shall be a new foundational principle underpinning 
contemporary international law, responding to the need for transformative change 
encompassing the objectives of equity, equality in outcome, sustainability, security, social 
justice and empowerment, applicable to all developing and developed countries alike.  
</p><p>2. As such, the general objective of international solidarity shall be to create an 
enabling environment in which all human rights, including the right to development, can be 
progressively realized for all peoples and individuals through international cooperation and 
preventive solidarity measures undertaken by States, international organizations, civil 
society and all other stakeholders who constitute international society, in active 
partnerships with each other, with a view to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Preventing and removing the fundamental causes of the asymmetries and 
inequalities between developed and developing countries and populations and the structural 
obstacles and factors that generate and perpetuate poverty worldwide; 
</p>
<p>(b) Engendering trust and mutual respect between State and non-State actors in 
creating an enabling environment for realizing the right to development;  
</p>
<p>(c) Fostering the equitable, just and fair distribution of benefits in a globalized 
world through the protection and fulfilment of all human rights for all. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 5 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right to international solidarity shall be understood as a fundamental human 
right by which peoples and individuals have the freedom to enjoy, on the basis of equality 
and non-discrimination, the benefits of a harmonious international society with a just and 
fair international political and economic order, in which all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms may be fully realized.14  
</p>
<p>2. Human rights, a birthright which everyone holds in common, binding peoples and 
individuals together in solidarity across cultural diversities and variations in language, 
religion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, shall entitle everyone to 
the freedom to exercise and enjoy the right to international solidarity, and to participate in 
and contribute to its full realization in accordance with applicable international human 
rights standards.

<p>3. The right to international solidarity shall be drawn from the freedoms and 
entitlements already codified in international human rights treaties reflecting core 
economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights, the right to development and 
international labour standards, complemented by other responsibilities arising from 
voluntary commitments and decisions in the various relevant fields at the bilateral, 
multilateral, regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 6 
</b></p>
<p>1. The rights-holders of the right to international solidarity shall include individuals, 
peoples, such as indigenous peoples and minorities, and civil society groups and 
organizations within the population who are either self-identified and/or identified as such 
by others, including States.  
</p>
<p>2. Rights-holders shall also include those who are outside dominant paradigms, but 
who nevertheless share similar values and concerns and are structured in some way,15 such 
as: 
</p>
<p>(a) Local and grass-roots communities which are unable to represent themselves 
or are underrepresented in and isolated from larger civil societies and organizations;  
</p>
<p>(b) Groups in social spheres that transcend national borders, such as 
transnational and diaspora communities; 
</p>
<p>(c) Transnational advocacy networks, including those that simultaneously 
participate in both domestic and international activities, that are bound by shared values and 
discourses and that engage in dense exchanges of information and services;16  
</p>
<p>(d) Virtual communities of individuals that may be geographically separated, but 
are nevertheless connected through the Internet and digital media and who together develop
