<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its seventh session from 8 to 19 February 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Madagascar was held at the 12th meeting, on 15 February 2010. The 
delegation of Madagascar was headed by Christine Razanamahasoa, Garde des Sceaux, 
Ministre de la Justice. At its 16th meeting, held on 17 February 2010, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Madagascar: Bahrain, Norway and South 
Africa. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Madagascar: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Madagascar through the 
troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation stated that, despite the crisis situation prevailing in the 
country, the Government had taken all the measures necessary to honour its obligations 
under the universal periodic review mechanism, which the international community wanted 
to be intergovernmental, cooperative, interactive, objective, constructive, non-politicized 
and action-oriented.  
</p>
<p>6. The presence of the Malagasy delegation showed the determination of the 
Government to achieve the common goal of the full enjoyment of human rights in the 
country, with the support and encouragement of the international community. 
</p>
<p>7. In presenting the most salient points of the national report, the head of the delegation 
emphasized that, with regard to the delay in the submission of periodic reports to the treaty 
bodies, an Inter-ministerial Committee for the Drafting of Human Rights Reports, which 
included members of civil society, had been set up in 2003. Since then, 15 reports had been 
drafted, of which 4 had already been examined and 3 were awaiting review. 
</p>
<p>8. The Committee prepared the national report for the universal periodic review, which 
was the subject of successive consultations with members of civil society at the regional 
level and includes their observations.  </p>


<p>9. With regard to the normative framework, the Constitution states, in its preamble, 
that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and the conventions related to women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights are an 
integral part of Malagasy positive law. The Constitution also acknowledges that 
international conventions ratified by Madagascar, once published, have authority above that 
of domestic legislation. Furthermore, in order to ensure the judicial implementation of 
ratified international instruments, relevant actors and members of civil society recently 
received training on human rights and the administration of justice, conducted in 
partnership with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>10. At the institutional level, in the light of the observations of treaty bodies and in 
conformity with the Paris Principles, a National Human Rights Council was created by law 
in 2008. It includes nine members of Parliament and members of the Executive, the law 
faculty, civil society, the Bar Association, journalist unions and trade unions. Owing to the 
suspension of Parliament, it was not possible to establish this institution in an effective 
way. However, a People&#8217;s Ombudsman (M&#233;diateur de la R&#233;publique) protects the rights of 
citizens in cases of conflict with the Administration.  
</p>
<p>11. Within the framework of the implementation of the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime, ratified 
by Madagascar in 2003 and 2005, respectively, four independent bodies entrusted with 
combating corruption have been established. 
</p>
<p>12. In order to guarantee the exercise and enjoyment of rights concerning electoral 
procedures, a national electoral council was established in 2003. A draft bill aimed at the 
creation of an independent national electoral council is in the process of being adopted, 
following a broad inclusive and consultative process. The council will have the task of 
managing, organizing and supervising electoral operations and referendums. It will also 
ensure that electoral legislation is complied with in order to guarantee free, transparent, 
democratic, fair and equitable elections. It will ensure that citizens are educated in that 
regard, with the collaboration of civil society. The membership and the powers of the 
committee will be in conformity with relevant international practice. 
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution enshrines the independence of the judiciary and ensures that judges 
cannot be removed. At present, the Supreme Council of the Judiciary comprises mainly lay 
and non-judge members, whereas previously most of its members were appointed by the 
Minister of Justice. 
</p>
<p>14. Moreover, codes of conduct for judges, other judicial personnel and prison personnel 
have been published in order to improve the equality of justice. Access to justice has been 
improved through the following measures: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of new courts and tribunals, thus enhancing the effectiveness of 
the appeal process;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of judicial assistance for economically disadvantaged persons; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The setting up of legal information and orientation kiosks; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of alternative means for dispute settlement in a community setting, 
through &#8220;law houses&#8221; focusing on reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the protection of women&#8217;s rights, Madagascar adopted a National 
Policy for the Promotion of Women in 2000 and has implemented a Gender and 
Development Plan of Action for the period 2004-2008. In that connection, a number of 
legislative measures have been taken: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provisions ensuring equality between men and women, in particular with regard to 
marriage and inheritance rights; </p>


<p>&#8226; The inclusion of all forms of violence against women in the Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A draft reform of the Nationality Code to remedy its discriminatory effects on 
women. 
</p>
<p>16. Moreover, awareness-raising and popularization programmes for women&#8217;s 
associations, the religious community and traditional chiefs have been organized 
throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>17. In the area of children&#8217;s rights, Madagascar has developed national plans to combat 
child labour and all forms of violence against children. In that connection, a commission 
aimed at reform involving children&#8217;s rights has been established to identify all measures 
necessary to protect such rights, including ensuring the conformity of national legislation 
with the relevant international instruments.  
</p>
<p>18. A coherent system for the protection of children&#8217;s rights has been operational and 
includes the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Protection networks with national coverage, implemented in partnership with the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  A centre for criminal analysis established with the national police, in partnership 
with the Embassy of the United States of America; 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Welcome and reintegration centres for children. 
</p>
<p>19. In partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), a National 
Committee for the Fight against Child Labour and Committees and Regional Observatories 
for the Fight against Child Labour have been established to guide the implementation of the 
National Plan for the Fight against Child Labour. Their priority activities are focused on 
preventing child labour and removing children from the workplace with a view to their 
reintegration into schools or professional training centres.  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to education, the Constitution guarantees the right to education as a 
parental responsibility, with respect for their freedom of choice. It also ensures the 
mandatory nature of primary education and the organization of a public education system. 
Madagascar endorses &#8220;education for all purposes&#8221; and has a national plan of action for its 
implementation. Specifically, the following measures have been taken: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Financial coverage by the State for primary school fees and the distribution of 
school kits to all pupils in both private and public schools; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The strengthening of the scholastic infrastructure and of teacher recruitment; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The payment of subsidies for teachers recruited by parents; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The financing of programmes providing private education; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of school canteens in disadvantaged areas. 
</p>
<p>21. Moreover, a National Plan of Action for Girls&#8217; Education has been adopted and 
implemented to prevent girls from dropping out of school early and to increase the 
percentage of girls in the education system.  However, early pregnancy, extreme poverty 
and certain customary practices constitute threats to access for female pupils and the 
continuation of their schooling. The legislation authorizes readmission to school after 
childbirth.   
</p>
<p>22. Concerning harmful traditional practices, the Ministry of Justice, with the support of 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has planned to holding a local, 
regional and national dialogue to discuss that issue, in order to involve all local actors in 
efforts to raise the awareness of the entire population about forced and early marriage.  </p>


<p>23. State and non-State actors will focus on the establishment of a road map for the 
formulation of a national policy against all discriminatory traditional practices. 
</p>
<p>24. In the area of health, significant results have been achieved with regard to infant 
mortality reduction and the use of contraception. On the other hand, the struggle against 
maternal mortality requires additional effort. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to combating disease, the AH1N1 epidemic is under control, while the 
national HIV/AIDS rate is below 1 per cent. In terms of improving access to health care, 
free medical assistance is now provided to economically disadvantaged individuals.   
</p>
<p>26. With respect to its intention to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, the Government intends to undertake the ratification process after Parliament has 
been seated. The bloody repression carried out by the Presidential Guard on 7 February 
2009, which caused the deaths of more than 20 persons, has been investigated by the 
National Mixed Investigating Committee. That investigation has led to the incrimination of 
people allegedly involved in the killings and it is scheduled to be concluded by the first 
quarter of 2010. 
</p>
<p>27. All parliamentarians, journalists, lawyers and other political personalities subject to 
criminal proceedings because of offences committed against common law have had access 
to defence rights. 
</p>
<p>28. With respect to allegations concerning the arbitrary detention and arrest of 
journalists, three journalists were arrested on the basis of penal accusations relating to 
offences of common law, attempts to carry out a plot and incitement to revolt.  
</p>
<p>29. With regard to prison conditions, the following measures have been undertaken: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of infirmaries covering every penal facility; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The quantitative and qualitative improvement of food supplies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The rehabilitation and refurbishment of penal facility infrastructure; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The revitalization of agricultural production to provide better food supplies to 
prisons; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The transfer of detainees to less-crowded prisons; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The implementation of the release-on-parole procedure to reduce prison 
overcrowding. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation clarified that the Direction for the Promotion of Integrity is involved 
in the fight against corruption in order to guarantee equal treatment for all citizens before 
the law and the State. The Communication Direction seeks to raise awareness among the 
population about ways and means of gaining access to justice in cases involving human 
rights violations. The Direction of the Oversight Jurisdiction Functions ensures the holding 
of periodic inspections in order to detect all irregularities, including human rights 
violations, which are to be reported to the relevant authorities. The Direction of Human 
Rights and International Relations ensures the implementation of projects in partnership 
with UNDP, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>31. Concerning gender equality, the delegation wished to submit the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Assistance measures have been set forth in order to assist victims of violence, in 
collaboration with national and international non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Awareness-raising films have been shown on television, including on private 
channels; </p>


<p>&#8226; Since 2007, awareness-raising campaigns and discussions aimed at promoting 
women equality have been carried out in various regions of the country. Traditional 
chiefs, State and non-State officials and members of civil society have been involved 
in those campaigns. 
</p>
<p>32. Furthermore, Madagascar approved law 2007-038 on 14 January 2008 to combat 
exploitation, sexual tourism and the trafficking in persons. The law provides for the 
provision of protection and aid to victims, including their social reintegration, through the 
establishment of welcome centres. The Government has also organized, as part of the 
project entitled &#8220;Fight against Trafficking and abuse&#8221;, a national awareness-raising 
campaign against sexual tourism affecting minors. During the same year, Parliament 
authorized the ratification of the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons 
and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. Madagascar has also concluded 
judicial cooperation agreements with neighbouring islands.   
</p>
<p>33. With regard to child labour, the labour code raised from 14 to 15 the minimum legal 
age for work. Night work and overtime are prohibited for persons younger than 18. A bill to 
criminalize the worst forms of child labour is being discussed. A special free telephone line 
has been put in place for reporting all forms of mistreatment and violence against children. 
</p>
<p>34. Concerning the death penalty, Madagascar is a de facto abolitionist State. Before 
presenting a new bill, the Government intends to conduct awareness-raising campaigns on 
the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>35. Twenty-four delegations took the floor during the interactive dialogue on the 
universal periodic review of Madagascar.  
</p>
<p>36. The United States of America deplored the use of violence that had led to deaths and 
injuries; the use of a politically controlled judiciary; and the continuing refusal to 
participate meaningfully in negotiations leading to the resolution of the political crisis. It 
was deeply concerned about the abductions and arbitrary arrests that had occurred since 
January 2009, and stated that authorities should put an end to the impunity of its security 
forces and address the politically motivated imprisonment and lengthy pre-trial detentions. 
It noted increasing problems regarding children&#8217;s issues, particularly the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children and child labour. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Canada was concerned about the ongoing political crisis and the serious 
deterioration in the administration of criminal justice. It stated that the increasing number of 
illegal searches, arrests, detentions and convictions inspired by political motives suggested 
a strong politicization of the criminal justice system. The restrictions imposed on freedom 
of expression and freedom of assembly had been hardened. Canada welcomed measures 
taken before the current crisis to establish a National Human Rights Council and appoint a 
mediator. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. France noted that, despite efforts taken to put an end to arrests without a warrant 
order and the excessive use of force, those practices continued. It requested information 
about investigations opened to punish those responsible for such acts, as well as planned 
measures to improve detention conditions. France also requested information about 
measures to ensure that no one would be arrested for exercising his or her freedom of 
expression, association and assembly, and about the status of progress in and the timetable 
for finalizing the adoption of the Communication Code. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Slovenia commended Madagascar for having ratified the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court and for having adopted the Plan of Action for the World </p>


<p>Programme for Human Rights Education. It noted with interest the establishment of a 
special committee entrusted with drafting reports to treaty bodies. Referring to the 
recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Human Rights Committee, it was concerned about 
the high prevalence of violence against women and girls, such as domestic and sexual 
violence, including rape. It asked whether Madagascar planned to strengthen its national 
human rights institution. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Australia was concerned about the political crisis and called on all parties to abide 
by the Maputo Agreement. It supported the efforts of the United Nations and the South 
African Development Community to bring stability to Madagascar. It was concerned at 
human rights violations, including killings, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detentions and 
illegitimate limitations on freedom of expression. It was particularly concerned at the 
deaths of unarmed persons during riots prior to the takeover of power by the High 
Authority of Transition. It remained concerned at reports of widespread violence against 
women and children, including human trafficking, sexual exploitation and child labour. It 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed Madagascar&#8217;s 
pledge to continue to promote democracy, good governance and the rule of law, but noted 
that the crisis ran counter to those ends. It remained concerned that political movements had 
been unable to implement the Maputo Agreement and the Addis Ababa Additional Act. It 
highlighted the fact that it was important that journalists be able to report freely on the 
political crisis and that people be able to freely assemble. It was concerned at restrictions on 
media freedom and at the fact that no independent investigations had been conducted into 
the alleged arrest and detention of journalists. It noted that peaceful demonstrations had 
been disrupted, often violently, by security forces and that opposition figures had been 
unlawfully arrested and detained. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Spain positively acknowledged the efforts of international mediators and national 
political leaders, in terms of Maputo Agreement and Addis Ababa Additional Act, to find a 
consensual solution to the crisis. It considered that it was essential to make progress in 
implementing those agreements, as well as to move forward in building the Government of 
National Unity in such a way as to re-establish democratic institutions as soon as possible. 
Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Germany was concerned about disappearances, including those of children and 
adolescents. It requested information about measures taken to find the disappeared, bring 
perpetrators to justice and prevent enforced disappearances. It referred to the concerns of 
the Human Rights Committee about the situation of children working as domestic servants. 
It requested information about measures taken to prevent that practice and the other worst 
forms of child labour, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, child 
labour in mining and quarrying, and child labour in hazardous and unhealthful conditions. 
Germany made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. Italy called on authorities to involve opposition movements in the process of 
preparing for elections, in order to ensure impartiality and transparency.  Italy noted with 
concern that the political crisis had given rise to a significant number of human rights 
abuses, such as the use of excessive force by the armed forces, extrajudicial killings, 
arbitrary arrests and ill treatment. While welcoming measures taken to protect women&#8217;s 
rights, Italy noted that much remained to be done. Concerning capital punishment, it noted 
with satisfaction the de facto moratorium in place. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Hungary expressed concern at the allegations of human rights violations reportedly 
taking place in Madagascar. It requested information about the mandate of and the </p>


<p>resources available to the national mechanism established to protect women&#8217;s and 
children&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Chile acknowledged the difficulties faced by Madagascar as a result of the socio-
political crisis that had affected the country since December 2008. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. The Syrian Arab Republic considered that Madagascar&#8217;s national report assessed the 
human rights situation in the country in a transparent manner. It noted Madagascar&#8217;s 
positive role in the Human Rights Council. It commended Madagascar&#8217;s endeavours to 
develop an institutional framework for human rights, including with regard to economic, 
social and cultural rights, and its efforts to combat corruption. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Madagascar noted all questions and recommendations made by the United States, 
France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Chile and Italy concerning human rights, the Maputo 
Agreement and a way out of the crisis, and indicated that replies would be given at a later 
stage. 
</p>
<p>49. The delegation provided specific replies regarding a number of concerns raised by 
the international community regarding arrests of journalists described as arbitrary, and 
stated that three journalists had been arrested on the basis of common law offences, but not 
on the basis of deprivation of freedom of expression or of the press. The delegation 
expressed its commitment to respecting freedom of expression and of the press, announcing 
that, for example, a dozen newspapers had been created within a period of six months. The 
delegation also indicated that politicians had been arrested on the basis of common law 
offences and could be released on fair bail, although their cases were still pending. 
</p>
<p>50. Regarding reported cases involving violent practices by agents of the gendarmerie 
and the investigation services, Madagascar was committed to investigating those acts of 
violence. 
</p>
<p>51. The delegation drew attention to the issue of the disappearance or abduction of a 
number of women and girls. It deplored the lack of statistics, but was committed to 
providing information at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation stressed the efforts made by Madagascar to improve the situation of 
women and children victims of violence, including marital and domestic violence, and 
indicated that its criminal code severely punished such acts, as well as acts involving the 
trafficking in and exploitation of children for sexual tourism purposes. 
</p>
<p>53. The delegation also indicated that Malagasy legislation criminalizes torture, which is 
severely punished. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation indicated that Malagasy legislation prohibited child labour and that 
achievements had included removing some children from the labour market and 
reintegrating them into school or training centres. Madagascar was committed to continuing 
to improve the situation. 
</p>
<p>55. The delegation referred to the fact that Madagascar prohibited public meetings in 
certain locations to prevent the recurrence of the destruction of private and public property.  
</p>
<p>56. The delegation stated that Madagascar was considering allowing the national human 
rights council to function as soon as possible after implementation by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>57. Madagascar welcomed the invitation to adopt specific legislative measures to 
combat discriminatory acts against women.  
</p>
<p>58. The delegation recalled that, with regard to arbitrary arrests and degradation of the 
judiciary, the legal provisions of the criminal code, including its provisions aimed at </p>


<p>adequate defence, were respected and that appeal procedures were available for persons 
willing to submit a complaint and bring their case to court. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation expressed the assurance that it would provide written replies to other 
questions that had not been fully addressed. 
</p>
<p>60. The Netherlands expressed serious concern at the impact on the enjoyment of all 
human rights resulting from the political crisis in the country, particularly with regard to 
reported unlawful arrests and arbitrary detentions, as well as violence against women and 
girls, including widespread domestic and sexual violence accompanied by a culture of 
impunity, and the lack of criminal provisions sanctioning marital rape. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. China appreciated the fact that Madagascar considered the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals a priority in its long-term efforts to eradicate poverty. It 
noted the establishment of a National Human Rights Council and the efforts made to 
promote the right to education and health and cultural rights. It noted that Madagascar had 
formulated a poverty reduction strategic paper and plan of action, and it expressed the hope 
that further information would be provided about their implementation.  
</p>
<p>62. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted the progress and achievements of 
Madagascar in promoting recovery and development despite the socio-political crisis that 
had affected the country since 2008. It also noted the establishment of a National Human 
Rights Council in accordance with the Paris Principles. It commended Madagascar for 
having supported the objectives of &#8220;Education for All&#8221;. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Belarus noted with satisfaction a number of initiatives undertaken by the country, 
particularly the adoption of national plans to promote education for all and to combat 
HIV/AIDS and child labour. In that regard, it considered that, at the request of the 
Government, the United Nations, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, would provide appropriate technical assistance. It 
encouraged Madagascar to step up its efforts related to women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, 
including in the areas of sexual exploitation, women&#8217;s access to medical care and 
education, the protection of street children from forced labour and the trafficking in 
persons. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway recalled that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights set out the 
fundamental principle that the authority of Government shall be based on the will of the 
people, expressed in genuine elections. Norway expressed its particular concern regarding 
the human rights impact of environmental degradation in Madagascar, including the 
ongoing plundering of biological treasures recognized as World Heritage, which had 
escalated during the political crisis. Norway highlighted the role of civil society as essential 
to any meaningful universal periodic review process. Norway noted the focus on freedom 
of speech and the right to assembly, but expressed concerns about the increased number of 
politicians and journalists reportedly arrested and imprisoned. Norway recalled that media 
were crucial in ensuring freedom of expression. While noting certain progress made, 
Norway remained concerned at the lack of judicial independence and effectiveness. 
Norway appreciated the country&#8217;s determination regarding women&#8217;s rights. Norway made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Argentina submitted a number of questions about the situation in Antananarivo, 
particularly concerning measures taken to restore the rule of law and measures adopted for 
the defence of women&#8217;s rights, in particular in cases involving domestic violence. 
Argentina welcomed the efforts made to accede to most international instruments on human 
rights. Argentina expressed concern about the situation of physical and sexual domestic 
violence experienced by girls and women. Argentina made recommendations. </p>


<p>66. Switzerland took note of the replies made to its advance questions. Switzerland 
expressed concern about ongoing stalemates undermining the transition process in the 
context of the Maputo Agreement and the additional act of Addis Ababa, and urged a 
solution to the unstable situation to ensure that the Government would fulfil its obligations 
in terms of protecting human rights. Switzerland noted with great concern the deterioration 
in the conditions related to the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression. Switzerland 
noted that a number of measures had been taken to improve detention conditions, but 
expressed concern about general detention conditions and prison overcrowding. 
Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Sweden noted that, while Madagascar had ratified all major United Nations human 
rights conventions, political unrest and political turmoil remained a source of concern, 
especially with regard to the right of all persons to take part in the conduct of public affairs. 
It requested information about measures being taken to guarantee that right. Sweden noted 
that, while Madagascar had imposed a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, it had not 
adopted a law formally abolishing it, nor had it signed and ratified the Second Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights. Sweden requested information 
about the status of the death penalty, including with regard to any plans to abolish it de jure
