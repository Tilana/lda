<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession,<b> </b>an objective and impartial prosecution able to perform its functions accordingly 
and the integrity of the judicial system are prerequisites for the protection of human rights 
and the application of the rule of law and for ensuring fair trials and that there is no 
discrimination in the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all<b> </b>its previous resolutions and decisions, as well as those of the 
Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, on the independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary and on the integrity of the judicial system,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/60), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the importance of the ability of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to cooperate closely, within the framework of his or 
her mandate, with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
in the fields of advisory services and technical cooperation, in the effort to guarantee the 
independence of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the importance of bar associations, professional associations of judges 
and non-governmental organizations in the defence of the principle of the independence of 
judges and lawyers,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that prosecutors shall, in accordance with the law, perform their duties 
fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold 
human rights, thus contributing to due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal 
justice system,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that judges, prosecutors and lawyers play a critical role in safeguarding 
the non-derogable right of freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment<i>, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that it is essential to ensure that prosecutors possess the professional 
qualifications required for the performance of their functions through improved methods of 
recruitment and legal and professional training, and through the provision of all necessary 
means for the proper performance of their role in combating criminality, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that every State should provide an effective framework of remedies to 
redress human rights grievances or violations and that the administration of justice, 
including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent 
judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in 
international human rights instruments, is essential to the full and non-discriminatory 
realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and 
sustainable development,

judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court officials,
