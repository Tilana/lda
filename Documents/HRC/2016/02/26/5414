<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 9/9, the Human Rights Council invited the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene, within existing resources, an 
expert consultation, open to the participation of Governments, regional organizations, relevant 
United Nations bodies and civil society organizations, and in consultation with the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), on the issue of protecting the human rights of civilians in 
armed conflict, and requested OHCHR to report on the outcome of that consultation, in the form 
of a summary of discussions on the above-mentioned issue, to the Council at its eleventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. The expert consultation was announced on the public website of OHCHR. 
On 9 April 2009, notes verbales were sent to all permanent missions in Geneva and the President 
of the Human Rights Council. The expert consultation was held in Geneva on 15 April 2009, in 
consultation with ICRC, in accordance with Council resolution 9/9. The expert consultation was 
chaired by Professor Georges Abi-Saab, former judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber and Honorary Professor, Graduate Institute of 
International and Development Studies (see also annex). Representatives from 16 Member 
States: Algeria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Hungary, 
Pakistan, Qatar, the Russia Federation, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the Syrian Arab Republic, 
Turkey and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and one from the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) attended the meeting as observers. The present report 
provides a summary of the discussion by the experts. The draft was circulated to the experts for 
comments. All comments received were taken into consideration when finalizing the report. 
When reviewing the report, ICRC confirmed that the expert meeting had been organized in 
consultation with it. It further stated that many of the questions raised during the expert 
consultation were not, in its view, settled international law. Therefore, ICRC considered it 
difficult to draw any definitive conclusions at the current stage on many of the substantive legal 
matters involved or on procedural aspects on improving compliance, such as monitoring and 
similar mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. The expert consultation comprised one opening session and three substantive sessions.  
The substantive sessions were structured around three thematic issues: (a) the legal framework, 
namely the continued application of international human rights law in situations of armed 
conflict; (b) the relationship between international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, including the complementary and mutually reinforcing application of human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, the question of lex specialis, issues arising from 
the application of article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other 
rights of particular relevance; and (c) implementation and monitoring of human rights 
obligations in situations of armed conflict and accountability for violations, in particular 
appropriate mechanisms to monitor the implementation of human rights in situations of armed 
conflict, as well as mechanisms to ensure accountability for violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the expert consultation. 
The High Commissioner recalled that, in recent decades, many millions of innocent lives of 
civilians had been claimed and tens of millions more have been permanently displaced. Homes </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>had been destroyed, while access to life-saving food, medicine and shelter had been denied. 
Grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were common to many 
armed conflicts. Civilians had become the primary target of attacks motivated by ethnic or 
religious hatred, political confrontation or simply the ruthless pursuit of economic interests. It 
was the duty of the international community as a whole to see how best it could enhance human 
rights and humanitarian law protections. International human rights law and international 
humanitarian law shared the common goal of preserving the dignity and humanity of all. 
</p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner recalled that, over the years, the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and, more recently, the Human Rights Council had expressed the 
view that, in situations of armed conflict, parties to the conflict had legally binding obligations 
concerning the rights of persons affected by the conflict. The Council had also recognized the 
importance and urgency of these problems. In line with recent international jurisprudence and 
the practice of relevant treaty bodies, the Council acknowledged that human rights law and 
international humanitarian law were complementary and mutually reinforcing. It also considered 
that human rights law continued to apply in armed conflict situations, taking into account when 
international humanitarian law applies as lex specialis. The Council reiterated that effective 
measures to guarantee and monitor the implementation of human rights should be taken in 
respect of civilian populations in situations of armed conflict, and that effective protection 
against violations of their human rights should be provided in accordance with international 
human rights and applicable international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>6. Concerning the legal framework, the High Commissioner recalled that, as an international 
criminal judge, she had witnessed the interaction between human rights norms and humanitarian 
law principles. In order to apply the adequate standards of international criminal accountability, 
it was useful and even essential to take into due account the different forms of protection offered 
by international human rights and international humanitarian law. The protection of the human 
rights of civilians was better served when this complementarity between international human 
rights and international humanitarian law were duly enforced. The International Court of Justice 
had recognized the dual and complementary application of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, in both its advisory opinions and its contentious cases. The 
Court, in its judgment on the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo 
(<i>Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i>) case brought into its judgment the criteria 
defined in the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the occupied Palestinian 
Territory advisory opinion concerning the complementary application of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict. Similarly, the 
International Criminal Court had also recognized the importance of human rights in its analysis 
of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. 
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner pointed out that the issues dealt with during the expert 
consultation were, therefore, not purely theoretical. The impact of these issues on the ground was 
visible on a daily basis. The challenge ahead was, on the one hand, to reflect on more effective 
ways to ensure that human rights and humanitarian law obligations were respected by parties to a 
conflict. On the other hand, when violations did occur, the analysis should focus on the means to 
ensure accountability for those violations. Also important was the discussion on the relationship </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including the 
complementary and mutually reinforcing application of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law; the question of lex specialis; the issues arising from the application of article 4 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and other rights of particular 
relevance. The High Commissioner referred to the list of non-derogable rights included in the 
International Covenant. Beyond that, however, she invited experts to consider other rights of 
particular relevance, including in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, for instance, 
the discussion on the rights of those persons detained in the context of armed conflict and the 
extent of judicial guarantees that should be provided to them, as well as the question of how to 
articulate access to food, medicine and shelter as rights during a situation of armed conflict. 
International criminal law had much to offer in that direction, particularly when it considered 
that deprivation of access to food and medicine may constitute, under certain circumstances, an 
international crime. Lastly, on the question of implementation and monitoring of human rights 
obligations in situations of armed conflict and the issue of accountability for violations, the 
High Commissioner indicated that this was the era for accountability and that the protection of 
human rights was significantly advanced when individuals were held to account for their acts. 
</p>
<p>8. Professor Georges Abi-Saab introduced the meeting by recalling the history of the 
evolution of the notion of protection of civilians. He indicated that, in 1968, the 
General Assembly, in its resolution 2444 (XXIII), invited the Secretary-General to, inter alia, 
study possible steps to secure the better application of existing protections in all armed conflicts. 
Several reports thereon were submitted by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly. 
Professor Abi-Saab also recalled that, more recently, the Commission on Human Rights 
acknowledged, in its resolution 2005/63, that human rights law and international humanitarian 
law were mutually reinforcing, and considered that the protection provided by human rights law 
continued in armed conflict situations, taking into account when international humanitarian law 
applied as lex specialis. The Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
took up the issue at its fifty-sixth session. A working paper on the relationship between human 
rights law and international humanitarian law was submitted at the fifty-seventh session dealing 
with the same issue, particularly from the perspective of their complementary application in the 
light of the practice of human rights treaty bodies and special procedures. Professor Abi-Saab 
also highlighted that the Human Rights Committee, in its general comments Nos. 29 (2001)  
and 31 (2004), dealt with the questions of the applicability of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights in situations of armed conflict, and recalled that the human rights obligations 
contained therein applied in situations of armed conflict to which the rules of international 
humanitarian law were applicable. Furthermore, the International Court of Justice, in its<i> Legality 
of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i> and<i> The wall</i> advisory opinions, as well as in the 
<i>Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i> case, also dealt with the question of the 
complementary application of international human rights law and international humanitarian law 
in situations of armed conflict. Lastly, Professor Abi-Saab pointed out that, in its resolution 9/9, 
the Council acknowledged that human rights law and international humanitarian law were 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, that all human rights require protection equally and 
that the protection provided by human rights law continued in armed conflict situations, taking 
into account when international humanitarian law applied as lex specialis. The Council also 
underlined the exceptional and temporary nature of derogations to human rights obligations and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>reiterated that effective measures to guarantee and monitor the implementation of human rights 
should be taken in respect of civilian populations in situations of armed conflict, including 
people under foreign occupation, and that effective protection against violations of their human 
rights should be provided, in accordance with international human rights law and applicable 
international humanitarian law. The discussions are summarized in the paragraphs below. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK:  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (SESSION 1) 
</b></p>
<p>9. The question of the complementary and mutually reinforcing nature of international human 
rights and international humanitarian law was thoroughly discussed. The relationship between 
the two bodies of law was analysed from the perspective of three different areas: (a) the scope of 
application; (b) the question of the subjects of the law; and (c) issues relating to the application 
of international human rights and international humanitarian law to particular cases. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the question of scope of application, it was generally indicated that 
international human rights law applied at all times, while international humanitarian law applied 
to situations of armed conflict, both international and non-international. The Human Rights 
Committee, in its general comment No. 31, reiterated that the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights continued to apply in situations of armed conflict to which the rules of 
international humanitarian law were applicable. This position had been reiterated by the 
International Court of Justice in <i>The wall</i> advisory opinion, as well as in the 
<i>Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i> decision. 
11. It was noted that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contained 
provisions dealing with states of emergency, including during situations of international or 
non-international armed conflict, which applied if and to the extent that the situation constituted 
a threat to the life of the nation. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, for 
example, envisaged that certain treaty obligations could be derogated from in situations of public 
emergency that threaten the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed. 
It was recalled that article 4, paragraph 2, of the Covenant explicitly indicated the Covenant 
obligations that were non-derogable, including the right to life, the prohibition of torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishment, or of medical or scientific experimentation without consent, 
the prohibition of slavery, slave trade and servitude, the prohibition of imprisonment on the 
ground of inability to fulfil a contractual obligation, the principle of legality in the field of 
criminal law, the recognition of everyone as a person before the law, and the freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion. It was pointed out, however, that even when derogations to human 
rights obligations were lawful, they were often not adequate to the situation they were trying to 
address. It was argued that it was often possible to achieve the same or more effective results 
through the application of lawful limitation clauses. 
</p>
<p>12. It was recalled that, in order for international humanitarian law to be applicable, it had to 
be demonstrated that the situation amounted to an armed conflict. It was noted that the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia had indicated that, in order to be 
considered an armed conflict, hostilities had to be protracted rather than sporadic. Below this </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>threshold, international humanitarian law was not applicable and only human rights law applied. 
In recent cases, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia had alluded to a 
large variety of criteria that could be taken into account to determine the existence of a situation 
of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>13. Concerning the concurrent application of international human rights and international 
humanitarian law to particular cases in situations of armed conflict, it was pointed out that both 
bodies of law were complementary and not mutually exclusive. In this context, it was recalled 
that, as the International Court of Justice had recognized in <i>The wall</i> advisory opinion and in the 
<i>Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i> decision, the protection offered by human rights 
conventions did not cease in the event of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for 
derogation of the kind found in article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. It was recalled that the Court envisaged three possible situations with regard to the 
relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law: (a) some rights may 
be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; (b) others may be exclusively matters 
of human rights law; (c) yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law. 
Some experts explained that bodies of law as such did not function as lex specialis. It was 
recalled that the lex specialis principle meant simply that, in situations of conflicts of norms, the 
most detailed and specific rule should be chosen over the more general rule, on the basis of a 
case-by-case analysis, irrespective of whether it was a human rights or a humanitarian law norm. 
The issue of complementarity was also further discussed in the session that followed. 
</p>
<p>14. It was recalled that the Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 29, indicated 
that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applied also in situations of armed 
conflict to which the rules of international humanitarian law were applicable. Given that both 
bodies of law were complementary, with regard to certain rights envisaged by the International 
Covenant, more specific rules of international humanitarian law may be especially relevant for 
the purposes of the interpretation of those rights. It was highlighted that there had to be some 
type of test against which each situation would need to be assessed in order for the most 
adequate legal framework to be determined. There was a suggestion that such a test could be 
framed in the context of effective control: the more effective the control over persons or 
territory, the more applicable human rights law would be. In this respect, it was argued that the 
human rights law paradigm posited effective control over a population, while the international 
humanitarian law paradigm posited a breakdown of power as a result of armed conflict. As a way 
to inform the lex specialis principle in the context of armed conflict, it was suggested that, the 
more stable the situation, the more the human rights paradigm would be applicable; the less 
stability and effective control, the more the international humanitarian law paradigm would be 
applicable to supplement human rights law. This approach nevertheless may raise complex legal 
questions. 
</p>
<p>15. It was underscored that effective control over individuals could occur in a context of the 
overall lack of control of a territory. Lack of control over territory should not, however, lead to 
ignoring the human rights paradigm. Moreover, it is also possible to have real control over 
individuals in non-stable environments. In those situations, international humanitarian law may 
offer better protection than human rights law. In this respect, it should be taken into account that 
control over individuals did not mean that there was total control over territory. Similarly, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>control over territory did not imply total control over individuals. Therefore, it was suggested 
that the more effective the control a State had over a territory or a population, the more the 
human rights paradigm applied. Nevertheless, some international humanitarian law rules may be 
the lex specialis, because it had the more specialized rules for a particular situation of armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>16. It was stated that measures taken by States in the &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, which was not, as such, 
an armed conflict, had led to confusion concerning the applicable legal standards. When States 
pursue potential members of armed groups, or alleged terrorists, international human rights law 
remained applicable regarding all issues including, inter alia, detention, treatment and fair trial. 
In addition, international humanitarian law may be applicable, depending on the qualification of 
each specific situation on a case-by-case basis and on whether the pursuit had a link with an 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>17. The territorial scope of application of both bodies of law was discussed. It was recalled 
that, in conformity with the rules of interpretation laid out in the Vienna Convention on the Law 
of Treaties, the Human Rights Committee had interpreted article 2 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights as calling for the application of States&#8217; human rights obligations 
concerning all individuals within their territory and to all individuals subject to their jurisdiction. 
This interpretation was consistent with the context and with the object and purpose of the treaty. 
Concerning international humanitarian law, it was pointed out that, in the case of international 
armed conflicts, it applied to parties to a conflict, irrespective of territorial considerations. In 
situations of non-international armed conflicts, international humanitarian law applied within the 
territory of the State engaged in armed conflict against non-State entities. Nevertheless, it was 
also highlighted that, increasingly, non-international armed conflicts had an international 
component owing to the phenomenon of cross-border hostilities. Also, the participation of 
foreign troops in non-international armed conflicts, with the consent of the territorial State or 
under the authority of the Security Council, added a transnational element to these conflicts that 
was not explicitly regulated in international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to the question of the subjects of the law, questions were raised about the 
obligations of non-State actors under international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law. While it was clear that both bodies of law mainly established legal obligations 
for States, it was discussed how each one also regulated the conduct of non-State actors and 
international organizations. Concerning non-State actors, it was highlighted that, in accordance 
with common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, and more generally international 
humanitarian law rules applicable to non-international armed conflicts, non-State actors engaged 
in a non-international armed conflict had, as a minimum, international humanitarian law 
obligations to protect persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed 
forces who had laid down their arms and those placed <i>hors de combat</i>, as well as further 
obligations provided for in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions and customary 
international law. On the other hand, the extent of human rights obligations of non-State actors 
was not clear as they were not usually parties to human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding the issue of whether international organizations participating in an armed 
conflict have human rights and international humanitarian law obligations, it was discussed </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>whether the obligations were actually incumbent upon the organization or the States contributing 
with military personnel, or upon both. In the context of international humanitarian law, it was 
considered that responsibility could be attributed to both the international organization and the 
contributing States. Concerning human rights obligations, it was indicated that the European 
Court of Human Rights decided in the case of <i>Behrami v. France</i> that human rights obligations 
could be attributed to international organizations. Experts noted that a similar issue was currently 
before the European Court in a number of cases. It was nevertheless recalled that, with regard to 
the United Nations, the Organization as a matter of policy sought to observe the highest 
standards of behaviour when conducting peacekeeping operations. In this respect, the bulletin of 
the Secretary-General on the observance by the United Nations forces of international 
humanitarian law provided some policy guidance as to the fundamental principles and rules of 
international humanitarian law that applied to United Nations forces when actively engaged in 
situations of armed conflict as combatants, to the extent and for the duration of their engagement, 
although this did not reflect the entire body of international humanitarian law obligations 
applicable to United Nations forces as a matter of international law. Moreover, it was 
underscored that it should be borne in mind that the Charter of the United Nations recognized the 
protection and promotion of human rights as one of the fundamental principles of the 
Organization. Some may argue that, although the United Nations was not a party to international 
human rights or international humanitarian law treaties, the Organization was nonetheless bound 
by customary international law. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (SESSION 2) 
</b></p>
<p>20. It was recalled that the discussion on the interaction between human rights law and 
international humanitarian law was part of a broader legal debate on the question of the 
fragmentation and unity of international law. On the one hand, there was normative 
fragmentation owing to the creation of functional areas in international law; on the other, all 
these areas were highly permeable and closely interrelated, as is the case between human rights 
law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, refugee law, disarmament and 
arms control law, and environment law, among others. It was underscored that, in recent years, 
there had been the development of a public interest area in international law, in which the 
individual was at the centre. As a result, recent legal debates had concentrated on developing 
mechanisms to ensure maximum protection for the individual. For instance, it was recalled that, 
in a number of cases, one body of law required a <i>renvoi</i> to another body of law, for example 
common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, which uses concepts also referred to in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Similarly, human rights law on certain occasions 
needed to be interpreted in the context of international humanitarian law, as done by the 
International Court of Justice in the context of the advisory opinion on nuclear weapons.  
</p>
<p>21. It was also recalled that human rights courts, such as the European Court of Human Rights 
and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, had developed further the applicable legal 
framework. The international criminal tribunals, developments in the peace and security sector, 
and Security Council resolutions, as was the case in resolution 1820 (2008) on violence against 
women, had further contributed to legal developments. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>22. It was suggested that the question of the complementary and mutually reinforcing nature of 
international human rights and international humanitarian law had been interpreted in different 
ways. For example, in its resolution 5/1 on institution-building, the Human Rights Council 
referred to the complementary and mutually interrelated nature of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law, while in its resolution 9/9, it acknowledged that both bodies 
of law were mutually reinforcing. It was questioned whether there is any real difference between 
&#8220;mutually interrelated&#8221;, as indicated in resolution 5/1, and &#8220;mutually reinforcing&#8221;, as mentioned 
in resolution 9/9. It was suggested that &#8220;mutually reinforcing&#8221; implied a reinforcement to do 
something. Since the aim of both bodies of law was to protect human dignity and in particular 
that of civilians taking no part in hostilities, it was pointed out that the Council had moved from 
a neutral statement about the interconnection between the two bodies of law to a more purposeful 
one. In that respect, it was suggested that, if the debate focused on the mutually reinforcing 
aspect, it would be easier to choose the best rules to achieve the goal of protecting the rights of 
civilians. 
</p>
<p>23. Concerning the question of complementarity, it was highlighted that both human rights law 
and international humanitarian law informed each other in a number of ways. For instance, in 
order to determine what constituted an arbitrary deprivation of life in the context of a given 
armed conflict, human rights law had to take into account the specific conditions set out by 
international humanitarian law applicable to the particular type of conflict. This test was 
particularly difficult in situations of non-international armed conflicts, because that type of 
conflict had to fulfil an intensity criterion (protracted armed violence as the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia had indicated and as mentioned earlier) as well as 
the organization criterion (the determination that non-States parties to the conflict are sufficiently 
organized to confront the State or each other with military means). These criteria, however, 
raised difficulties because often Governments refused to acknowledge that violence had reached 
the level of a situation of &#8220;armed conflict&#8221; on their territory, nor the existence of armed groups 
with a certain degree of organization operating within their territory. These situations raised 
issues with regard to the respect of applicable law, since the Government&#8217;s denial of the 
existence of an internal armed conflict made it difficult to argue in favour of the application of 
international humanitarian law as a complementary source for human rights law, which remained 
applicable. In this respect, it was pointed out that under international humanitarian law, the legal 
qualification of conflicts was based on facts and was independent of political determination by 
the parties.  
</p>
<p>24. In the light of the above-mentioned difficulties regarding situations of non-international 
armed conflicts, it was argued that human rights law and international humanitarian law were 
complementary to the extent that the latter reinforced the joint aim of protecting human dignity. 
In non-international armed conflicts, the traditional reciprocity approach of international 
humanitarian law was unworkable. It was underscored that there was a natural imbalance 
between a State party to an armed conflict and a non-State party, because the latter was 
accountable under criminal law for acts carried out against Government forces. Thus, since the 
reciprocity approach would be hardly acceptable in the context of non-international armed 
conflicts, the better paradigm to apply was that of human rights law. It was further recalled that, 
when discussing the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>it should be borne in mind that both bodies of law had very similar objectives. In that respect, 
while humanitarian law contained sufficient legal norms to regulate the use of force in 
international armed conflicts, there was no similar regulation in non-international armed 
conflicts and, therefore, human rights law was the most suitable legal framework. 
</p>
<p>25. The question of international legal standards applicable to detention in the context of 
armed conflicts was discussed as another example of the complex relationship between 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law. It was recalled that 
international humanitarian law, under certain conditions, allowed for a form of administrative 
detention designated as internment. The internment of prisoners of war and civilians in 
international armed conflict was regulated by the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. The 
Fourth Geneva Convention regulated issues concerning the internment of civilians in articles 42, 
43 and 78 regarding situations of international armed conflict. Article 75 of Additional Protocol I 
to the Geneva Conventions further provided for certain guarantees to detained persons in the 
context of international armed conflicts. It was pointed out that, while international humanitarian 
law contained provisions dealing with detention in international armed conflicts, there were still 
gaps of protection that could only be filled in by human rights law, such as the issue of judicial 
review of detention. Moreover, international humanitarian law contained general rules on 
internment in situations of non-international armed conflicts in articles 5 and 6 of Additional 
Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions. It was further noted that the preamble to Additional 
Protocol II recalled that international instruments relating to human rights offered basic 
protection to the human person. Therefore, in view of the complementarity of human rights law 
and international humanitarian law, the extent of guarantees and protections to be observed with 
regard to civilian detainees during an armed conflict could be fleshed out by reference to both 
bodies of law. 
</p>
<p>26. The situation was more problematic, however, when the question concerned which rules 
should be applied by non-State armed groups in cases of deprivation of liberty. It was indicated 
that some may oppose the application of human rights obligations on detention to armed groups, 
particularly because the issue of detention was closely tied to the question of justice, which was 
seen as a sovereign function of the State. Nevertheless, the application of the principle of 
humane treatment spelled out in common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions provided a 
minimum threshold of protection that non-State actors should be called to observe.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the framework for the conduct of non-State actors, it was further pointed 
out that certain international mechanisms, such as fact-finding commissions, could look at the 
application of both human rights law and international humanitarian law by States and non-State 
actors. Similarly, special rapporteurs had also looked at the conduct of non-State actors. It was 
further pointed out that there were examples of human rights treaties containing provisions 
explicitly related to obligations of non-State armed groups. For instance, article 4 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict clearly stipulated that armed groups that were distinct from Government armed forces 
should not, under any circumstance, recruit or use in hostilities persons under the age of 
18 years. It was recalled that, during the negotiations on the Protocol, questions were raised as to 
whether that provision embodied a human rights or an international humanitarian law norm. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>Parties to the negotiation clearly decided that it was a human rights provision rather than a 
humanitarian law rule. However, the wording of the provision in article 4 of the Protocol was 
carefully chosen. By using the word &#8220;should&#8221;, drafters had wished to differentiate between the 
obligations of non-State actors and those bestowed upon States, which were qualified by the 
word &#8220;shall&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>28. The consequences of armed conflict on other human rights, particularly economic and 
social rights, were also discussed. The question of armed conflict and the use of child labour was 
highlighted. It was pointed out that the United Nations Study on the Impact of Armed Conflict 
on Children established that the categories of children who became child soldiers were the same 
as those who were child labourers in peacetime. It was pointed out that, as recognized in 
Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization (ILO), child soldiering was a form 
of child labour. It was also indicated that the prohibition of child labour was an area in which 
human rights law and international humanitarian law were complementary and mutually 
reinforcing. Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provided that an occupying Power 
could not force children under 18 years of age to undertake compulsory labour. This provision 
was in line with the standards adopted by ILO, the norms contained in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Optional 
Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions also contained provisions on the use of child 
labour. It was also recalled that the International Court of Justice, in its decision on <i>Democratic 
Republic of the Congo v. Uganda</i>, held that Uganda had violated its obligations under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict by its recruitment and failure to 
prevent recruitment of children in areas under Ugandan control. 
</p>
<p>29. It was noted that certain rights were often neglected in discussions on the relationship 
between human rights law and international humanitarian law, such as the right to education. 
The monitoring and reporting mechanism on children affected by armed conflict established 
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), for example, addressed attacks on schools 
rather than the effects of armed conflict on the right to education, including the closure of 
schools owing to attacks and other threats. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN 
SITUATIONS OF ARMED CONFLICT AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
FOR VIOLATIONS (SESSION 3) 
</b></p>
<p>30. Regarding the issue of implementation and monitoring of human rights in situations of 
armed conflict, it was indicated that compliance was achieved if the elements of implementation, 
monitoring and accountability were observed. It was noted that the very important element of 
actual protection was lacking and that just to monitor respect and to ensure accountability for 
alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law violations was, indeed, an important 
element for the victims, but not enough. It was emphasized that victims needed to be proactively 
protected from violations of their human rights. It was pointed out that the question was what 
mechanisms were capable of ensuring such protection. There were two categories of 
international actors with protection mandates: peacekeeping forces and police forces in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping operations with a mandate to protect civilians (such as the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo); and humanitarian 
organizations, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ICRC, 
UNICEF and the protection clusters of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.  
</p>
<p>31. The question to be clarified was what protection meant in terms of approaches and 
activities. According to ICRC and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, protection denoted all 
activities aimed at ensuring equal access to and enjoyment by civilians in situations of armed 
conflict of their rights as human beings as embodied in international human rights instruments 
and international humanitarian law. This understanding of protection covered all categories of 
human rights, including action that prevented or put a stop to a specific pattern of abuse and/or 
alleviated its immediate effects, such as responsive measures, including protection through 
presence, advocacy and negotiations with relevant actors, triggering interventions at higher 
levels, and through public denunciation; protection activities aimed at restoring people&#8217;s dignity 
and at ensuring adequate living conditions through reparation, restitution and rehabilitation, 
including by providing access to justice, ending impunity, setting up mechanisms for restitution 
of property, as well as creating and running institutions for the rehabilitation of victims; and 
activities aimed at fostering an environment conducive to respect for the rights of individuals. It 
was agreed that protection activities aimed to prevent violations of human rights; to stop ongoing 
violations; to prevent the recurrence of violations; and to repair, restore, rehabilitate or 
compensate victims and their families when violations had taken place. 
</p>
<p>32. The issue of how certain monitoring and investigation mechanisms could contribute not 
only to establishing accountability for human rights and humanitarian law violations, but also 
help prevent such violations in the future was also discussed. While it was recognized that 
accountability mechanisms did not directly address prevention measures, they should not be seen 
in a vacuum. Instead, what was needed was a multipronged and multisectoral approach whereby 
measures for ongoing protection, rehabilitation and accountability were regarded as a package. 
The Human Rights Council and human rights treaty bodies had adjusted their mechanisms to 
respond to situations of armed conflict. For example, the Council had held special sessions to 
analyse the human rights situations in different parts of the world and had dispatched, on a 
number of occasions, fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry comprising of 
independent persons or building upon the specialist expertise of thematic special rapporteurs. It 
had also brought a number of thematic rapporteurs together to provide a joint assessment of the 
factual and legal responsibility of the parties to a conflict from their different perspectives. It was 
argued that the underlying rationale was presumably twofold: on the one hand, providing the 
Council and the international community with an independent and authoritative statement of 
what had occurred; on the other, a change of behaviour was sought by naming and shaming those 
allegedly responsible for human rights and humanitarian law violations. 
</p>
<p>33. Concerning fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry, it was argued that they had 
a mandate that was mainly oriented towards the victims and survivors of human rights abuses. 
They provided a forum for individuals to express themselves and to explain what had happened 
to them, even if not directly to the perpetrators. The process offered an opportunity to provide 
and make available a record of events and their consequences that had been carefully considered </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>and corroborated by independent outsiders. A report of a human rights fact-finding mission 
could thus become integral to building a file of authoritative information for subsequent use. The 
mission could provide a bridge between the commission of human rights abuses at a specific 
time and place and some future time when other processes for accountability and justice become 
politically possible. The need to have a true process of accountability as a result of a fact-finding 
mission was further stressed. It was recalled that the Human Rights Council and the Security 
Council had appointed a number of fact-finding missions, but only on rare occasions had their 
findings led to criminal investigations at the national or the international level, such as in the 
case of Darfur. It was also pointed out that, while international fact-finding missions and 
commissions of inquiry had been effective in addressing human rights and humanitarian law 
violations, national commissions of inquiry could also be effective in addressing issues related to 
violations of the rights of civilians in armed conflict. It was indicated that very few good 
practices had unfortunately been identified at the national level. 
</p>
<p>34. The fundamental role of judicial mechanisms and the contribution of courts in terms of 
establishing knowledge of human rights violations, in particular, the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, was 
acknowledged. Some domestic courts in Latin America had also been instrumental in clarifying 
facts relating to enforced disappearances. Emphasis was put on the experience of hybrid courts, 
such as the courts in Sierra Leone and in Cambodia, where the combination of international and 
national justice could bear positive results while respecting both international legal standards and 
national sensitivities. 
</p>
<p>35. It was recalled that, besides treaty obligations, there was another normative framework 
applicable to situations of armed conflict. The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and 
Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (General Assembly resolution 60/147) and 
the Updated Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to 
combat impunity (E/CN.<footnote name="4">4. In sum, the experts explored in detail the position already affirmed, inter alia, by the 
International Court of Justice and by the human rights treaty bodies regarding the 
complementary application of international human rights and international humanitarian law to 
situations of armed conflict as two interrelated and mutually reinforcing bodies of law. It was 
pointed out that, in the era of global media, the spread of information had allowed for these 
violations to reach the public opinion, which had put significant pressure on States to act to end 
them.  </footnote>/2005/102/Add.1) established important parameters that needed to be 
observed in the context of armed conflict. The Reparations Principles were of particular 
importance because they were adopted by the General Assembly by consensus. In its 
resolution 60/147, the Assembly further indicated that the principles did not entail new 
international or domestic legal obligations, but identified mechanisms, modalities, procedures 
and methods for the implementation of existing legal obligations under international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, which are complementary though different as to 
their norms. According to the Reparations Principles, States had an obligation to respect, ensure 
respect and implement human rights and international humanitarian law. The Principles also 
provided for the duty to investigate violations effectively, thoroughly, promptly and impartially. 
It was also recalled that the Impunity Principles established three main fundamental rights that 
States should observe regarding human rights violations: the right to the truth; the right to 
justice; and the right to reparations for victims. The Human Rights Committee had further 
analysed the question of the right to reparation, including from the perspective of guarantees of 
non-repetition, satisfaction and compensation, as mechanisms to ensure protection of the human 
rights of civilians in armed conflict. It was pointed out that the right to truth was an evolving 
issue in the context of the Human Rights Council, which had adopted a number of resolutions on 
this matter. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/31 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>36. It was indicated that the establishment of the right to the truth through judicial mechanisms 
as well as non-judicial mechanisms, such as truth commissions, should be underscored. It was 
also pointed out that the right to justice entailed the duty of States to undertake prompt, 
thorough, independent and impartial investigations of alleged human rights and humanitarian 
law violations, and to take appropriate measures with respect to perpetrators, in particular in the 
area of criminal justice. It was highlighted that the prosecution of human rights and humanitarian 
law violations had proved to be an important deterrent of further violations and, therefore, an 
important mechanism for ensuring the protection of civilians. Moreover, measures to enhance 
national accountability systems were of great importance because they constituted a first layer of 
protection, particularly in the area of investigation and prosecution. Having functioning and 
capable judicial systems was also fundamental because they were an entry point for the 
investigation and prosecution of gross violations of human rights, crimes against humanity, war 
crimes and genocide. By virtue of the complementarity principle contained in the statute of the 
International Criminal Court, States had an interest in ensuring that their legal systems were 
capable and willing to undertake criminal investigations of gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law if they wished to retain jurisdiction over 
such cases.  
</p>
<p>37. The Human Rights Council and its special procedures had contributed substantially to 
protecting civilian populations in armed conflict. Special rapporteurs had played a key role in 
identifying violations and showing where national systems could be improved. It was pointed out 
that many States had unfortunately not adequately followed up on the recommendations of 
special rapporteurs, nor had they used them as a framework for reform. 
</p>
<p>38. It was recalled that the universal periodic review mechanism, in accordance with Council 
resolution 5/1, had also a mandate to take into account applicable international humanitarian law, 
given the complementary and mutually interrelated nature of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>39. The Commission of Inquiry on Darfur had addressed two main recommendations to the 
Security Council: the first, to refer the situation of Darfur to the International Criminal Court, 
which was followed by the Security Council; the second, to establish an international 
compensation commission. The latter recommendation was not implemented. In this respect, it 
was pointed out that the aspect of the rights of victims had not been paid sufficient attention in 
the international debate. This situation needed to be addressed urgently. 
</p>
<p>40. Another mechanism that had functioned effectively to protect the civilian population, such 
as minorities, indigenous populations, farmers and displaced persons, from the effects of armed 
conflict in the Latin American context had been the application of provisional measures adopted 
by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The mechanism, implemented in conjunction 
with other protection measures, had put pressure on Governments to take measures to protect the 
civilian population. 
</p>
<p>41. It was pointed out that, while the international system provided for mechanisms of 
accountability for human rights violations, there was no similar mechanism for violations of 
international humanitarian law. In this respect, while human rights violations were dealt with by </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/31 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>regional human rights courts, human rights treaty bodies and other quasijudicial mechanisms, as 
well as the Council&#8217;s own mechanisms, the right to justice and reparation of victims of violations 
of international humanitarian law beyond what constituted international crimes did not have 
equivalent international mechanisms. Some pointed out that the problem seemed to be more 
political than legal, because it was difficult for some States to accept to hold parties to a conflict 
accountable for violations of humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>42. It was argued that there were two options to address the above issue. First, to create, 
instead of ad hoc commissions of inquiry, a permanent commission of inquiry with a mandate to 
investigate violations of international humanitarian law. It was also pointed out that the 
international fact-finding commission established by article 90 of Protocol I to the Geneva 
Conventions had the potential to fulfil this task. Owing to the dual consent required by article 90, 
the commission had never functioned since its creation. As a result of the absence of adequate 
mechanisms of accountability for international humanitarian law, the Security Council decided 
to create ad hoc tribunals to ensure that crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide in the 
contexts of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda were duly investigated and those responsible 
prosecuted. It was pointed out that these existing international criminal law mechanisms and 
human rights monitoring and fact-finding mechanisms did not have compulsory jurisdiction. 
What was required were mechanisms that could ensure protection when potential violations 
could take place, namely, the means to prevent and mechanisms of early warning of potential 
human rights and humanitarian law violations. The second option was to encourage the existing 
international human rights machinery to look into violations of both human rights and 
international humanitarian law. It was recalled that the Inter-American and the European human 
rights systems, as well as the Human Rights Committee, had already started using the 
international humanitarian law framework to interpret their respective human rights law 
framework. Such a course of action could require judges and human rights experts to be given 
adequate training to be able to interpret and apply the correct rules of human rights and/or 
humanitarian law to a specific situation. It was also considered that these mechanisms did not 
have a specific mandate to apply international humanitarian law, which explained why regional 
human rights courts sometimes had difficulty in reconciling obligations under both bodies of 
law. 
</p>
<p>43. It was recalled that, in 2003, ICRC held a regional expert seminar on improving 
compliance with international humanitarian law. The report on the seminar highlighted different 
options to tackle gaps in compliance. The experts participating in the seminar were of the 
opinion that the obstacles to the establishment of accountability mechanisms were mainly posed 
by lack of political will rather than by legal considerations.
