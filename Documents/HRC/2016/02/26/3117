</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
to race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations, the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention against 
Discrimination in Education, </p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of 
migrants, and the work of various special mechanisms of the Council that have reported on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, </p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants, regardless 
of their legal status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
international instruments to which they are party, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, inter 
alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant international instruments, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also </i>the need for adequate financial resources so that everyone can 
realize his or her right to education and the importance in this regard of national resource 
mobilization and international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Global Forum on Migration and Development process, including the 
debates on migratory mobility, which emphasize the importance of facilitating access to 
regular forms of migration and, where applicable, to social services, including education, 
that contribute to the strengthening of the personal development prospects and outcomes for 
migrants and their families, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>about the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and 
children, who place themselves in a vulnerable situation by attempting to cross international 
borders without the required travel documents, and recognizing the obligation of States to 
respect the human rights of those migrants, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering </i>that, in accordance with their international human rights obligations, 
States are responsible for promoting and protecting human rights, including the right to 
education, without discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the observation of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education that 
States&#8217; obligations to ensure the provision of adequate resources to overcome constraints to 
</p>
<p>the realization of the right to education consistently figure in the concluding observations 
adopted by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies,1 
</p>
<p><i>Considering </i>the need for all relevant stakeholders to achieve the goals of the 
Education for All initiative as well as  Millennium Development Goal 2, as contained in the 
outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the 
General Assembly, by, inter alia, tackling persistent economic and social inequalities, 
including on the basis of such factors as income, gender, location, ethnicity, language and 
disability, and noting the role that good governance can play in that regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time when migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the fact that, in the fulfilment of their obligations to protect human rights, 
States of origin, transit and destination can benefit from schemes of international 
cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful also </i>that migrant access to education may help to mitigate the risk of 
widening inequalities in education, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Reaffirms </i>the duty of States to effectively promote and protect the human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of women and children, 
regardless of their immigration status, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the international instruments to which they are party; 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Stresses </i>that education contributes to the full enjoyment of human rights; 
</p>

<p>3.<i> Calls upon </i>States to recognize and respect the right of everyone to education, 
as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and encourages them to take 
steps that promote the prevention and elimination of discriminatory policies that deny 
migrant children and children of migrants access to education; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses </i>concern at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, including the 
enjoyment of the right to education; </p>
<p>5. <i>Reaffirms </i>that, when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement 
migration and border security measures, States have the duty to comply with their 
obligations under international law, including international human rights law, in order to 
ensure full respect for the human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the fact that all migrants are entitled to equal protection by the 
law and that all persons, regardless of their migratory status, are equal before the courts and 
tribunals and, in the determination of their rights and obligations in a suit at law, are 
entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 
established by law; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to ensure that their immigration policies are consistent 
with their obligations under international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges </i>States to take specific measures to promote access to education for 
everyone, including by taking into account physical, financial, cultural and linguistic 
barriers that may contribute to furthering inequalities; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages </i>countries of origin, transit and destination to seek technical 
assistance and/or to collaborate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to better promote and protect the human rights of migrants, including the 
right to education; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to education, within their respective mandates, to continue 
their efforts to promote and support the building of greater synergies among States to 
strengthen cooperation and assistance for the protection of the human rights of all migrants 
and to promote their right to education; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Also requests </i>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants to 
continue to report<b> </b>on practical solutions, including by identifying best practices and 
concrete areas and means for international cooperation, in order to enhance the protection 
of human rights of migrants.
