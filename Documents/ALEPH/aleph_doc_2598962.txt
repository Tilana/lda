SECTION 1.0 – SUMMARY
1.1
Project Description
Mr.  Scott  Angus,  President  of  Rolling  Rock  Resources  Corporation  requested  Beacon  Hill  Consultants 
(1988) Ltd. to complete a Preliminary Assessment of the Monument Bay property. This report describes 
the results of the work.
The  Monument  Bay  property  is  located  in  northeastern  Manitoba,  immediately  adjacent  to  the 
Manitoba/Ontario  Provincial  boundary.  It  is  approximately  570  kilometers  (km)  northeast  of  Winnipeg 
and  340 km  southeast  of  Thompson  in  Manitoba.  The  nearest  community  serviced  by  scheduled 
commercial flights is Red Sucker Lake, 60 km to the southwest as shown on Figure 1.1.
1.2
Property Access
Access  to  the  property  is  by  means  of  chartered  aircraft  from  Red  Sucker  and/or  Gods  Lake  Narrows, 
Manitoba  and  Pickle  Lake  and/or  Red  Lake,  Ontario.  From  mid-January  to  the  end  of  March,  a  winter 
road extends 100 km from Gods Lake Narrows to Red Sucker Lake and offers an opportunity to transport 
bulk supplies into the region. The existing exploration camp is located at the center of the property on the 
southwest shore of the southern Twin Lake.
1.3
Topography and Geomorphology
The  property  is  located  in  an  area  of  low  topographic  relief,  with  a  mean  elevation  of  about 
200 meters above  sea  level  (masl).  Lakes  are  very  shallow  and  connected  by  meandering  streams  and 
bogs.
The  topography  of  the  property  area  is  characterized  by  myriad  lakes  and  swamps  as  part  of  an 
unorganized drainage system. The Seeber River drains the area and flows into Monument Bay. Northward 
drainage continues via the Stull River, Gods River, and the Hayes River, which flows into Hudson Bay.

Resource Estimate
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  resources  were  estimated  using  significantly  revised  vein  solids.  All  zones  were  interpreted  and 
edited  on  10 m  section  spacing,  and  zones  were  extrapolated  at  reasonable  distances  to  surface  and  to 
depth based on drill intercepts. In addition, the overburden surface was estimated and the vein solids were 
clipped  to  this  limiting  surface.  It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  blocks  interpolated  into  these  solids  are 
within the definition of mineral resource as defined below.
A  mineral  resource  is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid  inorganic  material,  or 
natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals 
in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity 
of  a  mineral  resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological  evidence  and 
knowledge.
The term “mineral resource” covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic interest that 
has  been  identified  and  estimated  through  exploration  and  sampling  and  within  which  mineral  reserves 
may  subsequently  be  defined  by  the  consideration  and  application  of  technical,  economic,  legal, 
environmental, socioeconomic and governmental factors. The phrase “reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction” implies a judgment by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic factors 
likely  to  influence  the  prospect  of  economic  extraction.  A  mineral  resource  is  an  inventory  of 
mineralization  that  under  realistically  assumed  and  justifiable  technical  and  economic  conditions  might 
become  economically  extractable.  These  assumptions  must  be  presented  explicitly  in  both  public  and 
technical reports.
In addition, these resources are categorized as inferred resources as defined by CIM Standards as stated in 
the following:
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
can  be  estimated  based  on  geological  evidence  and  limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not 
verified,  geological  and  grade  continuity.  The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling 
gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops,  trenches,  pits,  workings  and 
drill holes.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to inferred mineral resources, it cannot be assumed that all or 
any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured mineral resource as 
a  result  of  continued  exploration.  Confidence  in  the  estimate  is  insufficient  to  allow  the  meaningful 
application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy 
of  public  disclosure.  Inferred  mineral  resources  must be  excluded from  estimates  that form  the  basis of 
feasibility or other economic studies.
The  inferred  resources  as  estimated  in  this  report  are  listed  in  Table  1.1  for  grams  per  tonne  of  gold 
(Au g/t). These resources are listed at varying cut-off grades.

The  conceptual  mine  plan  calls  for  an  underground  mining  operation  with  an  ore  production  rate  of 
1,000 tonnes  per  day  (t/d).  The  concept  strategy  employs  a  combination  of  mining  methods,  with 
shrinkage stoping being the primary method and longhole stoping being the secondary method. The ore 
will be transported to the mill via the main access ramp utilizing truck haulage.
The production schedule by years is shown in Table 1.2.

Metallurgy and Plant Design
Metallurgical  testwork  was  carried  out  on  Monument  Bay  ore  by  the  previous  owners  of  the  project 
(Bema  Gold)  at  SGS  Lakefield  (Lakefield,  Ontario)  and  G&T  Metallurgical  Services  (Kamloops,  BC). 
The  ore  has  two  viable  flowsheets:  direct  cyanide  leaching  of  the  ore,  which  gives  a  recovery  of 
approximately  95%;  or  flotation  recovery  of  the  ore  followed  by  leaching  of  the  flotation  concentrate, 
which gives a 93% recovery. In both options, significant gold can be recovered by gravity ahead of other 
processing.  The  direct  leaching  process  has  been  selected  for  the  proposed  1,000 t/d  treatment  rate.  At 
significantly higher treatment rates, the flotation option would possibly offer some benefits.
1.7
Environmental
An  integral  part  of  the  Monument  Bay  project  development  process  is  the  assessment  of  the  project’s 
environmental,  social,  and  economic  impacts  on  its  regional  zone  of  influence.  These  aspects  must  be 
thoroughly  accounted  for  in  the  Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  process,  a  process  that  is  guided  by 
federal  and  provincial  legislation.  The  EA  process  is  a  tool  for  determining  potential  project-related 
adverse impacts before they occur, allowing mitigation and monitoring programs to be incorporated into 
all stages of project design, development and closure.
In accordance with Manitoba’s Environment Act (Manitoba Regulation 164/88 – Classes of Development 
Regulation),  the  project  will  require  the  completion  of  an  EA  and  a  licence  prior  to  construction.  The 
project is a Class 2 Development (Section 3, Sub-section 4) under the 164/88 regulation.
The  project  will  require  a  Comprehensive  Study,  in  accordance  with  the  Canadian  Environmental 
Assessment Act (Comprehensive Study List Regulations, Part V), because it is “a gold mine, other than a 
placer  mine,  with  an  ore  production  capacity  of  600  t/d  or  more.”  Should  there  be  a  need  for  the 
deposition  of  tailings  into  fish-bearing  waters  resulting  in  harmful  alteration,  disruption  or  destruction 
(HADD) of fish habitat, this would trigger the need for an amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining 
Effluent Regulations, under the Federal Fisheries Act. A HADD authorization falls under the authority of 
both the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada.
The Province of Manitoba and the Government of Canada have agreed to a “harmonized” process for EAs 
that  require  both  federal  and  provincial  approval.  The  Canada-Manitoba  Agreement  on  Environmental 
Assessment Cooperation agreement was enacted to assist in the coordination of environmental assessment 
processes, to reduce duplication, and to assist in a timely and efficient approval process.
1.8
Public and First Nations Consultation and Participation
Public consultation is a critical component of the EA process. Public consultation, when initiated as easy 
as possible, is a very strong tool for developing an open and transparent project that the stakeholders are 
more likely to support.
The  Monument  Bay  project  is  located  in  the  northeastern  section  of  the  Island  Lake  Tribal  Council 
region, bordering on the Keewatin Tribal Council region to the north and west, and the Manitoba-Ontario 
border to the  east. There  are several  First  Nations  communities located  around the project area, both  in 
Manitoba and Ontario. Active communication with these First Nations communities and Tribal Councils 
should  be  a  priority  throughout  the  EA  process  to  ensure  the  interests  and  needs  of  the  people  are 
considered throughout all stages of project planning from the outset.

Meaningful  participation  of  the  local  First  Nations  in  the  Monument  Bay  project  will  be  helpful  in 
obtaining project support. The general strategy for First Nations involvement would be as follows:
•  provide employment that leads to self-reliance and respect, including training programs
•  provide contractual opportunities
•
involve  individuals,  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  in  baseline  studies,  the  EA  process,  permitting, 
ongoing life-of-mine joint monitoring and other planning activities
•
incorporate traditional knowledge into project planning activities.
1.9
Waste Disposal
The mill will operate at a 1,000 t/d throughput, and the underground mine will yield 3.76 million tonnes 
(Mt)  of  ore  providing  a  mine  life  of  11  years.  The  ore  will  be  processed  using  conventional  flotation 
methods,  and  the  slurry  tailings  will  be  discharged  to  a  permanent  waste  storage  facility.  Geochemical 
characteristics of tailings and water are unknown at this stage at the design. For conservative purposes, it 
is assumed that all the tailings are potentially acid-generating (PAG) materials and must be submerged in 
perpetuity  under  1  m  of  water.  Limited  metallurgical  testing  data  cannot  determine  if  the  tailings  have 
high  cyanide  content  (G  &  T,  November  2003).  Therefore,  geosynthetic  liner  confinement  is  not 
considered as the base case scenario for this mine development assessment.
The  underground  mining  will  produce  approximately  2.8 Mt  of  waste  rock  during  the  life  of  mine 
operations.  Approximately  80%  of  waste  rock  will  be  stored  underground;  the  remaining  20%  will  be 
transported  to  surface  and  placed  in  a  waste  dump  or  used  to  construct  embankments  for  the  tailings 
storage facility (TSF). The external waste rock will be dumped near the mine portal. It is assumed that the 
external  waste  rock  consists  of  non-acid-generating  (NAG)  materials  and  will  be  suitable  for  use  in 
constructing TSF embankments. It is also assumed that low permeability core materials (e.g., glacial till) 
can be locally borrowed with sufficient quantity and suitable quality for use in the embankments based on 
the observations during the site visit.
The  TSF  is  designed  to  permanently  store  3.76 Mt  of  tailings  (2.9 Mm3  at  an  average  dry  density  of 
1.3 t/m3). The TSF embankment will be constructed using downstream methods at slope of 2.5:1.0 (H:V). 
Each stage of TSF development is sized to store tailings based on an average milling rate of 1,000 t/d of 
ore, as well as supernatant water and capacity for stormwater storage and wave run-up protection. A 2 m 
freeboard is included to account for the storm storage and wave run-up protection for the TSF.
1.10
Power Supply
Electrical power supply will be provided from a grid connection to the Manitoba transmission system.
Preliminary  information  from  Manitoba  Hydro  indicates  that  there  are  two  possibilities,  namely  a 
25 kilovolt (kV) supply from Red Sucker Lake about 40 km away, or a 138 kV supply from God’s Lake 
Narrows,  which  is  about  60  km  away.  It  is  likely  that  the  25  kV  supply  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the 
Monument Bay load and large motor starting duty; however, further study must be carried out before this 
option can be eliminated.
The  current  design  is  based  on  selecting  the  138  kV  option  due  to  its  greater  stability  and,  likely, 
reliability.  Indicative  capital  costs  are  about  $18.5 million  for  the  138 kV  option  and  about 
CAD$10 million for the 25 kV option. As the power tariff is higher for the 25 kV supply than the 138 kV

supply, there is a payback on the additional capital cost of the 138 kV supply (about $300,000 per year). 
Likely  construction  time  would  be  about  two  years  following  a  full  commitment  to  proceed.  In  either 
case, a main site substation would be required costing about CAD$1.5 million for the 138 kV option and 
CAD$0.5 million for the 25 kV option.
1.11
Infrastructure
An airstrip will be constructed at site to provide year-round access, while ground access will be possible 
by  winter  road  during  winter  months  only.  Site  facilities  will  be  constructed  assuming  supplies  for  the 
year will be transported via the winter road and stored at site. Personnel will be flown in on a two-week-
in/two-week-out schedule. This will require four crews to be established. It is expected that management 
personnel will work the same schedule.
Additional  facilities  will  consist  of  a  camp,  dry,  maintenance facilities,  warehouse,  offices,  fuel  storage 
and explosives and cap magazines. Site access roads will be constructed to allow movement of personnel 
and equipment between the facilities.
1.12
Capital and Operating Costs
Initial  capital  expenditures  have  been  estimated  at  $140.1  million  with  ongoing  capital  at  $18 million. 
Average operating costs are estimated to be $105.93 per tonne of ore processed.
It is expected that 708,300 oz of gold will be produced over the 11-year mine life.
1.13
Financial Analysis
A financial analysis was conducted at a gold price of US$750/oz, an exchange rate of US$1= CAD$1.25, 
a  production  rate  of  360,000 tonnes  per  annum  (t/a)  for  11  years  and  an  overall  average  grade  of 
6.33 g/t Au. The results of the analysis indicate that the property is viable, with an IRR of 8.14% and an 
NPV of $45 million. Sensitivity analyses indicated that an increase of 5% in mining grade, a reduction of 
10% in capital cost, and a reduction of 10% in operating cost would achieve a 15% IRR. An IRR of 15% 
may  be  achievable  if  an  additional  40%  potentially  recoverable  mineral  resource  can  be  defined  that 
allows for a production rate of some 504,000 t/a.
The results of the financial analysis are shown in Tables 1.3 to 1.5 and Figures 1.2 to 1.6.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The  economic  evaluation  of  a  1,000 t/d  underground  operation  at  the  Monument  Bay  deposit  indicates 
that based on an initial capital expenditure of US$140.1 million and gold metal prices of US$750/oz, the 
project  will  generate  an  after-tax  IRR  of  8.14%  and  an  undiscounted  NPV  of  $45  million  (negative 
$8 million discounted at 8%).
The current mineral resource estimate does not support a viable operation. The sensitivities completed on 
the  base  case  show  that  an  increase  in  resource  and/or  mining  grade  is  required  for  the  project  to  be 
considered economically viable in the industry.
If the mineral resource is increased by 40%, it is likely that a viable operation could be achieved. It would 
appear from an evaluation of the geological model that there is the possibility for additional resources to 
be defined that could satisfy this requirement.
A  40%  increase  in  mining  grade  also  indicates  project  viability,  but  a  review  of  the  geological  model 
shows that a large increase in mining grade will likely indicate a decrease in mineral resource.
Decreases  in  capital  and  operating  costs  would  also  improve  the  economic  viability  of  the  project; 
decreasing the capital and operating costs both by 10% would result in a 15% IRR.
To  improve  the  viability  of  the  project,  it  is  recommended  that  Rolling  Rock  undertake  an  exploration 
program to determine the existence of additional mineral resources at the same or higher grade that those 
estimated within this report. The following describes the proposed exploration program.

In  2009,  it  is  proposed  that  11,275  meters  will  be  drilled.  The  principal  objectives  of  the  drill  program 
will be to:
•
infill gaps in previous resource drilling programs and enlarge the assay database
•  better define and test higher grade trends for expansion within the veins
•  demonstrate grade continuity in order to support a better resource classification
•  provide material for specific gravity measurements
•  provide the basis for additional tonnage that would be at or greater than the grade estimated in Section
16.
The  program  is  designed  principally  to  increase  the  assay  sample  density  and  to  provide  the  basis  for 
additional  tonnage  to  support  a  larger  throughput  operation.  This  program  is  expected  to  result  in  a 
material change to the limits and the geometry of the resource model. In addition, the program is expected 
to better define higher grade trends within the deposit and provide more confidence in, and thus increase, 
the classification levels for much of the overall mineral resource.
Figures 1.7  to  1.19  indicate  the  proposed  targets,  shown  as  red  circles,  to  achieve  the  above  objectives 
based upon a vein-by-vein basis.

This  program  requires  11,275  meters  of  drilling  to  increase  the  tonnage  in  areas  of  opportunity  where 
there  is  potential  for  relatively  higher  grade  material.  Prior  to  embarking  on  this  program,  it  is  highly 
recommended  that  company  and  site  geologists  be  consulted.  Figure  1.20  illustrates  a  plan  view  of  the 
preliminary proposed exploration drilling program.
The costs for previous drilling programs—specifically, the summer 2006 and winter 2007 programs—are 
the basis for estimating future drilling costs. The cost of the summer 2006 program was $367/m, while the 
winter 2007 program was $231/m. The extra costs related to the summer 2006 program are primarily due 
to helicopter costs of nearly $100/m.

Figure 1.20:  Plan View of Preliminary Proposed Exploration Drilling Program
During the winter 2007 program, over 100 drums of diesel fuel, 200 bottles of propane and 100 drums of 
jet fuel were purchased and remain on site, which will reduce the cost of a future program. In addition, the 
current  economic  downturn  has  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  drilling  costs.  Therefore,  it  is  estimated  that 
drilling  costs  will  be  less  than  for  previous  programs;  however,  if  these  costs  are  utilized,  then  it  is 
anticipated that there will be opportunity to perform under budget.
Due to the substantial cost differential and timing, it is recommended that a winter program be planned 
for the end of 2009 to 2010. Therefore a 11,275 meter drill program performed in the winter would cost 
approximately $2.6 million. These costs are broken down below in Table 1.7.

SECTION 2.0 – INTRODUCTION
2.1
Purpose
The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  review  the  potential  viability  of  the  Monument  Bay  deposit  on  the 
Monument Bay property at a Preliminary Assessment of confidence and to present a program to develop 
the property.
The Monument Bay deposit is considered amenable to underground methods of extraction and does not 
lend  itself  to  open  pit  mining.  Metallurgical  testwork  indicates  that  mineral  processing  by  whole  ore 
cyanidation provides the highest recovery; this method has therefore been incorporated into this report.
This Preliminary Assessment study has used inferred resources1 to evaluate the Monument Bay property.

Terms of Reference
Beacon  Hill  Consultants  (1988)  Ltd.  (Beacon  Hill)  was  commissioned  by  Rolling  Rock  Resources 
Corporation (Rolling Rock) to complete a study on the Monument Bay deposit located close to the town
1 Due to the uncertainty that may be  attached to an inferred mineral resource, it cannot be assumed that all or  any part of an inferred mineral 
resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to 
allow  the  meaningful  application  of  technical  and  economic  parameters  or  to  enable  an  evaluation  of  economic  viability  worthy  of  public 
disclosure. Inferred resources must be excluded from estimates that form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies.

SECTION 4.0 – PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
The following section was excerpted from Wardrop’s “Technical Report on the Monument Bay Project, 
Twin  Lakes,  Manitoba”  (amended  24  May  2006,  Document  No.  0652430100-REP-L0001-02)  and 
“Technical Report on the Monument Bay Gold Deposit, Twin Lakes Manitoba; Focus on Gold Inventory 
Update” by Garcia and Shearer. This section has been included for completeness.
Monument  Bay  is  located  in  northeastern  Manitoba,  immediately  adjacent  to  the  Manitoba  /  Ontario 
Provincial boundary (NTS 53K/06 and 07). The existing exploration camp is located at the center of the 
property, on the southwest shore of the southern of the Twin Lakes, at approximately 54º 26.N latitude / 
92º 54.W longitude (UTM WGS 84 15U 6032500N / 506000E) (Figure 4.1).
The Monument Bay project area is located 570 km NNE of Winnipeg and 340 km SSE of Thompson in 
the province of Manitoba, Canada (Figure 4.2). Red Sucker Lake, Manitoba is located 60 kilometers to the 
southwest of the property, and Gods Lake Narrows, Manitoba is located 100 kilometers to the west. The 
Monument  Bay  project  comprises  of  35  contiguous,  un-surveyed  mining  claims  totalling  6,692  hectares 
(Table  4.1,  Figure  4.3).  Monument  Bay  is  100%  owned  by  Rolling  Rock  having  been  recently  acquired 
from Bema Gold Corporation and Wolfden Resources. These claims are arrayed in an east-trending belt 
and are surrounded by a recently Rolling Rock-owned mineral exploration license (MEL 235). All the 35 
mining claims are in good standing until at least early part of 2009. There are considerable excess credits 
on several claims that can be used to extend the expiry dates of the claims.
Rolling Rock owned Mineral Exploration License 235 encompassing the claim blocks (Table 4.1) totalling 
18,977  hectares.  This  was  originally  issued  to  Bema  but  was  cancelled  on  June  25  2007.  Rolling  Rock 
reapplied for the license and expects that a new lease for the same area will be granted soon, with a clean 
cost effective slate for annual work obligation.
The property was previously owned as to 70% by Bema and as to 30% by Wolfden. The Company issued 
8 million shares at a fair value of $3.8 million to Kinross for its 70% interest and 4 million shares at a fair 
value  of  $1.9  million  to  Zinifex  for  its  30%  interest  in  the  project.  The  Company  upon  completion  of  a 
feasibility study will issue a further 4 million shares to Kinross and a further 1.5 million shares to Zinifex  
and upon commencement of commercial production the Company will issue to Kinross a further 3 million 
shares and to Zinifex a further 500,000 shares. The Company has also granted a 1.5% net smelter return 
(“NSR”) royalty to Kinross. The project is subject to a 2% NSR royalty until the production of one million 
troy ounces of gold equivalent and 3% NSR royalty thereafter to Newmont Canada Limited (“Newmont”). 
In addition, Newmont will be entitled to a cash payment for $500,000 upon completion of a final, positive, 
independent  feasibility  study  prepared  by  a  reputable  third  party  of  national  recognition  and  a  cash 
payment for $500,000 upon the commencement of commercial production.
Kinross shall have the pre-emptive right, providing it owns at least 20% of the fully diluted shares of the 
Company,  to  participate  in  equity  financings  of  the  Company  to  maintain  its  interest  at  the  time  of  that 
financing. As long as Kinross owns at least 20% of the fully diluted shares of the Company, Kinross will 
have the right to nominate one individual for appointment as a director of the Company.
Zinifex shall have the pre-emptive right, providing it owns at least 10% of the fully diluted issued shares 
of the Company, to participate in equity financings of the Company to maintain its interest at the time of 
that financing. As long as Zinifex owns at  least 10% of the fully diluted issued shares of the Company, 
Zinifex will have the right to nominate one individual for appointment as a director of the Company.
The  principal  mineralized  zone  is  situated  near  the  center  of  the  claim  block.  Other  than  an  exploration 
camp, there are no structures or improvements. The property is not subject to any known environmental 
liabilities. Permits necessary to conduct the planned program of drill exploration are currently in place.

SECTION 5.0 – ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES,
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
The  following  section  was  excerpted  from  the  “Technical  Report  on  the  Monument  Bay  Gold  Deposit, 
Twin  Lakes  Manitoba;  Focus  on  Gold  Inventory  Update”  by  Garcia  and  Shearer  and  is  included  for 
completeness.
Access  to  the  property  is  generally  by  ski  or  float  equipped  aircraft  from  Red  Sucker  Lake,  St.  Therese 
Point,  or  Pickle  Lake,  Ontario,  which  is  located  approximately  240  kilometers  to  the  southeast  of  the 
property.  During  the  winter  months,  a  winter  road  extends  to  Red  Sucker  Lake  from  Island  Lake  if 
conditions permit. This road was opened during the winters of 2006 and 2007. Noranda constructed a winter 
road from God’s Lake to the property; however, this road has not been used since the early 1990’s.
Surface  access  via  snowmobile  and  bulldozers  is  possible  from  Red  Sucker  Lake  in  winter.  Climate  in 
Monument Bay area is characterized by long winters and short summers with low levels of precipitation but 
also low rates of evaporation, the combination of which results in a humid climate. Except for the periods of 
freeze-up and break-up, at the onset of winter and spring respectively, it is possible to conduct exploration 
operations year-round.
Water sufficient for mining operations is present within the property. Surface rights sufficient for a mining 
operation can be readily obtained, and the necessary area for mining and processing infrastructure exists. It 
may be feasible to extend a sub-line from a hydro line that runs approximately 30 to 40 km to the west of 
the property. Mining operations in both Manitoba and northern Ontario ensure that skilled mining personnel 
can be found locally.
The  Monument  Bay  project  area  is  overlain  by  1  to  30  meter  thick  glacial  till  and  outwash  sand,  with 
common swamp and muskeg areas. Rivers and lakes are frequent throughout the area, as is typical of the 
Canadian Shield. Thick growths of spruce forest blanket the area, along with thick moss and underbrush. A 
regional  forest  fire  burned  portions  of  the  property  in  the  early  1990’s.  A  number  of  small  forest  fires 
burned portions of the project area in June 2003.

Resource Estimation History
A  number  of  resource  estimates  have  been  performed  on  the  Monument  Bay  property.  Bema  Gold 
performed a resource estimate in 2004 and 2006. These resource estimates were internal documents that 
were not published on Sedar; however, Wardrop reported in the 2006 Technical Report that there was a 
reduction  of  40%  in  the  contained  ounces  of  gold  due  to  modelling  revisions  and  changes  in  the  grade 
capping strategy.
Wardrop  performed  a  resource  estimate  in  July  2006,  which  was  updated  by  Wardrop  via  memo  in 
January 2008 (Table 6.1). In addition, Rolling Rock published a Technical Report authored by Garcia and 
Shearer in January 2008.

Drilling History
The  following  section  was  excerpted  from  the  “Technical  Report  on  the  Monument  Bay  Gold  Deposit, 
Twin  Lakes  Manitoba;  Focus  on  Gold  Inventory  Update”  by  Garcia  and  Shearer  and  is  included  for 
completeness.
Pre - 1987
The earliest geological work that was done in the area dates back to the 1936 when regional mapping survey 
was conducted by D.L. Downie. The Little Stull Lake area was explored during this time by the Ken Bay 
Syndicate, which drilled 18 drill holes as part of their exploration for gold in quartz veins.
In 1956 to 1959, Phelps Dodge conducted airborne surveys on a permit covering the entire greenstone belt. 
A total of 8 diamond drill holes were completed in the Little Stull Lake area. In 1961, Rio Tinto explored 
the Ellard Prospect on Stull Lake, drilling 11 drill holes there.
Work  on  the  Twin  Lakes  /  Monument  Bay  property  was  performed  from  1969-1974  by  Amax,  including 
airborne EM and magnetometer surveys. The resulting anomalies were staked, and drill testing was done on 
8 targets. Umex continued work until 1975, likely as a partner to Amax. At least 11 more conductors were 
tested in the property area, with other targets also tested in the Stull Lake area.

1987 – 1999 (Noranda)
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Noranda staked the present property starting in 1987, and conducted Maxmin, VLF, magnetometer, IP and 
geologic mapping surveys over a cut grid covering the Twin Lakes, Monument Bay and Makataysip Lakes 
area.
In 1991, Noranda separated all of their gold assets, including the Monument Bay property into a separate 
company,  Hemlo  Gold.  Hemlo  was  subsequently  taken  over  by  Battle  Mountain  Gold,  who  in  turn  was 
taken over by Newmont Mining.
On  record,  for  the  year  1989  to  1991,  Noranda  accomplished  a  total  of  26,614.7  meter  of  diamond  core 
drilling in 81 boreholes.
2000 – 2001 (Wolfden)
The property was inactive during much of the 1990s, and was optioned by Wolfden Resources in late 1999.
Wolfden conducted a two-phase diamond drill program in 2000, and subsequently optioned the property to 
Bema Gold Corporation in 2002. Wolfden accomplished 23 diamond holes aggregating to 5,116.5 meters.
2002 – 2006 (BEMA)
For  the  year  2002;  Bema  Gold  Corp.  conducted  a  two  phase  drill  program  with  31  drill  holes  totalling 
8,384.9 m of drilling viz.,
•  09 March to 24 April (19 holes totalling 5,540.1 m) and
•  28 August to 17 October (12 holes 2,844.8 m).
Geophysical surveys consisting of Magnetic and VLF readings where conducted over the main Twin Lakes 
area and the overall property with ground geophysics and airborne geophysics respectively.
For the year 2003: A two-phase drill program was undertaken by Bema Gold Corp. A winter drill program 
consisted of 43 diamond drill (12,653.6 m) conducted between 10 January to 9 May. This was followed by a 
39 drillhole (7,640.6 m) drill program conducted from 16 August to 3 November.
An  extensive  property  wide  geochemical  survey  consisting  of  1192  B–Horizon  and  243  Humus  samples 
were  collected  by  Bema  personnel  between  20  July  and  10  September.  Bema  Gold  Corp.  Conducted 
mapping, prospecting and sampling program from 18 July to 20 August. Mapping was conducted by three 
field crews consisting of one senior Geologist and one or more junior geologists.
Mapping and prospecting was conducted on a “reconnaissance” level with control on outcrop and sample 
locations  being  attained  by  using  aerial  photographs  and  GPS  hand  held  units.  Grid  mapping  was  also 
performed with grid pickets and hand held GPS units used for spatial control. Mapping scale from 1:5000 to 
1:200 where used depending on detail required.
Limited Petrography and Reflective Light studies where undertaken to determine mineral characteristics for 
visible gold samples by Vancouver Petrographic Ltd and CANMET Laboratories respectively.
For  the  year  2004,  Bema  Gold  Corp.  conducted  an  extensive  exploration  program  between  early  January 
and  late  May.  Diamond  drilling  activities,  targeting  the  Twin  Lakes  and  Twin  Lakes  West  zones 
commenced in early January, with 65 drill holes completed by 14 May totalling 17,249.9 meters.

Geophysical  surveys  were  carried  out  during  the  first  week  of  April.  Total  field  magnetometer  and  VLF 
surveying  were  completed  on  the  east  and  west  side  of  Twin  Lakes.  Also,  magnetic  /  VLF  surveys  were 
conducted over the Frantic Zone to the south.
Bema Gold Corp. conducted an extensive study of existing data from February to August including work on 
alteration assemblages, vein morphology and visible gold characterization. These studies where undertaken 
to further define the lithological and vein morphology associated with high-grade mineralization and to act 
as a guide and training tool to enable geological consistency during drill core logging. On March, the study 
of the visible gold portion of the mineralization associated with the Twin Lakes property was undertaken. 
The scope of this study was to examine drill logs, core and microscope photographs for visible gold from 
the 2003 and 2004 drill programs. The objective  is to  identify empirical characteristics that would enable 
field personnel to better identify those veins that will carry significant gold values. To facilitate this a total 
of  twenty-three  (24)  visible  gold  occurrences  in  twenty-one  (22)  holes  were  examined  Bema  Gold  Corp. 
personnel from June to August, 2004 conducted a study of all existing core stored at the Twin Lakes camp 
site and re-logged the alteration assemblages of these holes.
A  total  of  186  holes  were  examined  encompassing  sections  130+00E  to  170+00E  on  Bema’s  Twin  Lake 
property  in  northern  Manitoba.  This  study  was  undertaken  to  identify  alteration  assemblages  within  the 
study area and to determine any grade alteration correlations. This report is also intended as an instructional 
document  for  new  geologist  on  the  property  to  introduce  them  to  the  alterations  associated  with 
mineralization.
During the 2004 summer/fall drill program, an effort was made to further characterize the vein morphology 
at  Twin  Lakes  –  Seeber  River  areas.  The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  relationship  of  vein 
morphology and gold mineralization. Between 14 August and 28 September a total of 17 diamond drillholes 
were completed using two drills with a total cumulative meterage of 3,245.2. The study was conducted by 
Bema geologists using drill core and high-resolution drill core photos from all existing drill core stored at 
Twin Lakes camp. From October to December, 209 holes were examined encompassing sections 130+00E 
to 170+50E.
For the year 2005, a winter drilling program was pursued by Bema Gold Corporation utilizing two drill rigs 
which completed 40 drill holes in the Seeber River and Twin Lakes areas adding another 9509.6 meters. Re-
cutting of the main grid began but was incomplete due to snow conditions.
The  winter  2005  drill  program  was  followed  in  the  period  of  August  to  November  with  another  drill 
program  using  one  to  two  drill  rigs.  A  total  of  30  drill  holes  were  completed,  one  of  which  was  on  the 
permit  area,  for  a  total  of  6,320.85  meters.  Line  cutting  continued  over  the  main  grid  and  VLF-EM  and 
magnetometer surveys were completed over 126.0 line-kms.
2006 to the Present (Rolling Rock)
The  Monument  Bay  was  acquired  by  Rolling  Rock  in  July  6,  2006  from  Bema  Gold  Corporation  and 
Wolfden  Resources.  Bema  was  since  acquired  by  Kinross  Gold  Corporation  (“Kinross”).  Wolfden  was 
since  acquired  by  Zinifex  Canadian  Enterprises  Inc.,  a  wholly  owned  indirect  subsidiary  of  Zinifex  Ltd 
(“Zinifex”).
Works introduced by the company are as follows:
•  Between 04 July and 03 October 2006, a summer drilling program was completed by Rolling Rock using
1 drill rig, accomplishing 26 boreholes aggregating to 6,272.7 meters.
•  Between 04 January and 07 April 2007, a winter drilling initiative was accomplished by Rolling Rock
using 2 rigs completing 28 boreholes for a total of 10,443.9 meters.

SECTION 7.0 – GEOLOGICAL SETTING
The  following  section  was  excerpted  from  the  “Technical  Report  on  the  Monument  Bay  Gold  Deposit, 
Twin  Lakes  Manitoba;  Focus  on  Gold  Inventory  Update”  by  Garcia  and  Shearer  and  is  included  for 
completeness.
7.1
Regional Geology
Northeastern  Manitoba  is  underlain  by  a  portion  of  the  Archean-age  Northern  Superior  Province  that  is 
tectonically segmented into granitoid crustal blocks, 10 to 50 kilometers in width, that are bounded by east-
trending, dextral strike-slip greenschist facies shear zones (Figure 7.1).
Figure 7.1:  Regional Geology
Twin Lakes, at the center of the property, is situated on the boundary of the Oxford-Stull Terrane with the 
Munroe Lake (North Caribou) Terrane to the south. This boundary, a splay of the Stull Lake – Wunnummin 
Fault Zone (SWFZ), separates younger crust (3.0 billion years (Ga)) to the south from older crust (>3.0 Ga) 
to the north and it contains a belt of supracrustal metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks, dated at about 
2.7 Ga, that host the Monument Bay mineralization.
The  supracrustal  stratigraphy  is  subdivided  into  the  Stull  assemblage  (Hayes  River  Group),  comprised  of 
mafic volcanics, that is overlain by coarse clastic sedimentary rocks of the Oxford Lake assemblage that are, 
in turn, overlain by arenaceous rocks of the Cross Lake assemblage.
Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd.

January 20, 2011
Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  Stull  assemblage  is  comprised  of  basalt  flows,  volumetrically  minor  mafic  intrusions  and  derived 
amphibolite and mafic tectonite, and oxide facies iron formation. The Oxford Lake assemblage is comprised 
of  metamorphosed  wacke,  siltstone  and  polymictic  conglomerate.  The  overlying  Cross  Lake  assemblage 
contains volcanic and sedimentary units. The volcanics include felsic to intermediate tuff and breccia; the 
metasediments include arenite and conglomerate. Cross Lake Sediments are differentiated from those of the 
Oxford  Lake  assemblage  by  the  absence  of  dikes  and  sills  of  gabbro.  The  Cross  Lake  sediments  are 
considered to postdate amalgamation of the various terranes and possibly to represent fluvial and shallow-
marine  sedimentation  in  pull-apart  basing  developed  along  transgressional  faults  that  accompanied 
collisional tectonics.
The SWFZ contains evidence of five generations of ductile and brittle deformation. The main deformational 
event appears to be D3, which produced open, asymmetric, east-trending F3 folds that plunge to the east-
southeast.  Green  schist  retrograde  metamorphism  is  associated  with  the  core  of  the  SWFZ  and  is 
characterized  by  the  variable  presence  of  ankerite,  fuchsite,  silicification  and  disseminated  sulphide 
emplacement in addition to ubiquitous chlorite and sericite. This alteration is best developed coincident with 
zones  of  tight,  Zasymmetrical  F3  chevron  folding  that  are  interpreted  (BS)  to  be  the  result  of  D3 
deformation in dextral transcurrent flexures in the fault zone. (Beaumont-Smith, 2003).
7.2
Property Geology
Within the property, the SWFZ and the associated supracrustal sequence of volcanic and metasedimentary 
rocks  are  the  most  significant  hosts  of  gold  mineralization.  The  best  known  occurrences  of  gold 
mineralization are located near the southern of the Twin Lakes.
The supracrustal sequence is comprised of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that belong to the Hayes River, 
Oxford  Lake  and  Cross  Lake  Groups.  The  Hayes  River  Group  is  comprised  of  mafic  volcanics,  gabbro, 
siltstone  and  oxide  facies  iron  formation.  The  Oxford  Lake  Group  is  made  up  on  felsic  tuffs  and 
intermediate  feldspar-phyric  flows.  Polymictic  conglomerate,  thick-bedded  feldspathic  wacke,  turbidites 
and  magnetite  facies  iron  formation  of  the  Cross  Lake  Group  have  been  mapped  south  of  the  main  Twin 
Lakes area (Figure 7.2).
These  rocks  have  Group  tuff  unit,  which  unit,  the  remaining  footwall  units,  present  to  the  north  of  the 
inferred fold, are not repeated on the south limb. The structural interpretation may therefore be incomplete, 
but  the  resolution  of  this  question  may  also  be  irrelevant,  as  this  inferred  fold  does  not  appear  to  have  a 
direct bearing on the interpretation of the distribution of quartz veins and associated gold mineralization.
A  prominent  feldspar-phyric  dike  cuts  tuffs  and  flows  of  the  Oxford  Lake  sequence  and  is  cut  by  gold-
bearing  quartz  veins.  This  dike  dips  consistently  at  about  70º  to  the  north  and,  for  most  of  its  length,  is 
contained  within  the  tuff  unit  but  strikes  to  the  northwest,  slightly  oblique  to  the  easterly  strike  of  the 
enclosing stratigraphy, and at the western end of the Twin Lakes Zone transgresses into the feldspar phyric 
flow unit. The dike diminishes from an average thickness of about 30 meters at the western end of the Twin 
Lakes  Zone  to  about  10  meters  at  the  eastern  end,  and  may,  at  the  eastern  end,  be  present  as  several 
enechelon lenses.

7.2.1
Stratigraphy and Lithology
The stratigraphy at Twin Lakes comprises three main groups of rocks:
1)  The  Hayes  River  Group  (HRG)  is  the  oldest  supracrustal  rocks  in  the  area  (2830  Ma).  HRG  rocks 
outcrop  at  Makataysip  Lake  (Anderson,  2003),  south  of  Monument  Bay  and  potentially  immediately 
north  of  the  Twin  Lakes  gold  zones.  At  Twin  Lakes  the  HRG  may  comprise  gabbro,  siltstone,  oxide 
facies iron formation, greywacke and mafic volcanic.
2)  The  host  rocks  for  the  Twin  Lakes  gold  deposit  are  Oxford  Lake  Group  (OLG)  (ca.  2717-2726  Ma) 
(Stone et al, 2001). Rocks comprising the OLG have been intersected at Twin Lakes and may outcrop 
along the mouth of the Seeber River at Monument Bay and on an island in southern Monument Bay. At 
Twin  Lakes,  the  rocks  comprise  felsic  tuffs,  intermediate  feldspar  phyric  volcanic  flows  that  are 
intruded by feldspar porphyritic dykes. An island in the south end of Monument Bay may comprise a 
large outcrop of OLG rocks (Anderson, 2003 and Stone et al., 2001).
3)  Cross  Lake  Group  (CLG)  (<2709  Ma),  previously  unrecognized  in  the  area,  comprise  polymictic

7.2.1.1  Hayes River Group
Gabbro
The  gabbro  is  light  medium  grey  to  dark  green  grey,  moderately  foliated,  locally  strongly  sheared.  Grain 
size  ranges  from  fine  through  coarse  grained,  and  is  generally  consistent  in  composition  throughout  with 
approximately  60%  plagioclase  and  40%  mafic  content  (variable  amphibole,  chlorite  and  biotite 
concentrations).
Alteration  is  generally  restricted  to  weak  to  moderate  chloritization  and  minor  carbonitization.  There  is 
minor  disseminated  pyrite  throughout  the  unit,  usually  less  than  1%,  primarily  concentrated  on  fracture 
planes.  Abundant  sediment  xenoliths  are  observed  within  the  unit,  including  banded  oxide  facies  iron 
formation  xenoliths.  This  cross-cutting  relationship  is  seen  in  the  airborne  magnetics  map,  particularly 
between  155+00E  and  167+00E.  To  the  east  and  west  of  this  area,  there  are  two  magnetic  signatures, 
indicating that the iron formation and gabbro are separate. Between the above grid locations, there is only 
one magnetic high, coincident with the gabbro intruding the iron formation horizon.
Locally, feldspar porphyritic dykes are observed cross cutting the gabbro. These dykes are generally 10 to30 
cm wide and mineralization has not been observed with these dykes.
Mafic Volcanic
The  mafic  volcanic  is  typically  light  to  medium  grayish  green,  homogenous,  very  fine  grained,  with 
approximately 10 to 30% pervasive calcite veining (strong calcite veining is very characteristic of unit). It is 
also  moderately  chloritized.  Sulphide  content  is  restricted  to  a  maximum  of  1  to  2%  disseminated  pyrite 
throughout. Due to the strong calcite veining throughout unit, observation of primary features is difficult. It 
is currently uncertain if unit is volcanic, or a chloritized sediment.  For consistency,  this distinctive unit is 
given the name mafic volcanic.
Siltstone/Iron Formation
Siltstone comprises the bulk of the unit (90%) with minor oxide facies iron formation throughout. The unit 
is typically dark green-grey, very fine to fine grained, banded and well-bedded sediments intercalated with 
locally  developed  magnetic  (magnetite-bearing)  intervals  (over  narrow  widths)  interpreted  to  be  iron 
formation (Algoman-type).  Alteration is generally weak to locally  moderate, comprising sericite, chlorite, 
carbonate and silica. The iron formation beds provide a distinctive magnetic unit that is easily identified on 
the airborne magnetics map. This unit consistently occurs in the hangingwall of the Twin Lakes zone, and 
can be traced across the property. Due to the cross cutting gabbro dyke described above, it is hypothesized 
that prior operators have not followed the correct marker horizon along strike to the east.
Greywacke/Siltstone
The  unit  is  typically  light  grey  to  light-med  green-grey,  moderately  foliated,  very  fine  grained,  and 
generally  has  a  moderately  well-banded  appearance.  It  is  unclear  whether  the  bands  are  derived  by  (1) 
tectonics, (2) alteration, or are (3) primary – to date Bema personnel have been unable to observe grading. 
Bands appear to be comprised of varying amounts of biotite and chlorite (brown bands are biotite, greenish 
bands  are  chlorite).  These  bands  are  consistently  fine  grained  and  generally  felsic  to  intermediate  in 
composition.
This  unit  is  commonly  cross  cut  by  10  to  50  cm  wide  gabbro  and  feldspar  porphyritic  dykes.  Sulphide 
content is restricted to trace amounts of pyrite. Generally there are 1-2% quartz-carbonate veins and veinlets 
throughout.

Felsic Feldspar Porphyritic Dyke
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  feldspar  porphyritic  dyke  has  been  observed  along  the  entire  length  of  defined  stratigraphy  (5.7  km) 
cross cutting the felsic tuffs and intermediate feldspar phyric volcanic flows. The thickness of the dyke is 
extremely variable from less than 1 meter to 120 meters wide (surface projection), based on drill core. The 
porphyry may be related to the gold mineralization, as it occurs within or proximal to gold bearing zones.
Noranda  geologists  have  previously  logged  this  unit  as  a  “felsic  volcanic”.  Identification  of  this  unit  is 
difficult however due to mineralization and alteration overprints. It had previously been overlooked in many 
of the early drill holes. The porphyry  is  variably colored (due to alteration) but  is usually a dark buff  tan 
color. Relict feldspar phenocrysts are occasionally  seen, and the unit appears  massive and aphanitic. This 
may  be  due  to  the  alteration  overprint.  Where  observed,  3-5  mm,  white,  euhedral,  randomly  oriented 
feldspar crystals are evenly distributed throughout the porphyry. Deformation appears moderate, and overall 
the unit looks massive; foliation is weak to moderate and fracturing/brecciation is more common.
Alteration  is  strong  throughout  the  unit,  generally  mottled  but  pervasive  in  nature:  silicic  >  sericitic  > 
carbonate > chloritic alteration dominates. Quartz stringers (+/carbonate) are common, and appear to be part 
of multiple veining events. The average sulphide content is 2-3% combined pyrite and arsenopyrite. Trace 
sphalerite  and  molybdenum  have  also  been  observed.  Sulphides  are  disseminated  in  fractures  and 
stringers/veinlets.
Felsic to Intermediate Tuff and Sediments
The unit is typically light medium grey to light medium greenish grey, moderately to strongly foliated, with 
a  locally  well-banded  appearance  (tectonic  and  primary).  Tuffaceous  horizons  are  generally  very  fine 
grained, homogenous, with a quartz feldspathic composition.
Sediments  are  well  banded,  felsic  to  mafic  composition,  very  fine  grained,  usually  12  mm  thick,  grading 
within  tuffaceous  horizons.  A  single  10  to  30  cm  wide,  graphitic  argillite  horizon  is  observed  within  the 
Twin Lakes area within the unit.
Healed fault breccia and clay-rich rubbly late faults are commonly observed proximal to the mafic volcanic 
contact.
Weak  to  moderate  sericitic  alteration  is  common,  with  local  moderate  silicification  throughout.  Near  the 
initial contact with mafic volcanic, brecciated and folded blue-grey quartz veins with trace to 1% pyrite are 
consistently observed within unit.
Intermediate Feldspar Phyric Volcanic Flow
The  volcanic  is  typically  medium  grey,  of  intermediate  composition  with  25  to  30%  white  to  light  grey, 
commonly flattened with common dimension 2 x 5 mm feldspar phenocrysts. Feldspars are oriented parallel 
to the local foliation. The matrix is typically very fine-grained and quartzo-feldspathic. Stretching lineation 
orientations  of  feldspar  crystals  are  observed  on  slip  surfaces  of  the  S2  foliation,  measured  at  20  to  30 
degrees to the east. These measurements are based on oriented core measurements. In the western Seeber 
River area, deformation typically increases towards the lower contact of feldspar phyric unit, "grading" into 
a deformation zone.

Alteration is variable and includes weak-strong sericite + carbonate (ank>cal) + minor chlorite. Alteration 
may also comprise weak to moderate bleaching (carbonate/silica?) throughout unit. Alteration can obliterate 
all primary textures and make identification of this unit difficult.
Outside of the Twin Lakes  gold zone, sulphide mineralization is weak within  the unit with pyrite content 
averaging less than 1%.
Felsic Tuff
The felsic tuff has been logged as a single undifferentiated unit for most of the program. However, the felsic 
tuff actually comprises at least three units: tuff breccia, ash tuff and quartz crystal tuff. Recognition of these 
different units is difficult due to strong alteration and mineralization overprints throughout the drilled area.
Tuff  breccia  comprises  the  bulk  of  the  felsic  tuff  unit  (approximately  80%).  The  tuff  breccia  is  typically 
light  grey  to  medium  dark  grey,  very  fine  grained,  locally  weak  to  strong  silicification  and  sericitization, 
with up to 85%, poorly defined 10 to 15 cm diameter tuffaceous fragments commonly separated by a 5 to 
10 mm wide chloritic seams, generally parallel to foliation.
The ash tuff is generally found south of the tuff breccia. Ash tuff is typically medium to dark grey, very fine 
to  fine  grained,  “gritty”  texture,  homogenous,  locally  weak  to  strong  silicification  and  sericitization 
throughout  the  unit.  The  tuff  also  contains  approximately  5%  sub-ovoid,  white  to  translucent,  1  to  3  mm 
diameter, quartz crystals randomly scattered throughout. Lapilli fragments are also observed throughout ash 
tuff intervals, up to 5% of total volume. Fragments are sub-angular, and pebble sized, with mafic and felsic 
lithologies with unknown affinity.
7.2.1.3  Cross Lake Group
Polymictic Conglomerate
Conglomerate is observed within the Twin Lakes gold zone area and 650 meters south in the Frantic zone. 
Thickness of the unit is approximately 15 meters in the Twin Lakes Au zone area (surface projection) but it 
is currently of undefined thickness in the Frantic Au zone area. Government and Noranda mapping indicates 
significant  thicknesses  to  the  south  of  the  main  Monument  Bay/Twin  Lakes  shear  zone,  as  well  as  along 
strike both east and west of the property.
In the Frantic zone the conglomerate is various colored, hetero-lithic clast-bearing, "massive" (no apparent 
bedding observed), matrix-supported, homogenous, volcaniclastic conglomerate. Clasts vary in composition 
and include volcanic (felsic, intermediate), sedimentary (mudstones - possible tuffs?, wackes) and igneous 
(supracrustal  -  felsic,  intermediate,  mafic?).  Clasts  also  include  lithologies  found  to  the  north  of  the 
conglomerate,  including  intermediate  feldspar  phyric  volcanic  flow  clasts.  Cursory  field  observations 
indicate  that  there  may  be  some  altered  silicified  clasts  within  the  sequence,  indicating  that  this 
conglomerate may postdate at least one mineralizing event. Further work need to be done on this issue.
Clasts appear to be of supracrustal composition with batholithic component absent. Clasts are well-rounded 
to  sub-angular,  pebble  to  cobble  ("small")  in  size.  The  conglomerate  is  matrix-supported  -fine  grained 
wacke  composition.  Possible  epiclastic  wackes  of  siliceous  composition  form  thin  (cm-scale)  beds 
intercalated within the volcaniclastic conglomerate.
Alteration comprises mainly sericitization, silicification, carbonatization and development in trace amounts 
of fuchsite. Sericitization dominates, variably pervasive to semi-pervasive. Silicification may be pervasive, 
semi-pervasive or veining. Pervasive silicic alteration forms very fine grained mauvish colored patches that 
often appear as "fragments.” Veins are in filled with quartz and carbonate (dolomite/siderite).

Deformation  is  ductile  and  strong;  a  dominant  east-west  fabric  prevails,  displayed  by  flattened  and 
elongated clasts. Deformation noted in outcrop at Frantic zone shows a dextral sense of movement.
In the southern footwall of the Twin Lakes zone, the conglomerate is also polymictic, with only pebble size 
clasts. Clast lithologies comprise very fine grained mafic and felsic clasts, of unknown affinity. Alteration 
comprises weak quartz-carbonate veining, and very weak sericitization.
In the Frantic zone area, the conglomerate is host to gold mineralization. Sulphide mineralization is weak 
overall with local sulphide content reaching 2 - 4% over cm-scale distances. Sulphides comprise pyrite and 
arsenopyrite.  Pyrite  is  fine  grained  to  medium  grained,  subhedral  and  disseminated.  Arsenopyrite  is  very 
fine  grained,  acicular  to  tabular,  disseminated  to  fracture-controlled.  Sulphide  content  increases  with 
increased  silicification  (pervasive  /  veining),  outside  these  areas  sulphide  content  decreases  often  to  trace 
amounts. Therefore, the average sulphide contents are often low (<1-2%) over any specific interval.
Plutonic Rocks
Intrusives bound the Hayes, Oxford and Cross Lake groups to the north and south of the Twin Lakes area. 
To the north of Twin Lakes are neo-Archean granitic and sanukitoid suites (2.5 to 2.9 Ga), to the south are 
neo-Archean to meso-archean tonalitic to gneissic suites (2.5 to 3.4 Ga).

SECTION 8.0 – DEPOSITS TYPES
The  Monument  Bay  gold  mineralization  is  an  Archean  shear-hosted  gold  occurrence.  Archean  shear-
hosted deposits have the following characteristics:
1)  Tectonic setting:  Major trans-crustal structural breaks within stable cratonic terranes. May represent
remnant terrane collisional boundaries.
2)  Host rock types:  Granite – greenstone belts – mafic, ultramafic (komaitiitic) and felsic volcanics,
intermediate and felsic intrusive rocks, greywacke and shale.
3)  Deposit form:  Tabular fissure veins in competent host lithologies, veinlets and stringers forming
stockworks in less-competent lithologies.
4)  Texture / structure:  Veins commonly have sharp contacts with wall rocks and exhibit a variety of 
textures including massive, ribboned or banded stockworks with anastamosing gashes and dilations.
5)  Ore mineralogy:  Native gold, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite,
tellurides, scheelite, bismuth, tetrahedrite, stibnite, molybdenite.
6)  Gangue mineralogy:  Quartz, carbonates, albite, fuchsite, sericite, muscovite, chlorite, tourmaline,
graphite.
7)  Alteration mineralogy:  Silicification, pyritization, potassium metasomatism generally occur
adjacent to veins within broader zones of carbonate alteration with or without ferroan dolomite veins, 
extending up to tens of meters from veins.
8)  Ore controls:  Gold-quartz veins occur within zones of intense and pervasive carbonate alteration 
along second order or later faults marginal to trans-crustal breaks; commonly associated with late 
syn-collisional, structurally controlled intermediate to felsic magmatism.
The  project  area  consists  of  a  sequence  of  steep  (70°  to  80°)  north-dipping,  east-west-striking 
metavolcaniclastic  sediments  and  greenschist  facies  gabbro  and  mafic  volcanics  with  minor  iron 
formation  bands  in  sedimentary  units.  A  porphyritic  dyke  (sill?)  cross  cuts  volcanic  stratigraphy  and  is 
present for almost the entire strike length of the project area. Significant gold mineralization is associated 
with moderate to strong sericite-silica-albite alteration and quartz-carbonate veins.
The zones fall within two main areas, Seeber and Twin Lakes. In general, zones strike east-west, dipping 
steeply to the north. In the Seeber area, the zones dip about 75° to the north and in the Twin Lakes area 
about 65° to the north.

SECTION 9.0 – MINERALIZATION
The  following  section  was  excerpted  from  the  “Technical  Report  on  the  Monument  Bay  Gold  Deposit, 
Twin  Lakes  Manitoba;  Focus  on  Gold  Inventory  Update”  by  Garcia  and  Shearer  and  is  included  for 
completeness.
This section has been included for completeness.
Mineralization  consists  of  varying  amounts  of  pyrite,  arsenopyrite,  sphalerite,  chalcopyrite  and  galena, 
with  rare  molybdenum.  Gold  is  most  commonly  associated  with  arsenopyrite  and  pyrite  mineralization. 
Native gold is commonly observed within the mineralized zones, particularly associated with smokey grey 
quartz veins, which are the main host to high grade gold mineralization” (Dadson and Johnson, 2006).
The higher grade gold intercepts are associated with zones of strong silicification/albitization and quartz 
carbonate veining, which are part of a larger overall alteration assemblage. In addition to silicification and 
quartz  carbonate  veining,  varying  amounts  of  sericite,  calcium  carbonate  and  iron  carbonate  alteration 
occur.
The present geological interpretation of gold mineralization in the Twin Lakes area recognizes a number 
of  discrete  veins  or  vein  zones  that  strike  about  1000  azimuth  and  dip  to  the  northeast  at  about  700 
(see Figure  9.1).  In  the  previous  estimate,  the  mineralized/alteration  zones  were  considered  to  be 
stratigraphically  controlled,  were  interpreted  as  continuously  mineralized  (using  gold  and  arsenic  grades 
>1,000 ppm  as  a  guide),  were  striking  generally  east-west,  and  dipping  steeply  to  the  north.  Several 
seasons of drilling, some of it close spaced (on the order of 12 m) and additional work on the structural 
regime indicates mineralized zones locally do cross cut lithology.
The Monument Bay project is comprised of a number of sub-areas as shown in Figure 9.2. These include 
the West (Buck) Area, Main Area, Frantic (South) Area, Near East Area, Middle East Area and Far East 
Area. The Main Area is of primary importance in relation to the resource estimate as this is the only area 
that has been modelled and estimated.
Some  drilling  has  been  done  in  the  West  Area,  which  indicated  gold  values  within  a  primarily  chloritic 
alteration system. The Frantic or South Area did not result in significant gold values; however, the drilling 
did demonstrate geological continuity of alteration, structures and mineralization that suggest the potential 
for increased gold values to the east. The eastern areas (i.e., Near East, Middle East and Far East) show 
evidence of mineralization and alteration that warrant continued investigation should the project advance 
to production.
The present geological interpretation of gold mineralization in the Twin Lakes area recognizes 15 discrete 
veins  or  vein  zones  that  strike  about  100º  azimuth  and  dip  to  the  northeast  at  about  70º.  The  veins  are 
distributed over an east-west distance of about 3 km, but are arrayed in an en-echelon pattern such that, 
from west to east, they step progressively to the north, and the longest individual vein or zone is less than 
1,000 meters in length. This configuration is consistent with dextral strike-slip deformation that has been 
recognized by geologists of the Manitoba Geological Survey elsewhere in the region.
With  increased  data  and  information,  the  number  of  veins  discovered,  delineated  and  modelled  has 
increased  over  the  life  of  the  project.  The  most  extensive  zones  are  the  C,  B,  A  and  G;  other  zones  of 
lesser extent are A1, B1, C1, V125, V146, E, X1, X2, 101, 102, 104 (Figure 9.1).
Gold  is  the  only  mineral  of  economic  significance,  and  occurs  in  both  quartz-carbonatealbite  veins  and 
within  zones  of  silicification  and  albitization.  In  both  cases  gold  is  spatially  associated  with  pyrite  and

arsenopyrite but also occurs in native form. Minor pyrrhotite and sphalerite are also present in some areas. 
The best-mineralized quartz veins typically are smoky, grey to bluish-grey in color.

Gold is not uniformly distributed within the veins, but is concentrated in shoots that plunge to the east at 
about  30º  to  40º.  These  shoots  range  from  about  100  to  300  meters  in  length,  with  the  exception  of  one 
portion of the C Zone in which a trend of elevated gold grades can be followed for about 600 meters down-
plunge. Within several of the more-extensive zones, B and C in particular, there appears to be a pattern of 
low-grade trends conjugate to the high-grade trends against which the high-grade trends terminate.  If this 
pattern is real, it is probably indicative of the stress regime in which the veins were formed, or in which the 
gold was deposited, and suggests that there may be a relatively predictable regularity to the distribution of 
gold.
Sericite is the most common alteration mineral, as an envelope surrounding both quartz veins and areas of 
silicification and albitization. Albite destruction is common in areas of sericite alteration. Fuchsite has been 
noted in some veins. Minor amounts of molybdenite and are present in the C Zone.

completeness.
The mineral resource estimate presented in Section 16.0 is based upon all data from all the drill programs 
conducted  by  previous  operators  as  this  recent  Rolling  Rock  accomplishment.  The  mineral  resource 
estimate is based on drill results obtained from holes drilled over what is termed as the “main resource area” 
which is a three-kilometer strike length zone within the Twin Lakes – Seeber River area that contains all the 
significant zones of gold mineralization that have been discovered to date.
The  Monument  Bay  Diamond  drill  database  consists  of  414  holes  totalling  113,703.6  meters.  The  pre-
acquisition Bema database contained 360 holes totalling 96,981.9 m to which Rolling Rock added 54 holes 
totalling 16,745.7 m.

Summary of Monument Bay Diamond Drill Holes Used in Resource Update
The  collar  locations  of  all  holes  were  surveyed  at  the  time  they  were  drilled  and  as  many  as  possible  of 
those drilled by Noranda and Wolfden were re-surveyed by Bema. Because many of the holes were drilled 
on the frozen surface of southern Twin Lake or the Seeber River, their locations could not be confirmed.
All holes were surveyed down-hole for deviation in strike and dip, although by a variety of methods, which 
may have introduced variations in relative accuracy.
For the Rolling Rock drill holes, the services of Barnes and Duncan Surveying of Winnipeg, Manitoba were 
engaged to locate the collars. Downhole surveys were conducted every 50 meters from collar and at the end 
of the hole using EZ-Shot bore single shot photo survey equipment.

Although most holes were drilled at an orientation intended to intersect the target mineralized zones at right 
angles,  some  were  drilled  at  various  other  orientations  and  the  mineralized  structures  also  have  variable 
orientations in space; therefore, it is not possible to make a generalized statement regarding the relationship 
between sample length and true thickness.

Most drill core samples collected by Noranda were 1.5 meters in length; the majority of those collected by 
Wolfden, Bema and Rolling Rock were one meter in length. Sample intervals were broken at lithological 
boundaries  to  differentiate  between  rock  types,  as  well  as  to  isolate  intervals  of  quartz  veining  and 
mineralization. Minimum sample length was eight centimeters; maximum sample length was seven meters 
with an average of 1.05 meters.

SECTION 13.0 – SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALAYSIS AND
SECURITY
The complete database consists of 38,370 assay intervals at an average assay length of 1.001 meters for a 
total  of  38,408.4  meters.  The  following  section  was  excerpted  from  the  “Technical  Report  on  the 
Monument  Bay  Gold  Deposit, Twin  Lakes  Manitoba;  Focus  on  Gold  Inventory  Update”  by  Garcia and 
Shearer and is included for completeness.
Sampling  protocols  followed  by  Noranda  and  Wolfden  are  not  known.  Noranda  submitted  drill  core 
samples to the Warnick Hersey Laboratory in Winnipeg for analysis by atomic absorption with a fire assay 
finish. A description of procedures used by Bema and Rolling Rock is as follows:
•  Sample selection was made by the core logger who marked the sample intervals and placed a permanent
sample marker in the core box.
•  The  core  was  then  sawn  into  two  portions,  half  was  placed  in  a  plastic  sample  bag  and  the  remaining
portion replaced in the core box for archival purposes.
•  The individual sample bags were packed into fiber sacs and shipped to Winnipeg either directly or via 
Red Sucker Lake. In Winnipeg, the samples were palletized and shrink wrapped before being forwarded 
to TSL Laboratories in Saskatoon for analysis. TSL Labs is ISO accredited.
•  Once samples are received by TSL, these are sorted and verified according to a Sample Submittal Form. 
Any  discrepancies  between  the  actual  shipment  and  the  submittal  form  are  noted  and  reported.  The 
shipment  is  assigned  a  TSL  reference number  (S#). A worksheet  with  analyses  requested  is  generated. 
Labels  for  the  samples  are  produced  from  the  worksheet  and  identify  the  S#  and  customer  sample 
number.  The  labels  are  placed  on  tin-tie  bags  for  the  pulverized  portion  (pulp),  and  plastic  bags  for 
crushed material (rejects). Original sample bags are discarded due to damage incurred during shipping.
•  The  samples  were  dried,  crushed  in  oscillating  jaw  crushers  to  95  %  passing  10  mesh  (1.70 mm). 
Samples  are  riffle  split;  typically  a  250 g  sub  sample  is  pulverized,  the  remaining  is  stored  as  reject. 
Ring-mill  pulverizers  grind  samples  to  95%  passing  150  mesh  (106  micron).  At  the  beginning  of  each 
shift  and/or  the  start  of  a  new  group,  samples  are  screened  to  ensure  correct  particle  sizes.  Crushers, 
rifflers,  and  pans  are  cleaned  with  compressed  air  between  samples.  Pulverizing  pots  and  rings  are 
brushed, hand cleaned, and air blown crushed and then analyzed by TSL for gold and arsenic.
•  Routine  gold  analyses  were  performed  on  50  grams  of  sample  material  by  fire  assay  with  an  atomic 
absorption finish. Samples that had assays in excess of three g/t were re-assayed by fire assay on a two 
assay ton aliquot followed by a gravimetric finish. Samples with assay values in excess of 10 g/t were re-
assayed using metallic screening.
•  Bema and Rolling Rock employed sample blanks, standards and duplicates. Blanks were prepared from 
barren  country  rock  obtained  in  the  vicinity  of  the  property.  Six  standards,  prepared  by  CDN  Labs, 
Burnaby  B.C.,  were  used  to  monitor  analytical  accuracy.  The  standards  represented  a  range  of  gold 
values in order that, in intervals of suspected higher grade, higher-grade standards could be inserted.
•  One each of the blanks, standards and duplicates were inserted into the sample stream for every group of
25 – 30 samples or one QA-QC samples in every 10.
•  TSL  Laboratories also used an in-house QA / QC program in which one standard, duplicate and blank
sample was inserted into every batch of 20 samples.
•  Bulk of the sample crushed and pulp reject are currently under the safe keeping of TSL laboratories. TSL
takes all precautions deemed necessary to protect the integrity of samples in storage.

SECTION 14.0 – DATA VERIFICATION
The  author  (QP)  did  not  do  any  direct  data  validation  or  data  verification  other  than  core  inspection 
performed  during  a  site  visit  dated  3  September  2008.  However,  the  author  did  review  the  extensive 
documentation and reports (2006 Technical Report by Wardrop). In addition, the author is satisfied that 
historical and recent work was performed in a professional manner by qualified individuals working for 
reputable companies. It should be noted that at all times Rolling Rock followed the direction of advisors 
and independent consultants with regard to continuous improvement and recommendations.
Therefore, it is the opinion of the author that the data set supplied should be considered to be validated 
and  verified  for  the  purpose  of  the  resource  estimate  as  presented  in  this  document.  All  future  drilling 
should  follow  the  same  procedures  and  protocols  for  sampling  and  QA/QC  for  consistency  and 
continuity.
During  Wardrop’s  2006  and  2008  studies,  the  GEMCOM  and  Datamine  Systems  were  used  for 
modelling,  analysis  and  resource  estimation.  All  relevant  data  was  extracted  and  imported  into  the 
MineSight System. This included drillholes, topography and geology solids. During the import procedure, 
MineSight’s validation and error-checking facility showed no data errors.

SECTION 16.0 – MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL
TESTING
16.1
2005-2006 Metallurgical Testwork
16.2
Introduction
Metallurgical  testwork  was  carried  out  on  Monument  Bay  ore  by  the  previous  owners  of  the  project 
(Bema  Gold)  at  SGS  Lakefield  (Lakefield,  Ontario)  and  G&T  Metallurgical  Services  (Kamloops,  BC). 
The  ore  has  two  viable  flowsheets:  direct  cyanide  leaching  of  the  ore,  which  gives  a  recovery  of 
approximately  95%;  or  flotation  recovery  of  the  ore  followed  by  leaching  of  the  flotation  concentrate, 
which gives a 93% recovery. In both options, significant gold can be recovered by gravity ahead of other 
processing.  The  direct  leaching  process  has  been  selected  for  the  proposed  1,000 t/d  treatment  rate.  At 
significantly higher treatment rates, the flotation option would possibly offer some benefits.
It  is  assumed  that  the  plant  will  be  built  economically  using  both  competitively  priced  new  equipment 
(possibly from China) and refurbished used equipment.
16.3
Process Description
ROM ore from underground will be trucked to the ore process plant from underground. The ore will be 
fed to the crusher or stored in an open stockpile at the plant area. Crushing will be carried out during one 
single (12-hour) shift per day; grinding and leaching will be continuous at 24 h/d.
Ore is dumped through a 500 mm grizzly into a 50 tonne live capacity dump pocket. Ore is reclaimed by 
apron  feeder  and  fed  to  a  750  x  1,000 mm  (30"  x  40")  Jaw  crusher.  This  crusher  will  accept  500 mm 
rocks.  Primary  jaw  crushed  ore  is  collected  on  a  24"  (600 mm)  conveyor  and  transferred  to  a  2  x 4 m 
double-deck  screen  via  a  transfer  tower  and  secondary  24"  conveyor.  This  screen  is  located  above  a 
1,000 tonne live capacity fine ore bin (9 x 13 m). Fines (<15 mm) fall directly into the bin, with oversize 
being directed to a secondary cone crusher via chute. The screen oversize is crushed by a 4¼" SH (HP300 
or similar) cone crusher. Cone crushed material is fed onto the same belt as the jaw crushed product and 
fed via the transfer tower to the same screen.
Ore is reclaimed from the fine ore bin via a belt feeder, and fed by the mill feed belt (and weigh scale) to 
a 3.5 x 5.5 m ball mill with a 1,000 kW motor.
Some  consideration  was  given  to  coarse  crushing  and  SAG-Ball  mill  comminution,  but  at  the  modest 
treatment rate of 1,000 t/d, fine crushing and single-stage ball milling is more economic. The 1,000 tonne 
fine or bin could be replaced by an open stockpile.
Ball  mill  discharge  is fed via  pumps  to  a  cyclopac  containing  hydrocyclones. A  bleed stream  from  this 
circuit is fed to a centrifugal gravity concentrator, with concentrate being treated over a shaking table for 
free gold recovery. Cyclone underflow is returned to the ball mill. The cyclone overflow is fed via a trash 
screen to a 4 m diameter hi-rate thickener. The thickener is used to control density to the CIL circuit, with 
thickener  overflow  being  returned  to  the  grinding  circuit  (via  carbon  columns  where  dissolved  gold  is 
recovered).

Ore slurry at approximately 40% solids is fed to the CIL consisting of a pre-leach tank and six CIL tanks. 
CIL  plant  residence  time  is  36  hours  and  all  the  tanks  are  8.5 m  diameter  x  9 m  high.  The  CIL  tanks 
contain  activated  carbon  retained  by  NKM  (or  similar)  inter-tank  screens.  Carbon  is  moved  counter-
currently  to  advancing  slurry  flow  by  recessed  impellor  vertical  pumps  (or  airlifts),  which  move  the 
carbon as a slurry. Slurry leaving the CIL circuit is fed (via a safety screen) to the tailings thickener (4 m 
hi-rate)  where  solution  containing  cyanide  is  recovered  for  re-use  in  the  grinding  circuit. The  thickener 
underflow is fed to the cyanide destruction reactors (the SO2/air method is assumed) before being pumped 
to the tailings impoundment area. Water is reclaimed from the tailings impoundment area for re-use in the 
plant.
Approximately 1.5 t/d of loaded carbon is harvested from the first CIL tank and sent to the carbon elution 
circuit.  The  carbon  is  backwashed  to  remove  trash,  and  then  washed  with  hydrochloric  acid  to  remove 
lime/gypsum  scale.  The  cleaned  carbon  is  transferred  to  the  elution  column  where  the  gold  is  removed 
from the carbon in the pressure vessel using hot (120°C) caustic solutions and electrowinning technology 
(where  gold  is  electro-won  onto  stainless  steel  filaments).  Gold  is  removed  from  the  steel  filament  by 
pressure washing and the gold sludge is smelted into doré bars in a diesel-fired furnace. The eluted carbon 
is transferred  back to the CIL  circuit  (last  CIL  tank)  or it  may  be  thermally  regenerated  at 650°C  in  an 
indirectly fired kiln. It is anticipated that about 35% of the carbon may need to be thermally regenerated 
on each pass to remove organic contamination (oil, etc.) that would deactivate the ore.
The plant will be housed within a single building, which will also contain reagent mixing facilities and a 
maintenance  area.  An  office  and  metallurgical  lab  may  also  be  contained  within  the  same  building, 
although the assay lab will be located elsewhere on site.
A simplified process flowsheet is shown as Figure 16.1.

Introduction
The  following  sections  detail  the  methods,  processes  and  strategies  employed  in  creating  the  resource 
estimate. It should be noted that within this document, resources are calculated for the each of the veins 
within  the  Monument  Bay  deposit.  Future  development  opportunity  for  both  open  pit  and  underground 
mining has been identified and exists within the numerous veins. Table 17.1 lists some conventions and 
abbreviations that are encountered throughout the resource estimation section of this report.

Data Evaluation
A total of 414 drillholes were supplied for the Monument Bay deposit estimate, which are the combined 
drillholes for the A, A1, B, B1, C, C1, E, G70, X1, X2, 101, 102, 104, 125 and 146  zones.
This includes drillholes from numerous exploration drilling campaigns from 1989 to 2007 (14 from 1989; 
36 from 1990; 18 from 1991; 4 FN holes from 2003; 7 GSC holes from 2004; 5 MAK holes from 1991; 1 
MB hole from 2005; 11 SR holes from 2000; 4 SR holes from 2003; 7 STL holes from 1990; 1 STL hole 
from 1991; 12 TL holes from 2000; 31 TL holes from 2002; 66 TL holes from 2003; 74 TL holes from 
2004; 69 TL holes from 2005; 26 TL holes from 2006; and 28 TL holes from 2007).
The holes drilled during each successive campaign were mainly definition and infill drilling to the south 
to  better  define  the  resource.  The  drillholes  within  the  database  included  collars,  downhole  surveys, 
assays, and lithology (Figure 17.1).

Figure 17.1:  Example of Drillhole Database Showing Grades and Lithology Codes
The drillhole database (metric) was supplied in electronic format by Rolling Rock. This included collars, 
downhole surveys, lithology data and assay data (i.e., Au  g/t, %As, domain, vein number and lithology 
code) with downhole from and to intervals in metric units.
The drillhole database was numerically coded by mineralized zone solid, and then manually adjusted by 
drillhole to ensure the accuracy of zonal intercepts. Figure 17.2 shows a box plot and statistics for gold 
within each of the interpreted vein zones. Simple statistics for gold assays (weighted and unweighted) by 
assay interval are shown in Tables 17.2 and 17.3.
The  assay  database  shows that  gold  distributions  are well behaved (in comparison  with  other  deposits), 
with  several  samples  in  each  case  representing  an  outlier  population.  The  respective  mean  overall  gold 
grade (weighted by sample length) is 0.31 g/t with standard deviations of 2.58. However, within the ore 
zones, the mean grade increases to 3.27 g/t with a standard deviation of 14.23.
Gold assays have a relatively high coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.36, within the ore zones weighted by 
sample  length  in  Table  17.2.  This  indicates  a  relatively  modest  scatter  of  the  raw  data  values.  The 
coefficient  of  variation  is  defined  as  CV=σ/m  (standard  deviation/mean),  and  represents  a  measure  of 
variability that is unit-independent. This variability index can be used to compare different and unrelated 
distributions. Zones with relatively high CVs are B, B1, C, X1, G70 and 125.

Topography
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Topography was imported from an AutoCAD topographic map supplied by Rolling Rock in DXF format. 
The  surfaces  were  generated  from  a  1  meter  topographic  map  created  by  McElhanney  Engineering 
Services Limited. The topography was surveyed and is believed to be accurate. Checks against drillhole 
collars illustrate accuracy to within 1 meter.
Figure 17.10 (above) shows the topographic surface in orange and the overburden surface in brown. The 
overburden surface was created from triangulating the bottom of the overburden intercepts in the drillhole 
database. This was then used to clip the vein solids to account for the volume of overburden material that 
will be needed to be stripped in any surface mining operations.
Figure  17.11  shows  the  triangulated  surface  of  the  topographic  contours.  Figure  17.12  shows  the  3D 
gridded topographic surface. The gridded surface is used for 3D Lersch-Grossman pit optimizations.

Computerized Geologic Modelling
Solid models of the Monument Bay deposit were created using the sectional interpretations from drillhole 
intersections within the database. These were based on both lithology and gold grade. The ore zones or 
vein solids were then used for constraining the interpolation procedure. The interpretations for each vein 
were created on very closely spaced sections at 120 meter intervals.
The  main  difference  between  the  current  model  and  past  geological  interpretations  and  models  is  the 
detailed  interpretation  of  the  125  zone.  In  previous  studies,  the  125  zone  was  defined  as  one  large, 
complete solid, so that during the interpolation procedure the ellipse was limited in the vertical direction 
or across the width of the vein. For this resource estimate, the 125 zone was interpreted and modelled as 
numerous continuous zones. In addition, the solids for all veins were manually edited in order to line up 
with, and include, the drillhole intercepts. This allows for more accurate accounting of volumes and better 
represents  the  actual  location  of  the  zones  at  the  actual  intercept  (although  there  will  be  “kinks”  in  the 
solids). As this is an inferred resource, the tolerances are presently acceptable; however, for future studies 
it is recommended that the solids be re-interpreted from first principals.
Once  the  solids  models  were  created,  they  were  used  to  code  the  drillhole  assays  and  composites  for 
subsequent  geostatistical  analysis.  Since  the  quality  of  the  variograms  was  poor  and  the  choice  of 
interpolator was inverse distance, the value of the variograms was limited. For the purpose of the resource 
model,  the  solid  zone  was utilized to  constrain  the block  model  by  matching  assays  to  those  within  the 
zones in a process called geologic matching so that only composites that lie within a particular zone are 
used to interpolate the blocks within that zone. The orientation and ranges (distances) utilized for search 
ellipsoids  used  in  the  estimation  process  were  derived  from  strike  and  dip  of  the  mineralized  zone  and 
previous site knowledge and conclusions from previous studies.

17.3.1.1  Composites
It  was  determined  that  the  2.0  meter  composite  lengths  offered  the  best  balance  between  supplying 
common support for samples and minimizing the smoothing of the grades, as well as reducing the effect 
of  high  grades  to  a  small  extent.  The  most  common  sample  length  was  1.0  meter,  with  88%  of  the 
composites  being  <  1.1  meters.  Remnants or “tails” of  less than  2  meters  occurred  where  the  drillholes 
exited the vein solids. Composites of less than 0.5 meters were merged with the previous composite.
Although it is preferable to have all composites the same length, it is not always possible, especially when 
estimating  a  vein  deposit  such  as  Monument  Bay.  In  theory,  if  all  composites  are  of  equal  size  and 
reasonably de-clustered, then those composites should represent an equal volume of rock; therefore, the 
composites  should  represent  the  same  proportional  amount  of  rock  with  equal  weight  on  the  overall 
average  grade.  It  is  possible,  however,  that  a  bias  can  be  introduced  into  the  estimate  by  assigning  the 
same  weight  to  smaller  (i.e.,  shorter)  composites,  especially  if  these  smaller  composites  differ 
significantly  in  average  grade  from  the  rest  of  the  population.  Merging  the  tails  with  the  previous 
composites will tend to smooth the effects of the remnants and lessen any biasing effect on the high or 
low side.
Figures 17.16 and 17.17 provide an analysis of all assay interval lengths and those within the ore zone, 
where two meters appears to be the optimal interval length overall.

Table 17.4 shows the detailed statistics for the 2 meter composites. Note that a number of the veins—B, 
C, C1, G, X1 and 125 in particular—have relatively high CVs (i.e., greater than 1.5), and the overall CV 
for  all  vein  composites  is  fairly  high  at  2.48.  However,  when  the  composite  data  is  limited  or  “cut”  to 
39.5 g/t, then the CV’s are greatly reduced to less than 2.00 in all cases and the overall vein CV is reduced 
to 1.40.
Figures 17.18 and 17.19 illustrate the histogram and grade tonnage curve for the gold composites, while 
Figure 17.20 shows the cumulative frequency plot for gold composite grade intervals.

Outliers
Limiting the influence as opposed to capping of gold assays were performed for although the distribution 
of  grades  followed  a  lognormal  distribution  the  probability  plots  showed  “breaks”  which  indicated 
multiple populations. Figure 17.20 shows a change or “break” in the cumulative frequency plot indicative 
of an outlier population at 37.5 g/t Au. This threshold results in the limiting of 1% of the total data set 
within  the  vein  solids.  In  addition,  as  pointed  out  above,  the  effect  of  limiting  the  gold  grades  above 
37.5 g/t reduces the CV to acceptable values, especially for a resource estimate using inverse distance as 
the interpolator.
It is important to note the method employed for this study was not to cut the high-grade outliers, but to 
limit  their  influence.  The  range  selected  to  limit  grades  greater  than  the  outlier  cut-off  of  37.5 g/t  was 
20 meters or 2 block lengths. In other words, composite grades greater than the threshold amounts were 
not used in the estimation if the high-grade composites were outside the respective radius from that block.
17.3.2.1
Specific Gravity Determinations
A total of 69 bulk density measurements using wax-coated submersion techniques were collected. Using 
these data, the specific gravity was determined to be 2.73 t/m3 for all zones and was utilized for this study. 
A  specific  gravity  of  2.76 t/m3  was  used for  waste  zones.  It  is recommended  that for all  future  studies, 
exploration and development, the measurement of specific gravity should be included to better evaluate 
the density of ore and waste material. This will bring additional confidence to tonnage calculations and 
allow resource categories to be upgraded.

Variography
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The grade estimation methodology used did not involve kriging, so geostatistics was of limited relevance. 
The  author  carried  out  a  preliminary  geostatistical  analysis  on  the  composites  to  evaluate  the  potential 
search parameters to be used in the grade estimate.
Downhole  correlograms  were  generated  to  estimate  the  nugget  effect,  as  that  is  the  direction  in  which 
there is most abundant data. Figure 17.21, which shows the downhole correlogram for the Au composites, 
illustrates a modest nugget effect of 30% of the sill. Geostatistical analyses were performed on the assays 
and  composites  using  no  constraints  in  addition  to  the  coded  intervals  within  the  zone  solid.  The 
downhole correlogram also gives a good indication of the range for the vertical direction or perpendicular 
to the vein (i.e., vein width).
Figure 17.21:  Downhole Correlogram for Au Composites
The ellipsoid direction chosen for the estimation process was 93° rotation about the Z axis, -30° rotation 
about the X axis and 73° rotation about the Y axis. Maximum ellipse size was selected to be 350 m along 
the major axis, 275 m along the  minor axis and 25 m along the vertical axis. This direction follows the 
orientation of the vein solids, which are the major mineralized structures with a rack of 30°.
The  spatial  continuity  estimator  chosen  for  this  study  was  the  correlogram,  which  has  been  shown  in 
previous work to be more robust with respect to drift and data variability, allowing for a better estimation 
of  the  observed  continuity  (Parker  and  Srivastava,  1988).  Note  that  the  sill  of  the  variograms  has  been 
standardized to one, so the variograms are therefore relative.
Figures 17.22 and 17.23 show the correlograms for the primary orientations of the ellipse utilized in the 
estimation  process.  The  rotations  of  the  angles  for  the  ellipsoid  are  given  according  to  the  convention 
used by GSLIB in MineSight Compass.

Block Model Definition
The block model used to calculate the resource was defined according to the following limits shown in 
Figure 17.25.
The  block  model  is  orthogonal  and  non-rotated,  reflecting  the  orientation  of  the  deposit.  Figure  17.26 
shows the position and orientation of the block model used for the study. The block size chosen was 10 x 
1 x 10 m to roughly reflect drill hole spacing available and to adequately descretize the deposit.
Of the potential 10,968,750 blocks to be estimated (450 rows, 375 columns, 65 levels), less than 99,179.6 
blocks  or  0.9%  have  estimated  values  in  them  (weighted  against  topography  and  within  vein).  This  is 
primarily due to the geologic constraints applied to the estimation process and the limited search distances 
applied, as well as the search ellipsoid direction and use of inverse distance as the modelling method.

Resource Interpolation
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Inverse  distance  to  the  third  power  was  chosen  as  the  interpolator  for  the  Monument  Bay  resource 
estimation process. For an open-pit, bulk-tonnage scenario, inverse distance to the second or third power 
is preferred. However, in this case where there are large, high-grade zones within which high-grade veins 
are being evaluated from an underground mining perspective, inverse distance to a higher power is more 
appropriate as it localizes the grade.
Three estimation passes were used, because a better block-by-block estimation can be achieved by using 
more restrictions on those blocks that are closer to drill holes and thus better informed. The three passes 
are  based  on  increasing  the  levels  of  information  used  to  estimate  blocks  where  each  pass  is  less 
constrained than the previous pass.
The estimation plan includes the following items:
•
•
•
storage of the mineralized vein solid code and percentage of mineralization
application of density
estimation of the grades for gold using inverse distance to the third power using a three passes.
The  estimation  strategy  employed  a  minimum  of  three  composites  and  a  maximum  of  twelve,  with  a 
maximum of three from any one drillhole. Table 17.6 summarizes the search ellipse dimensions for the 
estimation passes.

Resources
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  resources  were  estimated  using  significantly  revised  vein  solids,  especially  in  the  case  of  the 
125 zone. All zones were interpreted and edited on 10 meter section spacing, and zones were extrapolated 
at  reasonable  distances  to  surface  and  to  depth  based  on  drill  intercepts.  In  addition,  the  overburden 
surface  was  estimated  and  the  vein  solids  were  clipped  to  this  limiting  surface.  It  is  reasonable,  in  the 
authors opinion, that block interpolated into these solids are within the definition of mineral resource as 
defined below.
A  mineral  resource  is  a  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid  inorganic  material,  or 
natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals 
in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity 
of  a  mineral  resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological  evidence  and 
knowledge.
The term “mineral resource” covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic interest that 
has  been  identified  and  estimated  through  exploration  and  sampling  and  within  which  mineral  reserves 
may  subsequently  be  defined  by  the  consideration  and  application  of  technical,  economic,  legal, 
environmental, socio-economic and governmental factors. The phrase ‘reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction’ implies a judgment by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic factors 
likely  to  influence  the  prospect  of  economic  extraction.  A  mineral  resource  is  an  inventory  of 
mineralization  that  under  realistically  assumed  and  justifiable  technical  and  economic  conditions  might 
become  economically  extractable.  These  assumptions  must  be  presented  explicitly  in  both  public  and 
technical reports.
In addition, these resources are categorized as inferred resources as defined by CIM Standards as stated in 
the following:
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
can  be  estimated  based  on  geological  evidence  and  limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not 
verified,  geological  and  grade  continuity.  The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and  sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to inferred mineral resources, it cannot be assumed that all or 
any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured mineral resource as a 
result  of  continued  exploration.  Confidence  in  the  estimate  is  insufficient  to  allow  the  meaningful 
application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of 
public  disclosure.  Inferred  mineral  resources  must  be  excluded  from  estimates  forming  the  basis  of 
feasibility or other economic studies.
The inferred resources as defined by the parameters in Table 17.6 (above) are listed in Table 17.7. These 
resources are listed at varying cut-off grades for each element within the Main Zone.  A comparison of 
statistics is provided in Table 17.8.

Model Validation
A graphical validation was done on the block model to do the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
checks  the  reasonableness  of  the  estimated  grades,  based  on  the  estimation  plan  and  the  nearby 
composites
check that the general drift and the local grade trends of the block model, compared to the drift and 
local grade trends of the composites
insure that all blocks that should be filled in, are in fact filled in
check that topography and overburden surface has been properly accounted for
check against manual “ballpark” estimates of tonnage to determine reasonableness
inspect and explain high-grade blocks created as a result of outliers.
The  mean  block  grade  compared  against  the  mean  grade  for  the  composites  differs  by  a  mere  0.74%, 
which  indicates  an  excellent  correlation  between  the  source  data  and  the  resultant  resource  estimate.  In 
addition,  the  resultant  CV  is  reduced  to  1.35  from  1.40,  which  is  excellent  for  a  high-grade  vein-type 
deposit such as Monument Bay.
A full set of cross-sections, long-sections and plans were used to check the block model on the computer 
screen, showing the block grades and the composite. No evidence of any block being wrongly estimated 
was  found;  it  appears  that  every  block  grade  can  be  explained  as  a  function  of  the  surrounding 
composites, the ellipsoid direction and orientation used, and the estimation plan applied.
Validation techniques are limited to the following:
•  visual inspections on a section-by-section and plan-by-plan basis
•  histograms at varying cut-off grades, which demonstrate a relatively uniform, lognormal distribution
(as in Figure 17.43), which is common for a high-grade, vein-constrained resource
•  grade tonnage curves (shown in Figure 17.44) showing a smoothed curve compared to the composites
•
•
•
swath  plots  showing  the  comparison  of  the  ordinary  kriged  blocks  vs.  inverse  distance  and  nearest 
neighbor estimates as shown Figures 17.45, 17.46 and 17.47 for eastings, northings and elevations
an inspection of histograms of distance of first composite to nearest block, average distance to blocks 
for all composites used as shown in Figure 17.48
analysis  of  relative  variability  index  which  quantifies  variability  within  the  deposit;  this  technique 
may be used in further studies to quantify risk and qualify resources for the purpose of classification.

As shown in Figures 17.45 to 17.47, the inverse distance and nearest neighbor curves track quite closely; 
however, the ordinary kriged model is reporting relatively higher grades.
Table  17.9  shows  the  resources  reported  by  varying  cut-off  grades  using  ordinary  kriging,  inverse 
distance and nearest neighbor interpolations. At a zero cut-off, the ordinary kriged model results in gold 
grades that are higher by 8% than the inverse distance model, while the nearest neighbor model has gold 
grades that are 1% higher. At increasing cut-offs, the difference is significantly greater.
The conclusion that may be drawn is that the choice of inverse distance is a more conservative approach, 
but well within reasonable limits. In addition, the ordinary kriged model is usually more smoothed than 
the  inverse  distance  model,  which  is  not  the  case  in  this  instance,  confirming  the  choice  of  inverse 
distance as the interpolator.

SECTION 18.0 – OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
18.1
Mining Operations
The  conceptual  mine  plan  calls  for  an  underground  mining  operation  with  an  ore  production  rate  of 
1,000 t/d. The concept strategy employs a combination of mining methods, with shrinkage stoping being 
the primary method and longhole stoping being the secondary method. The ore will be transported to the 
mill via the main access ramp utilizing truck haulage.
18.1.1  Mining Methodology
The conceptual study evaluated both the potential for open pit mining and the potential for underground 
mining of the Monument Bay orebody.
18.1.1.1  Open Pit Mining
The  Monument  Bay  project  did  have  the  potential  for  part  of  the  orebody  to  be  mined  by  open  pit 
methods since the orebody extends up to the top of bedrock in many locations and the top of bedrock is 
located close to surface.
Economic pit determinations were completed using the following cost parameters:
•  gold price of US$700/oz
•  mining costs of CAD$3.80/t for ore and waste
•
combined milling costs and overhead costs of CAD$22.90/t milled
•  pit wall slope of 45°.
The results are shown in Figure 18.1. For these pit shells, the resource is 0.9 Mt of ore at 5.5 g/t Au with 
15.6 Mt of waste, for a strip ratio of 18:1. The revenue generated from these pits is too small to offset the 
major costs and risks associated with removing/diverting the large water features of the Seeber River and 
Twin  Lakes.  Therefore,  the  possibility  of  open  pit  mining  was  dismissed  and  an  evaluation  of 
underground mining commenced.
18.1.1.2  Underground Mining
The  selection  of  a  specific  mining  method  is  generally  related  to  the  geometry  of  the  orebody  and  the 
strength characteristics of the rock, both the ore and the host rock. The narrow widths of the Monument 
Bay  orebody  preclude  the  consideration  of  any  bulk  mining  method,  except  for  narrow  vein  longhole 
stoping. Longhole stoping requires the orebody to have the following characteristics:
•  The  orebody  must  have  a steep  dip  that exceeds the angle  of repose  of the  ore;  hang-ups  along  the
footwall are not desirable.
•  The boundaries of the orebody must be regular to avoid excessive dilution
•  The  host  rock  must  provide  a  strong  hangingwall  and  a  strong  footwall;  the  walls  need  to  remain
standing until mining is finished so that all blasted ore can be extracted.
•  The  orebody  must  be  competent;  drill  holes  need  to  remain  open  to  facilitate  proper  loading  of
explosives and successful blasting and fragmentation of the rock.

An evaluation of the interpreted vein structures on cross-section indicated that the first two characteristics 
did exist in the orebody, but not everywhere. Although a geotechnical program has not been undertaken, a 
site visit provided visual inspection of the core. From this inspection, core recovery appeared to be high 
and the core looked competent, both in the mineralized areas and in the host rock section. Thus, from the 
information available, the latter two requirements are satisfied
The longhole stoping method can be applied to the Monument Bay orebody and has been selected as one 
of the mining methods. A second method is required since the longhole stoping method will only work 
for a portion of the orebody.
The only other two methods considered are shrinkage stoping and cut-and-fill stoping.
Cut-and-fill stoping is used where the host rock does not demonstrate competency, and therefore needs to 
be  artificially  supported,  and/or  where  a  high  level  of  selectivity  is  required.  Since  neither  of  these 
conditions  occurs  frequently  enough  to  justify  this  higher  cost  method,  cut-and-fill  stoping  is  not 
considered as a viable alternative.
Shrinkage stoping is commonly used with orebodies demonstrating the following characteristics:
•  proper flow during drawdown
•  orebody is firm and relatively competent; the miners are working directly beneath the back of each
lift, so safety is a main concern
•  orebody  has  a  stable  hangingwall  and  footwall,  and  the  walls  will  remain  standing  after  the  ore  is 
mined;  sloughing  of  the  footwall  or  squeezing  in  of  the  hangingwall  can  cause  problems  with 
drawdown
•  orebody  has  regular  boundaries;  this  method  allows  some  flexibility,  but  the  change  can  only  be
gradual.
The  dip  of  the  Monument  Bay  orebody  is  generally  in  the  range  of  55°  to  85°,  which  is  allowable  for 
shrinkage  stoping.  In  addition,  the  orebody  and  host  rock  appear  to  show  adequate  rock  strength  and 
competency  for  shrinkage  stoping.  Shrinkage  stoping  will  provide  support  of  the  footwall  and 
hangingwall if there are areas of weakness.
The shrinkage stoping method can be applied to the Monument Bay orebody and has been selected as one 
of the mining methods.
Due  to  the  irregularity  of  the  orebody,  more  areas  are  amenable  to  shrinkage  stoping  than  to  longhole 
stoping; therefore, these have been selected as the primary and secondary methods, respectively.
18.1.2
Production Rate
The production rate is selected based on the mining method and the period of time that is desirable when 
determining life-of-mine economics. Based on experience, from an NPV perspective and given the size of 
the  resource,  the  mine  life  for  this  project  would  have  been  set  at  six  to  seven  years.  This  would  have 
resulted  in  a  daily  ore  production  rate  of  between  1,500  to  1,700 t/d.  However,  consideration  must  be 
given to the mining method and whether or not it will be possible to achieve this rate. For this project, the 
primary  mining  method  is  conventional  shrinkage  mining  with  mechanized  drawpoint  access  for  ore 
removal.  A  significant  amount  of  upfront  labour  and  expenditure  is  required  to  prepare  enough  stopes 
where  ore  is  being  produced  from  all  parts  of  the  shrinkage  mining  cycle  (development,  mining,

drawdown, service raise pillar recovery). Based on this type of mining method and the fact that this is a 
narrow vein orebody, production rates of up to 1,250 tonne per day are achievable.
The  mining  method  dictates  what  range  is  acceptable  for  the  ore  production  rate.  For  this  conceptual 
study, an ore production rate of 1,000 t/d has been selected.
18.1.3  Mine Design
Mining  activities  are  represented  by  three  main  groups:    general  development,  shrinkage  stopes  and 
longhole stopes. The design criteria used for each are discussed in this section.
18.1.3.1  Development
The types of headings are generally grouped according to the equipment used for the primary breaking of 
the rock. For this project, this includes jumbo drills (jumbo development), raise climber / pneumatic hand 
held  drills  (raise  development)  and  raisebore  drill  (raisebore  development).  Design  dimensions  for  the 
headings used in this study are listed in Table 18.1.

Jumbo development headings primarily include the access ramp; haulage levels, levels and drifts; cut-outs 
for ore / waste passes and ventilation raises; and cross-cuts to the ore. The dimensions of these headings 
are based on the largest size of equipment that will operate in that excavation. The ramps and levels are 
designed with a clearance of 1 meter on each side of the truck. According to Manitoba’s Workplace Safety 
and  Health  Act  (Operation  of  Mines  Regulation  w210-228.94),  this  means  that  safety  stations  (wall

slashes) will be required at regular intervals not exceeding 30 meters. This is for the safety of pedestrian 
traffic in these headings.
Figure  18.2  illustrates  how  the  size  of  the  heading  may  be  dictated  by  the  ventilation  system  required 
during  the  development  stage.  The  ventilation  system  requirements  dictate  the  design  height  for  the 
access ramp, the haulage levels and the levels.
Figure 18.2:  Schematic of Development Heading With Equipment
Raise development will be performed with a pneumatic raise climber. Generally the raises will be from 
level to level, approximately 52 m in length. The raise climber will be used for most raise requirements 
within  the  mine,  including  ore  and  waste  pass  raises,  ventilation raises,  service raises  for  the  shrinkage 
stopes and blasthole slot raises for the longhole stopes.
Raisebore  development  is  required  only  for  the  primary  ventilation  system  and  will  be  completed  by  a 
contractor. There are two primary ventilation systems, one for the western half of the mine, and one for 
the eastern half. Each system requires a raisebore hole from surface, which is sized at a diameter of 3.1 m 
to provide minimal resistance for the ventilation system. The western ventilation system also requires a 
raisebore hole underground.

Shrinkage Stopes
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The shrinkage stope blocks were designed according to the following criteria:
•  Use of geological block model and blocks with grade ≥ 4.0 g/t Au as a guide to create extent of
stoping block
•  Dip of vein structure of 55° to 90°
•
Irregular  changes  in  the  hangingwall  and  footwall  were  not  identified;  this  would  be  necessary  in 
detailed design
•  Min./max. stope block length of 40 m / 90 m
•  Min./max.stope block height of 30 m / 50 m
•  Drawpoints on 10 m spacing x 11.5 m length
•  Service raise – two required, one at each end of the stope for stope access
•  Mining lift height of 2.7 m along dip (3.0 m drilled)
•  Crown pillar – 5.0 m crown pillar left at top of stope (non-recoverable).
Figure 18.3 shows a schematic of a typical shrinkage stope.

Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The design of the longhole stope blocks was based on the following criteria:
•  Use  of  geological  block  model  and  blocks  with  grade  ≥  4.0 g/t  Au  as  a  guide  to  create  extent  of
stoping block
•  Dip of vein structure of 65° to 90°
•
Irregular  changes  in  the  hangingwall  and  footwall  were  identified  and  areas  were  excluded  from  a 
stoping block
•  Min./max.stope block length of 40 m / no maximum length
•  Min./max.stope block height of 30 m / 50 m
•  Drawpoints at 10 m spacing x 11.5 m length
•  Slot raise – one required, located at end of stope for blasting
•  Drill drift located at mid height of the block
•  Drilling  – upholes ~18 m length; downholes ~24 m length
•  Crown pillar – 5.0 m crown pillar left at top of stope (non-recoverable).

Ventilation
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  ventilation  system  is  a  positive  pressure  system  with  primary  ventilation  fans  installed  on  surface. 
The ventilation fans will have the capacity to supply air at a rate of 210 m3/sec (440,000 cfm) and at an 
estimated  system  total  pressure  of  1.5  to  1.7  kPa  (6"  to  7"  inch  Water  Gauge).  This  will  require  two 
300 hp axial van fans. The ventilation quantity is based on an equipment ventilation requirement of 100 
cfm per unit brake horsepower for the equipment fleet operating underground. Table 18.2 summarizes the 
unit  ventilation  requirements  for  this  equipment  fleet.  The  system  total  pressure  is  estimated  from 
operating mines with similar mining methods, similar production rates, and similar depths from surface.

The  concept  is  that  ventilation  air  will  be  supplied  to  each  level  of  a  mining  block  through  a  series  of 
ventilation raises at the back end of the block. The levels are connected together by the ventilation raises, 
which  are  in  turn  connected  to  the  primary  ventilation  shaft  via  a  ventilation  drift  at  one  of  the  level 
elevations. Ventilation regulators will be installed at each of the ventilation raises to control the quantity 
of airflow required for each level. Figure 18.5 illustrates the ventilation concept.
Secondary ventilation fans and ducting will be used to direct the appropriate amount of air to a particular 
heading.

18.1.5  Water Management
It  is  assumed  that  there  will  be  adequate  groundwater  inflow  to  provide  clean  water  to  the  drilling 
equipment.
Although no hydrology data have been collected for the underground area, it is assumed that there will be 
groundwater inflow of 25 L/sec. Dirty water will be directed to a main sump by designing development 
headings with a 1% to 2% grade and using drainholes between levels. The dirty water pumping system 
will be located at the -330 Level in the initial mining block and will serve the western half of the mine. A 
second dirty water pumping system will be required when mining progresses to the eastern extent of the 
orebody. The dirty water will be pumped to the TSF on surface via a 150 mm pipeline.
18.1.6
Resource Available for Mining
The estimated resources available for mining are summarized in Table 18.3. These resources are adjusted 
for mining dilution and mining recovery and these factors are presented in Table 18.4. The cut-off grade 
used for the resource calculation is 4.0 g/t Au.
For this conceptual study, it is assumed that all crown pillars are non-recoverable. In reality, geotechnical 
assessments and detailed mine planning should result in recovery of a portion of these crown pillar areas.

Notes:  1. Dilution percentage calculated against material >= 4.0 g/t Au within stope 3D solids. 2. Dilution percentage calculated 
against ALL material within stope 3D solids.
The resource estimate is developed in five steps:
1)  Stope outlines are created on long-section using the geological block model as a guide by only 
showing blocks with a grade ≥ 4.0 g/t Au (the pre-determined cut-off grade). The stope outline 
extents are governed by other criteria as defined in Section 18.1.4, such as continuity and regularity 
along strike and dip and minimum dip angles. These criteria were visually taken into account by 
looking at the veins in cross-section and long-section.
2)  The stope outlines are then intersected with the 3D solids of the vein structures creating 3D solids of 
the veins within the stope outlines. These solids are used to calculate the base resource number. All 
material with a grade < 4.0 g/t Au, including waste, is referred to as internal dilution.

3)  Surface crown pillar and stope crown pillar quantities are estimated for each stope solid. The base
resource is reduced by these pillar quantities prior to the application of external dilution factors.
4)  External dilution is calculated by determining the percentage of areas of the stope solids that do not
meet the minimum mining width criteria. External dilution is applied to the reduced base resource 
with a grade of 0.0 g/t Au.
5)  General mining recovery factors are then applied to the diluted resource.
The  3D  solids  and  resources  are  generated  using  MineSight®  geological  modelling  and  mine  planning 
software.

The  production schedule  is  based on  a  mill feed  rate of  1,000 t/d  of ore (360,000  t/a). The  mine  life is 
estimated to be 11 years after pre-production. The mine production schedule is summarized in Table 18.5 
(overleaf), with the ore production detailed in Table 18.6 and development requirements in Table 18.7.
Figure 18.6 illustrates the mine layout with a 3D perspective.
For scheduling purposes, the orebody is divided into eight individual areas, called mine planning blocks 
(MPB). Figure 18.7 illustrates the extent of each MPB. Each block contains both shrinkage and longhole 
stopes.  Mining  generally  starts  at  or  near  the  bottom  of  a  MPB,  progressing  along  each  level  and  then 
moving up to stopes on the next level; however, it is necessary at times to have multiple levels actively 
producing  ore, particularly  since  shrinkage  stopes and  longhole stopes are  not equally  distributed  along 
levels and amongst MPB. Maintaining this sequence will ensure the maximum amount of waste disposal 
into mined-out areas at the lowest transport distance.
For this conceptual study, the required ore production of 750 t/d from the shrinkage stopes is maintained 
at a constant rate of 9% from stope development mining, 33% from stope production mining (assuming 
40%  removal  of  total  mined),  49%  from  stope  drawdown,  and  9%  from  recovery  of  the  service  raise 
pillar. The required ore production of 250 t/d from the longhole stopes is maintained at a constant rate of 
16% from development mining and 84% from stope blasthole mining.
No allowance is provided at the start of mine production for the length of time required to advance the 
shrinkage  stopes  and  longhole  stopes  to  the  point  where  a  constant  level  of  production  is  being 
maintained  from  the  development  and  production  stages.  For  the  initial  shrinkage  stopes,  this  length  of 
time is estimated to be approximately six months, at which time the drawdown phase is achieved. For the 
longhole stopes, this length of time is significantly shorter at approximately two months. The net impact 
is that during the first year of production, the mill will not actually see full ore production from the mine, 
but  will  instead  have  a  ramped  start-up  to  full  production.  The  length  of  time  for  this  ramp-up  of  ore 
production can be decreased by stockpiling ore on surface or by increasing the amount of production from 
the longhole stopes in the initial production year.

18.1.9  Waste Disposal
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Mine sequencing will be important to minimize the amount of waste that needs to be hauled externally to 
the disposal area directly southwest of the portal. It is currently estimated that approximately 1.1 Mt will 
be hauled to the external waste disposal area. At a placed swell factor of 1.4, the external disposal area 
will require a capacity of approximately 560,000 m3. Table 18.5 (above) summarizes the annual quantities 
placed  internally  within  the  mine  and  hauled  externally  to  the  waste  disposal  area.  Figure  18.6  (above) 
depicts the location of the external disposal area.
18.1.10  Mine Equipment
The equipment required for the underground mine operations is classified into three categories:  mobile 
fleet, stationary and surface support fleet.

The  two-boom  jumbo  drills  will  primarily  be  used  for  ramp  development,  level  development  and 
drawpoint development for the shrinkage and longhole stopes. The one-boom jumbo drill will primarily 
be  used  in  the  development  of  the  undercut  drifts  for  the  shrinkage  and  longhole  stopes,  where  mining 
widths are narrower, and will assist with other development headings as required.
The longhole drill will be capable of drilling 25 to 30 m, 63 mm diameter upholes and downholes.

The  pneumatic raise  climber  will  be  capable  of  driving  raises  up to  150  m  in  length  and  up to 3.1  m  x 
3.1 m  in  area. The  raise climber  will  be used  for  development raises,  such  as  ore  and  waste  passes  and 
ventilation,  and  for  production  raises,  such  as  service  raises  for  shrinkage  stopes  and  slot  raises  for 
blasting in longhole stopes.
The scooptram (load-haul-dump or “LHD”) fleet will be used to tram ore to the ore pass; tram waste to 
either the waste pass or to a mined-out stope; and to load waste into a truck for haulage to the appropriate 
destination.  The  small  LHD  will  be  used  for  narrow  width  areas,  such  as  the  undercut  drift  for  the 
shrinkage and longhole stopes.
The primary function of the 30-tonne truck fleet will be to haul ore from the chute to the mill via the main 
ramp.  The  20-tonne  trucks  will be  used  to  haul  waste  to  the appropriate  destination, either internally  to 
mined-out stopes or externally to the waste disposal area on surface.
The  scissor  lifts  will  be  used  for  a  variety  of  tasks  in  the  mine,  including  blasthole  loading  for 
development  headings  and  longhole  stopes,  installation  of  ground  support,  and  installation  of  services 
(air, water, power, ventilation). The grader will primarily be used to maintain the main ramp for the truck 
ore haul. The utility cassette vehicle will provide an assortment of services, including delivery of supplies, 
fuel, explosives and small equipment from surface to the underground.
Stationary Equipment
The estimated stationary equipment requirements are listed in Table 18.9.

The  compressed  air  system  will  be  capable  of  delivering  up  to  3000  cfm  at  100  psi.  The  air  will  be 
delivered  by  a  150 to  200 mm  pipe  along  the  main  ramp,  reducing  to  a 100 mm  pipe  on  the levels  and 
reducing to a 50 mm pipe into the working headings.
The dirty water pumping system will be located at the -330 Level in the initial mining block. Although no 
data on groundwater inflows are currently available, it has been assumed that the pumping system will be 
capable  of  handling  an inflow  rate  of  25  L/s.  Water will  be  directed to this  main  sump  location for  the 
western half of the mine by designing development headings with a 1% to 2 % grade and through the use 
of  drainholes  between  levels.  A  second  dirty  water  pumping  system  will  be  required  when  mining 
progresses to the eastern extent of the orebody. The dirty water will be pumped to the TSF on surface via 
a 150 mm pipeline.

Truck loading chutes will be required at the bottom of each of ore pass and waste pass that are designed 
for a mining block. The chutes will be pneumatically operated and sized for loading a 30-tonne truck
One  primary  ventilation  system  will  be  required  for  mining  the  western  half  of  the  orebody  and  one 
primary ventilation system will be required for mining the eastern half of the orebody. The system will be 
capable of delivering 440,000 cfm to the underground mine via a 3.1 m raisebore-driven ventilation shaft. 
The system will include a mine air heater to heat the air to prevent freezing in the ventilation shaft.
The  underground  mine  requires  a second  egress  in  addition to  the  main  ramp.  An  industrial lift  will  be 
installed in one of the ventilation shafts and will have a six-person capacity.

18.1.13  Mine Development Schedule
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
No timeline has been developed for the mine development schedule (pre-production), but it is estimated 
that  the  duration  will  be  between  two  to  three  years.  This  does  not  include  the  time  frame  for  ore 
production  to  achieve  the  full  production  rate,  which  is  estimated  at  six  months  from  the  start  of  ore 
production from the stopes.
18.2
Capital Cost Estimate – Mine
All costs are shown in constant year 2008 Canadian dollars. Where required, a currency exchange rate of 
CAD$0.85 = US$1.00 is used. The level of accuracy associated with the cost estimate is +30% / -15%.
All operating costs from pre-production are included in the capital cost estimate. A contingency of 20% 
has been added to the estimate.
The estimate excludes costs for the following, which are included in other sections of this report:
•  winter road costs or site access road
•  mine accommodation facility (camp)
•
administration, maintenance, and operations buildings
•  warehouse and facilities for storage of operating and maintenance supplies
•
fuel storage facility on surface
•  power generation facility
•
electrical distribution – surface and underground.
Capital costs account for approximately 20% of total spending over the project life. These costs represent 
the  capital  expenditures  required  to  operate  the  underground  mine,  but  also  include  surface  preparation 
and support activities.
The capital cost estimate for the pre-production period is $72.6 million. The capital cost estimate for the 
life of mine is $86.7 million, which is summarized in Table 18.12.
The basis of this estimate is described in the following paragraphs.
18.2.1  Mine Equipment Capital Cost
The capital cost estimate for initial equipment expenditures in the pre-production period (and for life of 
mine) is $18.8 million, which is summarized in Table 18.12. Initial mine equipment capital costs include 
all  equipment  purchases  up  to  the  end  of  pre-production.  Equipment  purchases  after  pre-production  are 
considered sustaining capital.

Operating  costs  account  for  approximately  80%  of  total  spending  over  the  project  life.  These  costs 
represent the operating expenditures required to operate the underground mine, but also include surface 
preparation  and  support  activities.  Excluded  are  costs  associated  with  the  operation  of  the  mill,  tailings 
and administration.
The operating cost estimate for the pre-production period is $40.2 million, all of which has been included 
in  the  capital  cost  estimate  under  pre-production.  The  operating  cost  estimate  for  the  life  of  mine  is 
$357.5 million, which is summarized in Table 18.18 on the following page.
In Table 18.18 the costs are presented by primary cost items. Table 18.17 below presents the life-of-mine 
operating  costs  in  a  different  breakdown  where  the  cost  items  are  rolled  back  into  the  mining  areas  of 
shrinkage, longhole and general development, with a few other cost centers representing overhead costs 
supporting these mining areas.

18.3.1
Basis of Estimate
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The operating cost estimate is based on the development of a direct mining unit cost for the three main 
types  of  mining  areas:    shrinkage  stoping,  longhole  stoping  and  general  development.  This  unit  cost  is 
based on a work-up of the activities of personnel and equipment required for each mining area.
From  this  work-up  of  activities,  factors  were  derived  for  operating  personnel  requirements  (operating 
hours  per  tonne),  equipment  requirements  (operating  hours  per  tonne)  and  operating  supplies 
requirements (units per tonne). The unit operating cost (dollars per tonne) for each component can then be 
derived  by  applying  these  factors  against  a  unit  cost,  specifically  an  hourly  labour  rate  for  operating 
personnel (dollars per operating hour), an hourly operating cost for equipment (dollars per operating hour) 
and a unit cost for supplies (dollars per unit).
The equipment requirement factor is further broken down into requirements for maintenance personnel, 
equipment operating supplies and equipment repair supplies. Using the same logic, a unit operating cost 
(dollars per tonne) can then be derived for each of the equipment operating and maintenance components. 
The sum of the individual components results in the total direct mining unit cost for each mining area.
Table 18.19 summarizes the unit cost detail for each of the main mining areas, expressed in terms of the 
ore  milled. Table  18.20 also  summarizes  the  unit cost  detail  for  each  of the  main  mining  areas,  but  the 
unit cost is expressed in terms of the total material mined for each area.

Mine Operating and Mine Maintenance Personnel
The  workforce  for  mine  operating  and  mine  maintenance  personnel  is  summarized  in  Section  18.1.12, 
Mine Personnel.
The mine will operate 360 d/a, 24 h/d. All personnel are scheduled to work a two-week-in / two-week-out 
rotation. While on site, the work schedule will be seven days per week with two 12-hour shifts per day. 
Staff  will  generally  work  on  dayshift  and  hourly  employees  will  rotate  between  dayshift  or  nightshift 
assignment.
After  incorporating  an  allowance  for  absenteeism,  sickness,  training  and  vacation  and  an  allowance  for 
overtime, the available hours for work per employee is 1,946 hours per year. Less fixed delays estimated 
at  3  hours  per  shift,  the  worked  hours  per  employee  is  1,406  hours  per  year,  and  the  paid  hours  per 
employee is 2049 hours per year.
The  base  labour  rate  for  hourly  positions  ranges  from  $28  to  $34  per  hour.  With  an  allowance  for 
overtime at 3.4%, benefits at 40% and an incentive program at 10%, the loaded hourly rate ranges from 
$43 to $52 per hour. On an annual basis, this equates to $88,000 to $107,000.
Vacation pay is incorporated into the hourly rate.

Mine Consumables
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The unit cost of mine consumables is based on current budget pricing information from suppliers.
Consumables for drilling include drill bits, drill rods, shank adapters and couplings. The cost of operating 
the rock drill is included in the equipment operating costs.
Consumables for blasting include explosives and accessories such as boosters and initiating systems. The 
price of explosives and accessories is based on an explosives supply contract, which includes an on-site 
explosive  plant  to  manufacture  ANFO  (ammonium  nitrate  /  fuel  oil)  explosives.  The  supplied  price  of 
ANFO is $0.70/kg.
Consumables for services include pipe and fittings for the air, water and pumping lines; electrical cable 
for the electric/hydraulic jumbo drills and longhole drill; and ventilation ducting and accessories.
Consumables  for  ground  support  primarily  include  split  sets  and  wire  screen.  Visual  inspection  of  the 
core  during  the  site  visit  indicates  that  both  the  mineralized  rock  and  the  host  rock  are  competent; 
therefore,  it  is  expected  that  ground  conditions  will  be  fair  to  good.  Based  on  this  assessment,  it  is 
assumed that ground support will be required for 50% of the area of the back and wall shoulders. The use 
of screen will vary from 10% to 25%. It is assumed only minimal shotcreting will be required. Ground 
support costs could increase if it is found that resin rebar is required instead of split sets.
Equipment Operating and Repair
Operating supplies for equipment include lubrication and fluids, tires and ground engaging tools (GET). 
Lubrication and fluids are assumed to be 15% of the fuel cost. Current pricing for tires is applied against 
an assumed tire life for the equipment. The tire life varies by equipment and ranges from 1,500 hours to 
2,500 hours. GET is estimated from the consultant’s cost database and information supplied by equipment 
vendors.
Repair parts include the replacement of equipment parts over the life of the equipment, including rebuilds 
of major components. The hourly cost is estimated from the consultant’s cost database and information 
supplied by the vendor.
Fuel and Power
The assumptions used for fuel costs are $1.10/L. These unit costs only account for fuel associated with 
operating the mine mobile equipment fleet.
Labour
The unit costs in the labour area account for staff personnel and surface support personnel. Costs for mine 
operating personnel and mine maintenance personnel are included in the individual areas for shrinkage, 
longhole and general development.
The workforce for staff personnel is summarized in Section 18.1.12, Mine Personnel. The workforce for 
surface support personnel is also listed in Table 18.11.
The mine will operate 360 d/a, 24 h/d. All personnel are scheduled to work a two-week-in / two-week-out 
rotation. While on site, the work schedule will be seven days per week with two 12-hour shifts per day.

Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Staff  will  generally  work  on  dayshift  and  hourly  employees  will  rotate  between  dayshift  or  nightshift 
assignment.
The base rate for staff positions ranges from $75,000 to $125,000 per year. With an allowance for benefits 
at 40% and an incentive program at 10%, the loaded annual salary ranges from $113,000 to 188,000.
The  rates  for  the  surface  support  personnel  are  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  Section  18.3.1.1  in  Mine 
Operating & Mine Maintenance Personnel.
Power and Fuel
The  unit  cost  for  the  power  and  fuel  area  accounts  for  power  and  fuel  costs  for  equipment  that  is  not 
included in the direct mining costs for the shrinkage, longhole and general development areas.
This includes power costs for the following:
•  mine ancillary equipment, such as the diamond drill core rig
•  mine  stationary  equipment,  such  as  compressed  air  system,  pump  system  for  dirty  water,  pump
system for fresh water, primary ventilation fans and secondary ventilation fans
•  ANFO plant and lighting, shops, small equipment.
This includes fuel costs for the following:
•  mine  support  and  ancillary  equipment,  such  as  the  underground  grader,  utility  cassette  vehicle  and
underground personnel trucks
•
surface support equipment.
Site Preparation and Miscellaneous
The unit cost for the site preparation and miscellaneous area accounts for the following:
•  Site  preparation  of  surface  areas.  Most  of  the  site  preparation  is  completed  in  pre-production,  but 
there is some work scheduled during mining operations when the access road and area of the second 
primary ventilation shaft is required in Year 4.
•  Cost of excavating the second ventilation shaft with a raisebore contractor. The raisebore contractor
rate is estimated at $1,565/m, which includes mobilization/demobilization costs.
•  Operating equipment and supplies allowance for technical services to the mine (engineering/geology)
•  Operating  equipment  and  supplies  allowance  for  administration  services,  including  safety,  training,
first aid and other items.
•  Equipment operating cost for surface support equipment.

General Site Conditions
18.4.1
General Site Conditions
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  Monument  Bay  property  is  located  in  northeastern  Manitoba,  immediately  adjacent  to  the 
Manitoba/Ontario  Provincial  boundary.  It  is  approximately  570  km  northeast  of  Winnipeg  and  340 km 
southeast  of  Thompson  in  Manitoba.  The  nearest  community  that  is  serviced  by  scheduled  commercial 
flights is Red Sucker Lake, 60 km to the southwest as shown on Figure 1.1.
Access  to  the  property  is  by  means  of  chartered  aircraft  from  Red  Sucker  and/or  Gods  Lake  Narrows, 
Manitoba and Pickle Lake and/or Red Lake, Ontario. A winter road usually available in the mid-January 
to  end  of  March  period  extends  from  Gods  Lake  Narrows  to  Twin  Lakes,  a  distance  of  approximately 
60 km and offers an opportunity to transport bulk supplies into the region. The existing exploration camp 
is located at the center of the property, on the southwest shore of the southern of the Twin Lakes as shown 
on Figure 18.8.

Topography and Geomorphology
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The property is located in an area of low topographic relief, with a mean elevation of about 200 m above 
sea level. Lakes are very shallow and connected by meandering streams and bogs.
The  topography  of  the  property  area  is  characterized  by  myriad  lakes  and  swamps  as  part  of  an 
unorganized drainage system. The Seeber River drains the area and flows into Monument Bay. Northward 
drainage  continues  via  the  Stull  River,  the  Gods  River  and  the  Hayes  River,  which  flows  into  Hudson 
Bay.
A regional surficial geology map is shown on Figure 18.9 on the following page. Outcrop is rare in the 
project  site,  and  bedrock  is  covered  by  up  to  30  m  of  till.  Glacial  outwash  sand,  swamps,  and  areas  of 
muskeg  are  common.  Vegetation  is  typical  of  the  Northern  Boreal  Forest,  with  an  abundance  of  black 
spruce trees and low sedges, as well as shrubs and willows in swampy areas.
Figure 18.10 below shows an overview of the project site. The deposit ground is largely covered by the 
surface waterbody of the Twin Lakes and the Seeber River.

Climate
The  northern  latitude  of  the  property  results  in  winter  conditions  prevailing  from  October  to  May  with 
temperatures occasionally dipping to -30°C and 1 to 2 m of snow. Summer conditions are generally dry 
with temperatures reaching 30° over short periods. The climate is characterized by long winters and short 
summers with low levels of precipitation and evaporation, the combination of which results in a humid 
climate (G.A. Harron and Associated, May 2002).
18.4.4
Hydrometeorology
Precipitation at the Monument Bay site has been estimated by referring to the Atmospheric Environment 
Services  (AES)  stations  operated  by  Environment  Canada  located  in  the  general  vicinity  of  the  project 
site.  Table  18.21  summarizes  three  AES  stations  located  in  the  Monument  Bay  area;  these  stations  are 
shown on Figure 18.11.

NOTES:
METEOROLOGICAL DATA OBTAINED FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CANADA.
There  are  two  stations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  mine  site:  one  at  Gods  Lake  Narrows  (AES 
5061067) located 100 km northwest from the project area with a mean annual precipitation of 538.2 mm; 
and  another  at  Island  Lake  (AES  5061376)  situated  130  km  southwest  from  the  project  site  with  a 
precipitation value of 552.5 mm. Both stations are approximately at the same elevation as the Monument 
Bay  project  site  (189  m  and  237  m,  respectively),  and  have  complete  and  historical  records  of 
precipitation data which make them suitable as surrogates for selecting an annual site precipitation value 
of 550 mm for the Monument Bay site.
No specific data were sourced to estimate the average annual lake evaporation for the project area. The 
evaporation rate for the Monument Bay site is expected to be low given the cold climate conditions. An 
annual  site  lake  evaporation  value  of  220  mm  (approximately  40%  of  mean  annual  precipitation)  is 
assumed for the Monument Bay project site.
Stream  gauging  stations  operated  by  Water  Survey  of  Canada  (WSC)  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Monument 
Bay site are summarized in Table 18.22. Site-specific data are not available at this stage. The surface run-
off coefficient value is estimated to be 35% to 40% in the Island Lake area. When run-off coefficients for 
the project site are investigated more thoroughly at the next level of design, these stations can be used to 
guide the selection of appropriate run-off coefficients for the Monument Bay project.

Mining Rock Mechanics Assessment
18.5.1
General
Knight  Piésold  (December  2008)  conducted  an  extensive  review  of  the  currently  available  geological 
information  and  the  historical  exploration  drill  core  data  for  the  Monument  Bay  project.  Rock  mass 
characterization has been completed based on limited geomechanical data collected from the exploration 
programs.  Preliminary  geotechnical  recommendations  for  the  underground  mining  development  are 
presented in this section.
18.5.2
Regional Geology
Northeastern  Manitoba  is underlain  by  a portion  of  the  Archean-age  Northern Superior  Province that is 
tectonically  segmented  into  granitoid  crustal  blocks,  10  to  50  km  in  width,  that  are  bounded  by  east-
trending, dextral strike-slip greenschist facies shear zones.
A  regional  geology  map  is  illustrated  on  Figure  18.12.  It  shows  that  Twin  Lakes,  at  the  center  of  the 
property, is situated on the boundary of the Oxford-Stull Terrane with the North Caribou Terrane to the 
south.  This  boundary,  a  splay  of  the  Stull  Lake  -  Wunnummin  Fault  Zone  (SWFZ),  separates  younger 
crust (3.0 billion years (Ga)) to the south from older crust (>3.0 Ga) to the north and contains a belt of 
supracrustal metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks, dated at about 2.7 Ga, that host the Monument Bay 
mineralization (Wardrop, July 2006).

Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The supracrustal stratigraphy is subdivided into the Stull assemblage (Hayes River Group), comprised of 
mafic volcanics, that is overlain by coarse clastic sedimentary rocks of the Oxford Lake assemblage that 
is in turn overlain by arenaceous rocks of the Cross Lake assemblage.
The Monument Bay gold mineralization belongs to the class of Archean shear-hosted gold occurrences. 
Within the property, the SWFZ and the associated supracrustal sequence of volcanic and metasedimentary 
rocks  are  the  most  significant  hosts  of  gold  mineralization.  The  best-known  occurrences  of  gold 
mineralization are located in the vicinity of the southern Twin Lake.
18.5.3
Deposit Geology
A sub-surficial bedrock geology map for the Monument Bay deposit area is shown on Figure 18.13. The 
deposit  area  is  characterized  by  supracrustal  metavolcanic  and  metasedimentary  rocks  from  the  Hayes 
River, Oxford Lake and Cross Lake Groups. The Hayes River Group comprises mafic volcanics, gabbro, 
siltstone,  and  oxide  facies  iron  formation.  The  Oxford  Lake  Group  is  the  main  host  rock  for  the  Twin 
Lakes gold deposit, which is comprised of felsic tuffs and intermediate feldspar-phyric flows. The Cross 
Lake Group is made up on polymictic conglomerate, thick-bedded feldspathic wacke and mudstone, and 
magnetite iron formation (Rolling Rock, January 2008).

Gold-quartz veins occur within zones of intense and pervasive carbonate alteration along second order or 
later  faults  marginal  to  transcrustal  breaks;  commonly  associated  with  late  syncollisional,  structurally 
controlled  intermediate  to  felsic  magmatism.  Veins  commonly  have  sharp  contacts  with  host  rocks  and 
exhibit a variety of textures including massive, ribboned, or banded stockworks (Wardrop, July 2006).
18.5.4
Structural Geology
The  host  rocks  have  been  interpreted  to  be  striking  at  260°  to  280°  and  dipping  60°  to  90°  toward  the 
north (Wardrop, July 2006). The volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Oxford Lake sequence are cut by 
a feldspar porphyritic dyke with 10 to 30 m thick striking east-west and dipping approximately 70° to the 
north. This feldspar porphyritic dyke is cut by gold-bearing quartz veins.
Several folds have been mapped and inferred in the Oxford Lake Group tuff unit, but are not considered 
to be continuous throughout the deposit area, as several footwall units do not appear in some of the major 
inferred  folds.  The  presence  of  large-scale  faults  in  the  area  is  known,  but  the  orientations  and 
characteristics are unknown at this time. Smaller scale shear zones are present and are generally striking 
east-west.
18.5.5
Rock Mass Characterization
Rock  quality  designation  (RQD)  data  were  collected  during  the  previous  exploration  drilling  programs. 
Selected drillhole RQD data and core photos were used to estimate the rock mass quality using the rock 
mass rating (RMR) classification scheme for major rock types. The equivalent modified tunnelling index 
(Q’)  values  were  also  estimated  for  the  preliminary  geomechanical  study.  Unconfined  compressive 
strength  (UCS)  of  intact  rock  was  estimated  from  limited  geotechnical  logging  data  and  on-site  core 
inspection.
The  intact  rock  strength  and  rock  mass  quality  parameters  for  the  major  rock  types  encountered  in  the 
Monument  Bay  deposit  are  summarized  in  Table  18.23.  In  general,  the  intact  rock  strength  of  the 
mineralized zones and host rocks is strong with the exception of the medium strong Greywacke-Mudstone 
unit. The estimated UCS values for the strong rocks are typically in the range of 50 to 100 MPa, while the 
greywacke-mudstone unit is estimated to have a lower UCS value of approximately 25 to 50 MPa.
The  rock  mass  quality  for  the  gold  quartz  veins  (mineralized  zones),  greywacke-mudstone,  and  iron 
formation  is  estimated  to  be  FAIR  with  a  typical  RMR  value  of  50.  The  rock  mass  quality  of  the 
remaining host rocks is expected to be GOOD with a typical RMR of 65.
It  is  noted  that  these  preliminary  geotechnical  parameters  were  developed  from  limited  information  for 
the  scoping  level  study.  The  design  values  of  rock  mass  strength/quality  should  be  revisited  when 
additional geomechanical data becomes available at the next level of study.

Proposed Underground Mining Development
The  Monument  Bay  underground  mine  development  will  utilize  the  shrinkage  stoping  and  sublevel 
stoping  (longhole  stoping)  method.  The  stopes  will  be  mined  along  the  mineralized  veins  with  average 
true widths of 3.2 m and 2.9 m, for the shrinkage and longhole methods, respectively. An average stope 
dipping  angle  of  65°  was  assumed  for  the  underground  mine  assessment. The  preliminary  underground 
mining design parameters for both mining methods are summarized below (MMTS, November 2008).
•
•
stopes mined at angle of vein with a minimum mining width of 1.8 m
average mining width of 3.2 m (true width) for the shrinkage stopes and 2.9 for the longhole stopes
•  mining levels set at 50 m vertical spacing
•
•
•
•
stope block height is 45 m vertical (i.e., 5 m horizontal pillar left at top of stope block) and pillars are 
not recovered
stope block length is unlimited along level (i.e., no vertical intermediate pillars left in place)
a crown pillar of 30 m beneath bedrock has been left in place underneath all areas that have a water 
feature on surface; a crown pillar of 15 m beneath bedrock has been left in place in all other areas
the maximum opening of main ramps, drifts, haulage levels, and sub-levels are designed to be 4.5 m 
high x 4.7 m wide.
18.5.7
Implications for Underground Mining Design
The existing geomechanical database does not provide enough details on joint condition, weathering, joint 
orientation, and in-situ stress conditions. A preliminary rock mechanics assessment was performed based 
on  a  series  of  assumptions  using  empirical  methods  to  check  the  stope  stability,  pillar  strength,  and 
tunnelling support requirements for the proposed underground mining development.

Stope Stability
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Figure 18.14 displays an empirical stability diagram of open stopes based on the hydraulic radius of the 
hangingwall and the adjusted RMR of rock mass (Laubscher, 1990). A reduction factor of 0.6 was applied 
for the host rocks to downgrade the rock mass rating values for unknown joint orientations, weathering, 
induced stress, and blasting disturbance. The adjusted RMR for the mineralized zone and the weak host 
rocks (i.e., greywacke-mudstone) is approximately 30 and the stability index (or hydraulic radius) for the 
proposed open stope is around 1.5.
The figure shows that an unsupported open stope can be achieved for the proposed base case mining plan 
with an average mining width of 3.2 m. It also suggests that the maximum mining width (truth width) for 
the unsupported open stope is around 10 m given a maximum hydraulic radius of 4. However, it may be 
restrained by pillar strength.

18.5.7.2  Pillar Strength
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The strength of the pillars that will be left in each stope was assessed using the Hedley and Grant 1972 
power  equation  for  hard  rock  pillar  design  (Esterhuizen,  2006).  Pillar  strengths  were  calculated  for  the 
rocks with a different width-to-height ratio and an average rock mass strength value of 50 to 70 MPa in a 
stope  dipping  at  65°  degrees  for  depths  from  100  to  500  m.  It  was  assumed  that  the  stopes  would  be 
empty as no blasted ore is left in place. The far field stress ratio (σh:σv) was assumed at 1.
Table 18.24 presents a factor of safety (FOS) matrix for various pillar design. The FOS was calculated as 
a ratio of pillar strength over induced pillar stress. An FOS of 1.5 is typically required for underground 
mining. It shows that the FOS decreases significantly with decreases in the width-to-height ratio. For the 
base case mining plan, using a 5 m wide (thick) pillar with 3.2 m true mining width, the maximum safe 
mining depth is about 200 m. A wider (thicker) pillar up to 10 m will likely be required when mining at a 
depth of 500 m. A minimum width to height ratio of 1.5 is recommended for the pillar size determination.

18.5.7.3  Tunneling Support
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  supporting  requirements  for  the  proposed  underground  openings  were  evaluated  using  an  industry 
standard  empirical  method  developed  by  Barton  et  al  (1974).  The  method  uses  a  rock  mass  quality 
tunnelling  index  (Q)  and  excavation  span  to  provide  estimates  of  suitable  support.  The  modified 
tunnelling index (Q’) for major host rocks has been estimated to be in the range of 4 to 10, indicating the 
rock mass quality is FAIR to GOOD. A stress reduction factor (SRF) of 2.5 was applied to downgrade the 
Q value for unknown stress conditions.
The  tunnelling  support  assessment  chart  for  the  main  access  ramp  is  presented  on  Figure  18.15.  An 
excavation  support  ratio  (ESR)  of  1.6  was  adopted  for  permanent  mine  opening.  The  maximum 
span/height for the main access ramp is 4.7 m. It indicates that support is not required for the main access 
ramp given a FAIR to GOOD rock mass. However, spot bolting with mechanical anchor bolts or friction 
bolts at 1.5 m spacing is recommended for the potential weak zones along the access tunnels.

Future Studies
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
It  is  noted  that  this  preliminary  rock  mechanics  assessment  was  based  on  a  series  of  assumptions  with 
empirical data. Additional geomechanical data collection will be required to obtain further information on 
rock mass structure, rock mass quality, and far field stress conditions. Detailed geotechnical assessment 
should  be  conducted  to  determine  the  design  and  operation  parameters  for  underground  mine 
development.  Numerical  stress  modelling  is  recommended  when  the  refined  resource  model  and  the 
updated mining plan become available.

Tailings Storage Facility Design
18.6.1
General
Knight  Piésold  (December,  2008)  conducted  a  scoping  level  mine  development  study  to  provide  a  cost 
effective  layout  and  operating  strategy  for the  waste/water  management  for the Monument  Bay  project. 
Design  basis  was  determined  based  on  a  review  of  the  proposed  mining  plan,  limited  geotechnical, 
geochemical, and hydrometeorological data. A conceptual design for the TSF is presented in this section, 
along  with  the  considerations  of  water  management  and  closure  planning.  A  preliminary  quantity  and 
capital cost estimate for the proposed mine waste/water management plan is also provided.
The  overall  layout  of  the  proposed  mine  plan  is  illustrated  on  Figure  18.16  along  with  the  general 
arrangement of the preferred TSF option.

The  proposed  mine  will  operate  at  a  1,000  t/d  mill  throughput  and  the  underground  mine  will  yield 
3.76 Mt  of  ore,  with  a  mine  life  of  11  years.  The  ore  will  be  processed  using  conventional  flotation 
methods,  and  the  slurry  tailings  will  be  discharged  to  a  permanent  waste  storage  facility.  Geochemical 
characteristics of tailings and water are unknown at this stage at the design. For conservative purposes, it 
is assumed that all the tailings are potentially acid-generating (PAG) materials and must be submerged in 
perpetuity under 1 m of water. Limited metallurgical testing data cannot determine if the tailings have a 
high  cyanide  content  (G  &  T,  November  2003);  therefore,  geosynthetic  liner  confinement  is  not 
considered as the base case scenario for this mine development assessment.
The  underground  mining  will  produce  approximately  2.8 Mt  of  waste  rock  during  the  life  of  mine. 
Approximately 80% of waste rock will be stored underground and the remaining 20% will be transported 
to  surface  and  either  placed  in  a  waste  dump  or  beneficially  used  in  the  construction  of  the  tailings 
embankments. The external waste rock will be dumped near the mine portal as shown on Figure 18.16. It 
is  assumed  that  the  external  waste  rock  consists  of  non-acid-generating  (NAG)  materials  and  will  be 
suitable  for  constructing  the  embankments  of  the  TSF.  It  is  also  assumed  that  low  permeability  core

materials (e.g., glacial till) can be locally borrowed with sufficient quantity and suitable quality for use in 
the embankments based on the observations during the site visit.
The  TSF  is  designed  to  permanently  store  3.76 Mt  of  tailings  (2.9 Mm3  at  an  average  dry  density  of 
1.3 t/m3).  The TSF embankment  will be  constructed using  downstream  methods  at  a 2.5:1  (H:V)  slope. 
Each stage of TSF development is sized to store tailings based on an average milling rate of 1,000 t/d of 
ore, as well as supernatant water and capacity for stormwater storage and wave run-up protection. A 2 m 
freeboard is included to account for the storm storage and wave run-up protection for the TSF.
18.6.3
Site Selection
The  principal  objectives of  the  design  for the TSF  are  to ensure  protection  of the  regional  groundwater 
and  surface  waters  at  all  times  (including  post-closure),  and  to  achieve  effective  reclamation  at  mine 
closure. The selection of the tailings storage site has taken into account the following criteria:
•  proximity to the plant site
•
•
•
•
•
•
sufficient storage capacity for all solid waste materials
reasonable quantity of fill for the embankment construction
reasonable final embankment crest elevation
staged development of the facility over the life of the project
expansion potential
easy  for  TSF  seepage  control,  collection,  and  recycling  as  process  water  to  the  maximum  practical 
extent
•
small TSF catchment and less water diversion challenges
•  no significant fisheries issues
•  no apparent orebodies intersecting the facility.
The  project  site  is  situated  at  a  low  topographic  relief  area  with  numerous  shallow  lakes  connected  by 
meandering  streams.  Groundwater  level  is  expected  to  be  near the  surface. The  proposed  plant  site  and 
mine  portal  will  be located  at a  highland  southwest  of  the Twin  Lakes as shown  on  Figure  18.16. Two 
potential tailings storage sites were considered during the preliminary mine development study.
•  Twin  Lakes  –  The  south  leg  of  Twin  Lakes  is  a  natural  impoundment  area  with  sufficient  storage 
capacity for tailings discharge. It is on top of the underground deposit and very close to the proposed 
plant site (see Figure 18.16). The natural lake storage facility will only need minimum construction 
work prior to mine operations. However, this option has a major impact on the surface waterbody and 
flow  patterns.  Diversion  of  the  Seeber  River  and  water  quality  control  will  be  challenging.  In 
addition, there will be some fisheries issues associated with this option. As such, this big lake storage 
option is not recommended for the Monument Bay mine development.
•  Rabbit  Lake Basin – The  second  option is  to  discharge  tailings  to  a  shallow  basin  of  Rabbit  Lake 
that  is  located  south  of  the  proposed  plant  site,  upstream  of  Twin  Lakes.  Rabbit  Lake  is  a  much 
smaller lake  compared  to Twin  Lakes (see  Figure  18.16). This option can  minimize  the  impacts on 
the existing waterbody and watercourses. It is relatively simple for surface water diversion and water 
quality control. It will require construction of embankments to provide sufficient storage capacity for 
the tailings impoundment. The quantity of embankment fills is less significant and the dam height is

low compared to the Twin Lakes option. Therefore, the Rabbit Lake basin site has been selected for 
the Monument Bay mine development.
The  general  arrangement  of  the  preferred  TSF  option  is  shown  on  Figure  18.16  above,  along  with  the 
overall  layout  of  the  mining  plan.  A  depth-area-capacity  (DAC)  relationship  for  the  TSF  site  was 
developed  using  a  1 m  contour  map  (NASA,  2003),  even  though  it  does  not  quite  match  the  mapped 
waterbodies and courses shown on the 10 m contour map. Figure 18.17 illustrates the depth-area-capacity 
curves for the Rabbit Lake basin site. Filling curves for the TSF, which overlay the staged embankment 
construction through the 11-year mine life, are illustrated on Figure 18.18.

Layout and Operating Strategy
18.6.4.1  Embankments
The embankments will be developed in three stages throughout the life of the project using materials from 
mine waste rock and local borrow glacial till. The TSF will be constructed as water-retaining structures 
throughout the 11 years of operations.
The starter impoundment is designed to provide two years’ storage capacity for tailings and supernatant 
water.  The  dams  will  be  raised  utilizing  a  downstream  construction  method  with  a  transition  zone 
supported  by  the  downstream  shell  zone.  The  filter/transition  zone  will  prevent  the  migration  of  fines 
from the dam core zone and filter zone into the pervious downstream shell zone. The tailings, which have 
a relatively low permeability, provide confinement of the supernatant pond. A typical cross-section of the 
proposed  embankments  is  illustrated  on  Figure  18.19,  along  with  the  material  descriptions  and 
compaction requirements.

Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
No  site-specific  foundation  conditions  were  available  to  estimate  the  quantities  of  material  that  would 
need to be excavated prior to construction of the starter embankments. An average stripping depth of 1 m 
has been assumed within the embankment footprint. Given an ultimate dam crest elevation of 211 m, the 
maximum  height  of  the  main  (north)  embankment  will  be  6  m.  Dam  fill  requirements  for  each 
embankment  stage  have  been  estimated  for  preliminary  costing  purposes.  The  total  required  earth  fill 
volume has been estimated to be in the order of 300,000 m3.
18.6.4.2
Seepage Collection and Control
Seepage from the TSF will result from infiltration of ponded water directly through the embankment fill, 
the natural ground and from expulsion of pore water as the tailings mass consolidates. The seepage will 
largely  be  controlled  by  the  low  permeability  core  zone,  the  tailings  deposit,  and  the  low  permeability 
foundation materials.
The  TSF  will  be  constructed  with  toe  drains  to  collect  seepage  through  the  main  (north)  embankment. 
Seepage collected in the embankment drainage systems will be transferred to a seepage collection pond 
(SCP)  located  at  topographic  low  points  of  the  downstream  toe  of  the  north  embankment.  In  addition, 
seepage collection ditches constructed along the toe of the embankments will be used to collect seepage 
and surface run-off and direct the flow to the SCPs, from where it will be pumped back to the TSF.

Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
It is anticipated that the TSF will have a net surplus of water; the clean water diversions will minimize the 
amount  of  excess  water  that  must  be  managed.  Diversion  ditches  have  been  considered  along  the 
southeast  perimeter  of  the  TSF  to  minimize  the  volume  of  run-off  into  the  TSF  from  the  undisturbed 
portion of the catchment area.
18.6.4.3  Tailings Discharge System
Tailings  from  the  mill  process  will  be  delivered  via  a  pumping  scheme  from  the  mill  to  the  TSF. 
Figure 18.16  shows  the  general  alignments  for  the  tailings  line  for  the  TSF.  The  pipeworks  will  be 
constructed  to  efficiently  handle  the  design  1,000  t/d  and  temporary  increases  in  mill  throughput.  The 
discharge of tailings from the delivery pipelines into the TSF will be from several valved off-takes located 
along the embankment via a head tank located above the maximum elevation of the TSF.
The  coarse  fraction  of  the  tailings  are  expected  to  settle  rapidly  and  will  accumulate  closer  to  the 
discharge  points,  forming  a  gentle  beach  with  a  slope  of  about  1%.  Finer  tailings  particles  will  travel 
further  and  settle  at  a  flatter  slope  adjacent  to  and  beneath  the  supernatant  pond.  The  beaches  will  be 
developed with the intent to maximize storage volume and to control the location of the supernatant pond. 
Selective tailings deposition will be used to maintain the supernatant pond away from the embankments 
in the order of 100 m to reduce seepage and ensure that reclaimed water is clear and accessible for re-use 
in the milling process.
18.6.4.4  Reclaim Water System
Water will be reclaimed from the tailings pond by a barge-mounted pump station. The water will consist 
of supernatant from the settled tailings and run-off from precipitation and snowmelt within the catchment 
area. The floating reclaim pump station in the TSF will initially be confined in a deep narrow channel at a 
location remote from the point of tailings discharge. This will maximize the potential for the recovery of 
water of acceptable clarity. The barge will be relocated as required throughout the mine life.
Reclaimed water will be pumped from the reclaim barge to the plant site. The reclaim pipelines will be 
graded to minimize high or low sections and to allow for gravity drainage to the mill. A conceptual layout 
of the reclaim system for the TSF is shown on Figure 18.16.
18.6.5  Water Management
18.6.5.1  Objectives
The main objective of the water management plan is to control all water that originates from within the 
project  area  in  an  environmentally  responsible  manner.  This  includes  optimizing  the  use  of  available 
water  sources  to  supply  the  water  requirements  of  the  milling  process  and  related  mining  activities, 
thereby eliminating the demand for external make-up water.
The overall mine site water balance and water management plan are not included in this report, as detailed 
information of mill process and other mine facilities are not available. The water management activities 
for the TSF include:
•
•
•
collecting and recycling seepage from the TSF
controlling, collecting, and diverting surface water run-off from the TSF catchment area
eliminating uncontrolled release of water from the TSF area
Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd.
18-53
January 20, 2011
Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
•  optimizing the volume of water stored in the tailings supernatant pond to meet operations and closure
requirements.
18.6.5.2  Water Balance
A preliminary water balance assessment was completed to estimate the annual water surplus or deficit for 
the TSF. The TSF water balance is a model that describes the movement of water within the operational 
system  throughout  the  life  of  mine.  External  influences  on  this  model  include  precipitation  and 
evaporation. An annual mean precipitation value of 550 mm is used for this assessment, while the annual 
evaporation is assumed to be 220 mm under cold climatic conditions. The surface run-off coefficient has 
been estimated to be around 40% based on the review of limited streamflow data at the Island Lake area.
Two water balance scenarios were run for the preferred TSF option. Scenario 1 considered 100% of run-
off  from  the  undisturbed  catchment  flows  into  the  TSF,  while  Scenario  2  considered  diverting  all  the 
undisturbed catchment run-off out of the TSF. The preliminary water balance results indicate that there 
will be a net surplus under either scenario. The annual surplus water has been estimated to be in the order 
of 1.5 Mm3 and 0.5 Mm3 for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Therefore, diversion ditches are required to 
minimize  the  run-off  into  the  TSF  from  the  undisturbed  catchment  area.  Consideration  will  need  to  be 
given to release of water from the project area both during operations and at closure.
18.6.5.3  Water Management Plan
The  preliminary  water  management  plan  for  the  TSF  has  been  incorporated  into  the  general  layout  as 
shown on Figure 18.16. The main components of the TSF water management plan during the early stages 
of mine development include the following:
•
•
•
construction of initial embankment
construction of a diversion channel in the undisturbed TSF catchment
tailings / water pipelines between the TSF and plant site.
In addition, wastewater from the underground mine and NAG waste storage area should be controlled and 
properly  discharged.  These  components  of  the  overall  site  water  management  plan  have  not  been 
incorporated into the current conceptual layout.
18.6.6
Closure and Reclamation
The  primary  objective  of  the  closure  and  reclamation  initiatives  is  to  return  the  TSF  site  to  a  self-
sustaining facility with pre-mining usage and capability. The TSF will be required to maintain long-term 
stability,  protect  the  downstream  environment  and  manage  surface  water.  Activities that  will  be  carried 
out during operations and at closure to achieve these objectives are highlighted below:
•
selective  discharge  of  tailings  around  the  facility  during  the  final  years  of  operations  to  establish  a 
final tailings beach that will facilitate surface water management and reclamation
•  dismantling and removal of the tailings and reclaim delivery systems and all pipelines, structures and
equipment not required beyond mine closure
•
cap  the  tailings  surface  with  NAG  waste  rock  (or,  breach  the  diversion  ditches  to  flood  the  entire 
tailings pond)

•
•
removal of the seepage collection system at such time that suitable water quality for direct release is 
achieved
removal and regrading of all access roads, ponds, ditches and borrow areas not required beyond mine 
closure.
18.6.7
Cost Estimate
A  preliminary  initial  capital  and  sustaining  capital  cost  estimate  was  completed  for  the  preferred  TSF 
option as shown in Table 18.26. The costs were divided to match the staged construction of each option, 
with the costs being incurred the year when the stage is required. Hence, the table shows costs occurring 
for start-up (Year -1), as well as Years 3 and 8. Finally, capital costs were totalled and divided by the total 
tailings tonnage that will be stored to derive a cost per tonne value.
The initial capital cost for the TSF development is in the order of $3.5 million; the ultimate capital cost is 
expected to be around $5 million. The total unit cost for waste storage is about $1.35/t.

18.7.1
Summary
This  section  discusses  electrical  power,  control  and  communications  aspects,  and  includes  estimates  of 
both capital and operating electrical costs for the entire project including, but not limited to, access to the 
site, mining, ore handling and processing, ancillary buildings and services, camp and water pumping.
Options  for  providing  electrical  supply  to  the  site  include  a  grid  connection  via  an  overhead  line  from 
Manitoba Hydro’s transmission system or on-site diesel electric generation. At this stage, the evaluation 
of supply from Manitoba Hydro is preliminary; however, despite the large capital cost of constructing a 
power line, the cost of operating a grid connection is roughly 10% of the cost of on-site diesel generation, 
so the payback period would be very short (approximately18 months).
The  current  design  therefore  assumes  a  grid  connection  to  Manitoba  Hydro  based  on  the  significantly 
lower life-cycle cost of this option versus the option of on-site diesel electric power generation. On-site 
power generation also requires the availability of an all-weather access road to the site to avoid the high 
capital cost and cash flow impact of having to transport a full year’s supply of fuel to site via winter road.
Grid power will be supplied by either a 138 kV or 25 kV overhead power line to a main site substation, 
which will step the voltage down to 4.16 kV for distribution around the site. The 138 kV option has been 
selected, as it is unlikely that the much weaker 25 kV supply will be capable of starting the large drives 
and maintaining acceptable voltage stability. Manitoba Hydro has advised that about 60 km of power line 
will be required. The main incoming substation at the Monument Bay site will be owned by Rolling Rock 
and two  main transformers  will provide  power at  4.16  kV to  main secondary  switchgear,  which  in  turn 
will distribute electricity via 4.16 kV feeders to the various loads around the site.
At  each  remote  load  centre,  a  unit  substation  will  step  the  voltage  down  to  600  volts  to  supply  most 
process loads. The voltage will be further stepped down to 120/208 and 120/240 as required for smaller 
service loads.
Electrical  services  generally  will  be  to  current  North American  best available  technology  standards  and 
will  include  grounding,  lighting,  security,  small  power,  welding,  heating,  ventilation,  air  conditioning, 
process power, process control, instrumentation, fire protection, on-site and off-site communications, and 
entertainment systems.
Capital and operating costs for the electrical installation (including the mill motor, but excluding process 
motors that are included with mechanical equipment) are as follows:
Electrical capital cost:
Manitoba Hydro supply (138 kV) ................................................................... CAD$18,500,000
Main site substation ........................................................................................... CAD$1,500,000
Mine, process plant and miscellaneous ............................................................. CAD$4,500,000
Electrical  annual  operating  costs  (based  on  an  annual  consumption  of  27.11  GWh  and  a  unit  cost  of 
CAD$0.0366/kWh for Manitoba Hydro) are CAD$993,000. This excludes electrical labour costs, which 
are included elsewhere in this report.

18.7.2
Electrical Power Supply
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
Two options for supplying electrical power to the site have been evaluated: (1) a grid connection to the 
Manitoba transmission system; and (2) an on-site diesel electric power plant. Both options are presented 
for comparison; however, the grid connection has been selected for this evaluation and estimate due to its 
significantly lower life cycle cost.
18.7.2.1  Manitoba Hydro Supply
Preliminary information from Manitoba Hydro indicates that there are two possibilities for power supply 
to site, namely a 25 kV supply from Red Sucker Lake about 40 km away, or a 138 kV supply from God’s 
Lake  Narrows  about  60  km  away.  It  is  likely  that  the  25  kV  supply  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the 
Monument Bay load and large motor starting duty; however, further study must be carried out before this 
option can be eliminated.
For  the  purposes  of  this  report,  the  138  kV  option  has  been  selected  due  to  its  greater  stability  and 
reliability. Indicative capital costs are about $18.5 million for the 138 kV option and $10 million for the 
25  kV  option.  As  the  power  tariff  is  higher  for  the  25  kV  supply  than  the  138  kV  supply,  there  is  a 
payback on the additional capital cost of the 138 kV supply (about $300,000 per year). Construction time 
would be approximately 2 years for the 138 kV option following a full commitment to proceed. In either 
case,  a  main  site  substation  would  be  required,  costing  about  $1.5  million  for  the  138  kV  option  and 
$500,000 for the 25 kV option.
18.7.2.2  On-site Generation
An on-site diesel electric power plant would consist of several identical diesel gensets with a combined 
rating of about 8 MW. This will provide some spare capacity above the estimated peak load of 5 MW and 
will  allow  sufficient  spinning  reserve  capacity  to  handle  normal  transient  load  fluctuations  and  load 
variations between shifts.
On-site generation of power is problematic because a full year’s supply of diesel fuel would have to be 
delivered  while  the  winter  road  is  open.  Since  the  fuel  consumption  for  the  power  plant  alone  will  be 
about 7 ML/a, this will require approximately 125 trips by a B-train fuel truck and pup during the period 
of freeze-up. Also required will be the construction of an on-site fuel storage facility, where this fuel, as 
well as an allowance for the diesel vehicle fleet, can be stored.
18.7.3
Electrical Distribution
Power will be distributed from the main site substation or power plant at 4.16 kV, three-phase, 60 Hz and 
distributed  to  main  load  centers  via  cable  feeders  mounted  on  ladder  trays,  buried  underground,  or  via 
overhead lines as appropriate. Main load centers in the process plant will be in the mill area. In addition, 
4.16 kV overhead lines will run to fresh and reclaim water pumping systems, underground mining loads 
and surface facilities (truckshop, warehouse, assay, administration building, changehouse and camp).
The  main  4.16  kV  load  centers  will  each  consist  of  an  outdoor  transformer,  an  electrical  room  and  a 
control room. The mill will have dual transformers feeding into one electrical room. Transformers (4.16 – 
0.6  kV)  will  be  outdoor  oil-filled type  with  natural  air-cooling.  Also  located  in electrical  rooms  will  be 
4160 and 600 volt switchgear, 600 volt motor control centers and low voltage lighting and power panels, 
and AC and DC power supplies.
Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd.

Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The 4.16 kV load centers in the underground mine will be low-profile, skid-mounted and will consist of 
cast-epoxy  insulated  transformers  and  arc-proof  switchgear.  All  equipment  will  be  fire  rated,  fully 
insulated  and  enclosed,  and  will  contain  appropriate  ground  fault  protection  for  equipment,  cables  and 
cable connectors.
18.7.4
Underground Mining Facilities
In  the  underground  mine,  it  has  been  assumed  that  4.16  kV  cable  feeders  will  be  run  underground  to 
portable  skid-mounted  unit  substations  where  voltage  will  be  transformed  to  600  volts.  Further,  it  has 
been assumed that at least one vertical ventilation raise will be established with suction fans mounted at 
surface. Cables feeding the mine from surface may then be installed in this vent raise if cable routes can 
be shortened.
Unit  substations  will  be  robust,  shock-proof,  skid-mounted  assemblies  utilizing  cast-epoxy  insulated 
transformers and metal-enclosed and bus-insulated medium and low-voltage switchgear.
Cable feeders will utilize portable trailing cable of standard lengths that can be moved from site to site as 
the  mine  develops.  Waterproof  cable  connectors  will  be  used  and  all  systems  will  include  ground  fault 
monitoring and tripping where appropriate.
Portable,  high-efficiency,  non-sparking  sealed  type  fluorescent  or  compact  fluorescent  lighting  will  be 
required.
An allowance has been made for in-line ventilation fans to operate in series in longer drifts, and for some 
sump pumps for mine dewatering.
Evacuation  alarm  systems  will  be  installed  throughout  the  mine  and  will  activate  visual  and  audible 
warning devices.
Communications  systems  will  be  installed  and  include  sound  attenuated  calling  stations  at  regular 
intervals throughout the mine.
18.7.5
Process Drive Motors
Totally  enclosed,  fan-cooled  (TEFC)  process  drive  motors  with  high  efficiency  will  be  utilized.  These 
motors have been priced as part of the mechanical equipment and are not included in this portion of the 
cost estimate.
18.7.6
Grounding
The  underground  mine  and  surface  buildings  will  be  provided  with  an  overall  grounding  grid,  gradient 
control mats where required, and structure and equipment grounding systems. Overall, ground resistivity 
of power systems will be limited to 1 ohm to ensure acceptable touch-and-step potentials. If necessary, a 
remote grounding electrode will be used. All buildings and major outdoor structures will be connected to 
a buried grounding system with a maximum resistance to ground of 5 ohms. This may be achieved with 
grounding  rods  or  one  or  more  deep  holes  utilizing  copper  piping  or  similar  to  reach  locations  of  low 
ground resistivity.

POC  (products  of  combustion)  and  ROR  (rate  of  rise)  detector  heads  will  be  installed  in  transformer 
rooms, electrical rooms and control rooms. No sprinkling is permitted in these areas. Suppression systems 
will utilize either CO2 or Factory Mutual approved gas equivalent, manually operated. In the power plant 
(if  required),  a  fire-activated  water  misting  system  will  be  provided  together  with  sensitive  detection 
systems.
18.7.9
Security
Surveillance/security systems have not been included in this report. It is expected that all site security will 
be located at the guardhouse at each property main entry point.
18.7.10
Process Control / Instrumentation
The  main  elements  of  the  process  control  equipment  will  be  controlled  and  monitored  through  a  100% 
redundant PC-based HMI (human-machine interface) similar to Wonderware’s FactorySuite and will be 
centralized at a control room in the crushing building and an additional room in the mill building. Control 
will be PLC based and will not have manual override.
Conveyors will have standard control devices: emergency pull cord switches, belt misalignment switches, 
speed and plugged chute switches where applicable.
The  ball  mill  feed  conveyor  will  have  a  weightometer.  Process  water  tanks  will  have  continuous  level 
monitoring with ultrasonic level transmitters.
Thickeners  will  have  sludge  level  detectors.  Monitors  for  pH  will  be  installed,  and  automated  lime 
addition will be installed at various points in the process.
18.7.11
Plant Site Communications
An  allowance  has  been  made  for  communications  systems  in  the  underground  mine  and  in  surface 
buildings. These will be self-contained systems with multi-channel selective calling.
Allowance  has  been  made  for  satellite  or  microwave  communications  to  the  project  site.  It  has  been 
assumed that communication off site will only be possible via satellite or microwave service.

Environmental Overview
18.9.1
Introduction
This section provides an overview of the environmental assessment (EA) process and an environmental 
study plan for the Monument Bay project.
18.9.2
Environmental Assessment (EA) Process
An  integral  part  of  the  Monument  Bay  project  development  process  is  the  assessment  of  the  project’s 
environmental,  social,  and  economic  impacts  on  its  regional  zone  of  influence.  These  aspects  must  be 
thoroughly  accounted  for  in  the  Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  process,  a  process  that  is  guided  by 
federal  and  provincial  legislation.  The  EA  process  is  a  tool  for  determining  potential  project-related 
adverse impacts before they occur, allowing mitigation and monitoring programs to be incorporated into 
all stages of project design, development and closure.
In accordance with Manitoba’s Environment Act (Manitoba Regulation 164/88 – Classes of Development 
Regulation),  the  project  will  require  the  completion  of  an  EA  and  a  licence  prior  to  construction.  The 
project is a Class 2 Development (Section 3, Sub-section 4) under the 164/88 regulation.
The  project  will  require  a  Comprehensive  Study,  in  accordance  with  the  Canadian  Environmental 
Assessment Act (Comprehensive Study List Regulations, Part V), because it is “a gold mine, other than a 
placer  mine,  with  an  ore  production  capacity  of  600  t/d  or  more.”  Should  there  be  a  need  for  the 
deposition  of  tailings  into  fish-bearing  waters  resulting  in  harmful  alteration,  disruption  or  destruction 
(HADD) of fish habitat, this would trigger the need for an amendment to Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining 
Effluent Regulations, under the Federal Fisheries Act. A HADD authorization falls under the authority of 
both the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada.
The Province of Manitoba and the Government of Canada have agreed to a “harmonized” process for EAs 
that  require  both  federal  and  provincial  approval.  The  Canada-Manitoba  Agreement  on  Environmental 
Assessment Cooperation agreement was enacted to assist in the coordination of environmental assessment 
processes, to reduce duplication, and to assist in a timely and efficient approval process

18.9.3
Public and First Nations Consultation and Participation
Public consultation is a critical component of the EA process. Public consultation, when initiated at the 
earliest  possible  convenience,  is  a  very  strong  tool  for  developing  a  project  that  stakeholders  are  more 
likely to support.
The  Monument  Bay  project  is  located  in  the  northeastern  section  of  the  Island  Lake  Tribal  Council 
region, bordering on the Keewatin Tribal Council region to the north and west, and the Manitoba-Ontario 
border to the  east. There  are several  First  Nations  communities located  around the project area, both  in 
Manitoba and Ontario. Active communication with these First Nations communities and Tribal Councils 
should  be  a  priority  throughout  the  EA  process  to  ensure  the  interests  and  needs  of  the  people  are 
accounted for throughout all stages of project planning from the onset.
Enhancing  the  capacity  for  the  local  First  Nations  to  participate  meaningfully  in  the  Monument  Bay 
project  will  be  helpful  to  obtaining  support  for  the  project.  The  general  strategy  for  First  Nations 
involvement would be as follows:
•  provide employment and training programs that lead to self-reliance and respect
•  provide contractual opportunities
•
involve  individuals,  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  in  baseline  studies,  the  EA  process,  permitting, 
ongoing life-of-mine joint monitoring and other planning activities
•
incorporate traditional knowledge into project planning activities.
18.9.4
Environmental Setting and Effects Assessment
The  Monument  Bay  property  is  located  approximately  570  km  northeast  of  Winnipeg  in  northeastern 
Manitoba, immediately adjacent to the Manitoba–Ontario Provincial border. The Twin Lakes are located 
centrally within the property. This area of Manitoba is characterized by many rivers, lakes, swamps, and 
muskegs overlying glacial deposits and bedrock, and is covered by Boreal Spruce forests.
18.9.4.1  Land Use
Current land  uses for  the  general project area  are  not known,  although  exploration  activities  on  the  site 
date  back  to  1961  and  there  is  a  well-developed  exploration  camp  centrally  located  near  the  southern 
Twin Lake. The determination of land use within the project area will be assessed during the EA process.
18.9.4.2  Environmental Issues
The  air,  land  and  water  must  be  investigated  and  the  baseline  environmental  conditions  properly 
characterized  for  general  safeguarding  of  the  environment.  The  priority  environmental  issues  for  this 
project are water-related due to the immediate proximity of the property within the Twin Lakes system. 
The  priority  issues  of  concern  are  fisheries  and  fish  habitat  investigations,  surface  and  groundwater 
characterization, and acid rock drainage / metal leaching (ARD/ML) potential.
Baseline environmental data collection generally requires an extended period for collection, ranging from 
one  to  several  years,  to  properly  account  for  seasonal  effects  and  annual  variation.  The  baseline 
information is key to the development of engineering design concepts that provide for the prevention and 
mitigation features to safeguard the environment.

Preliminary Assessment – Monument Bay Gold Project
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
•  Meteorology, Air Quality and Noise – Regional climate data is collected by the Province of Manitoba 
Fire  Program,  with  the  two  closest  stations  at  Island  Lake  and  Gods  Narrows.  A  meteorological 
station  should  be  assembled  within  the  property  in  order  to  characterize  the  local  conditions  for 
temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, precipitation, and wind speed and direction. Relatively 
short-term (minimum of two years), site-specific data can generally be correlated to regional data for 
longer  term  predictions  as  inputs  to  engineering  design  needs.  The  remote  location  of  the  property 
limits the potential for noise and air quality impacts associated with anthropogenic sources. Noise and 
air  quality  impacts  due  to  future  developments  are  predicted  based  upon  information  from  existing 
similar  operations,  and  this  information  is  used  to  assess  potential  impacts  and  for  the  design  of 
appropriate mitigation measures.
•  Hydrology and Water Quality – The most effective means of collecting hydrological data is to install 
automated  pressure  transducers  in  rivers  and  streams  at  key  locations  throughout  the  property  area. 
Site and regional hydrological data are then correlated to obtain stream flow estimates for the project 
area  over  a  variety  of  return  periods.  Water  samples  are  collected  from  lakes  and  rivers  at  regular 
intervals  throughout  the  year  (generally  for  two  or  more  years)  in  order  to  characterize  the  water 
quality conditions.
•  Hydrogeology  and  Groundwater  Quality  –  Hydrogeological  studies  are  often  tied  in  with 
geotechnical drilling activities, and wherever possible, two-inch diameter piezometers are installed to 
isolated depths in the vertical geotechnical and exploration drill holes. These peizometers are used to 
monitor the static water level and to perform hydrogeological tests. Groundwater quality monitoring 
wells drilled in key locations within the project area are used to monitor water quality.
•  Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) / Metal Leaching (ML) – The initial assessment phase involves the review 
of  the  geology  and  drill plans to  gain an  understanding  of  the  deposit  geology.  This is followed  by 
static testing, which can include acid-base accounting, sulphur speciation, carbonate analysis, net acid 
generation  tests,  and  total  and  leachable  metal  tests,  among  others.  The  tests  are  conducted  on 
portions of the core samples, which are identified in the initial assessment phase. Kinetic tests, in the 
form of humidity cells, leach columns, and leach pads, are then conducted to predict the chemistry of 
the  tailings  and  waste  rock.  Predictions  regarding  water  quality  throughout  the  mine  life  are  made 
using the findings of these studies.
•  Fisheries and Aquatic Resources – The assessment of fish and other aquatic species and their physical 
and  biological  habitat  is  essential  where  there  are  potential,  or  real,  impacts  to  any  fish-bearing 
aquatic environment. The importance of fisheries studies if further emphasized should the location of 
potential tailings storage facilities trigger a HADD authorization. Fisheries, limnology, and sediment 
quality  data  would  be  collected  over  the  course  of  several  years  and  used  to  determine  potential 
impacts,  mitigation  measures,  and  appropriate  habitat  compensation  planning  if  habitat  loss  is 
unavoidable.
•  Flora and Fauna Studies and Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping – The purpose of this portion of the EA 
is to fully understand, document and map the flora and fauna within the project footprint, as well as 
the trace metal content of the important vegetation food sources. Particular attention is given to any 
species listed in Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA). Desktop studies must be completed prior to 
initiating field programs.
•  Surficial Geology, Soils, and Terrain Stability – These investigations occur in conjunction with site 
engineering investigations and consist of test pit and geotechnical drilling activities. Seismic activity 
is very low in northeastern Manitoba.
•  Archaeology,  Traditional  and  Cultural  Land  Use  –  Literature  reviews,  consultation  with  local  First 
Nations  and  other  sources,  such  as  museums,  are  important  resources  in  the  development  of  an
Beacon Hill Consultants (1988) Ltd.

Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
understanding of archaeology, and traditional and cultural land use in the project area. Any evidence 
of artifact, heritage or cultural significance will be further investigated in field investigations.
•  Socioeconomic Assessment – As assessment of the baseline socioeconomic conditions in the region of 
the project will be done initially. This information will be used as a basis for assessing the impacts 
that the development could have on a local and regional socioeconomic level, with particular attention 
given the impacts on local First Nations.
18.9.5
Environmental Assessment Report
The  environmental  assessment  report  will  be  compiled  over  the  course  of  the  study  period  and  will  be 
submitted  to  the  federal  and  provincial  authorities  in  support  of  the  application  for  the  Monument  Bay 
project approval and licensing. The details of the report will be prepared to meet the requirements of the 
Manitoba Environment Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
18.9.6
Capital Cost
The capital costs for the surface facilities have been estimated based on 2008 prices as described in the 
various  sections  contained  within  this  report.  The  costs  for  various  sections  include  contingencies  as 
shown within those sections; in addition, an overall 10% contingency has been added.
A summary of initial capital expenditures and ongoing capital costs is provided in Table 18.27.

Financial Analysis
Rolling Rock Resources Corporation
The  financial  analysis  base  case  has  been  prepared  using  standard  discounted  cash  flow  methods  to 
determine  the  NPV  and  IRR  of  the  project  based  upon  100%  equity  financing  and  metal  prices  of 
US$750/oz  Au.  The  analysis  was  performed  in  constant  2008  dollars,  excluding  inflation.  Various 
sensitivities analyses were completed to determine the effect of metal prices, capital costs, operating costs 
and exchange rates. The results are discussed in Section 1.13.
The  economic  evaluation  of  a  1,000 t/d  underground  operation  at  the  Monument  Bay  deposit  estimates 
that,  based  on  an  initial  capital  expenditure  of  US$140.1  million  and  the  metal  prices  stated  above,  the 
project will generate an after-tax IRR of 8.14% and an  NPV of $45 million undiscounted (and negative 
$8 million discounted at 8%). The resources established in this study are 3.76 Mt grading 6.33 g/t of gold.

SECTION 19.0 – INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
The economic evaluation of a 1000 t/d underground operation at the Monument Bay deposit indicates that 
based  on  an  initial  capital  expenditure  of  US$140.1  million  and  gold  metal  prices  of  US$750/oz,  the 
project will generate an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.14% and a net present value (NPV) of 
$45 million undiscounted (negative $8 million discounted at 8%).
The current mineral resource estimate does not support a viable operation. The sensitivities completed on 
the  base  case  show  that  an  increase  in  resource  and/or  mining  grade  is  required  for  the  project  to  be 
considered economically viable in the industry.
If  the  mineral  resource  is  increased  by  40%,  there  is  a  likelihood  that  a  viable  operation  could  be 
achieved.  It  would  appear  from  an  evaluation  of  the  geological  model  that  there  is  the  possibility  for 
additional resources to be defined that could satisfy this requirement.
A  40%  increase  in  mining  grade  also  indicates  project  viability,  but  a  review  of  the  geological  model 
shows that a large increase in mining grade will likely indicate a decrease in mineral resource.
Decreases  in  capital  and  operating  costs  would  also  improve  the  economic  viability  of  the  project; 
decreasing 
in  a  15%  IRR.
the  capital  and  operating  costs  both  by  10%  would  result

SECTION 20.0– RECOMMENDATIONS
To  improve  the  viability  of  the  project,  it  is  recommended  that  Rolling  Rock  undertake  an  exploration 
program to determine the existence of additional mineral resources at the same or higher grade that those 
estimated within this report. The following describes the proposed exploration program.
In  2009,  it  is  proposed  that  11,275  meters  will  be  drilled.  The  principal  objectives  of  the  drill  program 
will be to:
•
infill gaps in previous resource drilling programs and enlarge the assay database
•  better define and test higher grade trends for expansion within the veins
•  demonstrate grade continuity in order to support a better resource classification
•  provide material for specific gravity measurements
•  provide the basis for additional tonnage that would be at or greater than the grade estimated in Section
16.
The  program  is  designed  principally  to  increase  the  assay  sample  density  and  to  provide  the  basis  for 
additional  tonnage  to  support  a  larger  throughput  operation.  This  program  is  expected  to  result  in  a 
material change to the limits and the geometry of the resource model. In addition, the program is expected 
to better define higher grade trends within the deposit and provide more confidence in, and thus increase, 
the classification levels for much of the overall mineral resource.
This proposed program is fully described in Section 1.14.
