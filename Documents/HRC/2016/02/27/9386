<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism comprises two parts. Section I refers 
to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities undertaken from 1 January to 31 October 2007. Sections III 
to V reflect the main thematic issue of economic, social and cultural rights in the context of 
countering terrorism. Section III refers to the normative framework and contains information on 
the work done to date by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, special procedures and 
other United Nations entities, such as the International Court of Justice and the Counter-
Terrorism Committee of the Security Council. Regional organizations, such as the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Council of Europe, and judgements from 
the European Court on Human Rights, have also addressed the relationship between economic, 
social and cultural rights and counter-terrorism measures. 
</p>
<p> In Section IV, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own country-specific work and other sources 
illustrate the negative impact that counter-terrorism measures can have on the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights. The Special Rapporteur examines a number of thematic and 
country-specific examples, such as how physical obstacles constructed for security reasons can 
affect access to health, education, work and so on; how charitable, humanitarian and financial 
organizations have been hindered from promoting economic, social and cultural rights by the 
justification of countering the financing of terrorism; how the right to education can be 
compromised or overlooked in the interest of national security; and how counter-terrorism 
measures can stigmatize and target indigenous and minority communities, resulting in the 
destruction of their means of livelihood, forced evictions and internal displacement. 
</p>
<p> In Section V, the focus shifts to the role of the promotion of economic, social and cultural 
rights in addressing and countering the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. Such 
considerations need to be included in the formulation of long-term sustainable strategies against 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are presented in section VI, 
which includes recommendations resulting from the country-specific work by the Special 
Rapporteur, recommendations for States and the international community, and specific 
recommendations addressed to various human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80, General Assembly 
resolutions 60/158 and 60/251 and Human Rights Council decision 2006/102. It includes a 
reference to his activities from 1 January to 31 October 2007 and his views on the thematic issue 
of economic, social and cultural rights in the context of countering terrorism. The Special 
Rapporteur discusses the negative impact counter-terrorism measures can have on these specific 
rights and the role of promoting economic, social and cultural rights in preventing terrorism. 
</p>
<p>2. Addenda to the present report have been issued on communications in 2007 by the 
Special Rapporteur and the replies of Governments thereto and press releases issued under the 
mandate (A/HRC/4/26/Add.1); the report on the fact-finding mission to South Africa from 16 to 
26 April 2007 (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2); the report on the fact-finding mission to the United States 
of America from 16 to 25 May 2007 (A/HRC/4/26/Add.3) and the report on the fact-finding 
mission to Israel, including visits to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, from 3 to 10 July 2007 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.4). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>3. On the question of upcoming country visits, the Special Rapporteur hopes to conduct a 
mission to the Philippines and to Spain in the first half of 2008. There are outstanding visit 
requests to Algeria, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan and Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>4. A summary of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities between 1 January and 31 July 2007 can 
be found in paragraphs 4 to 25 of his report to the General Assembly (A/62/263). 
</p>
<p>5. On 9 and 10 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur was represented at a workshop in 
Geneva, organized by the International Commission of Jurists and the Geneva Centre for the 
Democratic Control of Armed Forces, on intelligence, accountability, counter-terrorism and 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. On 9 October, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion on the role of 
parliaments in striking a balance between national security, human security and individual 
freedoms and in averting the threat to democracy at a session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 
Geneva. 
</p>
<p>7. On 11 and 12 October, the Special Rapporteur convened an expert group meeting at the 
Institute for International Relations in Clingendael, Netherlands, to discuss thematic issues 
relevant to his mandate. He also met with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
had meetings with the Netherlands intelligence community. 
</p>
<p>8. On 19 October, he attended a meeting of the Interights International Advisory Council in 
London and participated in a panel session on security, the rule of law, counter-terrorism and 
human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. On 29 October, the Special Rapporteur presented his report (A/62/263) to the Third 
Committee of the General Assembly in New York. He also held meetings with delegates of the 
Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the 
Chairperson of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and non-governmental 
organizations. On 31 October, he visited Washington, D.C., and met with officials of the State 
Department of the United States of America and of non-governmental organizations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT 
OF COUNTERING TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. Combating terrorism has become a priority for the entire international community, 
particularly since the atrocious terrorist acts of 11 September 2001. A wide range of measures 
have been adopted on the national and international levels, including within the framework of 
the United Nations. Increasingly, decisions by the United Nations principal organs, such as the 
General Assembly and the Security Council, include an explicit affirmation that, when 
implementing the measures in question, States Members must respect international law, 
including human rights law. Such general references to human rights comprise also economic, 
social and cultural rights, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a 
number of international and regional treaties. 
</p>
<p>11. In line with the principle of complementarity, expressed in paragraph 14 (e) of 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80 that established the mandate, the Special 
Rapporteur seeks to address and highlight how economic, social and cultural rights have been 
neglected or underdeveloped in the otherwise commendable efforts that various human rights 
bodies and mechanisms have made towards the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
fight against terrorism.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Previous work 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Commission on Human Rights adopted several resolutions on the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. The human rights special 
procedures, assumed by the Human Rights Council, and treaty bodies continue to address the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism within their 
respective mandates and resources. Several human rights treaty bodies have continued to address 
the protection of human rights while countering terrorism. Significantly, special rapporteurs and 
treaty bodies that focus on civil and political rights have addressed counter-terrorism measures 
on an almost regular basis. Meanwhile, treaty bodies and special rapporteurs who have a 
mandate related to economic, social and cultural rights have addressed the protection of human 
rights while countering terrorism only when they came across specific cases, such as through a 
country visit. 
</p>
<p>13. Independent experts, such as the special procedures mandate-holders, have expressed their 
views on the relationship between human rights and the fight against terrorism on several 
occasions. In their joint announcement on Human Rights Day in 2001, the experts reminded </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>States of their obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, also in the 
aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September. They expressed their concern that the fight 
against terrorism must not result in violations of the enjoyment of any human rights - civil, 
cultural, economic, political or social - as guaranteed under international law. 
</p>
<p>14. Within the treaty-based system, the treaty bodies which monitor the implementation of 
international human rights treaties focus on different human rights. For the purposes of the 
present report, the evolving practice under the International Covenant on Social, Economic and 
Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child emerge as the most useful sources because they focus on 
economic, social and cultural rights. The other treaty bodies, such as the Human Rights 
Committee or the Committee against Torture, generally focus on civil and political rights and 
therefore their practice is not addressed in the present report. The Special Rapporteur is, 
however, aware of the commendable contribution the Human Rights Council and the Committee 
against Torture have made on a regular basis in promoting State compliance with human rights 
while countering terrorism. On occasion, their concerns have also related to economic, social and 
cultural rights.<b>1</b> </p>
<p>15. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination released a statement on racial 
discrimination and measures to combat terrorism, adopted at its sixtieth session in March 2002,<b>2</b> 
in which the Committee called upon States and international organizations to ensure that 
measures taken in the struggle against terrorism did not discriminate in purpose or effect on 
grounds of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p>16. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, while considering reports pursuant to the 
Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflicts, has so far made no 
reference to the fight against terrorism or the recruitment of children by terrorist groups. The 
Committee has encouraged States parties to include the Optional Protocol in school curricula and 
welcomes information on measures of recovery and social reintegration for refugee children or 
child soldiers. Furthermore, the Committee has encouraged States parties to strengthen the 
protection for asylum-seeking, refugee and migrant children who may have been recruited in to, 
or experienced, hostilities in their country of origin. 
</p>
<p>17. In her 2002 report (E/CN.4/2002/60, paras. 64-69), the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education drew the attention of States to the fact that many resources that could have been used 
for education were spent on security, which was in her view a negative approach and would not 
sustain peaceful communities in the long term. </p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. In 2006, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance expressed concern that Islam and Muslim religious 
observance continued in various parts of the world to be erroneously identified with terrorism 
(E/CN.4/2006/17, paras. 2 and 23). </p>
<p>19. In his 2006 report (E/CN.4/2006/78, para. 44), the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people expressed his concern at the fact 
that, in some countries, the State had sometimes confronted social struggles, claims and protest 
of the indigenous organizations with the implementation of terrorist law. He urged that those 
laws should not be used to criminalize social protest and the struggles of indigenous peoples. </p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living reported of cases of evictions and demolition as a form of punishment of 
residents who allegedly supported terrorist groups (E/CN.4/2004/48, para. 37). </p>
<p>21. In her report on her mission to the Russian Federation (E/CN.4/2006/61/Add. 2, 
paras. 70-80) the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
addressed the economic, social and cultural rights of Chechnyan women in the context of 
military operations described by the Government as counter-terrorism measures. </p>
<p><b>2.  Other entities in the United Nations system </b></p>
<p>22. In its advisory opinion of July 2004, the International Court of Justice concluded that Israel 
was in breach of its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights due to the construction of a wall along and partly inside the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, described by Israel as a counter-terrorism measure.<b>3</b> The Court found the International 
Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights applicable in relation to the conduct of Israel 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and identified a number of economic, social and cultural 
rights enshrined in the Covenant and affected by the construction of the wall, namely, the right to 
work (arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young 
persons (art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing 
and housing, and the right &#8220;to be free from hunger&#8221; (art. 11); the right to health (art. 12); and the 
right to education (arts. 13 and 14).<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>23. The Court concluded that the restrictions on the enjoyment by the Palestinians living in the 
territory occupied by Israel of their economic, social and cultural rights, resulting from the 
construction of the wall by Israel failed to meet a condition laid down by article 4 of the 
Covenant, that their implementation must be &#8220;solely for the purpose of promoting the general 
welfare in a democratic society&#8221;. According to the Court, the wall, along the route chosen, and 
its associated regime were a grave infringement of a number of rights of the Palestinians residing 
in the territory occupied by Israel, and the infringements resulting from that route could not be

 <p> 
</p>
<p>justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security or public order. The 
construction of such a wall therefore constituted breaches by Israel of several of its obligations 
under the applicable international humanitarian law and human rights instruments, including the 
Covenant and the Committee on the Rights of the Child.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The Counter-Terrorism Committee receives regular reports from States Members on 
their action under Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), but it has no 
special focus on the consideration of human rights violations resulting from counter-terrorism 
measures, or on economic, social and cultural rights in its work. The United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, her Office and the Special Rapporteur on human rights 
and counter-terrorism have all sought and maintained a dialogue with the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee and its Executive Directorate. This dialogue takes place, inter alia, within the 
inter-agency Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force operating to implement the Global 
Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly in September 2006 by its 
resolution 60/288.<b>6</b> They continue to recommend that the Committee systematically consider the 
impact of counter-terrorism measures on human rights. This aspiration reflects the view of the 
High Commissioner that, in the long term, a commitment to uphold respect for human rights and 
the rule of law will be one of the keys to success in countering terrorism.<b>7</b> </p>
<p><b>3.  Regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights adopted in 2002 a comprehensive 
special report on terrorism and human rights, in which it discusses, inter alia, issues relating to 
the right to property<b>8</b> and the human rights of migrant workers, asylum-seekers, refugees and 
other non-nationals in the context of countering terrorism.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>26. The Council of Europe has been active in emphasizing the imperative of complying with 
human rights while countering terrorism.<b>10</b> Many conventions and other instruments have been

 <p> 
</p>
<p>adopted.<b>11</b> The Council&#8217;s initiatives on counter-terrorism measures are built on three pillars: strengthening legal action against terrorism; safeguarding fundamental values; and addressing 
the causes of terrorism. These priorities are based on the fundamental principle that it is both 
possible and necessary to combat terrorism while respecting human rights, fundamental 
freedoms and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted guidelines on human rights 
and the fight against terrorism in 2002, supplemented in 2005 by guidelines on the protection of 
victims of terrorist acts. These guidelines focus on civil and political rights and set out clearly the 
strict limitations on the power of States to derogate from international human rights instruments. 
In these guidelines, reference to economic rights is made in section XIV on the right to property: 
&#8220;The use of the property of persons or organisations suspected of terrorist activities may be 
suspended or limited, notably by such measures as freezing orders or seizures, by the relevant 
authorities. The owners of the property have the possibility to challenge the lawfulness of such 
decisions before a court.&#8221;<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The European Court of Human Rights has released several judgements which refer to 
counter-terrorism measures and their negative impact on human rights, including those related to 
economic and social rights. The cases considered mainly deal with the burning of villages and 
internal displacement of persons in South-Eastern Turkey in the context of the measures by the 
security forces against the Workers&#8217; Party of Kurdistan (PKK), designated by the authorities as a 
terrorist organization. In the case of <i>Akdivar and Others v. Turkey</i>,<b>13</b> the Court considered the 
burning of nine houses in the village of Kelekci and the eviction of all its inhabitants on 
10 November 1992 during a search for PKK terrorists. The Court held that &#8220;there can be no 
doubt that the deliberate burning of the applicants&#8217; homes and their contents constitutes at the 
same time a serious interference with the right to respect for their family lives and homes and 
with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions&#8221;.<b>14</b> The Court concluded that there had been a 
violation of both article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (private and family life 
and home) and article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (peaceful enjoyment of possessions). 
29. Another illustrative case is <i>Dogan and Others v. Turkey</i>.<b>15</b> The applicants lived in 
Boyda&#351; village, Hozat district. The majority of the village population was of Kurdish origin. In 
October 1994, the applicants were forcibly evicted from their village and security forces 
destroyed their houses. As a result of the eviction, the applicants were forced to live in very poor 
conditions. The Court held that there had been a violation of article 1 of Protocol 1. The Court

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dealt with the situation under the first sentence of the first paragraph of article 1, &#8220;since the 
impugned measures undoubtedly restricted the applicants&#8217; rights to use and dispose of their 
possessions&#8221;.<b>16</b> The Court acknowledged the extraordinary measures taken by the Government in 
order to maintain the security of the state of emergency region, but observed &#8220;that, in the 
circumstances of the case, the refusal of access to Boyda&#351; had serious and harmful effects that 
have hindered the applicants&#8217; right to enjoyment of their possessions for almost 10 years, during 
which time they have been living in other areas of the country in conditions of extreme poverty, 
with inadequate heating, sanitation and infrastructure&#8221;. The Court held that the action taken by 
the Government was not proportionate to the aim pursued and for the same reasons held that 
there had been a violation of article 8, which enshrines the right to respect for family life and 
home.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>30. Since these events, Turkey has developed a compensation scheme to address grievances 
and to provide a domestic remedy.<b>18</b> The judgements by the Court are nevertheless referred to 
here to illustrate how the right to housing and the consequences of internal displacement can be 
addressed through a treaty pertaining to civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>31. Within the Council of Europe framework, the European Social Charter (revised) is the 
main instrument with special focus on economic and social rights. The monitoring body of the 
treaty, the European Committee on Social Rights, has on occasion reflected on counter-terrorism 
measures and legislation in its consideration of State party reports. For example, when 
considering a report by Turkey, the Committee held in 2002 that depriving press professionals of 
their jobs or preventing them from exercising their profession by sentencing them to prison on 
the grounds that they expressed a political opinion, in circumstances that did not constitute a 
clear and imminent danger to security or to the public interest, may also constitute violation of 
their right to earn a living in an occupation freely entered upon, which was contrary to article 1, 
paragraph 2, of the Charter.<b>19</b> However, in a subsequent reporting round in 2006, the Committee 
noted that the law had been amended and no longer provided for the imprisonment of press 
officials and as such did not lead to a finding of non-conformity.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The advisory committee of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National 
Minorities considered counter-terrorism measures and their impact on human rights with 
reference to article 6 on the duty to encourage a spirit of tolerance and intercultural dialogue,

<p>in particular in the fields of education, culture and the media.<b>21</b> Another monitoring body within 
the framework of the Council of Europe that has contributed to the efforts to address the human 
rights implications of countering terrorism is the European Commission against Racism and 
Intolerance, which considered the impact of counter-terrorism measures in country reports and 
released general policy recommendation 8 on combating racism while fighting terrorism 
(17 March 2004) and general policy recommendation 11 on combating racism and racial 
discrimination in policing (29 June 2007). Both policy recommendations have a feature related 
to economic, social and cultural rights as they address issues such as discrimination in the fields 
of education, employment and housing, racial or ethnic profiling, and linguistic rights. </p>
<p><b>IV. IMPACT OF COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES ON THE ENJOYMENT 
OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>33. The above examples of the attention paid by United Nations and regional human rights 
actors to issues pertaining to the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights 
illustrate various ways and situations where counter-terrorism measures may have a negative 
impact on the enjoyment of some of the human rights in question. A number of economic, social 
and cultural rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and other core human rights treaties with a special focus on economic, social and cultural 
rights have been found at risk because of counter-terrorism measures, namely the right to work 
(arts. 6 and 7); protection and assistance accorded to the family and to children and young 
persons (art. 10); the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food and 
housing (art. 11); the right to health (art. 12); and the right to education (arts. 13 and 14). Many 
examples demonstrate how some measures have a concurrent impact on several human rights, 
and thus the interdependent nature of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>34. This section provides additional information on that negative impact, primarily with 
reference to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own country-specific work but also on the basis of publicly 
available information from other sources. With regard to the latter category of cases in particular, 
the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that his intention is to provide illustrative examples of real or 
perceived negative impact, not to indicate whether the cases mentioned amount to a violation of 
human rights treaty obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Construction by Israel of a barrier in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p>35. The most illustrative case encountered to date by the Special Rapporteur was during his 
mission to Israel in July 2007 (A/HCR/6/17/Add.4), which included visits to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. During that mission, he made observations at various locations and 
consulted a number of governmental and non-governmental actors in Israel and the Occupied

</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory on the construction of the barrier, partly a wall and partly a fenced zone 
with multiple physical obstacles. The barrier is being built by Israel along and partly inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, referring to security concerns including combating terrorism. He 
assessed both the effectiveness of the barrier as a security measure and its impact on all human 
rights, including the economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people. 
</p>
<p>36. Notwithstanding a demonstrated statistical correlation between the construction of the 
barrier and the reduction in the number of successful terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, the 
barrier is having an enormously negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights by the 
Palestinian people. A considerable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including towns 
and villages, is being separated from the rest of the Territory by the barrier. The winding route of 
the barrier is creating multiple obstacles for movement between even close-by communities 
inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory and is establishing a &#8220;seam zone&#8221; of land between the 
Green Line and the route of the barrier, representing approximately 10 per cent of the 
West Bank. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory has reported a dramatic and continuing deterioration in the socio-economic conditions 
of many parts of the West Bank since the construction of the barrier (A/HCR/6/17/Add.4, 
para. 31). 
</p>
<p>37. As a result of closures and the system of permits regulating the movement of people from 
one area to another, the Palestinian people are adversely affected in their ability to gain access to 
education; health services, including emergency medical treatment; other social services; and 
places of employment. Access by ordinary Palestinians to their land and water resources, 
including through the devastation or separation from villages of agricultural land in the course of 
erecting the barrier, is also being impeded, in some cases to the point of having a devastating 
socio-economic impact on communities. 
</p>
<p>38. Delays at checkpoints have complicated childbirth for Palestinian women. This has 
resulted in the delivery of children at checkpoints and unattended roadside births, putting at risk 
the health of both child and mother, and leading to numerous miscarriages and the death of at 
least five mothers. These hardships are reported to have contributed to an 8.2 per cent increase in 
home deliveries.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>39. As a result of the barrier, Palestinian children encounter significant obstacles in attending 
or remaining at educational institutions. It also affects the movement of teaching staff, whether 
this be as a result of the barrier having been erected between &#8220;closed&#8221; communities and 
educational facilities, or the difficulties in obtaining special permits from the Israel Defense 
Forces to enter areas in which educational facilities are present. Various restrictions of

</p>
<p>movement associated with the barrier, including checkpoints and their limited daily operation 
hours, can effectively result in Palestinian children dropping out of school or enjoying only 
limited access to education.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>40. The barrier and its practical operation have caused diverse negative effects on the 
economic situation of the Palestinian population. Thousands of people no longer have direct 
access to their area of cultivation, such as olive trees, or are allowed to take machinery with 
them, such as tractors, or temporary workers to assist them. Under these circumstances, their 
earnings are so low and their very livelihood is at risk (A/HCR/6/17/Add.4, para. 39). 
</p>
<p>41. In sum, the construction of the barrier has broad and complex effects on the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory. The Special Rapporteur acknowledged in his mission report that many of the human 
rights affected by the barrier and associated security measures are under human rights law 
subject to permissible limitations. However, as arbitrariness or unprofessional conduct are 
frequent in the implementation of the security measures, and as the route of the barrier continues 
to breach international law as affirmed by the International Court of Justice (see paragraph 25 
above), the Special Rapporteur has concluded that the barrier and its associated regime continues 
also to cause effects that violate the international obligations of Israel under human rights law. 
With regard to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own mandate, it is even more relevant that the barrier 
and its associated measures are widely experienced by the Palestinians as unlawful, destructive 
to normal human life, and humiliating. As a consequence, the barrier has a counterproductive 
effect by contributing to conditions that are conducive to the recruitment to and spread of 
terrorism (A/HCR/6/17/Add.4, para. 43). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Impact of measures against the financing of terrorism  
</b></p>
<p>42. In May 2007, the Special Rapporteur conducted a visit to the United States of America 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.3). With regard to information received during the mission, he wishes to 
engage in the current thematic report in a somewhat broader discussion on the impact of 
counter-terrorism measures on charity work. Since September 2001, several United States 
charities have been shut down because of laws against the financing of terrorism. The negative 
impact has been felt mostly by Muslim charities, which are led by Muslims and/or are working 
for Muslim communities in the United States and abroad. Since 2001, over 40 charity groups 
have been investigated and their assets frozen, often without any evidence being available and 
without being prosecuted. Many Muslims were afraid to give their money to charity groups in 
case they were suspected of providing material support to terrorism. Some Muslim organizations 
have therefore requested from the authorities a &#8220;safe&#8221; list of charities to which it would be 
acceptable to donate. The United States authorities, however, have not drawn up such a list, 
apparently out of fear that any list of &#8220;safe&#8221; charities could potentially be abused for the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>financing of terrorism. This has a continuing chilling effect on charity work, as potential donors 
and charity administrators fear that their actions will be classified as material support to 
terrorism, even retroactively.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Charities are often involved in activities and projects that enhance the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Hence, obstacles on charity work may often have a direct 
negative impact on the enjoyment of these and other human rights. 
44. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the independent 
Charity Commission has opened 20 inquiries into charity organizations, most of them related to 
Islam in some way, allegedly having links with terrorism. The Commission states that the abuse 
of charities by terrorists is rare. One of the Commission&#8217;s tasks is to promote compliance with 
charity regulations in order to make charities less vulnerable to abuse by terrorist organizations.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act (bill C-36) prohibits the delivery of humanitarian 
assistance to zones of conflict where terrorist organizations are suspected of profiting from the 
assistance. One such zone is Northern Sri Lanka, where the needs of the poor, the marginalized 
and the displaced are the greatest. In this specific case, Canadian aid workers who have contacts 
with individuals and local organizations related to the Tamil Tigers run the risk of openly 
contravening the Act, accused of association with a terrorist organization. The Tamil Tigers, who 
control much of the affected area, are listed as a terrorist entity. Canadian donors who contribute 
to, for example, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, run a similar risk because that 
organization has helped victims in areas where the population is mainly Tamil, and the Tigers 
control much of the territory.<b>26</b> The work of many national and international charity employees is 
also made difficult by the Sri Lankan Public Security Ordinance which was adopted in 
December 2006.<b>27</b> The law prohibits all activities that might support terrorism, which in practice 
has made the aid work in Tamil areas risky.

</p>
<p>46. The application of government measures to curtail charity work because of a perceived risk 
that the funds might end up in support of terrorism is not always based on evidence. Such 
counter-terrorism measures are unlikely to be effective because they do not rely on the reality of 
charity work. They can also undermine general confidence in charities and encourage less 
transparent ways to transfer funds, thereby producing counterproductive effects. 
Counter-terrorism legislation has created uncertainty about the provision of humanitarian aid in 
some parts of the world, for example in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, even though these humanitarian activities are needed for the development of these 
places.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>47. In countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, military action, armed insurgency and terrorist acts 
have led to a security situation whereby the delivery of even the most basic humanitarian 
assistance is hampered. The protection of rights, such as access to health care or to basic 
education, is severely endangered by the weakness of State institutions and the worsening social 
and economic situation, which cannot develop without effective delivery of humanitarian aid.  
</p>
<p>48. Another example of measures taken to prevent the financing of terrorism resulting in a 
negative impact on economic, social and cultural rights is the case of Al Barakaat, which was the 
main organization for money transfers into Somalia and also the country&#8217;s largest private sector 
company, with financial involvement in other sectors.<b>28</b> The company, which had become 
essential for the delivery of remittances sent from family members living abroad, was run by 
many brokers who lived in different parts of the United States and in other countries where 
people of the Somali diaspora had settled.<b>29</b> Al Barakaat was closed down by the United States 
Government, even though it did not release any evidence that the money being sent to Somalia 
through the financial transfer system supported Al-Qaida. The Somalis who were, together with 
Al Barakaat, put on the terrorist list of the United States Treasury department were dropped from 
the list a year later. In 2002, the United Nations Development Programme stated that the closure 
of Al Barakaat had had a destabilizing effect on the economy of Somalia and a great 
humanitarian impact on the population of Somalia, who were unable to receive money from their 
relatives.<b>30</b>

</p>
<p>49. Many Al Barakaat brokers, working in many different countries, ended up listed on the 
terrorist list of the 1267 Committee or on different national lists. For instance, Luxembourg 
listed Al Barakaat, but a national court nevertheless released its assets because it could not get 
further information from United States intelligence and therefore had no evidence that the money 
was used to support terrorism.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The case of <i>Ahmed Ali Yusuf and Al Barakaat International Foundation v. Council of the 
European Union and Commission of the European Communities</i> was dismissed by the 
judgement of the European Union Court of First Instance of 21 September 2005 insofar as the 
affected individuals challenged Council regulation (EC) No. 881/2002 that regulates the 
restriction of certain measures directed against persons and entities associated with 
Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaida and the Taliban. According to the Court of First Instance, the 
regulation did not violate fundamental rights of the applicants of a jus cogens nature, as it 
primarily had an impact on the right to property and the right to a fair trial. Because the 
regulation was required by resolutions of the Security Council, pursuant to Article 103 of 
the Charter of the United Nations, it takes precedence over other human rights norms other than 
those of a jus cogens character. The judgement has been widely criticized for its formalistic 
approach to the relationship between human rights and Charter obligations, ignoring the 
Charter&#8217;s own references to human rights and the obligation of Member States (and the 
European Union Council composed of representatives of Member States) of ensuring compliance 
with human rights when implementing Security Council resolutions on countering terrorism. The 
judgement is being reviewed by the European Court of Justice (case C-415/05 P). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Right to education and its broader context  
</b></p>
<p>51. In the case of Turkey, where the Special Rapporteur conducted a mission in 
February 2006, the &#8220;Kurdish question&#8221; is at the centre of the Government&#8217;s counter-terrorism 
strategies. In the east and south-east of Turkey, the rate of violence is much higher than in other 
parts of the country. This appears to correlate with the complicated socio-economic situation in 
those regions, which in turn is related to shortfalls in the economic, social and cultural rights 
enjoyed by the people living there. On the basis of his mission to Turkey, the Special Rapporteur 
concluded that, in the long run, full respect for economic, social and cultural rights helped to 
eliminate the risk of individuals making the morally inexcusable decision to resort to acts of 
terrorism, and recommended that persons belonging to different cultural and linguistic groups, 
including the Kurdish population, should enjoy protection of their cultural, linguistic and 
religious rights, including the possibility to freely use their language in public and private. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the right to education is a key right for the 
integration and non-discrimination of all groups of people living in a country. In the case of 
Turkey, he was troubled by the pronounced differences in school attendance between boys and 
girls, in particular in the east and south-east. Even though the Government has launched 
campaigns aiming at improving attendance, especially of girls, in primary education, significant

 <p> 
</p>
<p>differences in the level of school enrolment for boys and for girls still exist. The Ministry of 
Education stated that school attendance is low in many urban settlements as well, such as 
Istanbul, and not only in the south-eastern regions. However, it appears that this problem is, at 
least in part, attributable to the high level of internal displacement of persons, primarily of 
Kurdish ethnicity, from the east and south-east.<b>32</b> Special programmes are in place to encourage 
school enrolment, particularly in the east and south-east, and a special scheme for the promotion 
of attendance of girls has been launched (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 62 and 63). 
</p>
<p>53. Another issue concerning the right to education is the closing or restricting the operation of 
or access to religious schools, or preventing their establishment under the justification of fighting 
terrorism. The issue has received attention in many countries, including Pakistan.<b>33</b> While the 
Special Rapporteur certainly agrees on the imperative of States taking decisive action against 
training for terrorism, he wishes to remind Governments that both the International Convention 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political 
Rights protect the right of families to secure an education for their children, in conformity with 
their religious or other convictions.  
</p>
<p>54. In China, criminal charges are often laid against members of the Uighur minority in 
connection with the &#8220;evil forces&#8221; of &#8220;separatism, terrorism and religious extremism&#8221;. In the 
aftermath of 11 September 2001, this has reportedly occurred in the Xinjiang-Uighur 
Autonomous Region, which is calling for independence.<b>34</b> The Khotan Communist Party 
Committee reportedly stated, in 2002, that they had found several illegal religious extremist 
activities which severely influenced and disturbed society mainly through education. Because of 
this situation, the schools and teaching bodies were reorganized by the Communist Party 
Committee, therefore affecting the enjoyment of the right to education. 
55. In India, the Naxalite conflict between the Maoist Communist party, the Government&#8217;s 
security forces and the Salwa Judum (a movement against the Naxalites) is mainly localized in 
the poorer, rural areas. In 2006, over 700 people were killed, most of them civilians. Because of 
the conflict, many people from the rural areas who formerly made their livelihood on small-scale 
farming and forestry have been displaced. Their means of livelihood has been destroyed by the 
displacement. Also, children&#8217;s right to education has been restricted through the Salwa Judum

<p>campaign, because boys and girls were recruited as &#8220;special police officers&#8221; in the camps of the 
internally displaced. Another reported negative impact on the right to education results from the 
alleged takeover of 250 schools by the security forces for their own use.<b>35</b>  
</p>
<p>56. One issue of concern related to refugee protection is the tendency of many countries to 
return asylum-seekers or repatriate refugees hastily for reasons of the country&#8217;s own national 
security interests but often with insufficient attention to the level of enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights for the returnees in their countries of origin.<b>36</b> Only in vary rare 
situations do States recognize such consequences as &#8220;persecution&#8221; or &#8220;inhuman or degrading 
treatment&#8221;, blocking as a matter of law the return of refugees on the basis of the rule of 
non-refoulement. The Special Rapporteur is specifically concerned about the effect that the 
return to conflict zones or post-conflict situations may have upon particularly vulnerable returnee 
households, including families with a female caretaker, unaccompanied children and youth who 
have no family networks in their country of origin. He draws States&#8217; attention to the possibility 
that children and youth who are unable to have access to education and whose social and 
economic rights are not respected may, in such situations, be vulnerable to recruitment by 
criminals, armed groups and even organizations carrying out terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>57. An issue that the Special Rapporteur has not yet encountered during his country visits but 
that has arisen in the context of his correspondence with Governments and that he hopes to 
address during forthcoming country visits is the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the 
economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples or other minority communities with 
distinct forms of livelihood and culture. He notes with concern that, in various parts of the world, 
Governments have invoked their counter-terrorism laws in response to claims and social 
movements emanating from the indigenous peoples of those countries. Such measures may 
wrongly stigmatize as terrorism the activities of indigenous communities in respect of conflicts 
over land rights and natural resources. Insensitive governmental responses based on a 
counter-terrorism framework may in such situations easily violate the human rights of 
indigenous peoples, including their economic, social and cultural rights. In some cases, such 
impermissible action by Governments may be driven by the persistence of the Government in 
practices that exploit the respective lands and resources without the consent of, or consultation 
with, the indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (General Assembly 
resolution 61/295) and expresses the hope that the international standards provided by this new 
instrument will guide Governments in the elimination of any misuse of the notion of terrorism in 
relation to claims by indigenous peoples. Referring to his earlier reports, the Special Rapporteur

</p>
<p>emphasizes that terrorism should be defined by the use of inexcusable methods of violence 
against bystanders and the intention to create fear among the general population rather than by 
political or other aims, which often overlap with the aims of social movements that have nothing 
to do with terrorist acts.  
</p>
<p>59. In Chile, a number of Mapuche community leaders have been prosecuted pursuant to a 
broadly defined definition of terrorism found in the current legislation, and some have been 
convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences for alleged &#8220;terrorist&#8221; acts committed in the 
framework of a social conflict over land rights (see A/HRC/6/17/Add.1).   
</p>
<p>60. In 2002, organizations of indigenous people in the Philippines which defended their 
traditional lands and land rights or resisted the encroachment by foreign commercial operators on 
their territories were often criminalized as subversive, and their members prosecuted as 
&#8220;terrorists&#8221; (E/CN.4/2003/90/Add.3, para. 49). The Special Rapporteur expects to address this 
issue on a forthcoming mission to the country.  
</p>
<p>61. According to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people, the adoption of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in India, in 
2002, led to the detention of many indigenous individuals, such as members of the Adivasis and 
Jharkhand tribal communities. By March 2003, when the Madras High Court upheld the 
supremacy of the Juvenile Justice Act over anti-terrorism laws, several indigenous children had 
been arrested as terrorists (E/CN.4/2004/80, para. 45). The Prevention of Terrorism Act has since 
been revoked, but many of its key provisions have been retained in ordinary legislation.<b>37</b> 
Members of the Adivasis community experienced forced evictions and their lives are threatened 
by dam and mining development projects, expansion of modern forms of agriculture and new 
settlements. Their land rights are neither recognized nor fully protected in the different regions. 
The forced eviction and demolition of their houses seems to be often linked to counter-terrorism 
measures. Reportedly, in 2003, Muslims in India were often stigmatized as &#8220;terrorists&#8221; when 
armed gangs systematically destroyed Muslim homes, businesses and places of worship. Such 
attacks were allegedly carried out with the participation and support of public authorities. 
Obviously, the resulting evictions would have a serious adverse impact on the right to adequate 
housing, which is guaranteed under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. <b>38</b>

<p>of the violence between Colombian military forces, paramilitary groups and guerrillas, often 
framed with reference to terrorism. In the impoverished urban slums, displaced persons have no 
way of earning a living, face ongoing violence, lack basic necessities such as food, water and 
sanitation, and are deprived of health services and education.<b>39</b>  
</p>
<p>63. In various parts of the world, evictions tend to affect persons who find themselves in a 
vulnerable situation, such as women, ethnic, religious and other minorities and indigenous 
peoples. In times of counter-terrorism, evictions and house demolitions are sometimes used as 
forms of targeted or even collective punishment for residents who are suspected of supporting 
terrorist groups. Heavily armed forces may carry out the evictions, destroying and demolishing 
houses and belongings. While some destruction of property may, in particular in the context of 
an armed conflict, be legitimate, collective punishments or the excessive use of force amount by 
definition to human rights violations, including that of the right to adequate housing. These 
actions may also deepen poverty and institutionalize impunity for those responsible for such 
violations. The discrimination behind these acts can escalate into violation of the most 
fundamental of human rights during times of forced eviction. The next step for people is to flee 
to other areas in the country, leading to displacement.<b>40</b>  
</p>
<p><b>V. ROLE OF THE PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND  
CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PREVENTING TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p>64. One pillar of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted by the 
General Assembly in September 2006 by its resolution 60/288, pertains to measures addressing 
the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. As such conditions - and underlining that 
none of these conditions can excuse or justify acts of terrorism - Member States referred to, 
inter alia, prolonged unresolved conflicts; violations of human rights; ethnic, national and 
religious discrimination; political exclusion; socio-economic marginalization; and lack of good 
governance. Many of these factors have a direct link with the extent to which economic, social 
and cultural rights are enjoyed. The promotion and effective realization of those rights can 
therefore be seen as a strategic choice to pursue policies aimed at preventing terrorism. While 
there is no scientific evidence of a causal connection between economic and social grievances 
and acts of terrorism, patterns of correlation can be demonstrated that suggest that societies 
characterized by such grievances and educational exclusion are often breeding or recruitment 
grounds for terrorists. <b>41</b>

<p>  For a rich but complex discussion on various approaches to the issue of causes or conditions 
related to terrorism, see the presentation by Alex P. Schmid, &#8220;Why terrorism? Root causes, some 
empirical findings, and the Case of 9/11&#8221;, Council of Europe document, available from 
www.coe.int/gmt.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. In the context of the Strategy, Member States agreed to undertake, inter alia, the following 
measures to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Timely and full realization of the development goals and objectives agreed at the major 
United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Development 
Goals; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Eradication of poverty and promotion of sustained economic growth, sustainable 
development and global prosperity for all; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The pursuance and reinforcement of development and social inclusion agendas at every 
level as goals in themselves, recognizing that success in that area, especially on youth 
unemployment, could reduce marginalization and the subsequent sense of victimization 
that propels extremism and the recruitment of terrorists; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Encouragement of the United Nations system as a whole to scale up cooperation and 
assistance in the fields of rule of law, human rights and good governance to support 
sustained economic and social development. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these and other concrete measures and once again 
underlines their close relationship with the protection and promotion of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>67. States and international organizations have an important role in promoting the realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights through their development programmes, and thereby 
contributing to addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. In its 
development cooperation, for instance, Germany has included a specific component of 
addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.<b>42</b> In 2002, the Government of 
Germany implemented, as part of its anti-terror package, 34 regional and 5 supra-regional special 
measures for crisis prevention and peacebuilding as a contribution to structural terrorism 
prevention worldwide. The Gesellschaft f&#252;r Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH was the 
executive agency, contracted by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development.<b>43</b> As a strategic framework, the package will need to address both the symptoms 
and the causes of terrorism, and will involve various policy areas. At the operational level, 
development cooperation is mandated to implement primarily structural terrorism prevention 
measures, which include civilian conflict transformation measures, as well as specific 
development cooperation measures designed to help eliminate the structural causes of and 
frameworks conducive to terrorism. Traditional development cooperation programmes are often 
highly capable of integrating crisis prevention and peacebuilding into their existing work by 
incorporating new approaches.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. The main focus of the anti-terror package was the implementation of structural measures to 
prevent terrorism. One of the strategies chosen was the promotion of economic and social rights 
for special groups, for example, youth without job prospects, who, excluded from participation in 
social and economic development processes, are susceptible to recruitment by criminal or violent 
groups. Such special groups should be integrated more intensively into development cooperation 
programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur concludes that counter-terrorism measures have both a direct and 
an indirect impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. The measures 
adopted by States to combat terrorism often pose serious challenges to economic, social and 
cultural rights. States therefore need to be mindful of their duty to ensure the conditions allowing 
all people living within their jurisdiction to enjoy all human rights, including economic, social 
and cultural rights. This is particularly important as the promotion of those rights should be seen 
as a means of addressing conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and hence of preventing 
acts of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>70. The social and economic marginalization of and discrimination against vulnerable groups, 
such as minorities, indigenous peoples or underprivileged households of women and children 
often amount to violations of their human rights, in particular of their economic, social and 
cultural rights. These circumstances may also provide fertile soil for recruitment to movements 
that promise a prospect for change but resort to the unacceptable means of acts of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>71. Through their negative impact on the effective enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, insensitive counter-terrorism measures, even when they may have a justification as 
permissible limitations to human rights, often result in counterproductive effects that undermine 
the long-term beneficial role of the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights in 
sustainable strategies to prevent terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>With reference to his country-specific work, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following recommendations:</b> 
</p>
<p> (<b>a) Without attempting to be exhaustive, the Special Rapporteur wishes to illustrate 
possible strategies and concrete steps in the field of the promotion and protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights while countering terrorism, by way of 
recommendations based on the experience of countries with which he has engaged in close 
cooperation;  
</b></p>
<p> (<b>b) Referring to his &#8220;desktop study&#8221; on Australia (A/HRC/4/26/Add.3), the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that, when Australia and other donor countries assist 
other States to adopt and develop their counter-terrorism laws and mechanisms, due 
attention be paid to securing the compliance of those measures with human rights and to </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>ensuring that technical or other assistance in the counter-terrorism field is not provided at 
the expense of development assistance, including programmes aimed at promoting 
economic, social and cultural rights. The Special Rapporteur recommends that 
development cooperation be furthered, keeping in mind the strategic importance of the 
promotion of economic, social and cultural rights in preventing terrorism and the need to 
avoid undermining that potential by shifting resources from such programming to 
short-term capacity-building and technical assistance in the field of counter-terrorism; 
</b></p>
<p> (<b>c) In his report on his mission to Israel, which included visits to the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4), the Special Rapporteur addressed the adverse 
human rights consequences of the security barrier/wall constructed by Israel along and 
inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and its negative impact on, inter alia, the rights 
to work, health, housing and education. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Israel make an immediate decision to withdraw all Israeli settlements from 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory and replace the still unfinished barrier, which extends 
deep into Palestinian territory, with a security infrastructure that, by its geographical 
position, respects the Green Line or is otherwise accepted by the Palestinians. While that 
decision is being implemented, the Special Rapporteur recommends that urgent action be 
taken to ensure that the permits regime, the administration of checkpoints and all other 
associated measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory do not have a disproportionate 
impact on the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights; 
</b> <b>(d) With reference to his missions to South Africa (A/HRC/6/17/Add.2) and the 
United States of America (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3), and to his earlier thematic report related to 
freedom of assembly and association, including in the context of listing terrorist entities 
(A/61/267, paras. 30-38), the Special Rapporteur recommends that these and other 
countries engage in a dialogue with relevant communities engaged in charity work in order 
to secure the availability of accessible and effective channels for charity that can be 
resorted to without the fear of donations being later stigmatized by the United Nations or 
the authorities of any country as financing or material support to terrorism. The 
Special Rapporteur is mindful of the fact that charity is seen as a religious duty by many 
Muslims, Christians and others; donors must therefore be able to choose a charity that is 
compatible with their convictions. Furthermore, charity work often plays an important 
role in enhancing the actual enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in poor 
countries; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) On the basis of his country visit to Turkey (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2), the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that attention continue to be paid to providing for victims 
of terrorism and of counter-terrorism operations not only compensation, but also measures 
that address rehabilitative and other needs of the victims, including by ensuring a safe 
environment to allow persons who wish to return to their home villages to do so. 
Emphasizing that full respect for economic, social and cultural rights helps to eliminate the 
risk that individuals make the morally inexcusable decision to resort to acts of terrorism, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends that steps be taken to secure for everyone, including 
the Kurdish population, effective access to education, which should be enhanced through, 
at least, initial immersion in their mother tongue; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <b>(f) With reference to his reports on his missions to Israel (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4) and 
Turkey, the Special Rapporteur urges Governments to ensure that any demolition of 
housing or other destruction of private property conducted as a measure aimed at 
combating or preventing terrorism is resorted to in strict compliance with international 
standards of international law and is accompanied by adequate reparation. Given that the 
high emotional impact of such measures could easily lead to counterproductive effects in 
the fight against terrorism, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments 
exercise extreme caution when resorting to such measures. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>With reference to States and the international community in general, the Special 
Rapporteur makes the following recommendations:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) The Special Rapporteur encourages all States and intergovernmental 
organizations, while countering terrorism, to take into account relevant instruments for the 
protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, in order both to avoid 
violations and minimize the negative impact on those rights in the fight against terrorism, 
and to utilize fully the potential of promoting economic, social and cultural rights as an 
inherent feature of long-term sustainable strategies to prevent terrorism. In particular, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the 
Security Council address these issues in order to provide guidance to Member States; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) The Special Rapporteur recommends that more attention be paid to the right to 
education as a key right in the enjoyment of several other human rights and as a 
cornerstone in sustainable long-term strategies for the prevention of terrorism;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) The Special Rapporteur recommends that attention be paid systematically to 
the rights of women and gender issues in the context of combating terrorism, including by  
securing the effective enjoyment by women of economic, social and cultural rights as 
another cornerstone in sustainable long-term strategies for the prevention of terrorism; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) The Special Rapporteur urges States not to apply their counter-terrorism laws 
and measures to social movements or protest by indigenous peoples or minority 
communities who claim recognition and full protection for their economic, social and 
cultural rights, including the right to enjoy their own distinctive culture, which is often 
associated with lands and specific forms of livelihood. He recommends strict adherence to 
the principle that terrorism should be defined through its inexcusable methods of violence 
against bystanders and its intention to create fear among the general population rather 
than through political or other aims, which often overlap with the aims of social 
movements that have nothing to do with terrorist acts;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Reiterating the final recommendation of his latest report to the 
General Assembly (A/62/263), the Special Rapporteur recommends that States and 
intergovernmental organizations commit themselves to a greater sharing of responsibility 
in protracted refugee situations, which today are often intertwined with military 
insurgency, armed conflict and, at times, terrorist acts against civilians, and that such joint 
efforts be based on a transparent, profound and responsible analysis of conditions allowing 
for the return of refugees as well as of the existence and risk of conditions that may be </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>conducive to the recruitment of terrorists and the spread of terrorism, and greater 
international coordination and cooperation to resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. Due 
attention to economic, social and cultural rights is crucial in this context; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) The Special Rapporteur recommends that all States include adequate 
guarantees to ensure compliance with human rights, including the requirement of legality 
and the availability of judicial review in their national procedures for the listing of 
individuals and entities as terrorist, affecting the right to property, in the implementation 
of Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) or otherwise.  
</b>74. <b>With specific reference to the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms, the 
Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) The Special Rapporteur recommends that all relevant special procedures and 
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council and human rights treaty bodies consider the 
protection and promotion of human rights within their mandates, with a special focus on 
economic, social and cultural rights, in the context of measures to combat terrorism, and 
coordinate their efforts as appropriate, in order to promote a consistent approach to this 
subject. He recommends that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights continue to update its digest of jurisprudence on the protection of human 
rights while countering terrorism and include in that compilation a new section on treaty 
body and special procedures practice with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and other treaty bodies that have economic, social and cultural rights 
within their mandates develop a systematic practice of addressing counter-terrorism 
measures by States while monitoring the implementation of respective treaties. In 
particular, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights adopt a general comment on economic, social and cultural rights and 
combating terrorism.
