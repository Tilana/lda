Directors’ Report
On 8 February 2016, the Company issued a Prospectus to issue up to 33,908,108 New Shares at an issue price of $0.024 
to raise up to $813,795 before costs.  The Offer was closed on 15 February 2016 having received applications and funds 
in the amount of $813,795.  
The  application  of  funds  raised  will  include  costs  associated  with  evaluating  new  acquisitions  or  investment 
opportunities (including due diligence costs) and working capital. 
On 13 May 2016 the Company announced that it had entered into a binding Heads of Agreement to acquire 100% of 
the issued capital of Israeli Company Ultracharge Ltd (formerly Voltape Ltd).  Ultracharge is the parent of Singapore-
registered Company Quick Charge Pte. Ltd, who is in partnership with Nanyang Technical University is developing faster, 
safer and more sustainable battery technologies. 
Overview of UltraCharge 
Ultracharge Ltd is an Israeli company founded in 2015.  It holds patent licenses with Nanyang Technological University 
(NTU) in Singapore to develop and commercialize a new and innovative lithium- ion battery (LIB) technology that seeks 
to revolutionise the rechargeable battery markets. LIBs are commonly used in devices such as smart phones, tablets, 
digital cameras, laptops, medical devices and power tools.   Moreover, demand for LIBs in the automobile industry is 
also  expected  to  increase  significantly  with  the  growing  market  for  electric  vehicles.  UltraCharge’s  technology 
potentially presents significant game-changing advantages to the entire battery industry, that may bring economic and 
ecological benefits to future energy sources. 
UltraCharge’s  breakthrough  technology  replaces  graphite  used  for  the  anode  (negative  pole)  of  LIB  with  a  novel 
nanotube gel material made from titanium dioxide (an abundant, cheap and safe material commonly used as a food 
additive and in sunscreen). The patented technology includes a unique and simple method to turn titanium dioxide 
particles into tiny nanotubes a thousand times thinner than the diameter of a human hair. 
This cutting edge nanotechnology presents the following key advantages:
•
•  Rapid Charging: On commercialisation, UltraCharge’s nanotechnology may enable Smartphones to be charged 
in under 6 minutes, and Electric Vehicles will increase their range dramatically with just 10-15 minutes of 
charging. 
Enhanced  Safety:  UltraCharge  batteries  would  be  entirely  free  of  carbon  and  avoid  thermal  runaway  or 
overheating which is a main cause of fire in traditional energy storage systems (the reason current LIBs are 
banned on passenger aircraft). This safe, user- friendly and low-risk energy storage opens up the technology 
for use in wider applications. 
Cost Efficient: UltraCharge will utilise low-cost raw materials and a uniquely affordable patented production 
method. 
Lifetime:  On commercialisation, UltraCharge batteries may endure between 10,000 - 15,000 charging cycles, 
approximately 20 times more than today's batteries. 
Simplicity:  UltraCharge  technology  allows  rapid  integration  into  current  battery  production  lines.  Battery 
manufacturers would find it easy to integrate the new anode into their production processes.
•
•
•
UltraCharge has through Quick Charge Pte. Ltd also signed a research agreement with Professor Chen’s research group 
at NTU one of the world’s leading authorities in LIBs today, to develop even better LIB products with faster charging, 
longer cycling life, energy density improvement and operating at a larger range of ambient temperatures. 
 
Re-compliance with ASX Listing Rules Chapters 1 and 2 
Since the Proposed Acquisition will result in a significant change to the nature and scale of the Company’s activities, the 
Proposed Acquisition will require approval from the Company’s shareholders’ under ASX Listing Rule 11.1.2 and will also 
require the Company to re-comply with Chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules. 
A Notice of Meeting seeking shareholder approval for the resolutions required to give effect to the Proposed Acquisition 
will be sent to the Company’s shareholders in due course.

Directors’ Report
Due diligence conditions in respect to the Proposed Acquisition of Ultracharge Ltd were satisfied on 24 June 2016.
Exploration activities – review and rationalisation 
During the year, the Company continued its review and assessment of all tenements held, with an aim of reducing 
tenement expenditure commitments across the project portfolio balanced against the commercial  prospectivity of 
those tenements. The remaining tenements were maintained in good standing during the year. 
A geochemical sampling program was undertaken in May 2016, across all accessible Road Reserves and selected forestry 
tracks within the Furniss East Project (E70/4212). 
The aim of the program was to conduct a broad assessment of the potential for gold, nickel/copper, and other base 
metals mineralisation within the project area.  The program did not detect any areas of significant anomalism for any 
elements. 
Risk management 
The Directors identify and manage risk and consider the business of mineral exploration, by its nature, contains elements 
of risk, with no guarantee of success.  The success of these activities is, amongst other things, dependent upon:
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
The discovery and/or acquisition of economically recoverable reserves; 
Access to adequate capital; 
Securing and maintaining title to interests; 
Obtaining consents and approvals to undertake exploration and associated activities; and 
Access  to  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced  operational  management,  contractors  and  other 
personnel.
Significant changes in the state of affairs 
During the period there were no changes in the state of affairs of the Group other than those referred to elsewhere in 
this report of the financial statements or notes thereto.
Events subsequent to balance date 
There has not been in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report any item, transaction 
or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors of the company, to affect significantly 
the operations of the Company, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Company, in future financial 
years.
Likely developments and expected results 
The due diligence conditions in respect to the Proposed Acquisition of Ultracharge Ltd were satisfied on 24 June 2016.  
Accordingly,  a  Notice  of  Meeting  seeking  Shareholder  Approval  for  the  resolutions  required  to  give  effect  to  the 
Proposed Acquisition will be sent to the Company’s shareholders in due course. It is expected that the Company will 
convene a general meeting in September 2016 to facilitate shareholder approval for matters in respect of the Proposed 
Acquisition.    The  Company’s  shares  were  suspended  from  the  trading  on  the  ASX  from  13  May  2016,  being  the 
announcement date of the Proposed Acquisition and will continue to be suspended until the company has re-complied 
with Chapters 1 and 2 of the ASX Listing Rules and the Proposed Acquisition has completed. 
The indicative share capital structure of the Company post-acquisition of UltraCharge (based on current securities on

Remuneration policies
Audited Remuneration Report 
The Remuneration Report sets out information relating to the remuneration of the Company’s key management 
personnel.  
Other than the short-term and long-term performance incentives, remuneration is not linked to the performance of 
the Company. 
The Remuneration Report is set out under the following main headings: 
A. 
Remuneration policies 
B. 
Details of Directors and Company Executives (Key Management Personnel) 
C. 
Options and rights over equity instruments granted as compensation  
All remuneration is presented in Australian dollars (unless otherwise stated).  
A. 
The Board has adopted a framework for corporate governance, including policies dealing with Board and Executive 
remuneration. These corporate governance policies are described more fully on pages 19 to 25 of the Directors’ Report. 
Policies adopted by the Board reflect the relative stage of development of the Company, having regard for the size and 
structure of the organisation. 
Remuneration levels are competitively set to attract and retain appropriately qualified and experienced Directors and 
Senior Executives. The remuneration packages of Executive Directors provide for a fixed level of remuneration. Other 
than  as  noted  below  Executive  remuneration  packages  do  not  have  guaranteed  equity  based  components  or 
performance based components.   
Fixed remuneration 
Fixed remuneration consists  of base remuneration (salary or consulting fees) including any FBT charges as well as 
employer contributions to superannuation funds, where applicable. 
Remuneration levels are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. 
Performance linked remuneration 
During the previous financial period, the Board of Directors completed a review of compensation and benefit structures.    
Long-term  incentives  can  be  provided  as  ordinary  shares  and  options  over  ordinary  shares  of  the  Company.  As 
determined, shareholders in general meeting will be asked to approve specific grants of shares and options to Non- 
Executive and Executive Directors as a form of remuneration.  
Consequences of performance on shareholders wealth 
In view of the relatively early stage of development of the Company's business, current remuneration policies are not 
directly linked to company performance. 
The table below shows the performance of the Group as measured by loss per share:

Board and will be accountable to the Board for the exercise of those delegated powers.
Further details of Board responsibilities, objectives and structure are set out in the Board Charter on the Lithex 
website.
Board Committees
The Board considers that the Company is not currently of a size, nor are its affairs of such complexity to justify the 
formation of separate committees at this time including audit, risk, remuneration or nomination committees, 
preferring at this stage of the Company’s development, to manage the Company through the full Board of Directors. 
The Board assumes the responsibilities normally delegated to the audit, risk, remuneration and nomination 
Committees.
If the Company’s activities increase, in size, scope and nature, the appointment of separate committees will be 
reviewed by the Board and implemented if appropriate.
Board Appointments
The Company undertakes comprehensive reference checks prior to appointing a director, or putting that person 
forward as a candidate to ensure that person is competent, experienced, and would not be impaired in any way from 
undertaking the duties of director. The Company provides relevant information to shareholders for their consideration 
about the attributes of candidates together with whether the Board supports the appointment or re-election.
The terms of the appointment of a non-executive director, executive directors and senior executives are agreed upon 
and set out in writing at the time of appointment.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chairman, on all matters to do with the 
proper functioning of the Board, including agendas, Board papers and minutes, advising the Board and its Committees 
(as applicable) on governance matters, monitoring that the Board and Committee policies and procedures are 
followed, communication with regulatory bodies and the ASX and statutory and other filings.
Diversity
The Company has adopted a formal Diversity Policy and is committed to workplace diversity, with a particular focus on 
supporting the representation of women at the senior level of the Company and on the Company Board.
The Company, which currently has no employees, is at a stage of its development such that the application of 
measurable objectives in relation to gender diversity, at various levels of the Company’s business, is not considered to 
be appropriate nor practical.

The Board will review this position on an annual basis and will implement measurable objectives as and when they 
deem the Company to require them.

The Company’s Diversity Policy is available on its website.
Board & Management Performance Review
On an annual basis, the Board conducts a review of its structure, composition and performance.
The annual review includes consideration of the following measures:
•  comparing the performance of the Board against the requirements of its Charter; 
•  assessing the performance of the Board over the previous 12 months having regard to the corporate strategies,
operating plans and the annual budget;
•  reviewing the Board’s interaction with management; 
•  reviewing the type and timing of information provided to the Board by management; 
•  reviewing management’s performance in assisting the Board to meet its objectives; and 
•
identifying any necessary or desirable improvements to the Board Charter.
The method and scope of the performance evaluation will be set by the Board and may include a Board self-
assessment checklist to be completed by each Director.  The Board may also use an independent adviser to assist in 
the review.
The Chairman has primary responsibility for conducting performance appraisals of Non-Executive Directors, in 
conjunction with them, having particular regard to:
•  contribution to Board discussion and function; 
•  degree of independence including relevance of any conflicts of interest; 
•  availability for and attendance at Board meetings and other relevant events; 
•  contribution to Company strategy; 
•  membership of and contribution to any Board committees; and 
•  suitability to Board structure and composition.
Given, the size of the Board, the change to the composition of the Board during the financial year and the current 
level of operations of the Company, no formal appraisal of the Board was conducted during the financial year.
The Board conducts an annual performance assessment of the Managing Director (where one is appointed) against 
agreed key performance indicators.
Independent Advice
Directors have a right of access to all Company information and executives.  Directors are entitled, in fulfilling their 
duties and responsibilities, to obtain independent professional advice on any matter connected with the discharge of 
their responsibilities, with prior notice to the Chairman, at Lithex’s expense.

Mr Jason Peterson
Non-Executive Chairman (appointed 1 December 2015);

Lithex Resources Limited ABN 97 140 316 463
Page | 21
Corporate governance statement
The Board currently consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors. 
 
Lithex has adopted a definition of 'independence' for Directors that is consistent with the Recommendations. 
 
The Company’s former Chairman, Mr Jason Peterson, was not considered to be an independent director of the Company 
as a result of him being a substantial shareholder of the Company.   
 
Since 1 December 2015, the Board has consisted of independent directors as Mr Wheeler, Mr Graziano and Ms Cowan 
are considered to be independent as they are not members of management and are free of any business or other 
relationship that could materially interfere with – or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with – the 
independent exercise of their judgement.
Board Selection Process
The Board considers that a diverse range of  skills, backgrounds, knowledge and experience is required in order to 
effectively govern Lithex.  The Board believes that orderly succession and renewal contributes to strong corporate 
governance and is achieved by careful planning and continual review.  
 
The Board is responsible for the nomination and selection of directors.  The Board reviews the size and composition of 
the Board regularly and at least once a year as part of the Board evaluation process.  The Company does not have an 
established Board skills matrix on the mix of skills and diversity for Board membership.  The Board continues to monitor 
the mix of skills and diversity on the Board.  However, due to the size of the Company, the Board does not consider it 
appropriate at this time to formally establish a matrix on the mix of skills and diversity for Board membership.  When 
the need for a new director is identified, the Board considers the required skills, experience and competencies of 
candidates and the mix of skills of the existing directors. 
 
Generally a list of potential candidates is identified based on these skills required and other issues such as geographic 
location  and  diversity  criteria.    Candidates  are  assessed  against  the  required  skills  and  on  their  qualifications, 
backgrounds and personal qualities.  In addition, candidates are sought who have a proven track record in creating 
security holder value and the required time to commit to the position.
Induction of New Directors and Ongoing Development
New Directors are issued with a formal Letter of Appointment that sets out the key terms and conditions of their 
appointment, including Director's duties, rights and responsibilities, the time commitment envisaged, and the Board's 
expectations regarding involvement with any Committee work.
An induction program is in place and new Directors are encouraged to engage in professional development activities 
to develop and maintain the skills and knowledge needed to perform their role as Directors effectively. 
Principle 3: Act ethically and responsibly 
The Company has implemented a Code of Conduct, which provides guidelines aimed at maintaining high ethical 
standards, corporate behaviour and accountability within the Company.
All employees and Directors are expected to:
• 
respect the law and act in accordance with it; 
•  maintain high levels of professional conduct; 
• 
• 
• 
•
respect confidentiality and not misuse Company information, assets or facilities; 
avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest; 
act in the best interests of shareholders; 
by their actions contribute to the Company’s reputation as a good corporate citizen which seeks the respect of the 
community and environment in which it operates; 
perform their duties in ways that minimise environmental impacts and maximise workplace safety; 
exercise fairness, courtesy, respect, consideration and sensitivity in all dealings within their workplace and with 
customers, suppliers and the public generally; and 
act with honesty, integrity, decency and responsibility at all times.

Corporate governance statement
An employee that breaches the Code of Conduct may face disciplinary action including, in the cases of serious 
breaches, dismissal.  If an employee suspects that a breach of the Code of Conduct has occurred or will occur, he or 
she must report that breach to the Company Secretary.  No employee will be disadvantaged or prejudiced if he or she 
reports in good faith a suspected breach.  All reports will be acted upon and kept confidential. 
Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting 
The Board as a whole fulfils the functions normally delegated to the Audit Committee as detailed in the Audit Committee 
Charter.  
 
The Board is responsible for the initial appointment of the external auditor and the appointment of a new external 
auditor  when  any  vacancy  arises.    Candidates  for  the  position  of  external  auditor  must  demonstrate  complete 
independence from the Company through the engagement period.  The Board may otherwise select an external auditor 
based on criteria relevant to the Company’s business and circumstances.  The performance of the external auditor is 
reviewed on an annual basis by the Board.  
 
The Board receives regular reports from management and from external auditors.  It also meets with the external 
auditors as and when required. 
 
The external auditors attend Lithex's AGM and are available to answer questions from security holders relevant to the 
audit. 
 
Prior approval of the Board must be gained for non-audit work to be performed by the external auditor.  There are 
qualitative limits on this non-audit work to ensure that the independence of the auditor is maintained.  
 
There is also a requirement that the audit partner responsible for the audit not perform in that role for more than five 
years.
Director and CFO Certifications
The Board has received certifications from a Director and the CFO in connection with the financial statements for 
Lithex for the Reporting Period.  The certifications state that the declaration provided in accordance with Section 295A 
of the Corporations Act as to the integrity of the financial statements is founded on a sound system of risk 
management and internal control which is operating effectively. 
Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure 
The Company has a Continuous Disclosure Policy which outlines the disclosure obligations of the Company as required 
under the ASX Listing Rules and Corporations Act.  The policy is designed to ensure that procedures are in place so that 
the market is properly informed of matters which may have a material impact on the price at which Company securities 
are traded.   
 
The Board considers whether there are any matters requiring disclosure in respect of each and every item of business 
that it considers in its meetings.  Individual Directors are required to make such a consideration when they become 
aware of any information in the course of their duties as a Director of the Company. 
 
The Company is committed to ensuring all investors have equal and timely access to material information concerning 
the Company. 
 
The Board has designated the Company Secretary as the person responsible for communicating with the ASX.  The 
Chairman, Managing Director (where one is appointed) and the Company Secretary are responsible for ensuring that: 
a) 
Company announcements are made in a timely manner, that announcements are factual and do not omit any 
material information required to be disclosed under the ASX Listing Rules and Corporations Act; and
b)  Company announcements are expressed in a clear and objective manner that allows investors to assess the impact
of the information when making investment decisions.
Principle 6: Respect the rights of security holders 
The Company recognizes the value of providing current and relevant information to its shareholders. 
 
The Company respects the rights of its shareholders and to facilitate the effective exercise of those rights the Company
Lithex Resources Limited ABN 97 140 316 463
Page | 23
Corporate governance statement
is committed to: 
•
communicating  effectively  with  shareholders  through  releases  to  the  market  via  ASX,  the  company  website, 
information mailed to shareholders and the general meetings of the Company; 
giving shareholders ready access to clear and understandable information about the Company; and
• 
•  making it easy for shareholders to participate in general meetings of the Company. 
 
The Company also makes available a telephone number and email address for shareholders to make enquiries of the 
Company.  These contact details are available on the “contact us” page of the Company’s website. 
 
Shareholders may elect to, and are encouraged to, receive communications from Lithex and Lithex's securities registry 
electronically.  
 
The  Company  maintains  information  in  relation  to  its  Constitution,  governance  documents,  Directors  and  senior 
executives, Board and committee charters, annual reports and ASX announcements on the Company’s website. 
Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk 
The Board is committed to the identification, assessment and management of risk throughout Lithex's business 
activities.
The Board is responsible for the oversight of the Company’s risk management and internal compliance and control 
framework.  The Company does not have an internal audit function.  Responsibility for control and risk management is 
delegated to the appropriate level of management within the Company with the Managing Director (where one is 
appointed) having ultimate responsibility to the Board for the risk management and internal compliance and control 
framework.  Lithex has established policies for the oversight and management of material business risks.
Lithex's Risk Management and Internal Compliance and Control Policy recognises that risk management is an essential 
element of good corporate governance and fundamental in achieving its strategic and operational objectives.  Risk 
management improves decision making, defines opportunities and mitigates material events that may impact security 
holder value.
Lithex believes that explicit and effective risk management is a source of insight and competitive advantage.  To this 
end, Lithex is committed to the ongoing development of a strategic and consistent enterprise wide risk management 
program, underpinned by a risk conscious culture.
Lithex accepts that risk is a part of doing business.  Therefore, the Company’s Risk Management and Internal 
Compliance and Control Policy is not designed to promote risk avoidance.  Rather Lithex's approach is to create a risk 
conscious culture that encourages the systematic identification, management and control of risks whilst ensuring we 
do not enter into unnecessary risks or enter into risks unknowingly.
Lithex assesses its risks on a residual basis; that is it evaluates the level of risk remaining and considering all the 
mitigation practices and controls.  Depending on the materiality of the risks, Lithex applies varying levels of 
management plans.
Given that the Company does not currently have any executives, there has been no report to the Board from 
management of its material business risks.  The management of the Company’s material risks is currently undertaken 
by the Board.  The Company faces risks inherent to its business, including economic risks, which may materially impact 
the Company’s ability to create or preserve value for security holders over the short, medium or long term.  The 
Company has in place policies and procedures, including a risk management framework (as described in the 
Company’s Risk Management and Internal Compliance and Control Policy), which is developed and updated to help 
manage these risks. The Board does not consider, given the current nature of the Company’s activities, that it has a 
material exposure to environmental or social sustainability risks.
The Company’s process of risk management and internal compliance and control includes:
•
•
identifying and measuring risks that might impact upon the achievement of the Company’s goals and objectives, 
and monitoring the environment for emerging factors and trends that affect those risks. 
formulating risk management strategies to manage identified risks, and designing and implementing appropriate 
risk management policies and internal controls.
•  monitoring  the  performance  of,  and  improving  the  effectiveness  of,  risk  management  systems  and  internal
Lithex Resources Limited ABN 97 140 316 463
Page | 24
Corporate governance statement 
compliance  and  controls,  including  regular  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management  and  internal 
compliance and control.
The Board review’s the Company’s risk management framework at least annually to ensure that it continues to 
effectively manage risk.  
Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly 
The Board as a whole fulfils to the functions normally delegated to the Remuneration Committee as detailed in the 
Remuneration Committee Charter.
Lithex has implemented a Remuneration Policy which was designed to recognise the competitive environment within 
which Lithex operates and also emphasise the requirement to attract and retain high calibre talent in order to achieve 
sustained improvement in Lithex’s performance.  The overriding objective of the Remuneration Policy is to ensure that 
an individual’s remuneration package accurately reflects their experience, level of responsibility, individual 
performance and the performance of Lithex.
The key principles are to:
• 
•
link executive reward with strategic goals and sustainable performance of Lithex; 
apply challenging corporate and individual key performance indicators that focus on both short-term and long-
term outcomes;
•  motivate and recognise superior performers with fair, consistent and competitive rewards; 
• 
• 
•
remunerate fairly and competitively in order to attract and retain top talent; 
recognise capabilities and promote opportunities for career and professional development; and 
through employee ownership of Lithex shares, foster a partnership between employees and other security 
holders.
The Board determines the Company’s remuneration policies and practices and assesses the necessary and desirable 
competencies of Board members.  The Board is responsible for evaluating Board performance, reviewing Board and 
management succession plans and determines remuneration packages for the Managing Director (where one is 
appointed), Non-Executive Directors and senior management based on an annual review.
Lithex’s executive remuneration policies and structures and details of remuneration paid to directors and senior 
managers (where appointed) are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Non-Executive Directors receive fees (including statutory superannuation where applicable) for their services, the 
reimbursement of reasonable expenses and, in certain circumstances options.  They do not receive any termination or 
retirement benefits, other than statutory superannuation.
The maximum aggregate remuneration approved by shareholders for Non-Executive Directors is $250,000 per annum.  
The Directors set the individual Non-Executive Directors fees within the limit approved by shareholders.
The total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors during the reporting period were $120,000.
Executive directors and other senior executives (where appointed) are remunerated using combinations of fixed and 
performance based remuneration.  Fees and salaries are set at levels reflecting market rates and performance based 
remuneration is linked directly to specific performance targets that are aligned to both short and long term objectives.
In  accordance  with  the  Company’s  Securities  Trading  Policy,  participants  in  an  equity  based  incentive  scheme  are 
prohibited from entering into any transaction that would have the effect of hedging or otherwise transferring the risk 
of any fluctuation in the value of any unvested entitlement in the Company’s securities to any other person.  
Further details in relation to the company’s remuneration policies are contained in the Remuneration Report, within 
the Directors’ report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2016 
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies 
The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the financial 
report. The accounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise stated.
The financial report covers the consolidated entity of Lithex Resources Limited (“the Parent”) and its subsidiary (“the 
Group”). Lithex Resources Limited (LTX) is a listed public company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. 
Reporting basis and conventions 
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report  that  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Australian 
Accounting  Standards  including  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations,  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001.
Australian Accounting Standards set out accounting policies that the AASB has concluded would result in a financial 
report containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply. 
Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that the financial statements and notes also comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards.
Going concern basis of accounting
Notwithstanding the loss for the year, negative cash flow from operations and historical financial performance, the 
financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis. This assessment is based on cash at bank balance at balance 
date of $1,739,365 (2015: $1,550,575).  On 13 May 2016 the Company announced that it had entered into a binding 
Heads of Agreement to acquire 100% of the issued capital of Israeli Company Ultracharge Ltd (formerly Voltape Ltd) the 
due diligence conditions in respect to the Proposed Acquisition of Ultracharge Ltd were satisfied on 24 June 2016.
Changes in Accounting Policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial reporting period except as follows:
New and amended standards adopted by the Group

Summary
AASB 9
Financial Instruments
AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces 
AASB 139. This new version supersedes AASB 9 issued in 
December 2009 (as amended) and AASB 9 (issued in 
December 2010) and includes a model for classification and 
measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected loss’ 
impairment model and a substantially-reformed approach to 
hedge accounting. 
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018. However, the Standard is available for early 
adoption. The own credit changes can be early adopted in 
isolation without otherwise changing the accounting for 
financial instruments. 
Classification and measurement 
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for 
classification and measurement of financial assets compared 
with the requirements of AASB 139. There are also some 
changes made in relation to financial liabilities. 
The main changes are described below. 
Financial assets 
a.
Financial assets that are debt instruments will be 
classified based on (1) the objective of the entity's 
business model for managing the financial assets; (2) the 
characteristics of the contractual cash flows. 
Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to 
present gains and losses on investments in equity 
instruments that are not held for trading in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends in respect of these 
investments that are a return on investment can be 
recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment 
or recycling on disposal of the instrument. 
Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair 
value through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing 
so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would arise from 
measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains 
and losses on them, on different bases.
b.
c.
Financial liabilities
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities 
are limited to the measurement of liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.
Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the 
change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:
►
►
The change attributable to changes in credit risk 
are presented in other comprehensive income 
(OCI) 
The remaining change is presented in profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was 
caused by changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to be 
measured at fair value. This change in accounting means that 
gains or losses attributable to changes in the entity’s own 
credit risk would be recognised in OCI.  These amounts 
recognised in OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if the 
liability is ever repurchased at a discount. 
Impairment 
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss 
impairment model that will require more timely recognition 
of expected credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard 
requires entities to account for expected credit losses from 
when financial instruments are first recognised and to

Hedge accounting 
Amendments to AASB 9 (December 2009 & 2010 editions and 
AASB 2013-9) issued in December 2013 included the new 
hedge accounting requirements, including changes to hedge 
effectiveness testing, treatment of hedging costs, risk 
components that can be hedged and disclosures. 
Consequential amendments were also made to other 
standards as a result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB 2009-11 
and superseded by AASB 2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 
2014-1 – Part E. 
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments 
arising from the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014. 
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of 
AASB 9 (AASB 9 (December 2009) and AASB 9 (December 
2010)) from 1 February 2015 and applies to annual reporting 
periods beginning on after 1 January 2015.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces the 
existing revenue recognition standards AASB 111 Construction 
Contracts, AASB 118 Revenue and related Interpretations 
(Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, 
Interpretation 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real 
Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers,  
Interpretation  131 Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving 
Advertising Services and Interpretation 1042 Subscriber 
Acquisition Costs in the Telecommunications Industry). AASB 
15 incorporates the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and developed jointly with 
the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue 
arising from contracts with customers (except for contracts 
within the scope of other accounting standards such as leases 
or financial instruments). The core principle of AASB 15 is that 
an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of 
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity 
recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by 
applying the following steps:
(a)   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
(b)
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the 
contract
(c)
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the 
performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity 
satisfies a performance obligation

effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2018. Early application is permitted.

The financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs.
All amounts presented are Australian dollars unless otherwise stated. Lithex Resources Limited is a for profit entity.
The financial report was authorised for issue by the Directors on 19 August 2016. 
Accounting policies 
a.
Basis of consolidation 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and  entities 
controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:
•  has power over the investee; 
• 
•  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement in with the investee; and
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has the power over the 
investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of 
the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or
Lithex Resources Limited ABN 97 140 316 463
Page | 35
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
not the Company’s voting rights are sufficient to give it power, including,
•
the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the 
other vote holders;
•  potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties; rights arising from
other contractual arrangements; and  
any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the 
current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including 
voting patterns at previous shareholder meetings.
•
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the 
date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit  or  loss  and  each  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  are  attributed  to  the  owners  of  the 
Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the 
owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the controlling interest having 
a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies  in  line  with  the  Group’s  accounting  policies.  All  intragroup  assets  and  liabilities,  equity,  income, 
expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in existing subsidiaries
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over 
the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and 
the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in subsidiaries. Any 
difference between the amount paid by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of 
the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as 
the difference between:
•
•
The aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest; 
and
The previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and 
any non-controlling interests.
All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted 
for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to 
profit and loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by the applicable AASBs). 
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded 
as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under AASB 139, when applicable, the cost 
on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
b.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable to the 
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and that revenue can be 
measured reliably. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances and duties and taxes 
paid. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Lithex Resources Limited ABN 97 140 316 463

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
b.
Revenue Recognition (continued)
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered and titles have passed, at which time all the following 
conditions are satisfied:
• 
•
• 
• 
•
the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; 
the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with 
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and 
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference  to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset to that assets’ net carrying amount on initial recognition.
c.
Income tax
The income tax expense (revenue) for the year comprises current income tax expense (income) and deferred 
tax expense (income).
Current income tax expense charged to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income calculated using 
applicable  income  tax  rates  enacted,  or  substantially  enacted,  as  at  reporting  date.  Current  tax  liabilities 
(assets) are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to (recovered from) the relevant taxation 
authority.
Deferred income tax  expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances 
during the year as well unused tax losses.
Current and deferred income tax expense (income) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit 
or loss when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result 
where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available. No deferred income tax will 
be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there 
is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting 
date. Their measurement also reflects the  manner in which management expects to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of the related asset or liability.
Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset 
can be utilised.
Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not recognized where the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and it is not 
probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
c.
Income tax (continued)
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended 
that net settlement or  simultaneous realisation and settlement of respective asset and liability will occur. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred
tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same entity 
or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement 
of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax 
assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.
d.
Other taxes 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
•  when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part 
of the expense item as applicable; and
•
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables 
or payables in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows 
arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority 
are classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority.
e.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation costs related to an area of interest are expensed as incurred.
f.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits held at call with banks with original maturities of three months or 
less.
g.
Financial Instruments
Classification
The Group has only receivables and trade payables. 
(i)
Receivables
Receivables are non-derivative financial assets  with  fixed  or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities 
greater  than  12  months  after  the  reporting  period  which  are  classified  as  non-current  assets. 
Receivables  are  included  in  trade  and  other  receivables  (note  10)  in  the  statement  of  financial 
position.
(ii)
Payables
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised costs and represent liabilities for goods 
and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
g.
Financial instruments (continued)
when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods 
and services.
Recognition and de-recognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.  Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risk and rewards of ownership.
Subsequent measurement
Receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined are disclosed in note 20.
Impairment
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial 
asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is 
measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred. The cash flows are discounted at the 
financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in profit and loss.
Fair value 
The Group does not have any financial instruments that are subject to recurring fair value measurements.   
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying values of its tangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset, being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the asset’s 
carrying value. Any excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed to the income 
statement.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Property, plant and equipment  
Each  class  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  carried  at  cost  less,  where  applicable,  any  accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is measured on the cost basis.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are  charged to the income 
statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Property, plant and equipment  (continued)
Depreciation
k.
l.
The depreciable amount of all fixed assets is depreciated on a reducing balance basis over their useful lives to 
the Group commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use.  The depreciation rates used for each 
class of depreciable assets for 2016 and 2015 are:
Class of Fixed Asset 
Computer Equipment
Depreciation Rate
33.3%
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet 
date. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately  to its recoverable amount if  the asset’s carrying 
amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains 
and losses are included in the income statement.  
Contributed equity 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a 
limited amount of authorised capital. 
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown as a deduction from the equity 
proceeds, net of any income tax benefit.  
Options  
Share-based payments 
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group received remuneration in the form of share-based 
payments, whereby employees receive equity instruments as consideration for services rendered (equity-
settled transactions).  
Equity-settled transactions 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made 
using an appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in 
other capital reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are 
fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of profit or loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits 
expense. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions for 
which vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
and/or service conditions are satisfied.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Directors make estimates and judgments in preparing the financial report based on historical knowledge 
and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are 
based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued) 
m.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)
Key estimates:  
Impairment 
The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may 
lead to impairment of assets including property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. Where 
an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. Value-in-use calculations 
performed  in  assessing  recoverable  amounts  incorporate  a  number  of  key  estimates,  including  levels  of 
operating revenue and terminal values of assets. A material change to these key assumptions could result in a 
material adjustment to the carrying values of non-current assets.  
Deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will 
be  available  against  which  the  losses  can  be  utilised.  Significant  management  judgement  is  required  to 
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level 
of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom. 
Judgements: 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: 
The Going Concern basis of preparation 
Management has made a significant judgement with regards to the application of the going concern basis of 
preparation (refer to note 1).
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker.  The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing  performance  of  the  operating  segments,  has  been  identified  as  the  board  of  directors  of  Lithex 
Resources Limited.
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  attributable  to  members  of  Lithex  Resources 
Limited, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year. 
Diluted earnings per share 
Earnings used to calculate diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the basic earnings by the after-
tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares. The weighted average 
number of shares used is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Incentive Option Cashless Exercise Facility
i.
ii.
A holder may, subject to clause (iii) below, elect to pay the Exercise Price for an Incentive Option by setting 
off the Exercise Price against the number of Shares which it is entitled to receive upon exercise (Cashless 
Exercise Facility). By using the Cashless Exercise Facility, the holder will receive Shares to the value of the 
surplus after the Exercise Price has been set off. 
  
If a holder elects to use the Cashless Exercise Facility, the holder will only be issued that number of Shares 
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) as are equal in value to the difference between the total 
Exercise Price otherwise payable for the Incentive Options on the Incentive Options being exercised and the 
then market value of the Shares at the time of exercise (determined as the volume weighted average of the 
prices at which Shares were traded on the ASX during the one week period immediately preceding the exercise 
date) calculated in accordance with the following formula:
S= O x (MSP – EP)

Note 20: Financial instruments 
Financial risk management 
The Group’s financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks and accounts payable. 
The main risks the Group is exposed to through its financial instruments is interest rate risk and credit risk. 
a)
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, which is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes 
in market interest rates. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s consolidated statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables constant.
b)
Change in Basis Points
Increase 100 basis points 
Decrease 100 basis points

Increase/(Decrease) 
2016 
2015 
15,506 
17,394 
(17,394) 
(15,506)
A sensitivity of 100 basis points has been used as this is considered reasonable given the current level of both short 
term and long term Australian Dollar interest rates. This would represent two to four movements by the Reserve 
Bank of Australia.
c)  Foreign currency risk
The Group is not exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies.
d)  Credit risk
The most significant concentration of credit risk is in relation to cash and cash equivalents, with the maximum 
exposure being the carrying value per the consolidated statement of financial position. 
The group minimises its credit risk by using financial institutions with a credit rating of AAA.
e)  Liquidity risk
The Company manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows and ensuring that adequate cash reserves 
are maintained. 
Trade and other payables are payable within 30 days.
f)  Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any material commodity price risk.
g)  Capital management
The  Group’s  policy  is  to  maintain  a  strong  and  flexible  capital  base  to  provide  investor,  creditor  and  market 
confidence to sustain future development of the business.  The Group monitors the statement of financial position 
strength and flexibility using cash flow forecast analysis and detailed budgeting processes.   
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.  Risk management policies 
and procedures are established with regular monitoring and reporting. 
Neither the Group nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
h)  Fair value
Due to the short term nature of financial assets and liabilities their carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Lithex Resources
Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Lithex Resources Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 1, the directors also
state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the
financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.
