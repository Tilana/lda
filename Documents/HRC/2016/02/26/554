<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  28/27. Human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Territory, including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the 
</p>
<p>involvement of children in armed conflict, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
</p>
<p>of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and affirming that these human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, among others, are applicable to and must be respected in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the recent reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, and of other relevant recent reports 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the recent accession by Palestine to several human rights treaties and the core 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law conventions, and its accession on 2 January 2015 to the Rome Statute of 
</p>
<p>the International Criminal Court,  
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> Israel&#8217;s recurrent practice of withholding Palestinian tax revenues, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights 
</p>
<p>and to ensure respect for international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-
</p>

<p><i>Noting in particular</i> the Court&#8217;s reply, including that the construction of the wall 
</p>
<p>being built by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
</p>
<p>in and around East Jerusalem, and its associated regime are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
</p>
<p>force, and deeply concerned at the fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, through the construction of settlements, settler roads, the wall and 
</p>
<p>other measures that are tantamount to de facto annexation of Palestinian land, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, and reaffirming the obligation of the States parties to the Fourth 
</p>
<p>Geneva Convention under articles 146, 147 and 148 with regard to penal sanctions, grave 
</p>
<p>breaches and responsibilities of the High Contracting Parties, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all States have the right and the duty to take actions in conformity 
</p>
<p>with international human rights law and international humanitarian law to counter deadly 
</p>
<p>acts of violence against their civilian population in order to protect the lives of their 
</p>
<p>citizens, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the need</i> for full compliance with the Israeli-Palestinian agreements 
</p>
<p>reached within the context of the Middle East peace process, including the Sharm el-Sheikh 
</p>
<p>understandings, and the implementation of the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State 
</p>
<p>solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of accountability in preventing future conflicts and 
</p>
<p>ensuring that there is no impunity for violations and abuses, thereby contributing to peace 
</p>
<p>efforts and avoiding the recurrence of violations of international law, including 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and international human rights law,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at the continuing systematic violation of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of the Palestinian people by Israel, the occupying Power, including that arising from the 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force and military operations causing death and injury to Palestinian 
</p>
<p>civilians, including children and women, to non-violent, peaceful demonstrators and to 
</p>
<p>journalists, including through the use of live ammunition; the use of collective punishment; 
</p>
<p>the closure of areas; the confiscation of land; the establishment and expansion of 
</p>
<p>settlements; the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in departure 
</p>
<p>from the Armistice Line of 1949; the policies and practices that discriminate against and 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem; the discriminatory allocation of water resources between Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlers who reside illegally in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>population of the said Territory<i>; </i>the violation of the basic right to adequate housing, which 
</p>
<p>is a component of the right to an adequate standard of living; the destruction of property 
</p>
<p>and infrastructure; and all other actions by it designed to change the legal status, 
</p>
<p>geographical nature and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the conflict in and around the Gaza Strip in July and August 2014 and the 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties caused, including the killing and injury of thousands of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>civilians, including children, women and elderly persons, the widespread destruction of 
</p>
<p>thousands of homes and of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, water 
</p>
<p>sanitation and electricity networks, economic, industrial and agricultural properties, public 
</p>
<p>institutions, religious sites and United Nations schools and facilities, the internal 
</p>
<p>displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians, and any violations of international law, 
</p>
<p>including humanitarian and human rights law, in this regard, </p>


<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> in particular about the disastrous humanitarian situation and the 
</p>
<p>critical socioeconomic and security situations in the Gaza Strip, including that resulting 
</p>
<p>from the prolonged continuous closures and severe economic and movement restrictions 
</p>
<p>that in effect amount to a blockade, and from the continuing and vastly negative 
</p>
<p>repercussions of the military operations between December 2008 and January 2009, in 
</p>
<p>November 2012 and in July and August 2014, as well as about the firing of rockets into 
</p>
<p>Israel, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that the situation in the Gaza Strip is unsustainable and that a durable 
</p>
<p>ceasefire agreement must lead to a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, including through the sustained and regular opening of 
</p>
<p>crossing points, and ensure the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the need to support the Palestinian national consensus government in its 
</p>
<p>assumption of full government responsibilities in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in 
</p>
<p>all fields, and through its presence at Gaza crossing points, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>deep concern </i>at the short- and long-term detrimental impact of such 
</p>
<p>widespread destruction and the continued impediments to the reconstruction process on the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation and on the socioeconomic and humanitarian conditions of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian civilian population, compounded by the fact that only about 5 per cent of 
</p>
<p>pledged donations for reconstruction have reached the Gaza Strip, and calling upon the 
</p>
<p>international community to step up its efforts in order to provide the Gaza Strip with the 
</p>
<p>assistance that it requires, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the need</i> to end immediately the closure of the Gaza Strip and for the full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for 
</p>
<p>the Rafah Crossing, both of 15 November 2005, to allow for the freedom of movement of 
</p>
<p>the Palestinian civilian population within and into and out of the Gaza Strip, taking into 
</p>
<p>account Israeli concerns, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing the need also</i> for all parties, in conformity with the relevant provisions of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other 
</p>
<p>humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian personnel, and the delivery of supplies and equipment, in order to allow such 
</p>
<p>personnel to perform efficiently their task of assisting affected civilian populations, 
</p>
<p>including refugees and internally displaced persons,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at the Israeli policy of closures and the imposition of 
</p>
<p>severe restrictions and checkpoints, several of which have been transformed into structures 
</p>
<p>akin to permanent border crossings, other physical obstacles and a permit regime, which are 
</p>
<p>applied in a discriminatory manner affecting the Palestinian population only, and all of 
</p>
<p>which obstruct the freedom of movement of persons and goods, including medical and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian goods, throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, and impair the Territory&#8217;s contiguity, and deeply concerned also at the 
</p>
<p>consequent violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and the negative impact 
</p>
<p>on their socioeconomic situation and the efforts aimed at rehabilitating and developing the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian economy,  
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> all policies and practices whereby Israeli settlers who reside illegally in 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, are accorded preferential 
</p>
<p>treatment over the Palestinian population in terms of access to roads, infrastructure, land, 
</p>
<p>property, housing, natural resources and judicial mechanisms, resulting in widespread 
</p>
<p>human rights violations of Palestinians, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the destruction of property and the forced displacement of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, </p>


<p>constitute, in all but the most limited cases as specified under international law, violations 
</p>
<p>of the prohibitions on destruction of property and forcible transfer, respectively under 
</p>
<p>articles 53 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention<i>, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>at reports of the hampering and destruction of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance by Israel, contributing to a coercive environment that can lead to the forcible 
</p>
<p>transfer of Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> that thousands of Palestinians, including many children 
</p>
<p>and women and elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, continue to be 
</p>
<p>detained and held in Israeli prisons or detention centres under harsh conditions, including 
</p>
<p>unhygienic conditions, solitary confinement, lack of proper medical care, denial of family 
</p>
<p>visits and denial of due process, that impair their well-being, and expressing deep concern 
</p>
<p>also about the ill-treatment and harassment of any Palestinian prisoner and all reports of 
</p>
<p>torture, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern </i>about the possible consequences of the enactment by Israel, the 
</p>
<p>occupying Power, of military orders regarding the detention, imprisonment and deportation 
</p>
<p>of Palestinian civilians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>and recalling in this regard the prohibition under international humanitarian law of the 
</p>
<p>deportation of civilians from occupied territories, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> of the need for an international presence to monitor the situation, to 
</p>
<p>contribute to ending the violence and protecting the Palestinian civilian population and to 
</p>
<p>help the parties to implement the agreements reached, and in this regard recalling the 
</p>
<p>positive contribution of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the continued efforts and tangible progress made in the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>security sector, noting the continued cooperation that benefits both Palestinians and Israelis, 
</p>
<p>in particular by promoting security and building confidence, and expressing the hope that 
</p>
<p>such progress will be extended to all major population centres, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the right of all people in the region to the enjoyment of human rights as 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the International Covenants on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Stresses</i> the need for Israel, the occupying Power, to withdraw from the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, so as to enable the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian people to exercise its universally recognized right to self-determination; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reiterates</i> that all measures and actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, 
</p>
<p>in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in violation of the relevant 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time 
</p>
<p>of War, of 12 August 1949, and contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council 
</p>
<p>are illegal and have no validity; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with the provisions 
</p>
<p>of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and cease immediately all measures and actions 
</p>
<p>taken in violation and in breach of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>4<i>. Also</i> <i>demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all practices and 
</p>
<p>actions that violate the human rights of the Palestinian people, and that it fully respect 
</p>
<p>human rights law and comply with its legal obligations in this regard, including in 
</p>
<p>accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Reiterates</i> the need for respect for the territorial unity, contiguity and 
</p>
<p>integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and for guarantees of the freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement of persons and goods within the Palestinian territory, including movement into 
</p>
<p>and from East Jerusalem, into and from the Gaza Strip, between the West Bank and the 
</p>
<p>Gaza Strip, and to and from the outside world; </p>


<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the unhindered passage of ambulances at checkpoints, 
</p>
<p>especially in times of conflict; 
</p>
<p>7.<i> Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, cease immediately its imposition 
</p>
<p>of prolonged closures and economic and movement restrictions, including those amounting 
</p>
<p>to a blockade on the Gaza Strip, which severely restricts the freedom of movement of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians within, into and out of Gaza and their access to basic utilities, housing, 
</p>
<p>education, work, health and an adequate standard of living via various measures, including 
</p>
<p>import and export restrictions, that have a direct impact on livelihoods, economic 
</p>
<p>sustainability and development throughout Gaza, and in this regard calls upon Israel to 
</p>
<p>implement fully the Agreement on Movement and Access and the Agreed Principles for the 
</p>
<p>Rafah Crossing in order to allow for the sustained and regular movement of persons and 
</p>
<p>goods and for the acceleration of long overdue reconstruction in the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p>8. <i> Expresses grave concern</i> at the confiscation and damage by Israel of fishing 
</p>
<p>nets in the Gaza Strip for which there is no discernible security justification; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Condemns </i>all acts of violence, including all acts of terror, provocation, 
</p>
<p>incitement and destruction, especially the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying 
</p>
<p>forces against Palestinian civilians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, where bombardment of 
</p>
<p>populated areas has caused extensive loss of life and a vast number of injuries, including 
</p>
<p>among thousands of children and women, massive damage and destruction to homes, 
</p>
<p>economic, industrial and agricultural properties, vital infrastructure, including water, 
</p>
<p>sanitation and electricity networks, religious sites and public institutions, including 
</p>
<p>hospitals and schools, and United Nations facilities, and agricultural lands, and large-scale 
</p>
<p>internal displacement of civilians, and the excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying 
</p>
<p>forces against Palestinian civilians in the context of peaceful protests in the West Bank; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Also condemns </i>the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas resulting in 
</p>
<p>loss of life and injury; 
</p>
<p>11<i>. Calls upon</i> Israel to cease all violations of the right to education of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians, including those stemming from restrictions on movement and incidents of 
</p>
<p>harassment and attacks on school children and educational facilities by Israeli settlers and 
</p>
<p>as a result of Israeli military action; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to end any harassment, intimidation and reprisals 
</p>
<p>against human rights defenders who peacefully advocate for the rights of Palestinians in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including by cooperating with United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies; 
</p>
<p>13<i>. Expresses deep concern</i> at the conditions of the Palestinian prisoners and 
</p>
<p>detainees, including minors, in Israeli jails and detention centres, demands that Israel, the 
</p>
<p>occupying Power, fully respect and abide by its international law obligations towards all 
</p>
<p>Palestinian prisoners and detainees in its custody, and also expresses its concern at the 
</p>
<p>continued extensive use of administrative detention, calls for a full implementation of the 
</p>
<p>agreement reached in May 2012 for a prompt and independent investigation into all cases 
</p>
<p>of death custody, and also calls upon Israel to release any Palestinian prisoner whose 
</p>
<p>detention is not in accordance with international law; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to explicitly prohibit torture, including psychological 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Demands</i> that Israel cease its policy of transferring prisoners from the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory into the territory of Israel, and respect fully its obligations 
</p>
<p>under article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention; </p>


<p>16. <i>Urges</i> Israel to ensure that any arrest, detention and/or trial of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>children is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including by refraining 
</p>
<p>from holding criminal proceedings against them in military courts that, by definition, fall 
</p>
<p>short of providing the necessary guarantees to ensure respect for their rights and that 
</p>
<p>infringe upon their right to non-discrimination; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Deplores</i> Israel&#8217;s resumption of the policy of punitive home demolitions and 
</p>
<p>the ongoing policy of revoking the residency permits of Palestinians living in East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem through various discriminatory laws, and the demolition of residential structures 
</p>
<p>and the forced eviction of Palestinian families, in violation of their basic right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing and in violation of international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law adopted by 
</p>
<p>the Knesset, which suspends the possibility, with certain rare exceptions, of family 
</p>
<p>reunification between Israeli citizens and persons residing in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem, thus adversely affecting the lives of many families; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, cease all of its settlement 
</p>
<p>activities, the construction of the wall and any other measures aimed at altering the 
</p>
<p>character, status and demographic composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including in and around East Jerusalem, all of which have, inter alia, a grave and 
</p>
<p>detrimental impact on the human rights of the Palestinian people and the prospects for a 
</p>
<p>peaceful settlement; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Also</i> <i>demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal 
</p>
<p>obligations under international law, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 
</p>
<p>July 2004 by the International Court of Justice and as demanded in General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003, and that it 
</p>
<p>immediately cease the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including in and around East Jerusalem, dismantle forthwith the structure situated therein, 
</p>
<p>repeal or render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and make 
</p>
<p>reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the wall, which has had a grave 
</p>
<p>impact on the human rights and the socioeconomic living conditions of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people; 
</p>
<p>21<i>. Calls upon</i> Israel to immediately cease any demolitions or plans for 
</p>
<p>demolitions that would result in the forcible transfer or forced eviction of Palestinians, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the vulnerable areas of the Jordan Valley, the periphery of Jerusalem and the 
</p>
<p>South Hebron Hills, to facilitate the return of those Palestinian communities already 
</p>
<p>subjected to forcible transfer or eviction to their original dwellings and to ensure adequate 
</p>
<p>housing and legal security of tenure; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Urges</i> Israel to ensure that water resource allocation in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory is not discriminatory and does not result in water shortages 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affecting the Palestinian population of the West Bank, and to take urgent 
</p>
<p>steps to facilitate the restoration of the water infrastructure of the West Bank, including in 
</p>
<p>the Jordan Valley, affected by the destruction of the wells of local civilians, roof water 
</p>
<p>tanks and other water and irrigation facilities under military and settler operation since 
</p>
<p>1967; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Deplores </i>the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem, including 
</p>
<p>home demolitions, evictions of Palestinian residents, excavations in and around religious 
</p>
<p>and historic sites, and all other unilateral measures aimed at altering the character, status 
</p>
<p>and demographic composition of the city and of the territory as a whole; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Expresses grave concern </i>at: </p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) The restrictions imposed by Israel that impede access of Christian and 
</p>
<p>Muslim worshippers to holy sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, and calls upon Israel to include guarantees for non-discrimination on grounds of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief as well as for the preservation and peaceful access to all religious sites; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The increasing tensions in occupied East Jerusalem and the wider region, 
</p>
<p>including those stemming from attempts aimed at illegally changing the status quo of holy 
</p>
<p>sites; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Urges </i>Member States to continue to provide emergency assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian people to alleviate the financial crisis and the dire socioeconomic and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian situation, particularly in the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to preserve and develop the Palestinian institutions and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure for the provision of vital public services to the Palestinian civilian population 
</p>
<p>and the promotion of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Deplores</i> the persistent non-cooperation of Israel with special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders and other United Nations mechanisms, and stresses the need for Israel to 
</p>

<p>Council, all special procedures and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights; 
</p>
