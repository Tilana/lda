2006 First Quarter Report
FINANCIAL & 
OPERATING 
HIGHLIGHTS
For The Three Months  
Ended March 31, 2006
Zargon Energy Trust is pleased to report that strong operating results in the first quarter of 2006 
provided cash flow from operations of $22.35 million ($1.17 per diluted trust unit), compared with 
$26.62 million ($1.40 per diluted trust unit) in the previous quarter and $17.48 million ($0.93 per 
diluted trust unit) in the first quarter of 2005.
Highlights from the three months ended March 31, 2006 are noted below:
•  First quarter 2006 production averaged 8,812 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a new quarterly 
high and an increase of four percent from first quarter 2005 and two percent from the preceding 
quarter. The year-over-year production gains were in oil and liquids while natural gas volumes 
were  essentially  unchanged  at  28.99  million  cubic  feet  per  day  as  active  drilling  and  tie-in 
programs  in  the  Alberta  Plains  and  the  West  Central  Alberta  core  areas  were  able  to  offset 
natural declines. Oil and liquids production rose to 3,981 barrels per day as a result of exploitation 
drilling in the Williston Basin core area in the second half of 2005. Production on a per million 
trust unit outstanding basis averaged 462 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, two 
percent higher than the prior year’s first quarter average and one percent higher than the 2005 
fourth quarter level.
•  Crude oil prices continued their strength with realized prices increasing nine percent compared 
to the first quarter of 2005 but decreasing four percent from the fourth quarter of 2005. Realized 
natural gas prices were 20 percent above first quarter 2005 but 29 percent below the record fourth 
quarter prices of 2005. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, revenue declined 19 percent and 
cash flow declined 16 percent primarily as a result of the reduction in commodity prices.
•  The  Trust  declared  three  monthly  cash  distributions  of  $0.18  per  trust  unit  in  the  2006  first 
quarter for a total of $8.89 million. These distributions were equivalent to a payout ratio of 46 
percent of the Trust’s first quarter cash flow on a diluted trust unit basis, and due to the effect 
that  the  exchangeable  shares  do  not  receive  distributions  the  distributions  amounted  to  40 
percent of the cash flow from operations. Net capital expenditures were $15.19 million for the 
first  quarter  exploration  and  development  program  of  13.2  net  wells  with  essentially  no  net 
property acquisitions. As at March 31, 2006, the Trust’s balance sheet remains very strong with a 
net debt to annualized cash flow ratio at 0.3 times.

N O T E S : 
Throughout this report, the calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) is based on the conversion ratio that six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil. 
Cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP term that represents net earnings except for non-cash items. For a further 
discussion about this term, refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section in this report.
Total units outstanding include trust units plus exchangeable shares outstanding at period end. The exchangeable 
shares are converted at the exchange ratio at the end of the period.
Average daily production per million total units is calculated using the weighted average number of units outstanding 
during the period, plus the weighted average number of exchangeable shares outstanding for the period converted at 
the average exchange ratio for the period.

PRODUCTION
Natural gas production volumes averaged 28.99 million cubic feet per day in first quarter 2006, 
level with the corresponding period of 2005 and a five percent gain from the preceding quarter. 
New  production  came  from  the  tie-in  of  wells  from  the  2005  West  Central  Alberta  exploration 
program at Highvale, Pembina and at selected properties in the Peace River Arch.

Oil and liquids production of 3,981 barrels per day in the 2006 first quarter showed an 11 percent 
increase over the 2005 first quarter and a one percent decline from the preceding quarter. The year-
over-year  gains  came  from  Williston  Basin  exploitation  initiatives  in  the  2005  third  and  fourth 
quarters that provided high rate horizontal production wells at the Pinto, Saskatchewan plus the 
Haas and Truro, North Dakota properties.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (1)
During  the  first  quarter  of  2006,  Zargon  drilled  14  gross  wells  (13.2  net)  that  delivered  8.2  net 
natural gas wells, 3.0 net oil wells and 2.0 net dry holes for an 85 percent success ratio. Natural gas 
wells drilled in the first quarter include 3.9 net wells at Pembina in the West Central Alberta core 
area and 3.0 net wells at the Ukalta property of the Alberta Plains. The three Williston Basin oil 
wells included vertical and horizontal oil wells at Elswick, Saskatchewan plus one Bakken oil well 
in Manitoba.

Following spring break-up, Zargon will commence a modest drilling program with two horizontal 
wells and one vertical well programmed for North Dakota, plus five natural gas exploratory targets 
primarily in the Alberta Plains. Later in the summer, Zargon will return to the field with a very 
active drilling program focused on Williston Basin oil exploitation, Alberta Plains shallow natural 
gas  development  and  West  Central  Alberta  natural  gas  exploration  at  the  Pembina,  Peace  River 
Arch and Highvale properties.

Despite  record  high  Crown  land  sale  prices  in  the  first  quarter,  Zargon  continued  to  selectively 
purchase Crown sale parcels and acquired eight thousand net acres of land that offset expiries and 
increased Zargon’s undeveloped land inventory slightly from year end to 368 thousand net acres at 
March  31,  2006.  Transaction  prices  in  the  first  quarter’s  property  market  continued  to  set 
unprecedented  highs  and  Zargon  did  not  complete  any  material  acquisitions  in  the  quarter.  In 
order  to  capture  the  property  market’s  enthusiasm,  Zargon  is  currently  marketing  three  higher 
operating cost properties with a combined 115 barrels per day of oil production. The proceeds from 
these property dispositions will be redirected to expand our fall Alberta Plains multi-well shallow 
gas development programs.

GUIDANCE(1)
In  the  March  14,  2006  press  release  announcing  the  2005  fourth  quarter  and  full  year  results, 
Zargon reconfirmed 2006 full year production guidance of 8,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 
comprised of 27.60 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of oil and liquids per 
day. This guidance was based on an exploration and development capital program of $45 million, 
and did not reflect any allowance for property sales or acquisitions. Reflecting flush production 
rates  from  new  Williston  Basin  horizontal  oil  wells  and  the  tie-in  of  fourth  quarter  2005  West 
Central Alberta natural gas wells, the first quarter results of 8,812 barrels of oil equivalent per day 
(28.99 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 3,981 barrels per day of oil and liquids) were 
slightly higher than the combined annual guidance levels. For the next two quarters, production is 
anticipated  to  drop  slightly  below  the  annual  guidance  levels  due  to  the  effect  of  both  oil  and 
natural gas initial flush production declines and due to the sale of minor non-core properties. By 
fourth  quarter,  improved  rates  are  once  again  forecasted  as  new  production  is  added  from  the

summer/fall Williston Basin oil drilling program and from summer natural gas well tie-ins in West 
Central Alberta. Consequently, at this time Zargon reconfirms its 2006 guidance levels at 8,600 
barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day,  a  level  which  is  now  premised  on  an  expanded  $50  million 
exploration and development capital budget.
Last  November,  Zargon  announced  an  increase  in  its  base  (sustainable)  monthly  distribution  to 
$0.18 per unit, based on the underlying assumptions of production guidance of 8,600 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day and long term commodity prices of US $50 per barrel (WTI oil) and US $8 per 
mmbtu  (NYMEX  natural  gas)  with  an  inferred  $0.84  Cdn./US  dollar  currency  exchange  rate 
assumption.  Consistent  with  last  year’s  practice,  if  and  when  commodity  prices  exceed  these 
assumptions, Zargon will consider supplemental semi-annual distributions to reach our stated goal 
of  distributing  approximately  50  percent  of  the  cash  flows  attributable  to  unitholders.  Our  next 
supplemental distribution review date is scheduled for the June distribution that would be payable 
in mid-July. At this time, Zargon plans to continue with its base (sustainable) monthly distribution 
of  $0.18  per  trust  unit,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  the  recent  significant  strengthening  of  the 
Canadian currency against the US dollar has negatively impacted our projected commodity prices 
in Canadian dollars for both natural gas and oil and the $0.18 per trust unit base distribution now 
reflects sustainable guidance levels with long term commodity price assumptions of US $55 per 
barrel (WTI oil), US $8 per mmbtu (NYMEX natural gas) and a $0.87 Cdn./US dollar currency 
exchange rate.
As in the past, production guidance levels do not include an allowance for property or corporate 
acquisitions that would be funded on an opportunistic basis by bank debt or possibly equity issues. 
Despite the current overheated acquisition market, the Trust will continue to seek opportunities to 
acquire underdeveloped oil properties, particularly in the Williston Basin and undeveloped natural 
gas prospective lands that provide the foundation for future exploration and development programs 
designed to deliver sustainable results.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
Management’s  discussion  and  analysis  (MD&A)  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  unaudited  interim 
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and the audited consolidated financial 
statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2005. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise 
noted. All references to “Zargon” or the “Trust” refer to Zargon Energy Trust.
In the MD&A, reserves and production are commonly stated in barrels of oil equivalent (boe) on the basis that six 
thousand cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in 
isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy 
equivalent conversion method primarily applicable to the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalent at the 
wellhead.
The following are descriptions of non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A:
•  The  MD&A  contains  the  term  “cash  flow  from  operations”  (“cash  flow”),  which  should  not  be  considered  an 
alternative to, or more meaningful than, “cash flow from operating activities” as determined in accordance with 
Canadian GAAP as an indicator of the Trust’s financial performance. This term does not have any standardized 
meaning as prescribed by GAAP and therefore, the Trust’s determination of cash flow from operations may not be 
comparable  to  that  reported  by  other  trusts.  The  reconciliation  between  net  earnings  and  cash  flow  from 
operations can be found in the unaudited interim consolidated statements of cash flows in the unaudited interim 
consolidated financial statements. The Trust evaluates its performance based on net earnings and cash flow from 
operations. The Trust considers cash flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Trust’s 
ability to generate the cash necessary to pay distributions, repay debt and to fund future capital investment. It is 
also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas trusts, and it is frequently included in published 
research when providing investment recommendations. Cash flow from operations per unit is calculated using the 
diluted weighted average number of units for the period.
•  Payout ratio equals cash distributions as a percentage of cash flow for the period. Payout ratio is a useful measure
used by management to analyze the Trust’s efficiency and sustainability.
•  The Trust also uses the term “debt net of working capital”. Debt net of working capital as presented does not have 
any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and may not be comparable with the calculation of 
similar measures for other entities. Debt net of working capital as used by the Trust is calculated as bank debt and 
any working capital deficit excluding the current portion of unrealized risk management assets and liabilities.
•  Operating netbacks equal total petroleum and natural gas revenue per boe plus realized risk management gains 
per boe, less realized risk management losses per boe, royalties per boe, and production costs per boe. Operating 
netbacks are a useful measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.
•  Cash flow netbacks per boe are calculated as operating netbacks less general and administrative expenses per boe, 
interest and financing charges per boe, and capital and current income taxes per boe. Cash flow netbacks are a 
useful measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.
References to “production volumes” or “production” in this MD&A refer to sales volumes.
Forward-Looking Statements – This document contains statements that are forward-looking, such as those relating 
to  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition,  capital  spending,  financing  sources,  commodity  prices,  costs  of 
production  and  the  magnitude  of  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves.  By  their  nature,  forward-looking  statements  are 
subject  to  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties  that  could  significantly  affect  anticipated  results  in  the  future  and, 
accordingly actual results may differ materially from those predicted. The forward-looking statements contained in 
this  report  are  as  of  May  11,  2006  and  are  subject  to  change  after  this  date.  Readers  are  cautioned  that  the 
assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, 
may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Zargon 
disclaims, except as required by law, any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This MD&A has been prepared as of May 11, 2006.
2006 First Quarter Report
p.5
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER
•  During the first quarter of 2006, the Trust realized cash flow from operations of $22.35 million 
and declared total distributions of $8.89 million ($0.54 per trust unit) to unitholders, resulting in 
a quarterly payout ratio of 40 percent of cash flow or 46 percent on a per diluted trust unit basis. 
For Canadian income tax purposes, the distributions are currently estimated to be 100 percent 
taxable income to unitholders.
•  Average field prices received (before risk management gains/losses) for oil and liquids declined 
to $55.51 per barrel and prices received for natural gas also declined to $8.07 per thousand 
cubic feet, a four percent and 29 percent decline, respectively from the fourth quarter of 2005. 
An  active  first  quarter  field  program  drove  production  up  to  a  record  8,812  barrels  of  oil 
equivalent per day.
•  During the first quarter of 2006, the Trust drilled 14 gross wells (13.2 net) with an 85 percent
success rate. Total net capital expenditures were $15.19 million for the quarter.
•  The Trust continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with a combined debt net of working 
capital  of  $28.39  million  (excluding  unrealized  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities),  which 
represents just under four months of the first quarter 2006 annualized cash flow.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
In the first quarter of 2006, Zargon reported relatively strong levels of petroleum and natural gas 
revenue and cash flow from operations. First quarter 2006 revenue of $40.94 million was 19 percent 
below the $50.26 million in fourth quarter 2005 and 20 percent above $34.12 million in first quarter 
2005. An increase in production volumes of two percent from the previous quarter did not offset 
the commodity price decreases in the quarter, resulting in lower revenue despite record quarterly 
production  volumes.  Oil  and  liquids  prices  received  averaged  $55.51  per  barrel  before  risk 
management gains/losses in first quarter 2006 compared to $50.79 in the 2005 first quarter and 
$57.58  in  the  preceding  quarter,  an  increase  of  nine  percent  and  a  decrease  of  four  percent, 
respectively.  Reflecting  industry  trends,  Zargon’s  crude  oil  field  price  differential  from  the 
Edmonton par price, decreased slightly to $13.45 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 
$13.59  per  barrel  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005.  Natural  gas  prices  received  averaged  $8.07  per 
thousand cubic feet before risk management gains/losses in the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 
20 percent over the 2005 first quarter prices but a 29 percent decline from the preceding quarter 
levels. The difference between the realized price received for natural gas and the benchmark AECO 
average daily price during the first quarter of 2006 widened primarily due to fixed price physical 
contracts  (see  note  9  to  the  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements)  and  also  from 
Zargon  receiving  the  AECO  monthly  index,  which  is  set  prior  to  the  actual  month  of  delivery, 
versus the AECO average daily index for approximately 26 percent of its natural gas production.

Net Earnings
Natural gas production volumes increased by five percent in first quarter 2006 to 28.99 million 
cubic feet per day from 27.73 million cubic feet per day in fourth quarter 2005 and were relatively 
unchanged from the 2005 first quarter. Oil and liquids production during the first quarter of 2006 
was 3,981 barrels per day which is slightly below the 2005 fourth quarter amount of 4,030 barrels 
per day and 11 percent above the first quarter of 2005. The year-over-year increase in oil and liquids 
production is primarily due to the effect of a successful late 2005 Williston Basin core area drilling 
program. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, Zargon produced 8,812 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day, which represents a two percent increase from the 8,651 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 
fourth quarter of 2005 and a four percent increase when compared to the first quarter of 2005.

Zargon’s commodity price risk management policy uses forward sales, puts and costless collars for 
20 to 35 percent of oil and natural gas working interest production in order to partially offset the 
effects of large price fluctuations. Because our risk management strategy is protective in nature and 
is designed to guard the Trust against extreme effects on cash flow from sudden falls in prices and 
revenues, upward price spikes tend to produce overall losses. Financial risk management contracts 
in place as at December 31, 2004 were designated as hedges for accounting purposes and the Trust 
continues to monitor the remaining contracts in determining the continuation of hedge effectiveness. 
For  these  contracts,  realized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  the  statement  of  earnings  as  the 
contracts  settle  and  no  unrealized  gain  or  loss  is  recognized.  For  financial  risk  management 
contracts entered into after December 31, 2004, the Trust considers these contracts to be effective on 
an economic basis but has decided not to designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes 
and accordingly, for these contracts, an unrealized gain or loss is recorded based on the fair value 
(mark-to-market) of the contracts at the period end. Thus, the 2006 first quarter’s relatively high oil 
and natural gas prices brought about a realized risk management loss of $1.36 million that compares 
to  a  $3.12  million  realized  loss  in  fourth  quarter  2005  and  a  $0.79  million  realized  loss  in  first 
quarter 2005. The primary driver for these realized risk management losses was the high oil prices 
recorded in the quarter relative to the terms of the related risk management contracts in place during 
this period. The unrealized risk management gain for the first quarter of 2006 was $2.49 million 
compared to a $4.89 million gain in the preceding quarter and a $2.26 million loss in first quarter 
2005. These unrealized risk management gains or losses reflect the change over the reporting period 
in the mark-to-market valuation of Zargon’s future contracts as compared to the very volatile futures 
commodity market. Zargon’s commodity risk management positions are fully described in note 9 to 
the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements.
Royalties, inclusive of Alberta Royalty Credit and Saskatchewan Resource Surcharge, totalled $9.02 
million for the first quarter of 2006, a decrease of 22 percent from the preceding quarter and an 
increase of 12 percent from $8.04 million in the first quarter of 2005. The variations generally track 
changes in production, prices and volumes. As a percentage of gross revenue, royalty rates ranged 
from 23.5 percent in first quarter 2005 to 23.1 percent in fourth quarter 2005 and 22.0 percent in 
the first quarter of 2006. The lower royalty rates in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first 
quarter of 2005 and to the fourth quarter of 2005 are a result of adjustments related to prior periods
2006 First Quarter Report
p.7
and are also due to the effect of revenue gains Zargon has achieved in the quarter from fixing a 
portion of its natural gas revenue on the AECO monthly pricing index versus the AECO average 
daily index. Zargon expects that its royalty rate will approximate 23.5 percent in 2006 based on 
current prices and production rates.
On  a  unit  of  production  basis,  production  costs  of  $7.55  per  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  in  the  first 
quarter of 2006 compare with $7.67 in the preceding quarter and $7.74 in the first quarter of 2005. 
The containment of the industry-wide trend to increased unit operating costs continues to be a key 
initiative for Zargon. The lower first quarter 2006 production costs on a unit of production basis are 
primarily  due  to  relatively  fixed  well  operating  costs  being  allocated  to  higher  flush  production 
rates from new wells. As these new wells decline in production over the remainder of the year, a 
small increase of the Trust’s per unit operating costs up to the $8.00 per barrel of oil equivalent level 
is anticipated.

Measured on a unit of production basis (net of recoveries), general and administrative expenses were 
$1.92 per barrel of oil equivalent in first quarter 2006 compared to $2.51 in the preceding quarter 
and  $1.72  in  the  first  quarter  of  2005.  The  upward  cost  pressures  on  general  and  administrative 
expenses on a per unit of production basis are primarily due to increased staff costs and increased 
regulatory reporting costs. The per unit decline from fourth quarter 2005 was primarily due to 2005 
year end performance-based compensation recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Expensing of unit-based compensation in the first quarter of 2006 was $0.32 million, a 31 percent 
increase from the previous quarter reflecting a first quarter 2006 grant of unit rights. In response 
to an emphasis by securities regulators that fair value methodologies be used, new measurement 
techniques  were  developed  in  the  2005  first  quarter.  Transition  in  methodologies  resulted  in  a 
relatively even year-over-year comparison of the quarterly expense, which was $0.33 million in the 
2005 first quarter.
Zargon’s  borrowings  are  through  its  syndicated  bank  credit  facilities.  Interest  and  financing 
charges  on  these  facilities  in  the  first  quarter  were  $0.31  million,  $0.08  million  higher  than  the 
previous quarter amount of $0.23 million and an increase of $0.13 million from $0.18 million in the 
first quarter of 2005. The primary reason for the increase on a year-over-year basis is the increase 
in first quarter 2006 average bank debt. The increase in bank debt resulted from an active first 
quarter capital program and the January 2006 payment of the supplemental cash distribution to 
unitholders declared in December 2005.
Capital and current income taxes decreased $0.21 million to $0.39 million from the fourth quarter 
of 2005 and $0.06 million when compared to the first quarter of 2005. Despite upward pressures on 
taxability on Zargon’s United States operations, Zargon’s consolidated capital and current income 
taxes declined as a result of declining rates and a prior period recovery of Canadian capital taxes in 
the amount of $0.28 million.

Depletion and depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2006 decreased slightly by two percent 
to $10.19 million, compared to $10.36 million in the prior quarter, but increased 16 percent when 
compared to the first quarter of 2005 expense of $8.76 million. On a per barrel of oil equivalent 
basis, the depletion and depreciation rates were $12.85, $13.02 and $11.53 for the first quarter of 
2006 and the fourth and first quarters of 2005, respectively. The primary reasons for the year-over-
year  expense  increase  are  due  to  the  increase  in  the  property  and  equipment  balance  from  the 
conversion of exchangeable shares due to the application of EIC-151, and also as a result of the third 
quarter 2005 production loss at a significant well in the West Central Alberta core area.
The provision for accretion of asset retirement obligations for the first quarter of 2006 was $0.31 
million, relatively unchanged from $0.30 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and five percent 
higher than the first quarter of 2005 expense of $0.29 million. The year-over-year change is due to 
changes in the estimated future liability for asset retirement obligations as a result of wells added 
through Zargon’s drilling program.
The  provision  for  future  taxes  was  $0.21  million  for  the  first  quarter  of  2006  compared  to  a 
provision for future taxes of $0.33 million in the prior quarter and a recovery of $0.32 million in the 
first quarter of 2005. Effectively, Zargon’s future tax obligations are reduced as distributions are 
made from the Trust, and consequently it is anticipated that Zargon’s effective tax rate will continue 
to be low.
According to the January 19, 2005 CICA pronouncement, EIC-151 “Exchangeable Securities Issued 
by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”, Zargon Energy Trust must reflect the exchangeable securities 
issued by its subsidiary (Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd.) as a non-controlling interest. Prior to 2005, these 
exchangeable shares were reflected as a component of unitholders’ equity. Accordingly, the Trust 
has reflected a non-controlling interest of $14.21 million on the Trust’s consolidated balance sheet 
as at March 31, 2006. Consolidated net earnings have been reduced for net earnings attributable to 
the non-controlling interest of $1.91 million in the first three months of 2006. In accordance with 
EIC-151 and given the circumstances in Zargon’s case, each redemption is accounted for as a step-
purchase, which to date in 2006 resulted in an increase in property and equipment of $2.28 million, 
an increase in unitholders’ equity by $2.06 million, and an increase in future income tax liability of 
$0.59 million. Cash flow was not impacted by this change. The cumulative impact to date of the

Cash flow from operations in first quarter 2006 of $22.35 million was $4.27 million, or 16 percent 
lower than the preceding quarter and $4.87 million, or 28 percent higher than the prior year first 
quarter.  The  decline  in  cash  flow  over  the  preceding  quarter  was  primarily  due  to  declining 
commodity pricing and the resulting decrease in revenue. With the prior year quarterly comparison, 
commodity prices received on a barrel of oil equivalent basis were 15 percent higher and production 
volumes  were  four  percent  higher.  Cash  flow  on  a  per  diluted  unit  basis  was  $1.17  for  the  first 
quarter of 2006, a 16 percent decrease from the prior quarter and a 26 percent increase from the 
first quarter of 2005 which tracks the changes in cash flow for the respective periods.

Net earnings of $11.92 million for the first quarter of 2006 were 32 percent below $17.45 million in 
the preceding quarter and 132 percent above $5.14 million in first quarter 2005. The net earnings 
track the cash flow from operations for the respective periods modified by non-cash charges which 
in the 2006 period include depletion and depreciation, unrealized risk management gains, future 
income taxes and non-controlling interest.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net capital expenditures of $15.19 million were 21 percent lower than the $19.12 million expended 
in  the  prior  year  fourth  quarter  which  tends  to  be  a  very  active  quarter  due  to  the  fall  drilling 
program.  Net  capital  expenditures  for  the  first  three  months  of  2006  were  allocated  to  Alberta 
Plains $4.26 million, West Central Alberta $6.68 million and Williston Basin $4.25 million. Field 
related drilling, completion and facility expenses of $12.98 million were 55 percent higher than the 
prior year’s first quarter field related capital program. During the first quarter of 2006, 13.2 net 
wells were drilled compared to 15.3 net wells in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 11.7 net wells in the 
first quarter of 2005. Cash flow from operations in the 2006 first quarter of $22.35 million, proceeds 
from the exercise of trust unit rights of $1.01 million and the increase in bank debt of $16.30 million 
funded  the  capital  program,  the  changes  in  working  capital  and  the  cash  distributions  to  the 
unitholders.  At  March  31,  2006,  the  Trust  continues  to  maintain  a  strong  balance  sheet  with  a 
combined debt net of working capital (excluding unrealized risk management assets and liabilities) 
of  $28.39  million,  which  represents  slightly  less  than  four  months  of  the  first  quarter  2006 
annualized cash flow.

OUTLOOK
With a very strong balance sheet, 368 thousand net acres of undeveloped land and a promising 
project  inventory,  Zargon  continues  to  be  well  positioned  to  meet  its  objectives  as  a  sustainable 
trust. For 2006, Zargon is forecasting an average production rate of 8,600 barrels of oil equivalent 
per day. Although Zargon and its industry continue to enjoy a period of high commodity prices, 
Zargon intends to continue with the disciplined approach that has served the Trust well to date. The 
Trust  will  adhere  to  a  focused  strategy  of  exploring  and  exploiting  our  existing  asset  base  while 
executing value-added property acquisitions, which if available, would be funded by bank debt or 
equity issues.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 (unaudited)
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Zargon  have  been  prepared  by 
management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. The interim 
unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  following  the  same  accounting 
policies and methods in computation as the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 
ended  December  31,  2005.  These  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  do  not 
include  all  disclosures  required  in  the  annual  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  interim 
unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated 
financial statements and notes thereto in the Zargon Energy Trust annual report for the year ended 
December 31, 2005.
The Trust’s principal business activity is the exploration for and development and production of 
petroleum and natural gas in Canada and the United States (“US”).
2.  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST – EXCHANGEABLE SHARES
Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd. is authorized to issue a maximum of 3.66 million exchangeable shares. The 
exchangeable shares are convertible into trust units at the option of the shareholder based on the 
exchange ratio, which is adjusted monthly to reflect the distribution paid on the trust units. Cash 
distributions are not paid on the exchangeable shares. During the three months ended March 31, 
2006, a total of 0.06 million exchangeable shares were converted into 0.07 million trust units based 
on the exchange ratio at the time of conversion. At March 31, 2006, the exchange ratio was 1.13319 
trust units per exchangeable share.

Per EIC-151 “Exchangeable Securities Issued by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”, if certain conditions 
are met, the exchangeable shares issued by a subsidiary must be reflected as non-controlling interest 
on the consolidated balance sheet and in turn, net earnings must be reduced by the amount of net 
earnings attributed to the non-controlling interest.
The  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  consists  of  the  book  value  of 
exchangeable shares at the time of the Plan of Arrangement, plus net earnings attributable to the 
exchangeable shareholders, less exchangeable shares (and related cumulative earnings) redeemed. 
The  net  earnings  attributable  to  the  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  statement  of 
earnings represents the cumulative share of net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest 
based on the trust units issuable for exchangeable shares in proportion to total trust units issued 
and issuable each period end.

The proforma total units outstanding at March 31, 2006, including trust units outstanding, and 
trust units issuable upon conversion of exchangeable shares and after giving effect to the exchange 
ratio at the end of the period (see note 2) is 19.132 million units.

The Trust has a unit rights incentive plan (the “Plan”) that allows the Trust to issue rights to acquire 
trust units to directors, officers, employees and service providers. The Trust is authorized to issue 
up  to  1.82  million  unit  rights,  however,  the  number  of  trust  units  reserved  for  issuance  upon 
exercise of the rights shall not at any time exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of issued and 
outstanding trust units of the Trust. At the time of grant, unit right exercise prices approximate the 
market price for the trust units. At the time of exercise, the rights holder has the option of exercising 
at the original grant price or the exercise price as calculated per the Arrangement. Rights granted 
under the Plan generally vest over a three-year period and expire approximately five years from the 
grant date. Zargon uses a fair value methodology to value the unit rights grants.
The  assumptions  made  for  unit  rights  granted  for  2006  include  a  volatility  factor  of  expected 
market price of 27.8 percent, a weighted average risk-free interest rate of 3.91 percent, a dividend 
yield of 7.22 percent and a weighted average expected life of the unit rights of four years, resulting 
in unit-based compensation expense of $0.32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006.
Compensation  expense  associated  with  rights  granted  under  the  Plan  is  recognized  in  earnings 
over  the  vesting  period  of  the  Plan  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  contributed  surplus.  The 
exercise of trust unit rights is recorded as an increase in trust units with a corresponding reduction 
in contributed surplus. Forfeiture of rights are recorded as a reduction in expense in the period in 
which they occur.

6.  WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF TOTAL UNITS
Basic per unit amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of trust units outstanding 
during  the  period.  Diluted  per  unit  amounts  are  calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method  to 
determine the dilutive effect of unit-based compensation. Diluted per unit amounts also include 
exchangeable shares using the “if-converted” method.

Financial risk management contracts in place as at December 31, 2004 were designated as hedges 
for accounting purposes and the Trust continues to monitor these contracts in determining the 
continuation of hedge effectiveness. For these contracts, realized gains and losses are recorded in 
the statement of earnings as the contracts settle and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized. The 
realized  losses  for  the  first  three  months  of  2006  were  $1.36  million  (2005  –  $0.79  million).  At 
March 31, 2006, an additional $0.41 million would have been required to settle the above designated 
hedge contracts. Contracts settled by way of physical delivery are recognized as part of the normal 
revenue  stream.  These  instruments  have  no  book  values  recorded  in  the  interim  consolidated 
financial statements.
For financial risk management contracts entered into after December 31, 2004, the Trust considers 
these contracts to be effective on an economic basis but has decided not to designate these contracts 
as  hedges  for  accounting  purposes  and  accordingly,  for  outstanding  contracts  not  designated  as 
hedges,  an  unrealized  gain  or  loss  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  (mark-to-market)  of  the 
contracts  at  the  period  end.  The  unrealized  gain  for  the  first  three  months  of  2006  was  $2.49 
million and the unrealized loss for the first three months of 2005 was $2.26 million.
10.  ACCUMUL ATED CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
During the three month period, the Trust paid or declared distributions to the unitholders in the 
aggregate  amount  of  $8.89  million  (2005  –  $6.60  million)  in  accordance  with  the  following 
schedule:
