<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
against Women is a multilateral grant-making mechanism established in 1996 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50/166. It is administered by the United 
Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) 
on behalf of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>2. The Trust Fund reinforces the efforts of UN-Women to prevent and end 
violence against women and girls, while UN-Women provides the Trust Fund with a 
strong institutional foundation. Working in synergy with UN-Women and with other 
members of its Programme Advisory Committee, at the global level, and of the 
subregional inter-agency programme advisory committees, at the subregional level,1 
the role of the Trust Fund in accelerating all efforts to eliminate violence against 
women and girls is vital. 
</p>
<p>3. The Trust Fund supports local, national, regional and cross-regional programmes 
to prevent and respond to all forms of violence against women and girls in all 
contexts. It provides funding for proven, innovative and catalytic multi-year 
programmes implemented by civil society organizations, national and local 
Governments and United Nations country teams. To date, the Trust Fund has 
awarded $95 million to 368 initiatives in 132 countries and territories. It currently 
supports 78 active initiatives in 71 countries and territories, with grants totalling 
$56.8 million. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report, prepared for the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on 
the Status of Women and the twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council, 
describes the impact and achievements of the Trust Fund in 2013. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>5. Grave manifestations of violence against women and girls attracted intense 
international attention in 2013, as did the courageous responses to them. Civilians 
and human rights defenders living and working in conflict settings continued to be 
the targets of gender-based violence. High-profile incidents of violence, widely 
covered in the media, generated public debate, sparked demonstrations and 
bolstered global activism. Women and girls made their message of non-violence

<p> 1 In 2013, members of the Programme Advisory Committee, at the global level, and of the 
subregional inter-agency programme advisory committees, at the subregional level, included: 
the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the International 
Labour Organization (ILO), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 
(UN-Women), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the World 
Bank. Leading civil society organizations, intergovernmental organizations and other experts at 
the global and field levels, including representatives from the Centre for Women&#8217;s Global 
Leadership, Equality Now, the Open Society Institute and the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), were also actively involved in the grant-making process. </p>

<p>clearly heard, affirming that freedom from violence is not optional, but an 
inalienable human right. 
</p>
<p>6. Despite the increasing global focus on violence against women and girls, the 
right to live a life free of violence continues to be systematically violated in public 
and in private, in times of war and of peace, and in all societies. The most recent 
global estimates on the prevalence of intimate partner violence and non-partner 
sexual violence suggest that one in three women worldwide will experience either 
physical violence by a partner or sexual violence by a non-partner in her lifetime.2 
Globally, as many as 7 per cent of women reported ever having been sexually 
assaulted by a non-partner in their lifetime.3 
</p>
<p>7. The international legal framework that obliges States to address violence 
against women and girls continued to develop during the year. Security Council 
resolutions 2106 (2013) and 2122 (2013) strengthen the operationalization of 
previous resolutions on sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations and 
on the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflict. Furthermore, 
135 Member States have endorsed the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual 
Violence in Conflict (see A/68/633, annex). In addition, Member States made an 
important and welcome commitment to eradicate such widespread violations of 
human rights when, in March 2013, the Commission on the Status of Women, at 
its fifty-seventh session, adopted the agreed conclusions on the elimination 
and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (see 
E/CN.6/2013/11-E/2013/27, chap. I. A.). The agreed conclusions adopt a 
comprehensive approach in addressing violence against women and girls and place a 
special focus on prevention and on responses to survivors. 
</p>
<p>8. Eradicating violence against women and girls requires sustained social and 
political will and engagement, increased financial resources, effective legal and 
policy responses and comprehensive interventions. The present report details the 
contributions of the Trust Fund to achieving an impact in three specific areas: 
preventing violence against women and girls, expanding access to justice and 
support services for survivors of violence and expediting the implementation of 
laws and policies aimed at ending violence against women and girls. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> III. Translating promise into practice

</p>
<p>9. The Trust Fund draws on more than 17 years of experience in its work to 
ensure that women and girls enjoy the right to live a life free of violence, exclusion

<p>and discrimination. It supports effective responses to violence against women and 
girls around the globe by allocating resources where they are most needed and 
where they stand to have the most impact on the lives of women and girls. 
</p>
<p>10. The programmes supported by the Trust Fund have shown the potential for real 
and sustainable impact. The Fund&#8217;s grantees demonstrate that violence against 
women and girls can be prevented by mobilizing communities. They show that 
access to justice and services can be enhanced even in challenging contexts, such as 
during and after conflict. They highlight how public institutions can be reformed 
and refocused to become more responsive to the specific needs of women and girls. 
The following examples illustrate the impact of the programmes supported by the 
Trust Fund in furthering progress in such areas. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Preventing violence against women and girls by mobilizing communities 
</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Social norms, attitudes and behaviours take shape, in part, at the community 
level. Approaches that mobilize communities are proven, effective strategies for 
preventing violence against women and girls.4 They involve multi-tiered 
interventions that engage women and girls, men and boys, traditional and religious 
authorities, local Governments and service providers. They challenge power 
relations based on gender and other markers of social identity by creating spaces for 
critical reflection, dialogue and engagement. 
</p>
<p>12. Currently, 30 per cent of Trust Fund grantees are working to mobilize 
communities and to bolster their capacities to respond to violence against women 
and girls. The Trust Fund is scaling up and replicating two successful community 
mobilization approaches in seven countries in Africa (Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania). 
</p>
<p>13. In a survey conducted by the Coalition of Women Living with HIV/AIDS in 
six Malawian districts, 41 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS reported 
incidents of sexual violence over the previous 12-month period. Among women who 
reported sexual violence, 25 per cent stated that they had been coerced by their 
partners into having unprotected sex.5 
</p>
<p>14. The work of the Coalition, which is a grass-roots women&#8217;s organization, is 
providing tangible evidence of the effectiveness of the &#8220;Stepping Stones&#8221; training and 
communication methodology in preventing intimate partner violence against women 
living with HIV/AIDS in Malawi. The Coalition&#8217;s programme to increase knowledge 
about gender-based violence, promote HIV/AIDS risk awareness and enhance 
communication skills reached 3,000 women living with HIV/AIDS, 311 survivors of 
intimate partner violence and more than 12,000 men and 28,000 women in 144 
communities between 2012 and 2013. Each community has established a full-time 
facilitator team comprised of a couple previously trained in the &#8220;Stepping Stones&#8221;

<p>methodology. The team leads a series of workshops in which participants question 
harmful constructs of masculinity and femininity and build positive alternatives. 
</p>
<p>15. The Coalition has detailed, in its second annual report to the Trust Fund, how 
the programme has decreased stigma, increased the use of condoms and reduced the 
number of men with concurrent sexual partners, all of which lessen the risk of 
contracting and spreading HIV/AIDS. Women report an increased ability to 
negotiate sexual practices, while couples report more fluid communication and a 
decrease in the use of physical and emotional violence as a means to settle conflict. 
In addition, village chiefs have banned harmful practices such as &#8220;sexual 
cleansing&#8221;.6 These results demonstrate that, when owned by communities, sustained 
activities decrease the social acceptability of violence against women and of 
discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>16. The Uganda-based civil society organizations Raising Voices and the Centre 
for Domestic Violence Prevention used community-led activism and mobilization to 
help bring about changes in behaviour and attitudes towards violence against 
women and girls. Support from the Trust Fund allowed the successful SASA! 
methodology, designed by Raising Voices, to be scaled up. This community-focused 
violence and HIV prevention programme challenges power imbalances between men 
and women through a series of sustained activities that support community members 
through different stages of behaviour change, from awareness of the issue, to 
support for women and men in creating change, to action against violence. For three 
years, the programme, which was recently the subject of an external evaluation in 
terms of its processes, provided technical assistance and mentored 13 grass-roots 
organizations in Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the United 
Republic of Tanzania. In feedback provided as part of the evaluation, participating 
organizations reported that the partnership gave them vital tools to continue rolling 
out the methodology in their communities. Grass-roots activists, women and men, 
also acknowledged that their own attitudes and behaviours towards gender-based 
violence and HIV/AIDS were positively transformed. 
</p>
<p>17. A separate evaluation of the impact of the SASA! programme was conducted 
by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and included a randomized 
controlled trial in four intervention sites and four control sites in Uganda, which 
showed the impact of the initiatives over a period of 2.8 years. In communities 
where the programme had been implemented (intervention sites), 76 per cent of 
women and men believe that physical violence against a partner is not acceptable; 
the corresponding figure in the control communities is 26 per cent. In addition, 
28 per cent more women and men in participating communities than in control 
communities consider that it is acceptable for a woman to refuse sex. Levels of 
physical partner violence against women are 52 per cent lower in intervention sites 
than in control communities. Finally, 27 per cent of men in participating 
communities reported having multiple concurrent sexual partners; the corresponding 
figure in the control communities is 45 per cent. These figures suggest that 
supporting systematic and sustained interventions can help to significantly reduce 
the social acceptability of intimate partner violence, the levels of physical violence 
and the prevalence of concurrent sexual partners among men.

<p>18. In Latin America, community participatory approaches in indigenous 
communities supported by the Trust Fund resulted in increased empowerment, 
educational motivation and performance among girls. In Guatemala, a girl-centred 
community-based programme by the non-governmental organization Population 
Council used the &#8220;safescaping&#8221; approach, which entails a process to build safe 
spaces and protective assets for girls who face exclusion and discrimination, in 
order to engage 1,300 Mayan girls aged between 8 and 17. The safescaping strategy 
tapped into the social and cultural reality of Mayan girls, who leave the formal 
education system very early.7 The Population Council established girls-only clubs in 
12 communities, where girls were trained by young mentors to become community 
leaders and agents of social change. 
</p>
<p>19. The programme&#8217;s final external evaluation found that the motivation and 
performance of girls was higher in spaces that integrated awareness-raising lectures, 
economic livelihood activities, such as handcrafts techniques, and sports. Girls who 
attended regularly reported a stronger sense of autonomy and empowerment, 
increased knowledge about their rights and greater self-esteem. The opportunity to 
have a close circle of friends also emerged as an important protective asset. The 
programme had an impact beyond the safe spaces, with mothers reporting girls&#8217; 
improved communication within the family and increased awareness about 
their human rights. Girls also reported sharing their knowledge and skills with 
younger siblings.8 
</p>
<p>20. The Trust Fund is gathering valuable lessons on what is effective in preventing 
violence against women and girls. Community mobilization approaches 
acknowledge the relationship between individual and collective rights, highlight the 
relevance and impact of community participation in transforming behaviour and 
practices and underline the importance of revitalizing positive traditions and 
customs that promote the rights of women and girls.9 These initiatives focus on 
power imbalances between women and men and address the resulting human rights 
violations without resorting to blaming or shaming. They recognize the importance 
of contextualizing and adapting activities to different settings and contexts so that 
communities are inspired to participate and programmes can be sustained. Lastly, 
these prevention strategies recognize that eliminating violence against women and 
girls requires harnessing the support of a critical mass of people and organizations 
that can issue a strong call for zero tolerance.

<p>institutional barriers often prevent them from exercising their human rights.10 The 
pursuit of justice and of psychosocial, health-care and legal services is even more 
challenging in conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings. Weakened social and 
community bonds, the inability to enforce legal sanctions and the erosion of 
response mechanisms in such contexts frequently result in entrenched impunity for 
gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>22. Research on and documentation of the scale and impact of gender-based 
violence during conflict are growing.11 Some research suggests that sexual violence 
affects between 4.3 per cent and 22 per cent of women in conflict situations. Other 
studies suggest that between one in four and one in three women experience sexual 
violence in conflict settings.12 
</p>
<p>23. Currently, 15 per cent of Trust Fund grantees are implementing programmes 
that address violence in conflict-related contexts. In 2012, the Trust Fund 
established a three-year thematic window on violence against women in conflict, 
post-conflict and transitional contexts. By 2015, this will generate much-needed 
knowledge on preventing and responding to violence against women and girls in 
these settings. 
</p>
<p>24. The non-governmental organization Physicians for Human Rights is leveraging 
support from the Trust Fund to overcome obstacles in reporting and documenting 
conflict-related sexual violence and to improve survivors&#8217; access to services. 
</p>
<p>25. A critical challenge in addressing systematic sexual violence in conflict zones 
is the difficulty in prosecuting crimes and providing redress. Lawyers, police and 
health professionals often lack the requisite skills and experience, medical 
examinations are rarely conducted, medical charts fail to document findings and 
there is limited awareness of the roles and responsibilities of public officials. In order 
to address these obstacles, Physicians for Human Rights is building medico-legal 
networks in five African countries: the Central African Republic, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda. The programme is improving 
data collection and the documentation of the forensic evidence required for criminal 
investigations by offering specialized forensic training and by strengthening the 
communication channels and coordination pathways between health, law enforcement 
and legal officials. 
</p>
<p>26. The organization has established two medico-legal networks of 340 
professionals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Kenya. Network 
participants report improved communication and coordination across sectors, greater 
knowledge and awareness of the evidence required to strengthen legal cases and 
increased skills in documenting, collecting and preserving forensic evidence of 
sexual violence. Health-care and legal service providers are addressing the specific 
needs of survivors in order to mitigate the risk of further traumatization, creating an 
environment in which survivors can safely tell their story.

<p>27. A mobile phone application, MediCapt, that securely documents, photographs 
and transmits forensic evidence of sexual violence to the police, hospitals and the 
courts is being piloted by the organization (see also para. 51). Officials from the 
medico-legal networks will be trained in the use of the application, which features a 
specialized medical uptake form for incidents of sexual violence against men and 
women, data mapping and cloud data storage. By harnessing the power of technology 
to document violence, the programme will also facilitate early warning and rapid 
response systems and assist in investigating and prosecuting sexual violence. 
Ultimately, the programme expects to strengthen accountability for such crimes. 
</p>
<p>28. Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice is another organization that is working 
to enhance the capacity of civil society to document sexual violence in conflict and 
post-conflict contexts and to support domestic and international accountability 
processes. The programme, which is being implemented in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, Libya, the Sudan and Uganda, aims to increase women&#8217;s participation 
in transitional justice mechanisms and to ensure that women&#8217;s needs and 
perspectives are integrated into peace processes. In the eastern provinces of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the organization is strengthening the capacities 
of women&#8217;s rights advocates to document sexual violence. In 2013 alone, the 
programme documented more than 300 incidents of sexual violence. The 
information gathered is being used in the prosecution of crimes of sexual and 
gender-based violence and the organization is advocating its use by the International 
Criminal Court to support its ongoing investigations. 
</p>
<p>29. Prosecution is one aspect of achieving justice in conflict, post-conflict and 
transitional contexts. Institutional reform and non-judicial processes and mechanisms, 
including material and symbolic reparations, are also needed. In Cambodia, the 
Trust Fund is supporting the Victims Support Section of the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia in its efforts to address gender-based violence 
during the Khmer Rouge era. Through dialogue and the sharing and dissemination 
of survivors&#8217; testimonies, the Victims Support Section is helping to raise awareness 
in communities and encouraging acknowledgement of the extent and impact of 
gender-based violence under the Khmer Rouge. 
</p>
<p>30. An unknown number of women were subjected to gender-based violence, 
including forced marriages, between 1975 and 1979. In order to document those 
crimes, in 2013 the Victims Support Section created the first online information 
platform on gender-based violence under the Khmer Rouge.13 The platform 
disseminates research and data gathered by the Victims Support Section and its 
partners and has become a valuable resource for the Government of Cambodia, 
researchers and civil society groups worldwide. 
</p>
<p>31. The Victims Support Section is also fostering dialogue on gender-based crimes 
through a series of six national radio programmes, community forums, support 
groups and interactive theatre. Through these initiatives, many communities are 
learning for the first time about the lasting impact of gender-based violence under 
the Khmer Rouge. 
</p>
<p>32. In 2011 and 2012, in partnership with national and international human rights 
organizations, the Victims Support Section co-sponsored two regional women&#8217;s 
hearings in which survivors from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal and Timor-Leste

<p>shared their experiences.14 Women&#8217;s hearings are a non-judicial space for  
truth-telling and memorializing in which survivors testify publicly and collectively 
advocate for justice. They provide survivors with symbolic redress and establish a 
historical record that aids investigations and potential prosecutions. The third 
women&#8217;s hearing took place in September 2013. It centred on the Cambodian 
experience and on raising awareness among the post-Khmer Rouge generation.15 
The hearing was attended by more than 400 students who listened to the testimony 
of four women survivors. A panel of university students recommended the inclusion 
of forced marriage as a gender-based crime in the indictment in cases under 
investigation by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.16 
</p>
<p>33. State-building processes are an opportunity to integrate gender equality 
measures into Government structures. In South Sudan, the American Refugee 
Committee, in partnership with civil society organizations, international  
non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies, community-based actors 
and Government ministries, is coordinating four state-level working groups on 
gender-based violence to promote the professionalization and availability of  
health-care and legal services. This Trust Fund grantee is also testing and 
operationalizing standard operating procedures for responding to gender-based 
violence.17 
</p>
<p>34. The Committee is establishing referral pathways for access to services, 
training medical officials to deal appropriately with medical intake forms and 
training midwives to provide psychosocial support to survivors. More than 42,000 
people have benefited from programme activities and 287 survivors of gender-based 
violence have received comprehensive services. In two of the four states where the 
programme has been rolled out, an average of 80 per cent of cases of gender-based 
violence referred to medical and legal services are supported by community 
volunteers trained by the Committee, demonstrating community buy-in and the 
potential for sustainability. 
</p>
<p>35. Establishing a network of comprehensive services is also the goal of a 
programme implemented by the International Medical Corps in Iraq. The 
organization is working with social workers, lawyers and medical staff from the 
Ministry of Health. It helped broker a gender-based violence referral pathway 
system that provides survivors of gender-based violence with integrated services, 
including counselling, psychosocial support, legal assistance and medical care, at 
primary health-care centres. Social workers trained by the organization supported 
more than 5,000 women and girls. A survey among public officials trained by the 
organization indicates that, as a result of the programme, the number of cases 
referred by social workers to lawyers increased by 54 per cent and that the number 
of cases referred by social workers to primary health-care centres increased by 
62 per cent.18 The response of survivors to the programme is also favourable. A

<p>patient exit survey revealed that 98 per cent of survivors felt strongly satisfied or 
satisfied with the support services they received and that 95 per cent reported that 
their lives are much better or better as a result of the attention provided by primary 
health-care centres, civil society organizations and legal officers trained by 
the organization. 
</p>
<p>36. The Trust Fund has found that a comprehensive approach to justice that 
addresses survivors&#8217; psychosocial and health needs as well as their legal requirements 
is vital in addressing conflict-related gender-based violence. This requires effective 
coordination between Government officials from different sectors so that at every 
stage, from referral to evidence documentation and from prosecution to redress, they 
approach cases in an appropriate and professional manner that fully respects the 
human rights of survivors. Clear official guidelines on handling gender-based 
violence must be established and adhered to. Finally, justice goes beyond prosecution; 
full accountability for violence against women and girls in post-conflict and 
transitional settings also warrants the establishment of judicial and non-judicial 
remedies and assurances of non-repetition. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Expediting the implementation of laws and policies to end violence against 
women and girls 
</b> 
</p>
<p>37. States have the primary responsibility for preventing, protecting, prosecuting, 
investigating, punishing and providing redress for violence against women and girls.19 
Civil society groups play a key role in advocating for the adoption or reform of laws 
and policies and in strengthening the capacity of State institutions to respond to 
violence against women and girls. Legislation that criminalizes gender-based 
violence not only places the issue on the public agenda, but also sends a message to 
the wider society that it will not be tolerated. Campaigns for law reform are of 
strategic importance and also strengthen networking and coordination among civil 
society groups and their allies in public institutions.20 Once laws and policies are in 
place, clear guidelines and protocols that are in line with international standards 
must be adopted to guide the practices of health-care, legal and other officials. 
</p>
<p>38. The Trust Fund is supporting initiatives that expedite the adoption and 
implementation of laws to prevent and address violence against women. Currently, 
32 per cent of Trust Fund grantees are promoting legal and policy adoption or 
reform.  
</p>
<p>39. In Mexico, the grantee Cat&#243;licas por el Derecho a Decidir (Catholics for the 
Right to Free Choice), in partnership with the Observatorio Ciudadano Nacional del 
Feminicidio (the National Citizens&#8217; Observatory on Femicide), is documenting 
gender-related killings21 and promoting the adoption and implementation of 
protocols to investigate such crimes.  
</p>
<p>40. The Federal Criminal Code and most states&#8217; criminal codes in Mexico include 
femicide as a distinct, gender-based crime. In 2013, in order to operationalize these

<p>laws, Catholics for the Right to Free Choice, in partnership with state-level women&#8217;s 
machineries and state attorneys&#8217; offices, established criminal investigation protocols 
for documenting gender-motivated killings in two states, Oaxaca and Colima. The 
protocols include technical guidelines and standardized judicial criteria for the 
investigation of such crimes. Oaxaca&#8217;s protocol also includes provisions that take 
into account the state&#8217;s pluralistic legal system and facilitate implementation in 
indigenous communities. The protocols provide for a multi-stakeholder monitoring 
and evaluation committee to guarantee State accountability (see also A/HRC/20/16, 
para. 112, on the relevance of protocols). 
</p>
<p>41. Increasing accountability for violence against women is also the focus of the 
Women&#8217;s Rights Initiative of the Lawyers Collective in India, a Trust Fund grantee. 
The organization designed an accountability tool, recognized as best practice, for 
monitoring the implementation of India&#8217;s Protection of Women from Domestic 
Violence Act of 2005. The Collective publishes the monitoring and evaluation report 
&#8220;Staying Alive&#8221;, which collects information to measure progress and challenges in 
the law&#8217;s implementation. The reports provide a detailed analysis of existing 
infrastructure and budgets, the pre-litigation, litigation and enforcement stages and 
court orders and judgements. They also analyse the increase in the number of 
protection orders being issued and estimate the budgetary allocation needed to fully 
implement the law.22 
</p>
<p>42. As a result of the organization&#8217;s advocacy, two national institutions, the 
Ministry of Women and Child Development and the National Mission for 
Empowerment of Women, have committed to undertake annual monitoring of the 
law. In order to facilitate such monitoring, the Collective published a manual on 
monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Protection of Women from 
Domestic Violence Act, as well as a manual on best practice relating to the 
implementation of the Act. The manual will be adapted to monitor new laws relating 
to sexual harassment, dowry practices and sexual assault. The process undertaken by 
the Collective is also an example of cross-fertilization, as women&#8217;s groups in 
Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are using the methodology to expedite 
the implementation of laws in their countries.  
</p>
<p>43. Strengthening the capacities to monitor the implementation of laws and 
policies is also the main strategy of the Provincial Secretariat for Economy, 
Employment and Gender Equality of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, 
Serbia. The Provincial Secretariat, a Trust Fund grantee, supported the 
implementation of a strategy for protection against domestic violence and other 
forms of gender-based violence. It designed and piloted a web-based database to 
register cases of domestic violence and to facilitate case monitoring that improved 
multisectoral information exchange and the institutional response to violence. As a 
result of the programme&#8217;s success, a new grantee, the United Nations country team 
in Serbia, is rolling out this system in other provinces of the country.  
</p>
<p>44. In addition to India, Mexico, Serbia and South Sudan, four other past and 
current Trust Fund grantees contributed substantially to the establishment and 
operationalization of laws and protocols to address violence against women and 
girls in 2013. In Cambodia, the Acid Survivors Trust International, a former grantee, 
and its partner, the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity, played a central role in

<p>developing and ensuring the enactment of the 2012 Acid Attack Law. As a result, in 
early 2013, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court handed down the first conviction for 
an acid attack. In the Pacific island of Tonga, advocacy and technical assistance by 
the Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, a 
former grantee, laid the foundation for the enactment in 2013 of the Family 
Protection Bill, the first domestic violence legislation in the country. In Grenada, the 
Ministry of Social Development, Housing and Community Development is 
finalizing the first standard operating procedures for the health-care sector for the 
care, management and treatment of survivors of gender-based violence. In Sierra 
Leone, the International Rescue Committee provided technical assistance to the 
Government in drafting a more effective version of the standard operating 
procedures for handling sexual and domestic offences. The revised version, 
endorsed in June 2013 by the Sierra Leone Police, was prepared by the police and 
by the judiciary and will facilitate the implementation of the 2012 laws relating to 
gender justice. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Generating knowledge and developing capacities 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>45. Through capacity-building initiatives and the evaluation of its programmes, 
the Trust Fund promotes the development of innovative, promising and sustainable 
practices to prevent and end violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>46. In 2013, the Trust Fund continued to support global learning initiatives 
through its thematic windows. The thematic windows focus on addressing the 
intersection of HIV/AIDS and violence against women and on addressing violence 
against women in conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings. In 2013, the Trust 
Fund established a new thematic window on addressing violence against adolescent 
and young girls.  
</p>
<p>47. The thematic windows are particularly useful for generating knowledge and 
stimulating action in strategic programme areas. In this context, in June 2013 the 
Trust Fund and the multi-country office of UN-Women in South Africa organized a 
learning workshop to deepen the knowledge and strengthen the capacity of grantees 
addressing the intersection of HIV/AIDS and violence against women. The 
three-day event brought together 15 grantees from seven programmes working in 
Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe to share promising practices and lessons learned, to 
measure progress towards the common outcomes and to strengthen coordination. 
Building on the first learning workshop held at the start of these programmes in 
2011, the second workshop bridged knowledge gaps and improved the evidence 
base on how violence and HIV/AIDS interact in the lives of women and how these 
two interrelated issues can be effectively and holistically addressed. 
</p>
<p>48. The Trust Fund also convened a learning and sharing workshop in April 2013 
for four grantees working to address violence against women in conflict, 
post-conflict and transitional settings. As grantees shared their experiences, a set of 
synergies related to advocacy, research, knowledge generation and common 
indicators emerged. The thematic window will generate information on 
mainstreaming gender in transitional contexts and on documenting gender-based 
violence in conflict and post-conflict settings.  
</p>
<p>49. The Trust Fund organized its tenth five-day capacity development workshop in 
New York in April and May 2013. The workshops are organized for each new cycle </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2014/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>13/16 </b>13-61736 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>of grantees to increase their capacity to monitor, evaluate, report and disseminate 
results and lessons learned and to assist new grantees in developing their monitoring 
and evaluation plans. 
</p>
<p>50. In 2012 and 2013, applicants and grantees utilized the online grant 
management system developed by the Trust Fund to monitor its grant portfolio. The 
second phase of the system is operational and the full version will be rolled out in 
the first half of 2014. The system is a tool that allows the Trust Fund to manage and 
monitor its grants more effectively, to identify issues and trends in programming and 
to provide timely support to its grantees. The system will aggregate data on the 
number of grants per country or region, the anticipated primary beneficiaries and 
those actually reached, the forms of violence addressed by country or region and 
financial data on strategic areas of intervention.  
</p>
<p>51. Trust Fund grantees are increasingly being recognized for their knowledge, 
experience and impact. Physicians for Human Rights was awarded first prize in the 
2013 United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-Humanity 
United Tech Challenge for Atrocity Prevention in the &#8220;Capture&#8221; category (see also 
para. 27). The Karnataka Health Promotion Trust in India received the 2013 World 
Health Organization Award for Excellence in Primary Health Care in the category 
&#8220;Innovations for improving access and ensuring continuity of care&#8221;. It was also 
recognized by India&#8217;s National Legal Services Authority for the development of best 
practice and contributions to strengthening access to services for marginalized 
communities. In Zimbabwe, the African regional organization SAfAIDS was 
awarded the 2013 National Non-Governmental Organization Award for Excellence 
in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Equal Access Nepal received the 2013 Avon 
Communications Award: Speaking Out about Violence against Women in the 
category of Community Change. This demonstrates that the Trust Fund is supporting 
organizations that are at the forefront of their fields.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> V. Partnerships 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>52. The Trust Fund enjoys the partnership of many stakeholders, including 
Governments, the private sector, non-profit organizations and concerned individuals 
from around the world. The financial contribution and political support of its 
partners are essential to the Trust Fund&#8217;s efforts to end violence against women and 
girls.  
</p>
<p>53. As of December 2013, Australia, Austria, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands and South Africa had made 
generous contributions to the Trust Fund. Zonta International, the Saban Foundation 
and the United Nations Federal Credit Union continued to support Trust Fund 
initiatives. The work of the Trust Fund was also funded by national committees of 
UN-Women from Austria, Germany, Iceland, Japan and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p>54. In 2013, the Trust Fund organized a number of events in order to raise its 
visibility, build new partnerships and expand its outreach to the corporate sector. In 
partnership with the Government of Japan, the Trust Fund hosted an event to 
highlight the achievements of programmes implemented by two Trust Fund 
grantees, The Population Council and Physicians for Human Rights, that harness 
technology to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. More than </p>

<p>80 representatives of Member States and the Japanese private sector attended the 
event, which was chaired by the Deputy Permanent Representative of Japan to the 
United Nations, Kazuyoshi Umemoto, and the Deputy Secretary-General.  
</p>
<p>55. On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the 
Trust Fund hosted a reception for the representatives of the permanent missions to 
the United Nations, public figures and the private sector to launch its 2014 
fundraising drive with the message &#8220;They count on us, we count on you&#8221;. The 
reception also honoured change-makers in the field of ending violence against 
women and girls. 
</p>
<p>56. In commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence, the 
Ambassador of the Netherlands to the United States, Rudolf Simon Bekink, hosted a 
concert and a private reception in support of the Trust Fund. The event launched the 
&#8220;Scheherazade Initiative: celebrating the resilience of women and girls in the face of 
violence&#8221;, a new partnership between the Trust Fund and Music for Life 
International, that will result in a series of concerts to connect audiences to classical 
music and to highlight the extraordinary resilience of women and girls in the face of 
violence.23 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Grant-making cycle 2013 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Trust Fund&#8217;s annual call for proposals, which is available in six languages, 
accepts multi-year grant applications for up to $1 million in English, French and 
Spanish. In line with its strategy, the Trust Fund selects proposals that pave the way 
for concrete national change. Priority is given to applications that offer novel 
approaches, opportunities for expansion, replication and sustainability, and that 
reach a large number of beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>58. Subregional inter-agency programme advisory committees ensure that grants 
respond to regional and national challenges and priorities, while the global 
Programme Advisory Committee, composed of members of civil society and the 
United Nations system, advises the Trust Fund secretariat on strategic priorities and 
on potential synergies among selected applications. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2013, the Trust Fund received 2,410 applications from 145 countries, with 
total funding requests of over $1.1 billion. The majority of applications were from 
civil society organizations. The Fund awarded $8 million in 17 grants, covering 
18 countries and territories. 16 civil society organizations and the Government of 
Antigua and Barbuda received grants that are expected to reach 2.3 million 
beneficiaries by 2017. In terms of grant value, 48 per cent of the funds allocated 
went to programmes in Asia and the Pacific; 15 per cent to programmes in Latin 
America and the Caribbean; 12 per cent to Africa; 11 per cent to Europe and Central 
Asia; 9 per cent to cross-regional programmes; and 5 per cent to initiatives in the 
Arab States and North Africa. Grants amounting to 33 per cent of the total 
($2.6 million) were awarded to five grantees working on the thematic window on 
adolescent and young girls; this will benefit more than 43,000 girls by 2017.

<p>60. Trust Fund grantees are advancing proven and innovative programmes to 
counter and prevent violence against women and girls. In Mauritania, SOS-Esclaves 
is advocating for the reform of the 2007 Anti-Slavery Act to allow civil society 
organizations to pursue claims on behalf of female slaves, remove the burden of 
proof from the victims and ensure that the State shoulders its responsibilities.  
</p>
<p>61. Building on a successful initiative previously supported by the Trust Fund, 
CARE International is scaling up interventions to address sexual harassment in the 
garment, tourism and hospitality industries in Cambodia. The Breakthrough Trust is 
replicating its proven &#8220;edutainment&#8221; methodology in six Hindi-speaking states in 
India. The Danish Refugee Council is establishing mobile legal aid clinics to meet 
the needs of returnees and internally displaced women in Afghanistan and 
Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p>62. Five new grantees are strengthening the implementation of laws and policies to 
end violence against women. In Antigua and Barbuda, the Directorate of Gender 
Affairs is implementing the 2013-2018 National Strategic Action Plan to End 
Gender-Based Violence. In Morocco, Initiatives pour la Protection des Droits de la 
Femme is enhancing women&#8217;s access to justice and to economic and social rights in 
a multifunctional centre known as &#8220;Batha centre&#8221;. In Myanmar, Action Aid is rolling 
out a successful pilot programme to increase access to justice in rural areas. In 
Armenia, Society Without Violence is promoting the integration of a gender 
perspective in public education policies. In Serbia, the B92 Foundation is expediting 
the implementation of the National Strategy for Prevention and Elimination of 
Violence against Women in the Family and in Intimate Partner Relationships by 
developing an agribusiness economic empowerment programme for survivors.  
</p>
<p>63. Addressing the intersection of HIV/AIDS and violence against women remains 
a global concern. Two new grantees, Jamaica AIDS Support for Life and the 
Association of Positive Women Indonesia, are working to increase access to health-
care services and to integrate into the health sector the needs of women, lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender people, women living with disabilities and sex 
workers. In Fiji, Medical Services in the Pacific is operating mobile clinics in seven 
rural market locations, bringing services and information into women&#8217;s workplaces.  
</p>
<p>64. Five programmes will address the needs of adolescent girls. In South Africa, 
Grassroot Soccer is expanding its &#8220;Skillz Plus&#8221; sports-based curriculum to foster 
girls&#8217; empowerment, expand girls&#8217; awareness of sexual and reproductive rights and 
increase access to services for survivors of gender-based violence. In Bangladesh, 
Nari Progati Sangha is working with schools to create safe learning environments 
for girls. Plan International in Viet Nam is piloting a research-based model for 
building gender-responsive schools in Hanoi. The Ukrainian Women&#8217;s Fund is 
promoting zero tolerance for violence among Ukrainian youth. In Kosovo, the 
European Centre for Minority Issues is improving access to violence prevention and 
protection services for girls and adolescents from minority communities. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The way forward 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>65. Trust Fund programmes to prevent violence against women and girls are 
mobilizing communities in order to change beliefs, attitudes and practices that 
perpetuate and normalize violence. These initiatives are opening up safe spaces for 
girls in which they can thrive and develop their potential. They are promoting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/17 
E/CN.6/2014/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>13-61736 <b>16/16 
 
</b></p>
<p>strategies to end impunity for gender-based violence in conflict situations, including 
by gathering evidence, strengthening prosecution systems and establishing 
non-judicial, truth-telling mechanisms. Through the Trust Fund&#8217;s support, grantees 
have made great advances in enabling the implementation of legislation that addresses 
all forms of violence against women and girls. In 2013 alone, the Trust Fund 
supported programmes that reached more than 3 million women, men, girls and boys 
around the world, including more than 30,000 survivors of violence. The work of the 
Trust Fund remains vital in closing the gap between promises and action. 
</p>
<p>66. As the examples in previous sections of the present report show, the Trust 
Fund&#8217;s initiatives have achieved notable results and demonstrate that with political 
will, social commitment and allocation of resources, a world without violence 
against women and girls could be just a generation away. In its 17 years of 
existence, the Trust Fund has worked ceaselessly to turn this aspiration into a 
reality. Each year, without fail, it has issued its call for proposals, despite the 
challenging global financial environment.  
</p>
<p>67. The Trust Fund announced its eighteenth call for proposals on 25 November 
</p><p>2013. Given the promising results of community-based approaches and the central 
role of social mobilization to enact change, in this grant cycle the Fund will 
specifically and strategically invest in grass-roots women&#8217;s organizations and youth-
led organizations, in addition to well-established civil society organizations, 
Governments and United Nations country teams. Programmes that engage groups 
facing discrimination and exclusion, such as internally displaced people; refugees; 
women and girls living in conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings; and 
women with disabilities, will also receive special consideration.  
</p>
<p>68. The Trust Fund will continue to deepen the knowledge and expertise it has 
acquired over the years in identifying and supporting promising initiatives. Building 
on this wealth of experience, the Fund is able to continually adapt and refine the focus 
of its activities, prioritizing programmes with the greatest potential. It is this analysis 
based on knowledge that underpins the increased focus on community mobilization.  
</p>
<p>69. In the past five years, requests for funds have more than doubled. Conversely, 
the amount distributed by the Trust Fund has fallen more than 60 per cent since 
2008, when a total of $21.1 million was distributed in grants, to 2013, when the total 
amount was $8 million. In 2008, the Trust Fund awarded grants to 4.2 per cent of 
applicants. By 2010 that figure had fallen to 1.1 per cent and by 2013 only 0.7 per 
cent of applicants received grants. 
</p>
<p>70. To fulfil its mandate and vision, the Trust Fund is stepping up its efforts to 
increase its pool of funds. The goal is to reach $15 million in grant-making funds for 
</p><p>2014. The Trust Fund is confident that Member States, the private sector and 
concerned individuals will work with the Fund to achieve this aim.  
</p>
<p>71. As the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-eighth session 
discusses the challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals for women and girls, the Trust Fund shares the commitment of 
Member States to expedite all efforts to end violence against women and girls. The 
Fund is confident that the issue will be integrated as a central component in the 
development agenda beyond 2015 and in the discussions surrounding the twentieth 
anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
