PARSLEY ENERGY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2016
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS AND UPDATES FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE
AUSTIN, Texas, August 3, 2016 – Parsley Energy, Inc. (NYSE: PE) (“Parsley,” “Parsley
Energy,” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter
ended June 30, 2016. The Company has posted to its website a presentation that supplements
the information in this release.
Second Quarter 2016 Highlights
•  Net production averaged 35.7 MBoe per day, up 23% versus 1Q16 and 60% year-over-year.
Net oil production increased 25% versus 1Q16 and 82% year-over-year, with oil volumes
representing 66% of total production in 2Q16.
•  The Company is increasing full-year 2016 production guidance from 31.5-34.5 MBoe per day
to 36.0-38.0 MBoe per day.
•  Lease operating expense (“LOE”) per Boe decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter, down
17% versus 1Q16 to $4.37.
•  Parsley is lowering full-year 2016 LOE per Boe guidance from $5.50-$6.50 to $4.50-$5.25.
•  Cash general and administrative (“G&A”) expense per Boe decreased 32% versus 1Q16 to
$4.28.
•  Parsley is lowering full-year 2016 cash G&A per Boe guidance from $4.75-$5.75 to $4.50-
$5.00.
•  The Company expects to complete 80-90 gross horizontal wells in 2016, up from the previous
expectation of 65-75 gross horizontal wells, benefiting from ongoing efficiency gains. To
accommodate these additional wells, Parsley is increasing guidance for full-year 2016 capital
expenditures from $410-$460 million to $460-$510 million.
•  Parsley closed previously announced acquisitions of approximately 14,200 net acres in the
Southern Delaware Basin and approximately 8,700 net acres in the Midland Basin.
Subsequent to the end of 2Q16, the Company also closed the previously announced
acquisition of mineral rights in approximately 30,000 acres in the Southern Delaware Basin.
“The substantial production growth and cost compression Parsley generated during the second
quarter are exactly what we envisioned earlier this year when we made a non-consensus
decision to maintain operational momentum in the face of unsteady commodity prices,” said
Bryan Sheffield, Parsley’s President and CEO. “We are also gratified to have closed on
meaningful leasehold acquisitions in both the Midland Basin and Southern Delaware Basin at
increasingly attractive prices, and to have boosted the economic potential of our promising
Southern Delaware acreage by acquiring associated mineral rights. Taking a broader view, over
Parsley’s nine quarters as a public company, we have increased production at a 16% compound
quarterly growth rate—almost entirely through the drill-bit—and built an asset base and the
organizational capacity to support top-tier growth for years to come.”
Operational Highlights
During the second quarter, Parsley spud 21 and completed 25 gross operated horizontal wells
with an average working interest of 93%. Second quarter completion activity includes four
recently acquired wells that had been drilled but not completed by the previous operators.
Parsley completed its first horizontal well on its recently acquired Reeves County acreage in the
Southern Delaware Basin. The Ranger C4-7-4309H, completed in the upper Wolfcamp interval
with a 5,078’ stimulated lateral, registered a strong peak 30-day initial production (“IP”) rate of
1,127 Boe per day or 222 Boe per day per thousand stimulated feet. Normalized to 7,000 lateral
feet, the well is outperforming the Company’s 1 million Boe EUR type curve for Midland Basin
Wolfcamp A/B wells by 24% after 60 days of production and is also on pace with the strong
results posted by the initial wells on Parsley’s Trees Ranch prospect in the Southern Delaware
Basin.
1
The Midland Basin wells that achieved 30-day peak production periods since the Company’s last
quarterly update generated an average 30-day IP rate of 1,013 Boe per day, with an average
stimulated lateral length of 6,238’ and an average oil cut of 75%. Each of these wells was
completed in the Wolfcamp A or Wolfcamp B target interval and among them, the Hirsch E
4201H, completed in the Wolfcamp A formation in Upton County, established a Company record
30-day IP rate of 284 Boe/d per thousand stimulated feet.
Financial Highlights
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to its
stockholders of $21.4 million, or $0.13 per weighted average share. Excluding, on a tax-adjusted
basis, certain items that the Company does not view as indicative of its financial performance,
and adding back the non-controlling interest allocated to Class B stockholders, adjusted net
income for the second quarter of 2016 was $6.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.
Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and
exploration expense (“Adjusted EBITDAX”) for the second quarter of 2016 was $81.9 million, up
48% compared to the first quarter of 2016.1
Parsley generated significant reductions in unit costs during the second quarter of 2016. LOE per
Boe decreased from $5.25 in 1Q16 to $4.37 in 2Q16. G&A per Boe decreased from $7.29 in
1Q16 to $5.33 in 2Q16, while cash G&A per Boe, which excludes stock-based compensation
expense, decreased from $6.25 in 1Q16 to $4.28 in 2Q16. Depreciation, depletion, and
amortization expense per Boe decreased from $18.66 in 1Q16 to $17.23 in the second quarter of
2016.
Despite completing ten more horizontal wells in 2Q16 than in 1Q16, reported capital
expenditures increased by just $26 million quarter-over-quarter to $136 million. Reported capital
expenditures include costs associated with the horizontal drilling activity noted above, as well as
one vertical well and one saltwater disposal well. Drilling and completion costs for a 7,000-
stimulated-foot Wolfcamp well in the Midland Basin averaged less than $5 million for the first
time, registering $4.8 million during the second quarter.
Liquidity Update
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $966 million of liquidity—consisting of $441 million of
cash on hand and an undrawn amount of $525 million on the Company’s revolving credit facility.
Pro forma for the closing of its Southern Delaware minerals acquisition on July 14, 2016, the
Company had approximately $189 million of cash on hand, $714 million of liquidity, and a net
debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAX ratio of 1.7.
Hedging Update
Parsley maintains an active hedging program to reduce the variability of its anticipated cash
flows arising from fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company remains well-hedged, with a
majority of anticipated oil volumes hedged this year and a significant hedge position in 2017.
Parsley also recently entered into natural gas hedge positions with settlements starting in 2017.
For details on Parsley’s hedging position, please see the investor presentation on the
Company’s website and/or the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, upon availability, for
the period ended June 30, 2016.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX
is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users
of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders
and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net (loss) income before
depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration costs, acquisition costs, (gain) loss on sales
of oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligation accretion expense, stock-based
compensation, net interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, rig termination costs,
derivative (income) loss, net settlements on derivative instruments, and net premium realizations
on options that settled during the period.
Management believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows the Company to more
effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from
period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company
excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these
amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon
accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the
assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more
meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the
Company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX
are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance,
such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable
assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company’s computations of
Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies.
The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating
performance.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to the GAAP financial
measure of net income for each of the periods indicated.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
8
Adjusted net income (loss) is a performance measure used by management to evaluate financial
performance, prior to non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, net cash received for derivative
settlements, net premiums received on options that settled during the period, (gain) loss on sale
of property, exploration costs, acquisition costs, and rig termination costs while adjusting for
noncontrolling interest and the associated changes in estimated income tax. Management
believes adjusted net income (loss) is useful because it may enhance investors’ ability to assess
Parsley’s historical and future financial performance. Adjusted net income (loss) should not be
considered an alternative to consolidated net income, operating income, or any other measure of
financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a
reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income (loss) to the GAAP
financial measure of net income (loss).
