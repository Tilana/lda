<p><b> I. Mandate on promoting human rights through sport  
and the Olympic ideal 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/1, the Advisory Committee 
</p>
<p>prepared a progress report1 on the possibilities of using sport and the Olympic ideal to 
</p>
<p>promote human rights for all and to strengthen universal respect for them, bearing in mind 
</p>
<p>both the value of relevant principles enshrined in the Olympic Charter and the value of 
</p>
<p>good sporting example, which it submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>seventh session. At the same session, in its resolution 27/8, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>requested the Committee to finalize its study and to present it to the Council before its 
</p>
<p>thirtieth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The drafting group, established by the Advisory Committee for the preparation of 
</p>
<p>the study, is currently composed of Saeed Mohamed Al Faihani (Chair), Mohamed 
</p>
<p>Bennani, Karla Hanan&#237;a de Varela, Mikhail Lebedev (Rapporteur), Katharina Pabel and 
</p>
<p>Yishan Zhang. 
</p>
<p>3. Observations of States and independent experts underpinned the work on the present 
</p>
<p>study to a large extent. In accordance with Council resolution 24/1, the drafting group 
</p>
<p>prepared a questionnaire, which was sent in March 2014 to all Member States, international 
</p>
<p>and regional organizations, national human rights institutions, civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>and other relevant stakeholders. As at August 2015, responses had been received from 25 
</p>
<p>States,2 6 national human rights institutions, 8 non-governmental organizations and civil 
</p>
<p>society representatives, 3 international organizations and 1 special procedure mandate-
</p>
<p>holder. 
</p>
<p>4. It is furthermore essential to stress the tremendous contribution, including in terms 
</p>
<p>of awareness-raising, of the scientific community, which continues to provide vibrant 
</p>
<p>critical evaluations, sometimes controversial and disputable, on all features of sport&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>proliferation in society, including on sport and policy, to identify advantages and 
</p>
<p>shortcomings of sport management and to suggest ways and means of improvement in the 
</p>
<p>interest of promoting human rights and, ultimately, the well-being of all. For many years, 
</p>
<p>Governments have had the tendency to keep academics at arm&#8217;s length, and academic 
</p>
<p>knowledge in sport was often geared to the sporting community, the identification of talent 
</p>
<p>and the production of medals or industrial complex.3 The increasing number of impressive 
</p>
<p>academic multidisciplinary sport research appears to be changing this situation. This 
</p>
<p>deserves special attention, but is beyond the scope of the present study. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General outline of the study 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and objectives 
</b></p>
<p>5. The purpose of the present study is to assist stakeholders in assessing modern human 
</p>
<p>rights policy related to sport and to facilitate its further development and improvement in a

<p>coherent, comprehensive and systematic manner. Widening the possibilities of using sport 
</p>
<p>and the Olympic ideal to promote and strengthen universal respect for human rights for all 
</p>
<p>requires sustained efforts based on the considerations below. 
</p>
<p>6. Sport plays a significant role in promoting human rights and represents an 
</p>
<p>expanding portion of humankind engaging in sporting activity. It stands for a strong will to 
</p>
<p>overcome the limitations of human abilities, a desire for self-realization aimed at cultivating 
</p>
<p>our fullest potential and a way of learning communication and harmonization through fair 
</p>
<p>play, among others. It is a multidimensional cultural activity for all and a physical group 
</p>
<p>and leisure activity, which enriches our lives. As with any other human activity, sport is 
</p>
<p>governed by human rights. The core human rights instruments therefore apply to sport like 
</p>
<p>all other fields of human activity. 
</p>
<p>7. Sport has a broad scope: it includes physical exercise and is a way to improve one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>lifestyle, well-being and health. It contributes to creating employment opportunities and 
</p>
<p>promoting peace, development, respect and non-discrimination. Sport therefore contributes 
</p>
<p>not only to achieving economic and social progress, but also to transcending perceived 
</p>
<p>differences and providing opportunities for personal development through its inherent 
</p>
<p>values of respect and tolerance. In the light of these various elements, sport, if used in the 
</p>
<p>right way, can help develop a generation and an environment underpinned by respect and 
</p>
<p>cooperation, thereby strengthening the promotion of and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Sport brings about new opportunities for individuals, communities and for States. It 
</p>
<p>expands global commitments in strengthening physical, mental and emotional health, social 
</p>
<p>welfare and cohesion, promoting camaraderie, physical prowess, team cooperation, 
</p>
<p>solidarity, adherence to standards and rules of the game, with an emphasis on participation, 
</p>
<p>equality, shared humanity, harmony and generosity, and in raising awareness and 
</p>
<p>understanding of human rights. Sport is important in promoting human rights worldwide 
</p>
<p>through the interactions it generates between people from different backgrounds and 
</p>
<p>cultures. Sport and the Olympic ideal can also be a means to advance the cause of peace, 
</p>
<p>promote development and combat all forms of discrimination. Sport unites a large number 
</p>
<p>of people around one issue irrespective of race, gender, religion or background. 
</p>
<p>Discrimination could wither away through sport because, if appropriately used, sport 
</p>
<p>teaches people cooperation, coordination and respect for others, providing people from 
</p>
<p>different cultures with the opportunity to work together in a team spirit. Through its 
</p>
<p>universal nature, sport can instil in people the values of respect, diversity, tolerance and 
</p>
<p>fairness and can serve as a means to combat all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>9. The values of sport, such as integrity, teamwork, excellence, respect, tolerance, fair 
</p>
<p>play and friendship, create an environment in which young people can learn and grow. 
</p>
<p>Hence, respect for human rights and the values of the Olympic Charter can be pursued 
</p>
<p>collaboratively. Sport and all those involved in sporting events are therefore key to 
</p>
<p>promoting, educating and sensitizing people about the importance of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, sport should be used as a channel to promote equal opportunities for education, 
</p>
<p>health, gender and ethnic equality, and to protect the rights of persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>the environment, among others. 
</p>
<p>10. The right to play sport has undergone a remarkable conceptual development in 
</p>
<p>recent years and now reflects a desire to lead a healthy way of life with human dignity. This 
</p>
<p>right is rooted in other rights and concepts, including the rights to health, participation in 
</p>
<p>cultural life and development. It must be guaranteed to everyone, including children and 
</p>
<p>young people, older people, women, the rich, the poor and people with disabilities, and 
</p>
<p>protected from any abuses by organizers of sporting events or State interference to sport 
</p>
<p>management. </p>


<p>11. It is important to implement the right to play sport, beyond politics and with full 
respect for the human rights not only of athletes, but also all those directly or indirectly 
</p>
<p>affected by sporting activities or events, thereby seeking to create a better world for all 
</p>
<p>through sport, physical activity and play. 
</p>
<p>12. The cohesion and neutrality of the sporting movement are important factors for 
</p>
<p>achieving the Olympic ideal and values. Sporting events should not be used to demonstrate 
</p>
<p>political protests or boycotts as measures of political pressure. In this regard, promoting the 
</p>
<p>ideals of the Olympic Truce in advance of the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games, 
</p>
<p>and recognizing the importance of constructive partnerships with the International Olympic 
</p>
<p>Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, the International Olympic Truce 
</p>
<p>Centre, hosts of the Games, international sporting federations, the United Nations and State 
</p>
<p>or non-State stakeholders in supporting the implementation of resolutions on the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Truce, becomes promising. 
</p>
<p>13. The observations below provide an overview, analysis and assessment of the main 
</p>
<p>areas where the continuing integration of a human rights-based approach into the practice 
</p>
<p>of sport and the implementation of the Olympic ideal could potentially be most beneficial 
</p>
<p>or fruitful in terms of promoting and strengthening universal respect for human rights for 
</p>
<p>all. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal and social framework  
</b></p>
<p>14. As highlighted above, sport is an important means to promote and strengthen 
</p>
<p>universal respect for human rights. It can and should be used to combat all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and more generally social exclusion, violence, inequality, racism and 
</p>
<p>xenophobia. There is a need to ensure that sport and sporting activities and initiatives do 
</p>
<p>not lead to such violations of human rights as forced evictions or child or labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation, or violations of economic, social and cultural, or civil and political human 
</p>
<p>rights. Clearly, sport as a form of human activity should be construed and practised under 
</p>
<p>general human rights provisions and specific conventions, with the full gamut of human 
</p>
<p>rights norms and standards, deriving from international human rights treaties and customary 
</p>
<p>law, governing any sport, sporting activity or event, big or small. 
</p>
<p>15. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is complemented in this regard by 
</p>
<p>different relevant United Nations basic guiding documents and resolutions, such as General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 58/5, by which the Assembly decided to proclaim 2005 the 
</p>
<p>International Year for Sport and Physical Education, to strengthen sport as a means to 
</p>
<p>promote education, health, development and peace.4 The General Assembly recognized the 
</p>
<p>potential of sport to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p>noting that sport has the potential, as declared in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, to 
</p>
<p>foster peace and development and to contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance and 
</p>
<p>understanding, and reaffirming that sport is a tool for education that can promote 
</p>
<p>cooperation, solidarity, social inclusion and health at the local, national and international 
</p>
<p>levels, as declared in the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals. Moreover, numerous United 
</p>
<p>Nations resolutions and reports appeal for the advancement of peace, development, 
</p>
<p>diversity, tolerance, fairness, mutual respect, human understanding, dialogue, 
</p>
<p>reconciliation, competition spirit, gender equality and the combating of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>racism, social exclusion and marginalization. Member States have been requested to create 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 Other relevant General Assembly resolutions include 69/6, 67/17, 59/10, 60/1, 60/9, 61/10, 62/271, 
</p>
<p>63/135and 65/4. </p>


<p>more opportunities for persons with disabilities, to contribute to the expansion of mass 
</p>
<p>sporting activities, to support high performance in sporting events, to engage more children 
</p>
<p>and young persons, women and girls and older persons in sport and to facilitate access and 
</p>
<p>create a barrier-free environment. Article 30.5 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities specifically addresses measures to be taken by State parties to enable 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities &#8220;to participate on an equal basis with others in recreational, leisure 
</p>
<p>and sporting activities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. In his report on sport for development and peace,5 the Secretary-General reviews the 
</p>
<p>programmes and initiatives implemented by States Members of the United Nations, as well 
</p>
<p>as United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies and other partners, using 
</p>
<p>sport as a tool for development and peace. 
</p>
<p>17. In its International Charter of Physical Education and Sport, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines access to physical 
</p>
<p>education and sport as a fundamental right for all. UNESCO will be adopting a revised 
</p>
<p>Charter in November 2015, the main amendments of which will include the introduction of 
</p>
<p>the concept of physical activity, notably to reflect the various related health benefits; strong 
</p>
<p>provisions on gender equality and the need to enforce the rights of women and girls; the 
</p>
<p>availability of inclusive, adapted and safe opportunities, especially for children at preschool 
</p>
<p>age, women and girls, the elderly, people with disabilities and indigenous people; the 
</p>
<p>shared responsibility of a large range of stakeholders, including the Olympic and 
</p>
<p>Paralympic movements, for developing and supporting physical education, physical activity 
</p>
<p>and sport policy; the need for activities of these stakeholders to be economically, socially 
</p>
<p>and environmentally sustainable; the important role of sport for development and peace 
</p>
<p>programmes in the realization of development, peace, post-conflict and post-disaster 
</p>
<p>objectives; and the protection and promotion of the integrity of sport against violence, 
</p>
<p>doping, political exploitation, corruption and manipulation. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition, the Olympic Charter has a pivotal role in the context of human rights 
</p>
<p>and sport in that it provides that &#8220;[t]he practice of sport is a human right,&#8221; and that &#8220;[e]very 
</p>
<p>individual must have the possibility to practice sport, without discrimination of any kind 
</p>
<p>and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, 
</p>
<p>solidarity and fair play&#8221;,6 and places sport at the service of the harmonious development of 
</p>
<p>humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of 
</p>
<p>human dignity. 
</p>
<p>19. It is also worth outlining the regional initiatives that have progressively developed 
</p>
<p>the legal basis for promoting human rights through sport and the Olympic ideal. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in the 2013 document entitled &#8220;Approach to Human Rights&#8221;,7 the Organizing 
</p>
<p>Committee of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games referred to domestic and international 
</p>
<p>law and its relevance to the human rights and sporting context. In the text, the Committee, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, stated that it had &#8220;an obligation &#8212; both moral and legal, and with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in mind &#8212; to respect, support 
</p>
<p>and promote these rights through the course of its normal business&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. Moreover, the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies; sporting 
</p>
<p>organizations, including the International Olympic Committee; and other stakeholders, such 
</p>
<p>as civil society, Governments and sporting, educational and research institutions 
</p>
<p>worldwide, devote increasing resources to areas of development through sport, as a means 
</p>
<p>of helping to promote youth, formal education, culture, healthy lifestyles, sustainability,

<p>gender equality, understanding among peoples and peace. The projects, beyond enabling 
</p>
<p>vulnerable communities to enjoy their right to leisure, support human rights at large. 
</p>
<p>Countless initiatives with this objective and scope have been implemented by relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including the International Olympic Committee. The Special Adviser to the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General and the Office on Sport for Development and Peace are spearheading 
</p>
<p>such activities, and the collaboration between the United Nations and the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Movement has further strengthened in recent years. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Instrumental significance of education, training and capacity-building  
</b></p>
<p><b>in sport 
</b></p>
<p>21. Many of the responses received to the questionnaire rightly recognize the 
</p>
<p>fundamental role of sport in educating children and young people, for whom physical 
</p>
<p>activity and sport are used as methods to acquire social skills, positive attitudes and moral 
</p>
<p>values. Sport, besides being a fundamental expression of the right to play, is an excellent 
</p>
<p>tool for psychosocial recovery. It is a right enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child. Educational programmes supporting the practice of sport as a human right need to be 
</p>
<p>given due prominence in curriculum planning. Through such programmes, the spirit of 
</p>
<p>friendship, mutual respect, solidarity and fair play can be promoted, learned and anchored 
</p>
<p>into individuals and their communities. In primary education, sport has a profound effect on 
</p>
<p>children, the development of their skills and the promotion of gender equality. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the development of values should be cross-cutting in educational programmes and 
</p>
<p>curricula, fostering a balanced mentality that promotes participation over winning, respect 
</p>
<p>for opponents, punctuality and solidarity. These values will ultimately be reflected in the 
</p>
<p>lifestyle of athletes, who will spread them to the rest of society. 
</p>
<p>22. Sport is more than an isolated activity. It can be seen as an integrative bridge 
</p>
<p>between education, culture, music and dance in order to strengthen human rights and the 
</p>
<p>Olympic values. Physical activity should aim at children becoming acquainted with their 
</p>
<p>culture and more respectful for diversity, tolerance, games rules and behavioural codes. 
</p>
<p>23. The promotion of peace culture contributes to prevent vandalism and violence 
</p>
<p>during sporting events, particularly in football stadiums, and calls for continuous and active 
</p>
<p>action by all stakeholders. Of particular relevance here is the UNESCO International 
</p>
<p>Charter of Physical Education and Sport, which seeks to combat these human rights 
</p>
<p>violations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Sport and combating all forms of discrimination and racism 
</b></p>
<p>24. One of the distinctive tenets of human rights instruments and the Olympic Charter is 
</p>
<p>the opposition to all forms of discrimination. In sport, any type of discrimination is 
</p>
<p>prohibited, such as those on the basis of race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or 
</p>
<p>other opinion, national or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status, or against 
</p>
<p>national minorities. Human rights and the Olympic ideal envisage a society without any 
</p>
<p>discrimination. The Olympic Charter seeks to develop sincere understanding, cooperation 
</p>
<p>and friendship among people and to set a unique and shining example: gaining laurels 
</p>
<p>through fair competition on an equal footing. 
</p>
<p>25. The best way to combat all forms of discrimination is through education, especially 
</p>
<p>for the younger generation. Education can enhance the respect for human rights and the 
</p>
<p>Olympic principles of friendship, respect and excellence. While the respect of the Olympic 
</p>
<p>values could make it possible to overcome all forms of discrimination in the sporting 
</p>
<p>context, an international academic debate continues on the real benefits of promoting these </p>


<p>values. Critical scholars argue that &#8220;athletes who are co-opted by the &#699;educational outreach&#700; 
</p>
<p>branch of the Olympic industry as role models, risk entrenching sexism, racism, and other 
</p>
<p>discriminatory systems that they may be hoping to challenge&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>26. Sport can combat social barriers, promote communication about gender and other 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination and contribute to bringing men and women closer together to 
</p>
<p>enhance social cohesion. 
</p>
<p>27. It is noteworthy that, in certain instances, the adoption of protocols within sport has 
</p>
<p>contributed to promoting respect and thus combating discrimination, for instance, 
</p>
<p>handshakes between players. In addition, banners in athletic fields and international athletic 
</p>
<p>conferences on anti-discrimination, together with laws prohibiting and providing penalties 
</p>
<p>for such acts, contribute to raising awareness of and combating all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Role of different types of sporting events 
</b></p>
<p>28. For the purpose of the present study, it is important to identify synergies and 
</p>
<p>complementarities between sport and human rights that would pinpoint the relations 
</p>
<p>between them, so as to promote the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and to 
</p>
<p>combat all forms of discrimination. It is also important to identify the obstacles to 
</p>
<p>promoting human rights, including any infringements, which may occur in the context of 
</p>
<p>sporting events. 
</p>
<p>29. Sporting events can help promote awareness and understanding of human rights 
</p>
<p>principles through the interactions between people of different backgrounds and cultures. 
</p>
<p>To strengthen this aspect, local, national and regional sporting events could include special 
</p>
<p>targeted competitions for ethnic sport strands designed to demonstrate different ethnic 
</p>
<p>traditions, practices and customs. 
</p>
<p>30. Sport and mega sporting events, including the Olympics, bring people closer 
</p>
<p>together and make them familiar with each other. The shared purpose emerging from sport 
</p>
<p>would eventually lead to decreasing prejudice and, given the high number of participants, 
</p>
<p>this spirit would spread further towards the creation of an environment conducive to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>31. The following categories of sporting events can be distinguished: local, national, 
</p>
<p>regional, continental, international and global, as well as special targeted programmes. The 
</p>
<p>categorization is functional and depends on the commitments and objectives of the 
</p>
<p>organizers, who decide upon the concrete requirements for each category. Hence, it is 
</p>
<p>important that stakeholders, and in particular organizers of mass sporting events, use and 
</p>
<p>leverage such events to promote and support sport for development and peace initiatives,9 
</p>
<p>including to support the inclusion of persons with disabilities and to promote non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. 
</p>
<p>32. The staging of multiple-sport events in different regions of a country also results in 
</p>
<p>the regions benefitting from the construction of related infrastructure, such as sporting 
</p>
<p>venues, hotels and access roads, the development of know-how, expertise and the tourism 
</p>
<p>industry and an overall positive impact on the economy. However, alongside these 
</p>
<p>opportunities for economic and social development, sporting events also carry risks, 
</p>
<p>including of the local population being displaced, evicted, exploited or killed.

<p>33. Global or mega sporting events like the Olympic Games or the F&#233;d&#233;ration 
</p>
<p>Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup receive special national and 
</p>
<p>international attention owing to their role in advancing human rights and well-known wider 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural agenda. The global dimension and increasing ratings of major 
</p>
<p>competitions can contribute to the perception that modern sport is a universal facilitator of 
</p>
<p>general humanitarian ideas and approaches addressed to all mankind. From a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, recent controversies about the balance between related opportunities and risks 
</p>
<p>have renewed fundamental questions about the social opportunity costs of hosting mega 
</p>
<p>sporting events and the responsibilities of host Governments, and international sporting 
</p>
<p>governing bodies, which set the terms for staging these kinds of events.10 Sporting events 
</p>
<p>can raise human rights questions, and human rights instruments and practices should be 
</p>
<p>observed in their organization as for all human activity. A scholar discourse continues on 
</p>
<p>failures to strike a fair balance between celebrating humanity and market manipulation.11 
</p>
<p>34. Major sporting events can be used as a catalyst to implement child protective 
</p>
<p>strategies and strengthen cooperation among various stakeholders to mitigate potential 
</p>
<p>harm. There is a need to involve and build partnerships with key stakeholders, such as the 
</p>
<p>International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, international 
</p>
<p>sporting federations, host countries and businesses. Organizers of such events should 
</p>
<p>include an impact assessment of human rights, including children&#8217;s rights, in the bidding 
</p>
<p>criteria. For instance, the &#8220;Children Win&#8221; project of the non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>ECPAT and Terre des Hommes calls for a revision of the bidding processes of major 
</p>
<p>sporting events, to include at all stages of the assessment the risk mitigation measures and 
</p>
<p>positive effects. Compliance with human rights principles and standards should become a 
</p>
<p>basic criterion for countries and cities to be eligible as hosts of major sporting events. In 
</p>
<p>this regard, the elaboration of a framework on &#8220;sporting and human rights&#8221; similar to that 
</p>
<p>on &#8220;business and human rights&#8221; may prove to be effective in defining the scope of the 
</p>
<p>human rights responsibilities of all actors involved in sporting events and in exploring ways 
</p>
<p>for them to be accountable for the impact of their activities on human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Business, public-private partnerships on human rights and sport 
</b></p>
<p>35. Sport makes it possible to create synergies between public and private sectors in a 
</p>
<p>concrete and effective manner, even in vulnerable areas, and can engage international 
</p>
<p>corporations and foreign suppliers or industries by making them aware of their social and 
</p>
<p>local responsibility. Labour, employment, health and safety in the management of sporting 
</p>
<p>activities require compliance with employment standards as expressed in the International 
</p>
<p>Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions along with, where appropriate, other 
</p>
<p>local initiatives. ILO conventions set out a &#8220;social floor&#8221; in the world of employment and 
</p>
<p>provide for the elimination of all forms of compulsory or forced labour and the effective 
</p>
<p>abolition of child labour. Accountability and transparency and complaint mechanisms 
</p>
<p>provide the necessary guarantees against human rights abuses of licensees, including child 
</p>
<p>labour, excessive working hours and abuses of health and safety laws in the supply 
</p>
<p>chains.

<p> Some researchers have also called for social responsibility to become a pillar of

<p>the Olympic Movement, arguing that, if future Olympic Games and the Olympic 
</p>
<p>Movement in general were to claim an authentic legacy, this must be demonstrated by 
</p>
<p>accessible housing, tenants&#8217; rights, freedom of assembly, a free media, unrestricted public 
</p>
<p>use of public spaces and the protection of children and young people from Olympic 
</p>
<p>propaganda.12 
</p>
<p>36. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights can contribute to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights during the management of sporting events but they cannot 
</p>
<p>ensure that there will be no negative human rights impact. However, if implemented from 
</p>
<p>the outset of the life cycle of mega sporting events, the Guiding Principles can reaffirm 
</p>
<p>States&#700; duties to protect individuals from rights abuses involving non-State actors. The 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles also offer a process to mitigate and effectively manage business-related 
</p>
<p>human rights risks. Strong not-for-profit partnerships and sponsorships could gather funds 
</p>
<p>to support sporting activities in schools and universities. As highlighted above, a 
</p>
<p>framework for sporting and human rights, drawing from the business and human rights 
</p>
<p>framework and governing the activities of all key actors in the organization of sporting 
</p>
<p>events, from the bidding stage to the actual event, may be necessary in order to better 
</p>
<p>reflect the specificity of sport and to limit the negative impact of such events on human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Incorporating sport to conflict-prevention activities and peacebuilding 
</b></p>
<p>37. Sport has the potential to contribute to overcoming humanitarian crises and conflicts 
</p>
<p>and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. One of the greatest challenges for a 
</p>
<p>country in internal conflict is to engage in dialogue or sign a peace agreement with parties 
</p>
<p>to the conflict. Because sport promotes rapprochement, it can help to reduce the levels of 
</p>
<p>violence. Sport does not need a language. It transcends nationalities, religions and ideas. 
</p>
<p>Sport should be conceived as a tool to foster dialogue, respect and collaboration. It has 
</p>
<p>often been the only way to establish dialogue between divided communities. Recreational 
</p>
<p>programmes, sport and games have heled to bring about a tacit truce in some regions where 
</p>
<p>there is armed conflict. For instance, in Colombia, several programmes have been launched 
</p>
<p>to assist victims, including children and young people involved in the conflict. Coexistence 
</p>
<p>and peace programmes complete this work by means of recreational training and sport 
</p>
<p>training in order to strengthen relations of coexistence among children and youth and to 
</p>
<p>prevent and mitigate the effects of violence. 
</p>
<p>38. Sport can promote peace through the competition of athletes from countries in 
</p>
<p>conflict. The fact that citizens of countries at war or in conflict can meet in an environment 
</p>
<p>of peace and tranquillity is very positive and helps break taboos, which have been the 
</p>
<p>source of many conflicts. Sport plays a relevant role in peace processes. The media also can 
</p>
<p>play an essential role towards achieving the common goal of peace. In Guatemala, for 
</p>
<p>instance, sport is used as a tool for social change. Specific programmes bring together 
</p>
<p>people in high-risk areas or conflict zones for the purpose of performing diverse sporting 
</p>
<p>activities without violent confrontation, thus contributing to acceptance and tolerance and 
</p>
<p>promoting social cohesion. 
</p>
<p>39. In post-conflict societies, the use of sport and human rights and the values of the 
</p>
<p>Olympic Charter can offer an alternative life model and an outlet for the energy of youth, 
</p>
<p>life training through rules, respect for one&#8217;s opponent and tolerance of difference. In non-
</p>
<p>post-conflict societies, the first step is to tolerate the specific characteristics of others, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See Helen Jefferson Lenskyj, <i>Olympic industry resistance: challenging Olympic power and 
</i></p>
<p><i>propaganda</i> (State University of New York, Albany, 2008), pp. 149-152. </p>


<p>respect their human rights and defend them when needed. The next step is to enhance cross-
</p>
<p>cultural exchange and teach the young generation to eliminate such causes of conflict as sex 
</p>
<p>discrimination and marginalization of social groups for cultural reasons. Sport can help 
</p>
<p>educate people, especially young people, about these values. Sport also helps eradicate 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty and hunger, promotes gender equality, reduces child mortality, improves 
</p>
<p>maternal health and contributes to developing a global partnership for development. 
</p>
<p>40. Sport plays an important role in promoting international relations among peoples 
</p>
<p>and opens up the field of common activity and competition between amateur and 
</p>
<p>professional athletes. Moreover, athletes are considered as ambassadors of peace, 
</p>
<p>cooperation and friendship between the peoples through their participation at the local and 
</p>
<p>international levels. 
</p>
<p>41. Sport can also advance the cause of peace by bridging social, economic and cultural 
</p>
<p>divides and building a sense of shared identity. It is important for States to cooperate with 
</p>
<p>the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee and 
</p>
<p>other sporting organizations, to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation in areas of conflict during and beyond the period of the Olympic and 
</p>
<p>Paralympic Games.13 
</p>
<p><b> H. Media, sport and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>42. The media is a critical stakeholder and plays a very important role in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and popularization of sport. It is the media that has made possible the globalization of sport. 
</p>
<p>Spreading knowledge about physical fitness, broadcasting sporting events and reporting on 
</p>
<p>public figures in sport encourages viewers to appreciate high-level matches and 
</p>
<p>sportsmanship. At the same time, it also acts as an amplifier for actions and sporting 
</p>
<p>policies, both positive and negative, and has therefore become a powerful tool both for and 
</p>
<p>against the promotion of human rights through sport. Because it has the power to shape 
</p>
<p>public opinion, it can illustrate how sport can translate into respect for human rights and 
</p>
<p>promote social cohesion and acceptance of diversity. The media uses mass communication 
</p>
<p>tools during commentaries of football and other sporting events and can therefore easily 
</p>
<p>disseminate human rights promotion messages during such events. 
</p>
<p>43. Moreover, the media aims to encourage Governments to ensure more transparency 
</p>
<p>and accountability in the sporting system. It also exposes human rights violations, provides 
</p>
<p>an arena for different voices to be heard, offers a significant opportunity for the promotion 
</p>
<p>of peace through sport, in particular the Olympics and other mega sporting events, and 
</p>
<p>plays a vital role in the creation of a friendlier society and more peaceful world. The media 
</p>
<p>therefore has an important role in demonstrating the clear benefits of sport, not only in the 
</p>
<p>area of health, but also in promoting social cohesion. Disseminating knowledge of sport and 
</p>
<p>the Olympic Games helps enhance cooperation, the understanding of friendship and 
</p>
<p>enterprising spirit. It is important to work towards improving friendship and 
</p>
<p>communication between athletes and trainers from different countries or regions. Thus the 
</p>
<p>media, as an influential actor, can promote and help spread social responsibility through 
</p>
<p>sport and also stimulate massive social mobilization as regards its practice. It is argued that 
</p>
<p>sporting events should therefore be covered by more television channels and national 
</p>
<p>newspapers, highlighting the requirements for a culture of peace, such as fair play, 
</p>
<p>cooperation and respect for the opponent. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 See General Assembly resolution 66/5. </p>


<p>44. The media can shed light on human rights violations and has an important role in 
</p>
<p>fairly covering all violations of the rights of athletes or the local population affected by 
</p>
<p>sporting events. Its broadcast programmes also educate people. Campaigns to promote 
</p>
<p>human rights, sometimes with the assistance of star athletes, are intended to raise awareness 
</p>
<p>of society at large. The media can also contribute to the promotion of human rights by 
</p>
<p>encouraging greater inclusion of disadvantaged groups. A powerful instrument of 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising is when personalities publicly condemn cases of racial discrimination or 
</p>
<p>intolerance. The collaboration with non-governmental organizations is also important to 
</p>
<p>raise awareness about the positive and negative impact of sporting events. The &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look 
</p>
<p>Away&#8221; campaign and the &#8220;Children Win&#8221; project, of the organizations ECPAT and Terre 
</p>
<p>des Hommes, which highlight the positive and negative effects that major sporting events 
</p>
<p>have on children, are a good example of such collaboration with traditional and digital 
</p>
<p>media. 
</p>
<p>45. Broad media coverage has made sport attractive to business, thereby turning it into a 
</p>
<p>huge industry and contributing to launch new mass sport trends. The modern media 
</p>
<p>promotes outstanding athletes, provides funding and fulfils humanitarian, educational and 
</p>
<p>other support objectives. 
</p>
<p>46. The media can therefore play a key role in upholding human rights and, for this 
</p>
<p>purpose, an independent media and freedom of expression are essential. Access to 
</p>
<p>information that is objective and balanced can only be guaranteed through a free and 
</p>
<p>competitive media. When censored, the media becomes a tool for propaganda, which goes 
</p>
<p>against the very idea of promotion of human rights in sport. Misleading and wrong 
</p>
<p>information can trigger violence among athletes and fans and lead to infringement of the 
</p>
<p>rights of sporting adversaries and/or local populations. 
</p>
<p>47. Racist comments and slander during sporting games, the Olympics and other mega 
</p>
<p>sporting events, and their wide dissemination through the media, may contribute to the 
</p>
<p>erosion of the rights of others during sporting events. To avoid such negative outbursts, it is 
</p>
<p>not enough to provide for legal remedies, which may be long-winded, but it is also 
</p>
<p>important to adopt and implement rigorous and effective disciplinary measures to preserve 
</p>
<p>the rights of athletes and promote human rights in sport. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Sport and development 
</b></p>
<p>48. Sport can promote sustainable development if there is awareness about the potential 
</p>
<p>negative economic and environmental impact of international sporting events and effective 
</p>
<p>measures to address them. Sporting events such as the Olympics may generate indirect 
</p>
<p>economic benefits and boost economic development in the host country. Development in a 
</p>
<p>country is promoted in a variety of ways. For example, the building of urban and rural 
</p>
<p>public sporting and exercise facilities in different regions contributes to economic 
</p>
<p>dynamism. The United Nations has incorporated sport as a tool for development and peace 
</p>
<p>in its work, notably through the Office on Sport for Development and Peace. 
</p>
<p>49. Sport also has unique attributes through which it can contribute to development 
</p>
<p>processes. Its capacity as a communication platform, its ability to connect people, its 
</p>
<p>popularity and its convening power make it a development tool that can be used to meet 
</p>
<p>high standards. It is noteworthy that the International Olympic Committee adopted the 
</p>
<p>Olympic Movement&#8217;s Agenda 21 for the twenty-first century, as a result of which the 
</p>
<p>London and Sochi Olympic Games were managed on a sustainable development basis. 
</p>
<p>50. Furthermore, sport is a catalyst for economic development whereby all elements of 
</p>
<p>the sporting economy are interconnected and simultaneously contribute to and benefit from 
</p>
<p>its development, at the local level in particular, as a result of economies of scale. Sporting </p>


<p>events may create employment opportunities, thereby increasing the revenue base of a 
</p>
<p>country. Tax revenues thus generated can be used for infrastructure projects such as 
</p>
<p>construction of roads, bridges, hospitals or water pumps. Sport can also be a mechanism 
</p>
<p>through which youth talent can be exploited to generate income for the individual and the 
</p>
<p>community. Additionally, by engaging young people, it may contribute to keeping them 
</p>
<p>from idleness and vagrancy. Development programmes that use sport can facilitate the 
</p>
<p>transfer of skills acquired in the field, in particular life skills and employability skills. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, promoting policies to train teachers and coaches, to ensure good sporting 
</p>
<p>facilities and to make them freely accessible, are fundamental factors for development. It is 
</p>
<p>therefore important that, in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and the 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals to be announced later this year by the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p>sport be recognized as a catalyst to development and be used as a tool to reach the 
</p>
<p>objectives set in the global development agenda. 
</p>
<p>51. One of the most important factors in promoting the development of a country is to 
</p>
<p>bring about social change. Sporting events and the practice of various disciplines carry 
</p>
<p>educational messages, which contribute to raising awareness on social issues, such as 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS or racial and gender discrimination, by attracting people who are more difficult 
</p>
<p>to target through institutional means and thus making it possible to reach a wider and more 
</p>
<p>diverse audience. 
</p>
<p>52. The ability of sport to promote self-belief alongside collective optimism makes it an 
</p>
<p>ideal social development tool. Sport is based on respect for rules and an equal respect for 
</p>
<p>and acceptance of those who make and apply them. The Olympic focus on the harmonious 
</p>
<p>development of humankind is echoed at every level, from children&#8217;s street games to the 
</p>
<p>highest levels of performance sport. 
</p>
<p>53. Projects aimed at improving life skills and teaching values that foster constructive 
</p>
<p>behaviours and respect for human rights are of crucial importance. One example is the 
</p>
<p>International Olympic Committee &#8220;Sport for Hope&#8221; programme, which consists in setting 
</p>
<p>up Olympic youth development centres in developing countries, in particular Haiti and 
</p>
<p>Zambia. It aims to provide young people and communities with positive sporting and 
</p>
<p>lifestyle opportunities, offers modern and professional training facilities to athletes of the 
</p>
<p>entire region and seeks to spread the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. 
</p>
<p>Such development projects, delivered jointly with appropriate specialized partners, adapted 
</p>
<p>sporting activities and sport at large, can be effective tools for the socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>development of communities. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Best practices, national experiences and models to follow 
</b></p>
<p>54. Sport is increasingly being recognized as a vehicle for inclusion and cohesion. Its 
</p>
<p>benefits, in terms of equality and social integration and of building self-esteem and 
</p>
<p>resilience, and its power to unite more than divide, are gaining ever more political and 
</p>
<p>apolitical credibility. Its contributions to the physical and mental well-being of individuals, 
</p>
<p>communities and the nation are manifold and not to be ignored or undervalued, as has 
</p>
<p>happened in the past. 
</p>
<p>55. The UNESCO Quality Physical Education guidelines, developed with the support of 
</p>
<p>several other United Nations agencies and the International Olympic Committee, promote 
</p>
<p>physical education as the only curriculum subject that combines physical competence with 
</p>
<p>values-based learning. Drawing on good practices and benchmarks in crucial areas, such as 
</p>
<p>inclusive provision and teacher training, the roll-out of the guidelines assists Governments 
</p>
<p>from all regions in revising their physical education policy. </p>


<p>56. One example of the promotion of social inclusion and the concept of fair play and 
</p>
<p>respect for opponents, especially among children and adolescents, is the &#8220;get ahead&#8221; 
</p>
<p>programme in Colombia, which contributes to having a complete education and improving 
</p>
<p>the quality of life of children and young people of ages 7-17 years, both in and out of 
</p>
<p>school. The programme is supported by an incentives package for students and athletes, 
</p>
<p>teachers and coaches, as well as educational institutions, municipalities and departments. 
</p>
<p>57. Greece seeks to use sport as a tool to instil the Olympic values in the young 
</p>
<p>generation, to help them gradually build a culture of peace. It also supports the 
</p>
<p>development of innovative educational programmes that help to reach the young generation 
</p>
<p>and educate them on how to uphold the Olympic ideal and respect for human rights in their 
</p>
<p>everyday lives. The &#8220;imagine peace&#8221; educational programme, implemented from 2011 to 
</p>
<p>2013, aimed at teaching children basic Olympic values. In 2014, the &#8220;respecting diversity&#8221; 
</p>
<p>educational programme aimed at educating students, through the history and ideals of the 
</p>
<p>Olympic Truce, on how to respect diversity and to address such issues, with Olympians 
</p>
<p>sharing their experience of participating in the Olympic Games. The International Olympic 
</p>
<p>Truce Centre organized an &#8220;imagine peace&#8221; youth camp in Olympia, Greece, in which 
</p>
<p>participants from all over the world were brought together for a week-long camp to learn 
</p>
<p>the principles and ideals of Olympism. Finally, Greece has endorsed a joint project between 
</p>
<p>UNICEF and the Truce Centre that promotes the values of peace, tolerance and solidarity. 
</p>
<p>58. In Guatemala, the &#8220;90-0&#8221; programme &#8212; meaning 90 minutes with zero violence &#8212; 
</p>
<p>focuses on promoting peace culture and aims at preventing vandalism and violence during 
</p>
<p>football matches. Another programme, the &#8220;Friday 24-0&#8221; &#8212; meaning 24 hours with zero 
</p>
<p>violent deaths &#8212; covering 3,791 educational centres aims to coordinate sport and arts 
</p>
<p>projects with a view conducive to an environment of peaceful coexistence within a human 
</p>
<p>rights framework. Guatemala also uses sport as a tool for social mobilization in support for 
</p>
<p>a variety of causes, for example, cancer, autism, peace and non-violence, HIV/AIDS and to 
</p>
<p>help persons with disabilities. Through these programmes, sport also plays a role as an 
</p>
<p>alternative to harmful or high-risk activities. 
</p>
<p>59. In Brazil, &#8220;caravan sport&#8221; is a social action initiative in which athletes train children 
</p>
<p>in 10 poor municipalities; and &#8220;segundo tempo&#8221; is a programme that provides primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary school children with a safe environment after school hours for learning activities 
</p>
<p>that seek to link sport and recreation with hygiene, life skills training and HIV prevention. 
</p>
<p>60. In China, the 1995 National Health Plan integrated sport and sporting events with 
</p>
<p>national development and national education policies. The Plan lists goals and targets, such 
as building 1,200,000 nationwide sport fields &#8212; thereby increasing to 1.5 square metres the 
</p>
<p>area of sport fields per capita &#8212; and stipulates that all children should engage in physical 
</p>
<p>exercise for at least one hour daily while at school. China has 250 million students at 
</p>
<p>school, with the benefits of the plan being self-evident. It contains policies for women, 
</p>
<p>children and young people, the elderly, persons with disabilities and national minorities. 
</p>
<p>The plan also calls for strengthening research into and development of sport for persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, and the organization of cultural, physical and recreational activities 
</p>
<p>specifically for children, with free access to public sporting facilities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Russian Federation promotes the establishment and development of national 
</p>
<p>and international systems of Olympic education, and puts forward its model as a best 
</p>
<p>practice to follow, with 20 years of successful partnership between government and non-
</p>
<p>government stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>62. France has a policy of prevention and combating behaviour that fails to respect 
</p>
<p>human rights and sporting values. The policy aims to promote athletes&#8217; awareness of the 
</p>
<p>values of the Olympic ideal, to prevent behaviour that would violate human rights. It also </p>


<p>aims to promote sport as a privileged space with shared values, such as respect for 
</p>
<p>tolerance, solidarity and fair play, by putting in place three interministerial programmes: 
</p>
<p>(a) The National Programme 2012-2014 against racism and anti-Semitism, 
</p>
<p>organized by an interministerial committee; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Government Programme 2014-2016 against sexual violence and 
</p>
<p>discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(c) The Fourth Interministerial Programme for combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women. 
</p>
<p>63. As the media plays a very important role in communicating human rights and the 
</p>
<p>Olympic ideal, significant awareness-raising initiatives with regard to the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>women began in France with a programme under the National Council of Sport. The 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Sport provides grants to increase broadcasting time for less popular sports with 
</p>
<p>a view to encouraging the universalization of sport. To enhance respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p>France aims for every federation to draft a statute giving effect to the principles of the 
</p>
<p>charter of ethics and conduct of the National Olympic Committee. 
</p>
<p>64. In Cyprus, special sporting programmes are aimed at strengthening the relationship 
</p>
<p>between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities and at facilitating 
</p>
<p>communication. 
</p>
<p>65. Long-term awareness-raising campaigns are important to involve organizers of 
</p>
<p>major sporting events in a sustainable way before, during and after major sporting events. 
</p>
<p>The non-governmental organizations ECPAT, Terre des Hommes and the Oak Foundation 
</p>
<p>have conducted initiatives and media campaigns to combat the sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>children in major sporting events. The &#8220;don&#8217;t look away&#8221; campaign, led by ECPAT, 
</p>
<p>provides for awareness-raising activities in countries hosting major sporting events, such as 
</p>
<p>the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. More importantly, the campaign also addresses the 
</p>
<p>demand side. Both the European Union and the Government of Brazil engaged in the 
</p>
<p>campaign, thus acknowledging the serious challenges that major sporting events represent 
</p>
<p>in relation to the sexual exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p>66. Furthermore, countries that have recently hosted major sporting events, such as 
</p>
<p>Brazil, Poland and South Africa, have deployed efforts to minimize the risks faced by 
</p>
<p>children of falling victim to sexual exploitation. Those efforts include the adoption of 
</p>
<p>specific legislation, monitoring tourist and sporting zones, launching awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>campaigns, creation of nationwide hotline services and the development of smartphone 
</p>
<p>applications, regional cooperation and the implementation of training programmes for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>67. &#8220;Unite for children, unite for peace&#8221; was the motto of the partnership between 
</p>
<p>UNICEF and the FIFA World Cup in Germany in 2006, aimed at promoting the right to 
</p>
<p>play and development of children worldwide. &#8220;Football for life&#8221; is another programme by 
</p>
<p>UNICEF in Honduras that uses football to educate children on HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>68. The Youth Leadership Programme, initiated by the Special Adviser to the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General and conducted by the Office on Sport for Development and Peace, is another 
</p>
<p>example of a project in support of youth role models. </p>


<p><b> K. Challenges: exploring the complexities of using sport to promote human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, preventing human rights abuses and detrimental practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>related to sport 
</b></p>
<p>69. As with any social activity, sport may have negative side effects.14 The challenges 
</p>
<p>faced are generally the same worldwide, with some differences owing to culture. Among 
</p>
<p>the main challenges are raising awareness among sporting actors that they are a vector for 
</p>
<p>the promotion of sporting values and ensuring that stakeholders make every effort to 
</p>
<p>prevent politicization of sport in any form. One of the key questions is how to create a 
</p>
<p>culture where people respect human rights and endorse the Olympic ideals. 
</p>
<p>70. Cultural, political or armed conflicts and a low level of economic development also 
</p>
<p>present significant challenges. In many countries, owing to the low level of economic 
</p>
<p>development or a sudden increase in demand for sporting activities, access to well-equipped 
</p>
<p>sporting facilities is not available to everyone. Uneven development and social conflicts are 
</p>
<p>also among the constraints for people&#8217;s participation in sport. In addition, a special focus 
</p>
<p>should be placed on religious and cultural issues. In some countries, for instance, women 
</p>
<p>are prohibited from practicing sport or still face difficulties in accessing competitions. 
</p>
<p>Insufficient policies to promote the participation of women in sport and a lack of 
</p>
<p>infrastructure in developing countries thus remain central challenge in the universalization 
</p>
<p>of sport as a means to promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>71. Numerous incidents have demonstrated the challenges faced in promoting human 
</p>
<p>rights through sport and the Olympic ideal. These include the sporting boycott of South 
</p>
<p>Africa during the apartheid era; attitudes towards the athlete Jesse Owens at the Berlin 
</p>
<p>Olympics in 1936; and the Munich massacre in 1972, in which members of the Israeli 
</p>
<p>Olympic team were taken hostage and killed by the Palestinian Black September group. 
</p>
<p>Strategies should therefore be devised to effectively translate into reality the symbolic role 
</p>
<p>sport plays in the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>72. There are also challenges related to the fight against corruption, the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination at all levels and unfair rules and regulations. The root causes of these 
</p>
<p>challenges are, inter alia, lack of awareness and a low level of social education; political or 
</p>
<p>financial instability; extreme national defence strategies that may be a cause of 
</p>
<p>discrimination; and customs and traditions that can impede the participation of specific 
</p>
<p>groups, such as women, older persons, minorities or ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>73. Many good education materials on sport and Olympic values have been produced in 
</p>
<p>recent years. They do not however sufficiently reach their target audiences, especially in 
</p>
<p>formal education systems. Through the Education Partnership, the International Council of 
</p>
<p>Sport Science and Physical Education, the International Fair Play Committee, the 
</p>
<p>International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, UNESCO and 
</p>
<p>the World Anti-Doping Agency have joined forces to teach values through sport, using 
</p>
<p>culture- and age-specific materials to give practical support school teachers. 
</p>
<p>74. Sport has also been connected to the trafficking of children, particularly from 
</p>
<p>developing and the least developed countries; young people who leave school early; 
</p>
<p>doping; and identity fraud in selections of some young people who have already passed the 
</p>
<p>age of eligibility. 
</p>
<p>75. Another major issue is the area of unregulated betting. The global volume of 
</p>
<p>unregulated sport betting is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Combined 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 Summary of the high-level interactive panel discussion of the Human Rights Council, A/HRC/20/11, 
</p>
<p>para. 10. </p>


<p>with corruption and coercion of athletes and sporting officials, it offers major business 
</p>
<p>opportunities for organized crime and money launderers. The manipulation of sport 
</p>
<p>competitions (match-fixing), with the involvement of transnational organized crime, is a 
</p>
<p>major threat to the integrity of sport. The protection of the integrity of sport against this and 
</p>
<p>other threats is a prerequisite for preserving the credibility of sport and its educational 
</p>
<p>values. This challenge can only be addressed effectively through close cooperation between 
</p>
<p>public authorities and sporting organizations at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>76. The media has a considerable influence on society. It tends to emphasize the 
</p>
<p>participation of men in sport, thereby ignoring the equal right of women to sport and 
</p>
<p>recreational physical activity. In addition, the promulgation and promotion of sport and 
</p>
<p>physical activities with a gender-equity approach amounts to little if the different needs of 
</p>
<p>men and women are not actually addressed. It is crucial for sport in any country to acquire a 
</p>
<p>socially targeted dimension to make it accessible to everyone. It is here that the contribution 
</p>
<p>of the media can be most helpful, by broadcasting sport-related programmes and events 
</p>
<p>aimed at a broad and diverse population made up of all rights-holders. 
</p>
<p>77. Furthermore, the following problems relating to gender discrimination in sport are to 
</p>
<p>be understood in an international context: 
</p>
<p>(a) The difference in the distribution of sport sponsorship by gender. It is 
</p>
<p>estimated that, with regard to participants at the Olympics, only 0.5 per cent of all 
</p>
<p>commercial sponsorships is focused on female athletes; 
</p>
<p>(b) Media coverage for women&#8217;s sport is estimated at only 5 per cent. Teenage 
</p>
<p>athletes therefore lack sufficient female role models for fair sporting behaviour; 
</p>
<p>(c) The gender wage gap in sport;  
</p>
<p>(d) The underrepresentation of women in leadership and management positions 
</p>
<p>in sporting organizations. 
</p>
<p>78. Other challenges include the lack of funds required for the promotion of sporting 
</p>
<p>activities, especially for vulnerable groups and persons with disabilities; the difficulties 
</p>
<p>associated with building sporting infrastructure, especially for the expensive activities that 
</p>
<p>cannot be practised by all; and doping. Generally, the provision of sporting facilities 
</p>
<p>remains an acute problem, although several inter-institutional alliances have been set up to 
</p>
<p>allow a wider population to gain access to the sporting facilities of educational centres. The 
</p>
<p>allocation of adequate resources for sport is also an issue. For instance, in some countries, 
</p>
<p>like Guatemala, priority has been given to those areas where violent episodes are more 
</p>
<p>frequent (&#8220;red zones&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>79. A very dangerous trend has been the appearance at sporting activities of racist and 
</p>
<p>extremist ideas within society arising as a result of economic or other critical domestic 
</p>
<p>challenges. Other obstacles refer to threats of sexual harassment and abuse in sport and the 
</p>
<p>poor representation of women in decision-making positions. There are also other obstacles 
</p>
<p>that might impede sport from promoting human rights, such as extreme nationalist 
</p>
<p>sentiment, which might impinge on others&#8217; rights and generate violence between athletes 
</p>
<p>and fans, thereby increasing hatred among all parties and eroding the rights of many. It is 
</p>
<p>therefore all the more important in such contexts to encourage the culture of friendship and 
</p>
<p>tolerance, a culture that could flourish if people did not have prejudices about each other. 
</p>
<p>80. In recent decades, it has been shown that, far from being a competitive activity, sport 
</p>
<p>is a multidimensional tool that substantially promotes quality of life and can indirectly 
</p>
<p>serve to bring nations together. Computerization, however, has become a prominent part of 
</p>
<p>the life of children and youth, thereby representing a non-negligible factor in drawing them 
</p>
<p>away from sport and other physical activities and possibly endangering their health and 
</p>
<p>physical development. </p>


<p>81. At the international level, the main challenges in the promotion of human rights 
</p>
<p>through sport and the Olympic ideal include the inclusion of professional athletes in the 
</p>
<p>Olympic games, the trading of athletes, the rapid introduction of technology in developing 
</p>
<p>countries (and the consequent increase of the cost of sporting activities) and the obligation 
</p>
<p>to recruit and pay sponsors in order to take part in high-level sporting events. This list is not 
</p>
<p>exhaustive, but it is evident that such practices have deeply affected the field of 
</p>
<p>international sport, especially in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>82. International athletes are often considered as commodities, for instance, in the World 
</p>
<p>Cup, where sometimes games have allegedly been rigged. The rights of athletes are 
</p>
<p>sometimes at stake owing to the exploitation they face. In many regions in the world, 
</p>
<p>athletes are treated like goods when they are being transferred from one club to another. 
</p>
<p>Although the word &#8220;sell&#8221; does not appear in the deals, the conditions may amount to 
</p>
<p>treating players like goods. Moreover, the deals struck with clubs are mostly arranged by 
</p>
<p>third parties, who work as middlemen. In certain instances, while the negotiations for deals 
</p>
<p>are in progress, the athletes may become the victims of human traffickers. 
</p>
<p>83. Another concern relates to the lack of a human rights code of conduct. For instance, 
</p>
<p>in Asia, the largest and most important Asian sporting confederation is the Asian Football 
</p>
<p>Confederation, which was established in 1954 in the Philippines and whose headquarters 
</p>
<p>are currently located in Malaysia. It is one of the six confederations that make up FIFA. 
</p>
<p>There has been no report of any serious human rights violations or abuses by the 
</p>
<p>Confederation in the past; however there have been a few allegations, which cannot be 
</p>
<p>substantiated. With the advancement of human rights issues in sport, a human rights code 
</p>
<p>of conduct for all affiliated members of the Confederation gains importance as a preventive 
</p>
<p>measure for any future human rights violation. For instance, a code of conduct 
</p>
<p>encompassing all federations under FIFA could be developed, enabling a culture of human 
</p>
<p>rights to flourish within the members of the Confederation, which would strengthen respect 
</p>
<p>for human rights in sport in general. 
</p>
<p>84. A lot of focus has been placed on competitive sport. However, the importance of 
</p>
<p>promoting non-competitive sports, or sports that do not produce opponents, those with a 
</p>
<p>collective and supportive nature, or those that do not have a winner and a loser, should also 
</p>
<p>not be disregarded. 
</p>
<p>85. Outdated coaching methods, which are hierarchical and confrontational, though this 
</p>
<p>cannot be generalized, also raise some concern. Structures such as the Winning Scotland 
</p>
<p>Foundation provide a new and inclusive approach to coaching techniques. 
</p>
<p>86. The behaviour of parents and caretakers on the touchline, lack of equal access to 
</p>
<p>sporting facilities and training times are also issues that need to be addressed, since these 
</p>
<p>are often factors that exclude young people from playing and participating. 
</p>
<p>87. Major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, can put children at a greater risk 
</p>
<p>of becoming victims of sexual exploitation, with the arrival of thousands of additional 
</p>
<p>tourists in a festive environment, thus increasing the number of potential abusers. Countries 
</p>
<p>that have recently hosted major sporting events, such as Brazil, Poland and South Africa, 
</p>
<p>deployed efforts to minimize the risks of children becoming victims of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>It is important to take stock of these recent efforts, good practices and lessons learned, in 
</p>
<p>order to minimize risks for vulnerable children. Through comprehensive and sustainable 
</p>
<p>child protection strategies, ethical and responsible sporting events can be developed. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National legislation and executive practice </b></p>


<p>88. <b>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee encourages States to:</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Strengthen existing legislation on the promotion and development of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sport and through sport;</b> 
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Adopt specific legislation on the prohibition of discrimination on all 
</b></p>
<p><b>grounds, including race, colour, sex, gender, sexual orientation, language, origin or 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion; doping; sexual exploitation; sexual harassment; and abuse in sport;</b> 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Continue and increase efforts at all levels to combat sexual exploitation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including of children, at major sporting events, and prevent any human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations related to sport;</b> 
</p>
<p>(d) <b>Provide access to sport at the national level, regardless of gender, race, 
</b></p>
<p><b>colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, origin, religion or social status;</b> 
</p>
<p>(e) <b>Guarantee constant safeguards against extreme nationalist sentiment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence in sport; unlawful influence on decision-making during competitions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other sporting events; and the discrediting of or undermining confidence in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>apolitical and autonomous nature of sport and sporting federations.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Programme support
