JUDGMENT

Mr W. Kurisaqila for the State
Mr Anil Singh for the Accused

I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up and after a consideration of the evidence and the opinion of the assessors, I have no difficulty in finding the case against the Accused is not proved. In bringing in a verdict of not guilty I do not do so because of a doubt I harbour, but I do so because I am convinced he is not responsible for the crime.

The Accused is acquitted, and is discharged.

Sekonaia Toka you may stand down from the dock.

I express my thanks to the 3 assessors for their careful deliberations.

Solicitors for the Accused: Legal Aid Commission
