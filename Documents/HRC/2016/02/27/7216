<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, 
</p>
<p>reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence presents the key activities undertaken by him 
</p>
<p>between July 2014 and June 2015. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur elaborates on the main elements of a framework for 
</p>
<p>designing State policies regarding &#8220;guarantees of non-recurrence&#8221;. Offering conceptual 
</p>
<p>clarity to the term &#8220;guarantees of non-recurrence&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur suggests 
</p>
<p>structuring such policies around three main spheres of intervention. At the level of official 
</p>
<p>State institutions, the report begins with a reminder of some basic conditions, including 
</p>
<p>security and legal identity, and proceeds to offer a range of initiatives, including the 
</p>
<p>ratification of relevant treaties; justice and security sector reforms; changes in security 
</p>
<p>legislation; and constitutional reforms, incorporating the separation of powers principle, 
</p>
<p>removing discriminatory provisions and incorporating a bill of rights. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur then draws attention to two spheres of intervention, the potential of which has 
</p>
<p>not been frequently examined as part of guarantees of non-recurrence, namely, civil society 
</p>
<p>and the spheres of culture and personal dispositions. In these sections, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur mentions the importance of legal empowerment and the creation of an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment in order for civil society to discharge its crucial role. Finally, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur emphasizes the preventive potential of education reform, arts and culture, and 
</p>
<p>trauma counselling. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
</p>
<p> ** The annex to the present report is circulated as received, in the language of submission only. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that &#8220;guarantees of non-
</p>
<p>recurrence&#8221; should be considered not as a rhetorical device but as an object of 
</p>
<p>policymaking. The Special Rapporteur highlights that, in order to develop an effective 
</p>
<p>preventive State policy, interventions in all three areas are necessary. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s set of general recommendations for truth commissions and 
</p>
<p>archives is presented in an annex to the present report.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of 
</p>
<p>truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence pursuant to Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 27/3. In it, the Special Rapporteur presents the key activities 
</p>
<p>undertaken from July 2014 to June 2015, and addresses the topic of establishing a 
</p>
<p>policy on guarantees of non-recurrence in the aftermath of mass violations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits and regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur undertook a country visit to Burundi ( see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/30/42/Add.1; A/HRC/30/CRP.1) and an advisory visit to Sri Lanka.1 He 
</p>
<p>thanks both Governments for their invitations and coopera tion.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to announce he will undertake a country 
</p>
<p>visit to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in November 
</p>
<p>2015. A further invitation was extended by the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Other 
</p>
<p>pending visit requests concern Brazil, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo, Guatemala, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Rwanda and Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur will undertake a regional consultation on transitional 
</p>
<p>justice for the Asia-Pacific region in December 2015. As with previous consultations, 
</p>
<p>the results will form part of the study requested in paragraph 1 (f) of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 18/7.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>5. From July 2014 to June 2015, the Special Rapporteur sent communications to 
</p>
<p>Chile, Egypt, Guatemala, Italy, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, 
</p>
<p>Serbia, Spain and the Russian Federation;2 prepared an open letter to the United 
</p>
<p>States of America; and issued press releases on Argentina, Bosnia  and Herzegovina, 
</p>
<p>Burundi, Colombia, Nepal, Spain and the United States.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. In August 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated as panellist in a national 
</p>
<p>forum on victims, organized in Cali, Colombia, at the request of the peace 
</p>
<p>negotiation representatives of the Government of Columbia and the Revolutionary 
</p>
<p>Armed Forces of Colombia &#8211; People&#700;s Army (FARC-EP).3  
</p>
<p>7. During the period in question, the Special Rapporteur presented his report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/56) addressing the topic of prosecutorial strategies in the aftermath of 
</p>
<p>mass atrocities and his visit reports on Spain and Uruguay (A/HRC/27/56/Add.1 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/27/56/Add. 2, respectively). In addition, he was a panellist in the Human 
</p>

<p>Rights Council panel debate on history teaching and memorialization processes, and 
</p>
<p>participated in side events on gender and transitional justice and experiences on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of transitional justice measures. He met with representatives of 
</p>
<p>Armenia, Cambodia, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Guatemala, Japan, Nepal, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States 
</p>
<p>and Uruguay, as well as several non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>8. In September 2014, the Special Rapporteur, the International Committee of 
</p>
<p>the Red Cross and the organization Swisspeace organized in Geneva an expert 
</p>
<p>workshop entitled &#8220;Archives in the Context of the Right to Know&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, in September 2014, the Special Rapporteur attended a regional 
</p>
<p>conference in Guatemala on the role of the judiciary in the fight against impunity for 
</p>
<p>international crimes. 
</p>
<p>10. In October, the Special Rapporteur, with the founding office of the Nuremberg 
</p>
<p>Principles Academy, conducted an expert workshop on  guarantees of non-recurrence, 
</p>
<p>held in Nuremberg, Germany. 
</p>
<p>11. Also in October, he presented to the General Assembly his report (A/69/518) 
</p>
<p>addressing reparations for victims in the aftermath of mass violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>12. In January 2015, the Special Rapporteur held meetings in Addis Ababa on the 
</p>
<p>draft African Union Transitional Justice Framework, including with the African 
</p>
<p>Union Commissioner for Political Affairs, the African Union Chairperson&#8217;s Special 
</p>
<p>Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, and donors agencies and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>13. In February 2015, the Special Rapporteur presented a keynote speech at the 
</p>
<p>conference entitled &#8220;Truth Commissions and Peace Processes: International 
</p>
<p>Experiences and Challenges for Colombia&#8221;, organized by the Kofi Annan Foundation 
</p>
<p>and the International Centre for Transitional Justice in Bogota.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Guarantees of non-recurrence as part of a comprehensive 
transitional justice strategy 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur addresses the topic of developing 
</p>
<p>a State policy on guarantees of non-recurrence in the aftermath of mass violations,  
</p>
<p>understood as part of a comprehensive transitional justice strategy. It is to be read in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with the 2015 report of the Special Rapporteur, to be presented to the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly at its seventieth session, in which the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>elaborates on the topic of transitional justice and security sector reform.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal foundation 
</b></p>
<p>15. International standards on guarantees of non-recurrence have grown 
</p>
<p>significantly since 1993, when the term was first used in a United Nations report. 4 
</p>
<p>This is demonstrated, inter alia, by the explicit reference to &#8220;guarantees of non-
</p>
<p>repetition&#8221; in the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/8, paras. 47 and 48, and 55; and section IX, principle 11. </p>


<p>16. In 2004, the Human Rights Committee held that the purposes of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &#8220;would be defeated without an 
</p>
<p>obligation integral to article 2 to take measures to prevent a recurrence of a violation 
</p>
<p>of the Covenant. Accordingly, it has been a frequent practice of the Committee &#8230; to 
</p>
<p>include &#8230; the need for measures, beyond a victim-specific remedy, to be taken to 
</p>
<p>avoid recurrence of the type of violation in question&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>17. The first jurisprudence by the Committee regarding right-to-life cases 
</p>
<p>requiring States to &#8220;take steps to ensure that similar violations did not occur in the 
</p>
<p>future&#8221; dates back to the 1980s.6 The former Special Rapporteur, Theo van Boven, 
</p>
<p>argued on that basis that &#8220;there exists a definite link between effective remedies to 
</p>
<p>which the victim(s) is (are) entitled, remedies aimed at the prevention of the 
</p>
<p>recurrence of similar violations and the issue of the follow -up given by the State 
</p>
<p>party&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>18. The general commitment to adhere to a right involves making efforts to ensure 
</p>
<p>that its violation ceases and is not repeated. The duty to prevent recurrence is hence 
</p>
<p>closely linked to the obligation of cessation of an ongoing violation. On this basis, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;guarantees serve a preventive function and may be described as a positive 
</p>
<p>reinforcement of future performance&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>19. Regional human rights courts and human rights treaty bodies have, with 
</p>
<p>increasing frequency, issued orders related to guaranteeing non -recurrence. For 
</p>
<p>example, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has interpreted its remedial 
</p>
<p>powers broadly and ordered remedies directed not only at victims, but also at 
</p>
<p>communities and towards society at large. Significant progress by the Court includes 
</p>
<p>a practice of requiring States to take measures to preserve the victim&#8217;s memory or 
</p>
<p>making relevant parts of its ruling public for educational purposes. 9 On legislative 
</p>
<p>reform, the Court held that laws that place civilians under military court jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>are a violation of the American Convention on Human Rights; consequently, it 
</p>
<p>ordered the State to change the legislation. 10 Such orders are not uncommon in Court 
</p>
<p>decisions. As the Court argued in its landmark Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez decision, States 
</p>
<p>are obliged &#8220;to organize the governmental apparatus and, in general, all the 
</p>
<p>structures through which public power is exercised, so that they are capable of 
</p>
<p>juridically ensuring the free and full enjoyment of human rights&#8221; .11  
</p>
<p><b> B. Conceptual issues 
</b></p>
<p>20. Despite the significant growth of the relevant international standards, the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;guarantees of non-recurrence&#8221; requires elaboration regarding the following 
</p>
<p>conceptual questions:

<p> (a) The &#8220;offer&#8221;, as it is not clear what is meant by a &#8220;guarantee&#8221;;  
</p>
<p> (b) The &#8220;object&#8221;, as the reference in the foundational texts12 to the non-
</p>
<p>recurrence of gross violation of human rights by States has widened to include the non-
</p>
<p>recurrence of &#8220;international crimes&#8221; committed by State and non-State actors, the non-
</p>
<p>recurrence of atrocities and even of the non-recurrence of violent conflict;13  
</p>
<p> (c) The &#8220;subject&#8221;, or who the beneficiaries of the guarantees are supposed to be, 
</p>
<p>i.e., the victims, a wider group of &#8220;potential&#8221; victims or society at large;  
</p>
<p> (d) The &#8220;duty bearers&#8221;, i.e., those supposed to fulfil their obligation to provide 
</p>
<p>said guarantees.  
</p>
<p>21. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur aims at contributing conceptual 
</p>
<p>clarity about &#8220;guarantees of non-recurrence&#8221;; acknowledging the breadth of the field, 
</p>
<p>yet giving it some structure, without being necessarily comprehensive; and 
</p>
<p>highlighting areas that have not received appropriate attention.   
</p>
<p>22. Furthermore, the main interests underlying the report are practical, and aim to 
</p>
<p>show that the topic can be concretely acted upon; demonstrate that it is a fit object of 
</p>
<p>rational policymaking, including planning, budgeting and monitoring; and offer a 
</p>
<p>general framework for designing an actionable non -recurrence policy.  
</p>
<p>23. Conceptually, there is a difference between guarantees of non-recurrence and 
</p>
<p>the remaining three core elements of a comprehensive transitional justice approach , 
</p>
<p>namely, truth, justice and reparation. While those three elements refer to measures, 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-recurrence is a function that can be satisfied by a broad variety of 
</p>
<p>measures. The foundational texts already demonstrate this variety, pointing to, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, reforming institutions, disbanding unofficial armed groups, repealing 
</p>
<p>emergency legislation incompatible with basic rights, vetting the secur ity forces and 
</p>
<p>the judiciary, protecting human rights defenders and training security forces in 
</p>
<p>human rights.  
</p>
<p>24. The core function of guarantees of non-recurrence is preventive in nature. It is 
</p>
<p>one to which truth, justice and reparation are themselves supposed to contribute: 
</p>
<p>criminal justice mainly through deterrence; truth commissions through disclosure, 
</p>
<p>clarification and the formulation of recommendations with a preventive intent; and 
</p>
<p>reparations by strengthening the hand of victims to claim redress for  the past and 
</p>
<p>future violations and to enforce their rights more assertively.  
</p>
<p>25. The preventive intent is the unifying thread in the foundational texts. Framing 
</p>
<p>an indicative reply to the aforementioned conceptual questions, the &#8220;offer&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-recurrence relates to a combination of deliberate, diverse 
</p>
<p>interventions that contribute to a reduction in the likelihood of recurring violations. 
</p>
<p>The &#8220;object&#8221; is not the prevention of isolated violations, but of gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. Such violations 
</p>
<p>presuppose systemic abuses of (State) power that have a specific pattern and rest on 
</p>
<p>a degree of organizational set-up.  
</p>
<p>26. The present report is written on the understanding that the &#8220;subject&#8221; of the 
</p>
<p>guarantees is the previously victimized society, seen at large, thus not limited to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12  E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1; E/CN.4/2004/88; General Assembly resolution 60/147; and 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1. 
</p>
<p> 13  See S/2004/616.  </p>


<p>direct or indirect victims.14 Given the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interest in exploring the 
</p>
<p>development of preventive policies, State institutions will be the main &#8220;duty 
</p>
<p>bearers&#8221;. Nonetheless, considering the diversity of the potential elements of a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive policy, those bearers are ultimately manifold.  
</p>
<p>27. Guarantees of non-recurrence are a function that can be satisfied by diverse 
</p>
<p>measures. Thus, there is no such thing as a general non-recurrence policy. An 
</p>
<p>effective policy designed to prevent systemic violations will need to adjust form to 
</p>
<p>function and choose the proper instruments.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Framing considerations 
</b></p>
<p>28. Three general considerations are relevant. First, transitional justice 
</p>
<p>programmes have not taken into account sufficiently the significant differences 
</p>
<p>between the post-authoritarian contexts, where the model of transitional justice 
</p>
<p>originally took shape, and the situations of (post-)conflict and fragility in which it is 
</p>
<p>now predominantly implemented. Two important differences relate to degrees of 
</p>
<p>(State) institutionalization and the types of violations, abuses and harms requiring 
</p>
<p>redress.  
</p>
<p>29. These differences play out as follows: criminal trials, truth commissions and 
</p>
<p>reparations programmes all rest upon certain institutional preconditions that are not 
</p>
<p>satisfied in all settings. Furthermore, those measures are effective instruments for 
</p>
<p>redressing certain kinds of violations and not others. The transfer of the model from 
</p>
<p>the post-authoritarian context to the (post-)conflict setting has taken place with 
</p>
<p>virtually no functional analysis.  
</p>
<p>30. The same applies to guarantees of non-recurrence: the institutional context, its 
</p>
<p>characteristics, capacities and history all matter, as do the cultural circumstances and 
</p>
<p>individual dispositions. Preventing mass violations does not call for the same 
</p>
<p>specific measures regardless of those factors. Similarly, the (risk of) prevalence of 
</p>
<p>some (patterns of) violations should naturally shape a prevention policy for a given 
</p>
<p>country.  
</p>
<p>31. In addition, transitional processes are dynamic. Therefore, besides allowing 
</p>
<p>for functional adequacy between means and ends and suitability to context, the 
</p>
<p>design of the policies to implement transitional justice elements should take into 
</p>
<p>account fittingness to a certain stage in a process. Thus, what is necessary and 
</p>
<p>feasible for prevention changes over time, not only as institutional characteristics 
</p>
<p>change, but also as the horizon of possibilities shifts.  
</p>
<p>32. Furthermore, the sort of transformations that are called for in order to 
</p>
<p>approximate anything resembling guarantees of non-recurrence following mass 
</p>
<p>violations cannot be achieved through &#8220;institutional engineering&#8221; or institutional 
</p>
<p>reforms alone. The challenge of achieving justice retrospectively and prospectively 
</p>
<p>is not merely a technical one. Lasting societal transformations require interventions 
</p>
<p>not only in the institutional sphere but also in the cultural sphere and at the level of 
</p>
<p>personal, individual dispositions. While culture and &#8220;character&#8221; play a stabilizing 
</p>
<p>function in social relations, and as such are by nature relatively immune to deliberate 
</p>
<p>change, they are not immutable altogether. Hence, in the present report, the Special 
</p>

<p>p. 261 (May 1997).  </p>


<p>Rapporteur pays attention to interventions in the cultural and the personal domains 
</p>
<p>that have received comparatively less attention.  
</p>
<p>33. Economic conditions and their relation to non-recurrence with a view to 
</p>
<p>meaningful transformation is a topic that does not receive sufficient focus. As argued 
</p>
<p>in previous reports, transitional justice cannot be thought to exhaust the agenda of 
</p>
<p>thorough political, social and economic transformation that is called for in the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of mass violations.  
</p>
<p>34. Although the causes of violence or violations of rights cannot be reduced to 
</p>
<p>inequality or poverty, singly or jointly, or to any straightforward combination of 
</p>
<p>social indicators, it is well known that both inequality and poverty correlate robustly 
</p>
<p>with violence and the violations of various rights, including civil and political, and 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural.15 Most of the violent conflicts in the world take place 
</p>
<p>in countries that are or have been deeply afflicted by large inequalities, poverty,  and 
</p>
<p>often both. 
</p>
<p>35. There are forms of economic exclusion that, if entrenched over time, may be 
</p>
<p>particularly detrimental to the enjoyment of rights. Persistent and durable 
</p>
<p>inequalities, but also some of the inequalities associated with rapid but highly 
</p>
<p>uneven economic growth, have been argued to be associated with both social 
</p>
<p>discontent and increases in criminal activities, violence and civil conflict. 16  
</p>
<p>36. The continuation in power of an abusive regime makes it impossible to 
</p>
<p>guarantee that violations will not be repeated. In some of these contexts, lack of 
</p>
<p>economic opportunities outside government-paid posts raises decisively the stakes of 
</p>
<p>losing power. This motivates the entrenchment of abusive regimes, increasingly also 
</p>
<p>observed through the subversion of democratic processes, and consequently 
</p>
<p>undermines the possibility of offering effective guarantees of non -recurrence. These 
</p>
<p>cases provide a compelling illustration of the economic and developmental 
</p>
<p>dimension to prevention, which must no longer be ignored and should be more 
</p>
<p>thoroughly analysed. 
</p>
<p>37. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur presents a range of interventions 
</p>
<p>from easily actionable to more ambitious, demanding interventions. This is not a 
</p>
<p>causal sequence. No intervention, large or small, on its own, in any of the three 
</p>
<p>spheres, is likely to offer sufficiently strong guarantees. The multidimensional 
</p>
<p>character of conflict and of rights violations needs to be matched by 
</p>
<p>multidimensional responses. The Special Rapporteur also demonstrates that there is 
</p>
<p>always something that can be done in order to diminish the likelihood of repeated 
</p>
<p>violations. Therefore, neither cost nor complexity of interventions is a legitimate 
</p>
<p>excuse for inaction.

<p><b> IV. Institutional interventions  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Basic preconditions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Security for all 
</b></p>
<p>38. Much reflection about redressing rights violations simply makes assumptions 
</p>
<p>about what is missing in the majority of the cases at hand, namely, functional State 
</p>
<p>institutions. In their original intent, human rights instruments were designed to 
</p>
<p>address &#8212; and in fact to redress and correct &#8212; abuses of State power. A great deal of 
</p>
<p>abuses, however, today takes place in areas of limited governance and by non -State 
</p>
<p>actors. Moreover, it should be highlighted that it is usually the most marginalized 
</p>
<p>who bear the brunt of the violations; the better-off have always more exit options 
</p>
<p>and can translate economic power into some degree of security. Non -recurrence 
</p>
<p>policies need to pay attention to the provision of effective security for all in full 
</p>
<p>compliance with all relevant rights-related standards including equality and fairness.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal identity  
</b></p>
<p>39. Proof of legal identity is crucial for the exercise of rights and for gaining 
</p>
<p>access to State services. It is generally a precondition for, inter  alia, participating in 
</p>
<p>most administrative and judicial proceedings, including those related to the violation 
</p>
<p>of fundamental rights; settling questions relating to civil status; voting or standing 
</p>
<p>for election and being appointed to office; obtaining a nationality and a passport; 
</p>
<p>gaining access to social security or other forms of State support; taking part in 
</p>
<p>commercial transactions, including entering contracts; opening bank accounts; and 
</p>
<p>acquiring a title to property.  
</p>
<p>40. International and regional human rights law recognize the right to legal 
</p>
<p>identity17 in time of peace and conflict. According to the United Nations Children's 
</p>
<p>Fund (UNICEF), approximately one third of all children under five worldwide have 
</p>
<p>never been registered.18 Statelessness, which affects more than 10 million people, 
</p>
<p>according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR), compounds the problem.19 Conflict negatively affects legal identity 
</p>
<p>through: (a) the absence or weakening of State presence and services; (b) migration 
</p>
<p>and displacement, often involving the loss of documents and the impossibility of 
</p>
<p>obtaining new ones; (c) fear and intimidation, for example, children being relocated 
</p>
<p>and forcibly conscripted; and (d) the deliberate destruction of registries, as has 
</p>
<p>happened during conflicts at least in Guatemala, Peru, Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
</p>
<p>Timor-Leste. In Cambodia, during the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s, all 
</p>
<p>documents relevant to civil status were destroyed. In Sierra Leone, where thousands 
</p>
<p>of children were abducted and forced to fight during the 10-year conflict, many had 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17  See International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 24; Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, arts. 7 and 8; International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance, art.25;  African Charter, art. 6; and American Convention on Human Rights, arts. 3 
</p>
<p>and 18.  
</p>

<p>no registration of their birth and lacked the means to trace their identity and identify 
</p>
<p>their families or communities.20  
</p>
<p>41. Officially recognized identity, substantiated through birth certificates or 
</p>
<p>identity documents, is a gateway for the realization of most fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>Legal identity is important for the purpose of having rights respected, for claiming 
</p>
<p>them and for obtaining redress when they are violated. Addressing  the challenges of 
</p>
<p>legal registration in the aftermath of conflict or repression provides an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>establish, restore or strengthen the foundations of a national registry that is 
</p>
<p>compulsory, universal, permanent and continuous, which secures the confidentiality 
</p>
<p>of personal data and is sensitive to cultural circumstances, including of minorities 
</p>
<p>and religious or indigenous groups. By facilitating statistical data, legal registration 
</p>
<p>can assist a Government to better plan, implement and monitor its service provision 
</p>
<p>and efforts towards the realization of the rights of the individuals and development 
</p>
<p>objectives. Addressing legal identity concerns in post-conflict or post-authoritarian 
</p>
<p>contexts provides a way for transitional justice mechanisms to have an impact 
</p>
<p>beyond their direct sphere of influence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ratification of treaties 
</b></p>
<p>42. While legal identity is a precondition for the exercise of rights, there are 
</p>
<p>measures that can proactively promote rights, both retrospectively, by redressing 
</p>
<p>their violation, and prospectively, by trying to prevent the violations. Some of these 
</p>
<p>tools have received legal expression in international treaties. A basic step in the 
</p>
<p>articulation of a non-recurrence policy, therefore, consists in the ratification of 
</p>
<p>relevant treaties concerning gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law.21 States should avoid, or withdraw, any reservation 
</p>
<p>that could raise doubts as to their compatibility with the object and purpose of the 
</p>
<p>treaty.  
</p>
<p>43. Because no law is self-executing, ratification alone can at best be taken as a 
</p>
<p>signalling device, which has the potential for misuse as &#8220;window dressing&#8221;, in which 
</p>
<p>case ratification can be followed by a worse human rights performance.22 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ratification, exemplifying what has been called &#8220;the paradox of empty 
</p>
<p>promises&#8221;,23 can lead to greater compliance if accompanied by various forms of 
</p>
<p>advocacy.24  
</p>
<p>44. Except for pure &#8220;monist&#8221; legal systems, ratification can lead to greater 
</p>
<p>compliance only if accompanied by the incorporation of treaty obligations into 
</p>
<p>domestic legislation. In such systems, therefore, a basic element of a non -recurrence 
</p>
<p>policy will require, in addition to ratification, a strategy of incorporation (and 
</p>
<p>desirably of monitoring and enforcement).

<p><b> C. Legal reforms 
</b></p>
<p>45. The incorporation of international legal obligations should at least cover the 
</p>
<p>following basic issues: the typification of relevant crimes; statutes of limitations and 
</p>
<p>retroactivity questions; and the introduction of reforms leading to de-incentivizing 
</p>
<p>violations, including regarding anti-terrorism legislation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Criminal types, statutes of limitation and retroactivity issues 
</b></p>
<p>46. The focus here is placed on the inclusion of measures that enable judicial and 
</p>
<p>non-judicial remedies for redressing gross human rights violations and serious 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law violations.  
</p>
<p>47. The incorporation of criminal types (offences) on the basis of international 
</p>
<p>law has the advantage not only of accurately reflecting international obligations, but 
</p>
<p>also of solving two problems that have increasingly become an excuse for inaction in 
</p>
<p>the face of systematic or widespread violations, namely, prescription and 
</p>
<p>retroactivity issues.  
</p>
<p>48. Common crimes in domestic jurisdictions are generally accompanied by 
</p>
<p>prescription regimes. The reasons to make &#8220;atrocity crimes&#8221; imprescriptible are, 
</p>
<p>first, that atrocity crimes raise particular investigatory and prosecutorial challenges 
</p>
<p>that usually cannot be met on the same schedule as common crimes; and second, that 
</p>
<p>imprescriptibility helps signal that such crimes constitute an affront to humanity, 
</p>
<p>communicating that, in theory, neither space nor time will provide escape from 
</p>
<p>responsibility.  
</p>
<p>49. The Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War 
</p>
<p>Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity,25 which also covers crimes of genocide and 
</p>
<p>those associated with apartheid, states that the relevant crimes are imprescriptible 
</p>
<p>&#8220;irrespective of the date of their commission&#8221;. International jurisprudence has 
</p>
<p>frequently reiterated that the Convention does not create new rights or obligations, 
</p>
<p>but that it is declarative in nature, and that the principle of imprescriptibility of war 
</p>
<p>crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is a matter of jus cogens.26 
</p>
<p>50. This helps to address claims regarding the retroactive application of criminal 
</p>
<p>law or violations of the principle of legality, in particular, of the principle that no one 
</p>
<p>should be punished for an act that was not proscribed by a law in force at the time of 
</p>
<p>commission.27 Jurisprudence from various courts shows the ways in which different 
</p>
<p>countries have confronted some of these challenges. Some countries have carried out 
</p>
<p>judicial processes for gross human rights violations using criminal types current in 
</p>
<p>their penal codes at the time of their commission, but, judging the offences to be 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity in accordance with jus cogens, they have attributed to those 
</p>
<p>violations some of the characteristics and consequences of international crimes, such 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 General assembly resolution 2391 (XXIII), 1968. 
</p>
<p> 26  See, for example, <i>The Prosecutor v. Klaus Barbie</i> (Supreme Court, France); <i>Kolk and Kislyiy v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Estonia</i> (European Court of Human Rights); <i>Priebke</i>, and <i>Arancibia Clavel</i> (Supreme Court, 
</p>
<p>Argentina); <i>Molco</i> (Supreme Court, Chile); <i>Barrios Altos</i>, and <i>Gelman</i> (Inter-American Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights). 
</p>
<p> 27 See Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 11 (2); International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, art. 15; Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, art. 7; 
</p>
<p>American Convention on Human Rights, art. 9.  </p>


<p>as imprescriptibility.28 Other courts have carried out judicial processes using criminal 
</p>
<p>types that may have not been present in national codes when the acts were 
</p>
<p>committed, arguing that this does not violate the principle of legality if international 
</p>
<p>law already declared the acts in question to be illegal when they were committed. 29 
</p>
<p>Indeed, domestic and international courts have found ways to guarantee 
</p>
<p>simultaneously respect to the principle of legality as well as due process and fair trial 
</p>
<p>standards for the defendants, and to the rights of victims to see the perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>violations brought to justice.30 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Emergency, security and counter-terrorism legislation 
</b></p>
<p>51. Another crucial legislative reform that is not particularly onerous in terms of 
</p>
<p>expenses or complexity is to ensure that emergency, anti -terrorism or other security-
</p>
<p>related legislation is fully compatible with human rights standards, so that it does not 
</p>
<p>incentivize violations of rights. Authoritarian regimes, regimes mired in conflict and, 
</p>
<p>for years now, States involved in so-called &#8220;wars on terrorism&#8221; almost invariably 
</p>
<p>adopt legislation that goes well beyond the objective security needs that purportedly 
</p>
<p>motivate it.31 Such laws have been seriously misused to justify gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. For example, in addition to allowing for prolonged periods of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;preventive&#8221; detention, constraining access to defence lawyers, the absence of the 
</p>
<p>review of the legality of detention by a court, among other limitations of rights, these 
</p>
<p>laws either directly or indirectly promote, even instigate, the violation of rights. This 
</p>
<p>is the case, for example, with the singly objectionable, jointly pernicious, removal of 
</p>
<p>bars on the use of evidence that may have been obtained illegally, frequently by 
</p>
<p>coercion, and the weakening of the safeguards under which &#8220;confessions&#8221; can be 
</p>
<p>given by detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Judicial reforms 
</b></p>
<p>52. Given the importance of an independent and effective judiciary in securing 
</p>
<p>rights &#8212; but also of acknowledging the dubious role some judiciaries have played in 
</p>
<p>pre-transitional periods in some countries &#8212; it is somewhat surprising that judicial 
</p>
<p>reform has not played a more prominent role in discussions about guarantees of non -
</p>
<p>recurrence. This is in spite of recommendations made by many truth commissions in 
</p>
<p>relation to judicial reform and the fact that many transitional countries have 
</p>
<p>reformed their justice systems.32 This serves as a good illustration of the lack of 
</p>
<p>focus and strategy in discussions about guarantees of non -recurrence, and of the 
</p>
<p>disconnect between transitional justice and other policy interventions with which it 
</p>
<p>coexists but rarely interacts.  
</p>
<p>53. In the aftermath of mass violations, committed sometimes with the 
</p>
<p>collaboration of the judiciary, or in any case having shown itself an insufficient 
</p>
<p>bulwark against the violations, there are three important issues that should be tackled 
</p>
<p>in order to help prevent future violations: (a) screening judicial personnel; (b) 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 See <i>Arancibia Clavel</i> and <i>Sim&#243;n </i>(Supreme Court, Argentina); and <i>Fujimori</i> (Specialized Criminal 
</p>
<p>Law Chamber, Peru).  
</p>
<p> 29  See Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Appeals Chamber, <i>STL-11-01/I, </i>paras.132 and 133; <i>P&#233;rez Garc&#237;a</i> 
</p>
<p>(Colombia).  
</p>
<p> 30  See <i>Scilingo </i>and<i> Pinochet</i> (National High Criminal Court, Spain); <i>Gelman</i>.  </p>
<p> 31 See A/HRC/16/51/Add.2; and A/HRC/25/59/Add.2.  
</p>
<p> 32  See Linn A. Hammergren, <i>Justice Reform and Development: Rethinking Donor Assistance to 
</i></p>
<p><i>Developing and Transitional Countries</i> (Routledge, Oxford, 2014).  </p>


<p>strengthening judicial independence; and (c) strengthening judicial competencies in 
</p>
<p>areas specifically important for preventive purposes.  
</p>
<p>54. If judiciaries virtually everywhere can at times be subjects of mistrust, in 
</p>
<p>contexts of past mass violations, some are so tainted with complicity that it is 
</p>
<p>virtually impossible for them to gain trust without a major vetting  or screening of 
</p>
<p>their personnel, from the top down. Particularly in places in which higher court 
</p>
<p>judges have responsibilities for the administration of courts, including case 
</p>
<p>allotment, judicial career and disciplinary procedures, as well as a voice in decisions 
</p>
<p>about judicial reforms, a judiciary entirely appointed by a predecessor regime, seen 
</p>
<p>as complicit in past mass violation, will stand in need of major personnel review.   
</p>
<p>55. The vetting of judges poses particular challenges because procedures need to 
</p>
<p>respect the separation of powers, judicial autonomy, due process guarantees and, if it 
</p>
<p>exists, the general principle of the irremovability of judges, which may only be 
</p>
<p>transgressed in exceptional cases.33 Furthermore, even a judiciary dependent on the 
</p>
<p>executive power is, in most cases, far from being a powerless branch. Some 
</p>
<p>countries under quite difficult circumstances have managed to vet the judiciary, 
</p>
<p>showing respect for the relevant principles, including due process. The latest country 
</p>
<p>to embark in such a project has been Kenya.34  
</p>
<p>56. Continuing judicial training should include information about the role of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary in past violations; the capacity to self-criticize needs to be exemplified by 
</p>
<p>the judiciary above all branches of government.  
</p>
<p>57. Changes in personnel are insufficient to turn ineffective or complicit 
</p>
<p>judiciaries into trustworthy arbiters and reliable guarantors of rights. Prospectively, 
</p>
<p>structural changes are necessary, including means to strengthen judicial 
</p>
<p>independence, as many truth commissions have recommended.35 Without such 
</p>
<p>reforms, the likelihood that courts will (at least) dare to check executive powers will 
</p>
<p>not increase significantly, and will be entirely dependent on the virtue of particular 
</p>
<p>individuals.  
</p>
<p>58. There is no single reform that can guarantee that judges will act 
</p>
<p>independently. However, opportunities for individuals to exercise judgement 
</p>
<p>independently are increased if they are offered certain protections , including 
</p>
<p>recruitment on the basis of merit and objective criteria; security of tenure; adequate 
</p>
<p>terms of service, for example, remuneration and predictable conditions of retirement; 
</p>
<p>and transparent, reliable disciplinary processes, for example, fair procedures, 
</p>
<p>proportionate sanctions, promotions, dismissals and transfers, so that the fears of 
</p>
<p>losing their jobs, not being promoted or being arbitrarily transferred to an 
</p>
<p>undesirable location do not influence their opinions.   
</p>
<p>59. Guaranteeing the physical safety of judges is a decisive condition of the 
</p>
<p>exercise of independent judgement.  
</p>

<p>60. In addition to guaranteeing the individual independence of judges, it is also 
</p>
<p>important to strengthen the institutional independence of the judiciary. This can be 
</p>
<p>accomplished by enshrining the separation of powers in constitutional texts and/or 
</p>
<p>practices; using methods for appointing judges and magistrates that signal a  
</p>
<p>valuation of competence and independence rather than political affiliation; endowing 
</p>
<p>the judiciary with sufficient resources and providing it with budgetary and 
</p>
<p>administrative autonomy; ensuring that cases are assigned on the basis of objective 
</p>
<p>criteria; and respecting and enforcing the decisions of courts, even when they are 
</p>
<p>contrary to the interests of the executive or its supporters, including regarding 
</p>
<p>significant issues for the Government, such as electoral questions.  
</p>
<p>61. For the adjudication of cases involving mass violations, judicial systems need 
</p>
<p>to build and further develop specialized capacities regarding the widespread and 
</p>
<p>systemic nature of violations and the identification of respective patterns and nodes 
</p>
<p>in networks of systemic crimes, as they require a change in investigative, 
</p>
<p>prosecutorial and adjudication techniques and practices. 36 In many jurisdictions, 
</p>
<p>familiarity with international human rights and humanitarian law is weak to non -
</p>
<p>existent. Familiarity with the peculiarities of &#8220;structure  crimes&#8221;,37 such as genocide, 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity and war crimes, which rest upon a network of actors, is 
</p>
<p>even scarcer. Dismantling networks of such criminality, some of which are 
</p>
<p>ensconced in State institutions, i.e. in torture cases, through the implementation of an 
</p>
<p>appropriate strategy ably pursued by prosecutors and competently adjudicated by 
</p>
<p>judges is one of the most effective contributions a judicial system can make to 
</p>
<p>preventing the recurrence of violations. Such capacities are sometimes best 
</p>
<p>expressed and built in the establishment of specialized (pre -)investigatory offices, 
</p>
<p>courts or tribunals.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Constitutional reform 
</b></p>
<p>62. The following is a set of constitutional issues, presented in a rough ascending 
</p>
<p>order of complexity, that transitioning countries could make part of their non -
</p>
<p>recurrence policy.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Removing discriminatory provisions, introducing mechanisms of inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>63. The removal from constitutions and other laws or by-laws of any provisions 
</p>
<p>that may fuel discrimination, a well-known source of social strife, is likely to 
</p>
<p>contribute to the prevention of violations. Several truth commissions and peace 
</p>
<p>agreements have made recommendations to this effect. For instance, the Sierra 
</p>
<p>Leonean Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended removing racist and 
</p>
<p>sexist provisions governing citizenship, arguing that citizenship should be acquired 
</p>
<p>by birth, descent or naturalization. In Morocco, the Instance &#233;quit&#233; et r&#233;conciliation 
</p>
<p>argued for a constitutional prohibition on all forms of internationally prohibited 
</p>
<p>discrimination and any incitation to racism, hatred or violence. The Arusha Peace 
</p>
<p>and Reconciliation Accord (2000), which aimed at settling the conflict in Burundi, 
</p>
<p>banned all political or other associations that advocated ethnic, religious or gender 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and laid the basis for the consociational power -sharing agreement, 
</p>

<p>which the 2005 Constitution set in place, and on which peace in Burundi still 
</p>
<p>hinges.38 
</p>
<p>64. Truth commissions and peace agreements have advocated for introducing 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of inclusion into constitutional texts. The Guatemalan Peace Accord, for 
</p>
<p>example, emphasized the need to define the country as multi-ethnic, multicultural, 
</p>
<p>and multilingual at the constitutional level. The Guatemalan Commission on 
</p>
<p>Historical Clarification elaborated recommendations on inclusion and the protection 
</p>
<p>of indigenous rights, calling for modes of governance that enable individual and 
</p>
<p>collective rights of the indigenous population and encourage their socia l and political 
</p>
<p>participation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Incorporating a bill of rights 
</b></p>
<p>65. A good part of the effectiveness of bills of rights depends on the strength of 
</p>
<p>the courts that interpret them and on how deeply other State powers feel bound by 
</p>
<p>courts&#8217; decisions. However, introducing a bill of rights that publically enumerates the 
</p>
<p>most fundamental rights a country seeks to safeguard is a powerful way of drawing a 
</p>
<p>line between an abusive past and a different future, especially in the aftermath of 
</p>
<p>mass violations. The design of a bill of rights and enshrining the basic principles of 
</p>
<p>governance signals to institutions and individuals where minimum standards of 
</p>
<p>acceptable behaviour lie. Bills of rights are a sort of a &#8220;pre-commitment&#8221; strategy 
</p>
<p>that works on the basis of publicity and takes some issues out of the give -and-take of 
</p>
<p>political expediency.39  
</p>
<p>66. In many countries with past mass violations, minorities were predominantly 
</p>
<p>targeted. Articulating clear and enforceable guarantees for minorities in bills of 
</p>
<p>rights may offer some protection and de-incentivize both attacks on them and the 
</p>
<p>taking by them of preemptive action in ways that are characteristic of &#8220;security 
</p>
<p>dilemmas&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>67. Where Governments have a history of committing or condoning human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, a bill of rights enables courts to identify legislation and governmental 
</p>
<p>practices that have the potential to lead to recurrence of violations before they take 
</p>
<p>place.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Security sector reform  
</b></p>
<p>68. Crucial elements in the area of security sector reform aiming at the prevention 
</p>
<p>of violations in the future pertain to: (a) defining the different roles of the police, the 
</p>
<p>military and the intelligence services; (b) strengthening civilian control over the 
</p>
<p>armed forces; (c) the elimination of military &#8220;prerogatives&#8221;; and (d) the vetting of 
</p>
<p>the security forces. In the light of the complexity of these areas, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has dedicated a separate report to these reform undertakings. 40  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Separation of powers 
</b></p>
<p>69. Abuses of power by security forces and lack of judicial independence are 
</p>
<p>often manifestations of the same phenomenon, namely, a bloated and unrestrained 
</p>
<p>executive power uninterested in accountability. Following mass violations, some 
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Democracy</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1993). </p>
<p> 40  Report to be presented to the General Assembly at its seventieth session. </p>


<p>countries reconsider issues such as the separation of powers and endeavo ur to limit 
</p>
<p>executive powers. The 2010 Constitution of Kenya, for example, curbs some of the 
</p>
<p>powers given to the President by the 1963 Constitution and successive amendments, 
</p>
<p>which had increased the powers of the President while weakening the legislature and 
</p>
<p>the judiciary. Most recently, the authorities in Sri Lanka presented to parliament the 
</p>
<p>XIX Amendment, ending the era of the so-called &#8220;executive presidency&#8221;, devolving 
</p>
<p>to parliament some of the powers that the office of the President had accumulated 
</p>
<p>over time to the detriment of the remaining State powers.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Limiting the scope of military justice 
</b></p>
<p>70. Militaries in most countries operate their own courts because the military 
</p>
<p>relies on distinct regulations, laws and codes of conduct, and the enforcement of 
</p>
<p>those codes, including disciplinary procedures, requires special mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>International law, however, is clear that the jurisdiction of military courts is 
</p>
<p>restricted to trying members of the military for military offenses, to the exclusion of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. 41 
</p>
<p>Trying civilians in military courts or trying members of the military for crimes other 
</p>
<p>than military crimes contravenes international law. Circumventing this key principle 
</p>
<p>is one of the most prevalent ways of shielding violations committed by the military 
</p>
<p>from accountability.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Establishing a constitutional court  
</b></p>
<p>71. Many transitioning countries, including virtually all the countries in the &#8220;third 
</p>
<p>wave&#8221; of democratization,42 have introduced a separate constitutional court, largely 
</p>
<p>following the lead of Germany after the Second World War. 43 The establishment of 
</p>
<p>such courts distinguishes the adjudication of routine, ordinary matters from crucial 
</p>
<p>decisions on fundamental rights. This distinction provides an elegant way out of a 
</p>
<p>dilemma faced by countries that do not trust judges appointed by a predecessor 
</p>
<p>regime to be the last arbiters of the most fundamental rights -related questions, but 
</p>
<p>that cannot afford to vet the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>72. There is no court, however, that can be entirely responsible for the protection 
</p>
<p>of rights if other branches of power are determined to commit violations , or if non-
</p>
<p>State actors are determined to commit abuses. Similarly, no court, on its own, can 
</p>
<p>sustain the rule of law in the face of attacks from other powers or indifference from 
</p>
<p>citizens.44 Membership in constitutional courts can be manipulated, judges coerced 45 
</p>
<p>or corrupted, and new ways of subverting legal order, which constitutional courts 
</p>
<p>were not designed to counter, have emerged.46 
</p>
<p>73. Notably, for a constitutional court to be effective in protecting individuals&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights and preventing violations, it needs to be vested with an individual complaints

<p>procedure, whereby an individual can challenge the infringement of his or her rights 
</p>
<p>by any public act or omission.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Adopting a new constitution 
</b></p>
<p>74. Many countries are tempted to adopt a new constitution immediately after a 
</p>
<p>transition. Some countries have succeeded in such an effort, including Spain in 1978 
</p>
<p>and, more recently, Kenya in 2010 and Tunisia in 2014, in a display of maturity and 
</p>
<p>self-restraint on the part of Assembly members that did the country proud.  There can 
</p>
<p>hardly be a more powerful way to mark a line between the present and the past and 
</p>
<p>to introduce guarantees and protections that were missing or ineffective before. 
</p>
<p>Provided the country can complete the constitution-making exercise and that the new 
</p>
<p>provisions are in fact observed, a new constitution enshrining a bill of rights and 
</p>
<p>principles of governance is likely to be the central part of a non -recurrence policy.  
</p>
<p>75. However, constitutions are, regretfully, more often breached than observed. It 
</p>
<p>might be that engaging in the far-reaching &#8220;existential&#8221; questions characteristic of 
</p>
<p>constitutional debates proves to be a distraction in the early days of a transition, in a 
</p>
<p>context in which State institutions might be required to urgently establish their 
</p>
<p>capacity to meet more immediate needs. The first phase of a transition might not be 
</p>
<p>the most conducive context for guaranteeing that the constitution will indeed be 
</p>
<p>inclusive enough; it may be that political actors are insufficiently representative or 
</p>
<p>that, in the absence of previous opportunities in countries lacking the required 
</p>
<p>political traditions, actors at the table on the cusp of the transition are insufficiently 
</p>
<p>versed in the complicated type of judgement that is called for if a sufficiently 
</p>
<p>inclusive, sustainable constitution is to be articulated. Some of these factors might 
</p>
<p>invite participants in constitutional debates to adopt a zero-sum attitude thinking that 
</p>
<p>this is their (only) chance. All of these elements put obstacles in the process expected 
</p>
<p>to produce a foundation that is good for all and for a long time.   
</p>
<p>76. Therefore, it may be advisable for countries to expand their repertoire of 
</p>
<p>options for constitutional reform to include, for instance, the adoption of transitional 
</p>
<p>or interim constitutional arrangements, as South Africa did, or incremental processes 
</p>
<p>of constitutional renewal, as in Hungary and Poland after 1989.47 More gradual 
</p>
<p>processes of constitution-making are likely to lower the stakes for all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>This might open the possibility of achieving a greater degree of consensus over 
</p>
<p>issues of critical importance.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Societal interventions 
</b></p>
<p>77. Prevention is not merely a matter of making changes in texts; prevention calls 
</p>
<p>for changes in practice. Hence, legal reforms need to be accompanied by initiatives 
</p>
<p>that can change &#8220;factor endowments&#8221;, including available resources and, 
</p>
<p>importantly, human capacity.  
</p>
<p>78. Most discussions of guarantees of non-recurrence have focused on the reform 
</p>
<p>of official State institutions. However, in contexts of past mass violations, State 
</p>
<p>institutions are often weak, inefficient and/or corrupt. Even if they are honest and 
</p>
<p>relatively competent, they may have very limited reach, as in some countries the 
</p>
<p>majority of conflicts are settled through informal mechanisms.  
</p>

</p>
<p>Making&#8221;, <i>Willliam and Mary Law Review</i>, vol. 49, iss. 4 (2008).  </p>


<p>79. The contribution of civil society organizations to transitional processes has 
</p>
<p>been analysed is various ways, including regarding their advocacy function, their 
</p>
<p>crucial role in collecting and preserving evidence, their monitoring functions and 
</p>
<p>their reconciliation initiatives. All of these are crucial. However, in the present 
</p>
<p>report, the Special Rapporteur concentrates on a more prevention-specific argument. 
</p>
<p>He presents a series of initiatives that may enhance the preventive potential of civil 
</p>
<p>society, ordered by degree of ambitiousness and complexity, showing how this 
</p>
<p>potential, in many ways, is a manifestation of a &#8220;power of aggregation&#8221; that 
</p>
<p>counteracts the &#8220;disarticulating power&#8221; of terror and that works by lowering the costs 
</p>
<p>of raising claims. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Ceasing attacks and threats and removing obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>80. One of the simplest ways of enabling civil society to contribute to preventive 
</p>
<p>work is simply to refrain from persecuting, intimidating and harassing civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives, including human rights defenders. 48  
</p>
<p>81. Another step is to remove many of the legal and practical barriers that have 
</p>
<p>been placed on civil society with increased frequency in the recent past. According 
</p>
<p>to one report, &#8220;between 2004 and 2010, more than 50 countries considered or 
</p>
<p>enacted measures restricting civil society. Since 2012, more than 90 laws 
</p>
<p>constraining the freedoms of association or assembly have been proposed or 
</p>
<p>enacted.&#8221;49 These laws introduce obstacles of various types, such as barriers to 
</p>
<p>operational activity, free speech and advocacy, contact and communication, peace ful 
</p>
<p>assembly and access to funding.  
</p>
<p>82. Such strong governmental interest in hampering the work of civil society 
</p>
<p>confirms yet again the importance of the latter. This consolation, however, does not 
</p>
<p>make up for the different kinds of risks and privations that these obstacles generate, 
</p>
<p>including violations of the right to physical integrity and the weakening of 
</p>
<p>monitoring and advocacy capacities to prevent violations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal empowerment 
</b></p>
<p>83. A more proactive way of strengthening civil society is to estab lish 
</p>
<p>programmes targeted at the community level, focusing on those who have 
</p>
<p>traditionally been excluded from the protection of the law, particularly women, with 
</p>
<p>the specific aim of facilitating the use of the law, the legal system and legal services 
</p>
<p>to advance their own rights, promote government accountability and resolve local 
</p>
<p>disputes.  
</p>
<p>84. Legal empowerment can contribute to restoring the sense of agency of control 
</p>
<p>over one&#8217;s life that mass violations erode. These initiatives have also acted as a 
</p>
<p>catalyst for social organizations and led to the enhanced ability, confidence and 
</p>
<p>willingness of individuals and communities to participate in sociopolitical processes, 
</p>
<p>including transitional justice mechanisms. This empowerment typically also brings 
</p>
<p>with it a more assertive attitude of civil society actors to prevent violations in the 
</p>
<p>future by enforcing their rights more confidently.  
</p>

<p><b> C. Creating enabling environments  
</b></p>
<p>85. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur encourages further reflection and 
</p>
<p>study on the ways in which the strengthening of civil society can contribute to 
</p>
<p>prevention. In earlier reports, observations were made about the fact that , without 
</p>
<p>civil society participation, little progress would have been made in the domains of 
</p>
<p>truth, justice and reparations. It is overwhelmingly thanks to the unrelenting 
</p>
<p>advocacy of civil society organizations that accountability remains on the political 
</p>
<p>agenda in countries with past mass violations. It is difficult to think of the efforts of 
</p>
<p>Argentina to achieve justice without the contribution of the organizations Madres de 
</p>
<p>la Plaza de Mayo and the centre for legal and social studies (CELS); those of Chile 
</p>
<p>without the contribution of the Vicar&#237;a de la Solidaridad; or those of Guatemala 
</p>
<p>without the persistence of the centre for human rights legal action (CALDH), to 
</p>
<p>name only a few examples.  
</p>
<p>86. Because &#8220;civil society&#8221; should not be reduced to &#8220;non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations&#8221;, it is important to recall that, in all transitional processes, a variety of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including trade unions and religious organizations, have made essential 
</p>
<p>contributions. To illustrate, although the role of the Catholic Church during the 
</p>
<p>dictatorships in Argentina and Spain and during the genocide in Rwanda has  been 
</p>
<p>questioned, its contributions to the search for accountability in Chile, Uruguay and to 
</p>
<p>this day in Burundi are notable. Similarly, trade unions have made crucial 
</p>
<p>contributions to many transitional processes, including in South Africa, Poland and , 
</p>
<p>recently, in Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>87. Because most transitional processes have been &#8220;liberalizing&#8221; and therefore, 
</p>
<p>over time, both trade union and church affiliations decline, the contribution of these 
</p>
<p>groups tends to be overlooked. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the significance of their contribution not only for the sake of historical 
</p>
<p>accuracy, but also because it gives an important indication about the type of civil 
</p>
<p>society that we should aim at if we are interested in prevention.   
</p>
<p>88. Authoritarianism has not disappeared as a threat to human rights, and other 
</p>
<p>threats have been added. Despite significant differences among them, systematic 
</p>
<p>threats to rights share a common element: violence or threats of violence undermine 
</p>
<p>civic trust, a phenomenon that creates a negative feedback loop and becomes both a 
</p>
<p>condition and a consequence of the continuation of violence.  
</p>
<p>89. Hence the importance of strengthening civil society. In past reports, more 
</p>
<p>concerned with issues of redress, the point to emphasize was that a strong civil 
</p>
<p>society diminishes the costs and risks of raising claims, both for individuals and 
</p>
<p>groups. In the context of a discussion about prevention, the point to emphasize is that 
</p>
<p>in a strong civil society, in which individuals and groups are empowered to exercise 
</p>
<p>their rights, the violation of rights is less likely.  
</p>
<p>90. Because civil society cannot be reduced to formal institutions, it would be a 
</p>
<p>mistake to conceive the project of strengthening civil society on the model of an 
</p>
<p>institutional reform process. Civil society by its very nature is not part of the State 
</p>
<p>and therefore does not respond to State initiatives as if it were.   
</p>
<p>91. The strengthening and enhancing of the preventive potential of civil society 
</p>
<p>are likely to come from such contributing factors as (a) the active promotion of the 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms of expression and opinion, of peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association and of religion; (b) the establishment of an education system that 
</p>
<p>provides opportunities to develop not just marketable skills but critical thinking; and 
</p>
<p>(c) the preservation of traditions of openness, transparency and consultation, more </p>


<p>than from the mere removal of obstacles to the operation of non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Interventions in the cultural and the individual spheres 
</b></p>
<p>92. In addition to interventions in the domains of official State institutions and in 
</p>
<p>civil society, those in the domain of culture and individual spheres are required for 
</p>
<p>long-lasting transformations, including non-recurrence. Culture and personality 
</p>
<p>structures are, generally speaking, sources of stability and continuity in social 
</p>
<p>relations, hence, neither one is open to direct and immediate change by legal fiat. 
</p>
<p>However, this does not imply that they are immune to any change.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Education 
</b></p>
<p>93. In transitional contexts, education has the potential to act as a powerful tool 
</p>
<p>for non-recurrence. Because of its formative potential, education can contribute to 
</p>
<p>shaping new norms, mediating between contending narratives of the past and 
</p>
<p>nurturing a culture of dialogue and democratic citizenship across generations. A 
</p>
<p>transitional justice approach to education can greatly contribute to contextualizing 
</p>
<p>the aims of educational reform after conflict and/or repression, with an eye to 
</p>
<p>strengthening its potential for preventing the recurrence of violations, for example, 
</p>
<p>by identifying the patterns that fuelled conflict, especially in relation to exclusionary 
</p>
<p>and authoritarian practices in school systems. 50 
</p>
<p>94. Of significant relevance is the teaching of history:  if approached as a system 
</p>
<p>of research rather than a mechanism for simply preserving and remembering data, it 
</p>
<p>can train citizens in habits of analysis and critical reasoning. 51 In transitional 
</p>
<p>contexts, historical facts are often manipulated to serve political  and ideological 
</p>
<p>aims through the propagation of one-sided narratives that leave no room for 
</p>
<p>alternative perspectives. Different groups in society, particularly in ethnically 
</p>
<p>divided ones, may learn different versions of a shared history that clash signifi cantly 
</p>
<p>with each other.52 Similarly, the suppression of historical events, as practised in some 
</p>
<p>contexts, reinforces the social identities of those who fought against each other. 53 
</p>
<p>Such practices risk perpetuating divisions and conflicts rather than preventi ng their 
</p>
<p>recurrence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Arts and culture 
</b></p>
<p>95. Cultural interventions, such as museums, exhibitions, monuments and theatre 
</p>
<p>performances, have the capacity to affect not only victims but also the population at 
</p>
<p>large.54 In addition to the capacity to engage empathy, there are artistic and cultural 
</p>
<p>interventions that are ideally suited to &#8220;make visible&#8221; both victims and the effects of 
</p>

<p>victimization, to account for the very complex ways in which violations affect the 
</p>
<p>lives of individuals and of communities, especially over time. Furthermore, some 
</p>
<p>artistic media provide space for victims to articulate their experiences and even, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing the interventions&#8217; enabling potential, to try out new identities, including 
</p>
<p>the identity of a rights claimant.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Archives 
</b></p>
<p>96. Archives containing records of mass violations can contribute to prevention. 
</p>
<p>Access to well-preserved and protected archives is an educational tool against denial 
</p>
<p>and revisionism, ensuring that future generations have access to primary sources, 
</p>
<p>which is of direct relevance to history teaching. One notable example in this regard 
</p>
<p>are the Stasi files opened up by Germany after 1989. Opening files contributes 
</p>
<p>directly to the process of societal reform.  
</p>
<p>97. However, there is a lack of consistency in the disposition of archives of 
</p>
<p>transitional justice mechanisms, including truth commissions.55 To address this gap, 
</p>
<p>as a first step and as a result of a series of consultations with experts, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur developed a set of general recommendations that builds on the right to 
</p>
<p>know. This set of general recommendations (see annex) is meant to provide guidance 
</p>
<p>for truth commissions and other relevant stakeholders in their future archival work.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Trauma counselling and psychosocial support 
</b></p>
<p>98. Psychosocial support or trauma counselling has been rather marginally 
</p>
<p>identified as a component of a comprehensive strategy of non -recurrence. Gross 
</p>
<p>violations are likely to lead to health problems, 56 implying troubles for individuals 
</p>
<p>and society, which call for adjustments on a more fundamental psychological level. 
</p>
<p>Challenges may include identity problems for individuals and society, which hamper 
</p>
<p>the transformation of societies. Moreover, unaddressed specific traumatic events may 
</p>
<p>lock countries in repeated cycles of violence. 
</p>
<p>99. Post-authoritarian and/or post-conflict settings face low levels of trust both 
</p>
<p>vertically &#8212; between the State and its people &#8212; and horizontally &#8212; between 
</p>
<p>individuals and between communities. However, trust is the foundation for the 
</p>
<p>development of a rule of law culture, an environment that fosters reconciliation and a 
</p>
<p>necessary precondition for effective communication between the victims and the 
</p>
<p>authorities, as well as within society.  
</p>
<p>100. Where structural abuse or recurrent patterns of violence and unresolved 
</p>
<p>trauma intersect, high levels of conflict and further violence are likely to develop. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, amid high levels of inequality, poverty and unemployment, where 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s sense of dignity and self-worth are severely compromised on a daily basis, 
</p>
<p>violent behaviour can become a simple means of taking back the control people are 
</p>
<p>denied in their life. 
</p>
<p>101. Trauma counselling can be used to overcome and transform victim/perpetrator 
</p>
<p>identities, as an important step towards reaching a conclusion. For the victim, this 
</p>

<p> 56  For example, for Peru, see Lisa J. Laplante, &#8220;Linking Peacebuilding and health in post-conflict 
</p>
<p>settings&#8221;, available from www.frient.de/publikationen/dokumente/library/linking-peacebuilding-and-
</p>
<p>health-in-post-conflict-settings.html. </p>


<p>can mean once more taking part fully in society; for the perpetrator, it can mean 
</p>
<p>acknowledging and assuming responsibility. This transformation can help to avoid 
</p>
<p>cycles whereby &#8220;victims become perpetrators&#8221;, which perpetuate cycles of mass 
</p>
<p>violations.57 
</p>
<p>102. While arguing for the anchoring of trauma counselling as a crucial element of 
</p>
<p>a State policy aimed at guaranteeing non-recurrence, the Special Rapporteur warns 
</p>
<p>against using psychosocial support to &#8220;water down&#8221; the importance of institutional 
</p>
<p>reform. Instead, trauma counselling and civil society efforts should be considered as 
</p>
<p>a &#8220;trigger-down mechanism&#8221; to ensure that institutional reform becomes truly 
</p>
<p>effective at the individual level.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Observations and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur calls for more focused attention to the challenges 
</p>
<p>arising in areas of weak governance for the effective satisfaction of rights and in 
</p>
<p>particular to the challenges for protecting the rights of marginalized groups and 
</p>
<p>individuals. Significantly more work needs to be done normatively and 
</p>
<p>practically in order to protect the rights of individuals in such situations, 
</p>
<p>including civilians trapped in the cross<b>-</b>fire of a conflict. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Institutional level 
</b></p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to take the necessary measures, 
</p>
<p>in the aftermath of conflict and/or repression, to enable the registration of 
</p>
<p>births and give access to all to gain or regain their legal identity; and to increase 
</p>
<p>access to registration mechanisms, including through mobile registration units, 
</p>
<p>accessible at the local and community levels, with simplified procedures that are 
</p>
<p>reflective of the circumstances people face, for instance after displacement and 
</p>
<p>the fragmentation of families. Measures need to be taken to ensure access for 
</p>
<p>all, without discrimination, to a fully functional civil registration system that is 
</p>
<p>universal, compulsory, permanent, continuous and cost<b>-</b>free, that ensures the 
</p>
<p>confidentiality of personal data and is culturally sensitive, especially in relation 
</p>
<p>to religious or cultural circumstances regarding minorities and indigenous 
</p>
<p>groups. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>105. He also calls upon States to adopt a non<b>-</b>recurrence policy that should 
</p>
<p>include the ratification of relevant treaties, avoiding or withdrawing 
</p>
<p>reservations that may defeat the purpose of the treaty. Ratification should be 
</p>
<p>followed by a strategy for incorporating the provisions effectively into domestic 
</p>
<p>law and their implementation. States should consider prioritizing the 
</p>
<p>ratification of targeted treaties that pertain to gross human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>serious violations of international humanitarian law, including torture, sexual 
</p>
<p>and gender<b>-</b>based violence, extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances, institutionalized discrimination, forced displacement 
</p>
<p>and exile, and crimes amounting to crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>genocide. The Special Rapporteur urges all States to ratify the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Non<b>-</b>Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes 
</p>
<p>against Humanity.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>106. States should promote reforms to ensure full compliance of emergency, 
</p>
<p>security or anti<b>-</b>terrorism legislation with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>Reforms should include explicit reference to non<b>-</b>derogable rights and enshrine 
</p>
<p>elements for suitability, necessity and proportionality tests. Legislation must be 
</p>
<p>in conformity with international standards, in particular the principle of 
</p>
<p>legality, due process and fair trial. Furthermore, the criminalization of terrorist 
</p>
<p>activity must be formulated in explicit and precise terms that enable individuals 
</p>
<p>to regulate their behaviour, and the definitions of terrorist crimes should be 
</p>
<p>confined exclusively to activities that entail or are directly related to the use of 
</p>
<p>deadly or serious violence against civilians. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>107. States should also consider methods of vetting judicial personnel that are 
</p>
<p>compatible with the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary and 
</p>
<p>due<b>-</b>process guarantees. A judiciary that is not trusted by citizens either for 
</p>
<p>reasons of complicity or ineffectiveness will find it impossible to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>corrective and preventive roles. Since self<b>-</b>reflection about the judiciary&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>role in violations is both trust<b>-</b>inducing and potentially preventive, the training 
</p>
<p>of judicial personnel, and judicial reform in itself, should address the 
</p>
<p>judiciary&#8217;s role in past violations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to include in their policies 
</p>
<p>initiatives geared towards strengthening internal (individual) and external 
</p>
<p>(institutional) judicial independence. He urges them to ensure that their judicial 
</p>
<p>systems comply with relevant standards, including the Basic Principles on the 
</p>
<p>Independence of the Judiciary. Judiciaries can crucially help to prevent 
</p>
<p>violations by checking executive powers and by adjudicating conflicts 
</p>
<p>impartially and independently. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>109. He also calls upon States to endow their judiciaries with specialized 
</p>
<p>competencies required to address mass atrocities strategically to dismantle 
</p>
<p>networks of criminality. Implementing such strategies is one of the most 
</p>
<p>significant contributions judiciaries can make to the prevention of violations. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, he urges them to acquire competencies in the detection and 
</p>
<p>prevention of other gross violations, which are routine in many places, including 
</p>
<p>torture. While specialized judicial capacities are sometimes best expressed 
</p>
<p>through the creation of specialized entities, no special jurisdiction &#8212; military or 
</p>
<p>not &#8212; should weaken the power to guarantee and enforce basic rights. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>110. States should consider, in transitional contexts, constitutional 
</p>
<p>amendments or reforms to lay down a catalogue of rights and structures of 
</p>
<p>governance as the foundation of the &#8220;new&#8221; State. This is possible through an 
</p>
<p>incremental, interim or fully fledged constitutional drafting process. Enshrining 
</p>
<p>the principles of the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary, the 
</p>
<p>non<b>-</b>partisan role of the security forces and a bill of rights is indicative of a new 
</p>
<p>beginning. Special attention should be paid to providing for oversight, 
</p>
<p>accountability and strong human rights protection mechanisms, including 
</p>
<p>through the establishment of a constitutional court or chamber with an 
</p>
<p>individual complaints procedure. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>111. The jurisdiction of military tribunals should be limited solely to military 
</p>
<p>personnel charged exclusively with military offences, to the exclusion of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. <b> </b></p>


<p><b>  Civil Society 
</b></p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to prevent any persecution, 
</p>
<p>attacks, threats, intimidation and harassment of civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p>States should ensure protection mechanisms for civil society at risk, including 
</p>
<p>early warning systems, physical protection measures, as well as accountability 
</p>
<p>and prompt and impartial investigations in cases of violations. This requires 
</p>
<p>clear and decisive messages from the highest authorities on zero<b>-</b>tolerance policy 
</p>
<p>for such attacks and intimidation against civil society actors and on public 
</p>
<p>recognition of their essential role in building just, inclusive and tolerant 
</p>
<p>democracies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>113. He also calls upon States to withdraw or reform provisions that impose an 
</p>
<p>excessive burden or disproportional heavy bureaucratic and costly procedures, 
</p>
<p>which severely hamper civil society participation. This includes (a) amending 
</p>
<p>registration mechanisms thereby excluding the possibility to deny registration 
</p>
<p>on vague grounds; (b) reforming excessive procedural requirements; (c) 
</p>
<p>withdrawing prior<b>-</b>authorization requirements, allowing spontaneous peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and, if prior<b>-</b>notification mechanisms exist, their rationale should be 
</p>
<p>grounded by ensuring the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly, protection 
</p>
<p>of public safety and order, and the rights and freedoms of others; (d) providing 
</p>
<p>for precise regulations defining illegal activities; (e) preventing arbitrary 
</p>
<p>interpretation of regulatory provisions; (f) reforming legislation that prevents 
</p>
<p>organizations from receiving support from certain donors, including foreign 
</p>
<p>funding; (g) reforming legislation that imposes undue restrictions on freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and criminalizes dissenting and critical opinions; (h) preventing 
</p>
<p>arbitrary or unlawful surveillance; (i) ensuring effective access to encryption 
</p>
<p>and anonymity tools in online communications; and (j) protecting the 
</p>
<p>confidentiality of sources.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>114. States should create the economic, political, legal, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>conditions that actively support the ability and capacity of persons, individually 
</p>
<p>or in association, to engage in social and civil activities, promoting the principles 
</p>
<p>of participation, non<b>-</b>discrimination, dignity, transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>Key conditions include: (a) a conducive political and public environment, 
</p>
<p>through a supportive legal and practical regulatory framework in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards; (b) access to international and regional 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms and effective cooperation with independent national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions; (c) access to information; (d) special measures and 
</p>
<p>resources targeting the most marginalized groups to ensure their integration 
</p>
<p>and participation and the consideration of their voice among civil society actors; 
</p>
<p>(e) opportunities for civil society to participate in decision<b>-</b>making processes; 
</p>
<p>and (f) the provision of financial resources and stability, including through 
</p>
<p>public subsidies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>115. States should also support legal empowerment programmes, ensuring 
</p>
<p>their broad participation among a sufficiently large section of the population 
</p>
<p>and their long<b>-</b>term impact, in order to have a transformative effect on attitudes 
</p>
<p>and behaviour. This may include: (a) building partnerships among various 
</p>
<p>actors, including (international) donors, government focal points and 
</p>
<p>community leaders; (b) sustained financial and capacity support; and (c) the 
</p>
<p>creation of mutually reinforcing networks among individuals and groups at the 
</p>
<p>local, national and international levels. <b> </b></p>


<p><b>  Cultural and the individual spheres 
</b></p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to conceive educational 
</p>
<p>reforms, cultural interventions, including memorialization, and archives as part 
</p>
<p>of their non<b>-</b>recurrence policies. He urges States to focus more attention on 
</p>
<p>these areas, and intends to pay more attention to them in the future, in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with other special procedures. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>117. He also calls upon States to consider the annexed set of general 
</p>
<p>recommendations for truth commissions and archives as an important 
</p>
<p>component of the work of the Human Rights Council on transitional justice.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>118. States should ensure that history teaching aims at fostering critical 
</p>
<p>thought, analytic learning and debate, in order to enable a comparative and 
</p>
<p>multi<b>-</b>perspective approach, as well as a better understanding of the 
</p>
<p>contemporary challenges of exclusion and violence. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>119. States should also ensure that psychosocial support and trauma 
</p>
<p>counselling are addressed as core components of transitional justice, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing their central importance for repairing the social contract &#8212; i.e., 
</p>
<p>the relationship between the State and the individual &#8212; and social cohesion &#8212; 
</p>
<p>i.e., relationships of individuals with one another &#8212; after periods of protracted 
</p>
<p>violence and/or oppression. The Special Rapporteur underscores that these twin 
</p>
<p>goals are essential to offering victims and society the highest possible guarantees 
</p>
<p>available that violations will not reoccur.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>120. The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to build a sustainable culture of 
</p>
<p>non<b>-</b>recurrence by ensuring that trauma counselling in transitional contexts not 
</p>
<p>only focuses on assisting individuals and families with &#8220;daily problems&#8221;, but 
</p>
<p>also includes interventions to build on and strengthen the resilience and coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the communities and society at large. In this connection, trauma 
</p>
<p>work should be linked to educational reform and education itself, for children, 
</p>
<p>adolescents and adults. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>121. He also calls upon States to develop further work on and support for 
</p>
<p>psychosocial initiatives, both to relieve the immense suffering of victims and to 
</p>
<p>help to put an end to cycles of violence. He highlights that to think that the 
</p>
<p>burden of prevention can be carried by punitive measures alone is both to 
</p>
<p>overestimate the capacities of criminal justice systems and to underestimate the 
</p>
<p>importance of other types of intervention. <b> </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><i>[English only] 
</i></p>
<p><b>  Set of general recommendations for truth commissions and 
archives  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Many post-authoritarian and post-conflict societies are faced with enormous 
</p>
<p>challenges in the preservation and disposition of records containing information on gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. In many 
</p>
<p>cases, secrecy, national security concerns, and poor archival practice stand in the way of 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing the right to know the truth. 
</p>
<p>2. Archivists have, over time, developed sophisticated technical expertise and 
</p>
<p>knowledge on all relevant issues regarding archives, including preservation, accessibility, 
</p>
<p>and management. However, there is a striking gap between technical archival expertise and 
</p>
<p>practice. Policies and practices that fall short of international standards risk the loss of 
</p>
<p>records containing an important part of a society&#8217;s heritage and hence hamper the 
</p>
<p>possibility of accessing documentary evidence and support for efforts to achieve truth and 
</p>
<p>justice. 
</p>
<p>3. Indeed, archives are relevant and can make significant contributions to each of the 
</p>
<p>pillars of transitional justice, not merely truth and justice. At the same time, transitional 
</p>
<p>justice measures can contribute to a country&#8217;s archival system. Beyond the fact that 
</p>
<p>transitional justice measures generate records themselves, truth commissions, trials, 
</p>
<p>reparations programs and other transitional justice initiatives can contribute to improving 
</p>
<p>archival practice both by the way they implement relevant standards with respect to their 
</p>
<p>own documents, and because some of them, particularly truth commissions, are in a good 
</p>
<p>position to make comments and recommendations about archival reform in general.  
</p>
<p>4. That potential, however, has not been consistently realized. Even truth commissions, 
</p>
<p>both in post-authoritarian and post-conflict settings, manifest a significant gap between 
</p>
<p>expertise and actual practice. There is little consistency in the disposition of truth 
</p>
<p>commission archives, in the regimes that govern subsequent access to them, and in the 
</p>
<p>recommendations that truth commissions make concerning archival systems. 
</p>
<p>5. In the conviction that these gaps need to be addressed, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence in his 2013 report 
</p>
<p>to UN Human Rights Council on truth commissions (A/HRC/24/42) &#8220;calls for the 
</p>
<p>development of international standards on archiving&#8221; for truth commissions. What follows 
</p>
<p>is intended to contribute to the development of such standards. Part I contains 
</p>
<p>recommendations <i>for</i> truth commissions pertaining to their own operations and the 
</p>
<p>disposition of their archives, and Part II comprises recommendations that truth 
</p>
<p>commissions <i>can make</i> regarding the establishment of national archival policies concerning </p>


<p>records that contain information about gross human rights violations and serious violations 
</p>
<p>of international humanitarian law.a  
</p>
<p>6. As a general point, the Special Rapporteur would like to take the opportunity to 
</p>
<p>reiterate the call on States to provide full support to truth-seeking mechanisms throughout 
</p>
<p>their whole life-cycle, which includes access to records containing information on gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, in order 
</p>
<p>for them to be able to effectively and independently implement their mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Recommendations for truth commissions  
</b></p>
<p>In the context of their operations, truth commissions are encouraged to:  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Build </i>provisions for the eventual disposition of their records, guaranteeing both their 
</p>
<p>safety and accessibility. This needs to be done in the early stages of planning their 
</p>
<p>operations; a commission needs to decide who will be responsible for managing the 
</p>
<p>records, where they will be stored in the short and long term, and how access to them will 
</p>
<p>be controlled. 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Engage</i> archival expertise in making and implementing those provisions during the 
</p>
<p>life of the truth commission, and in this context take advantage of national (National 
</p>
<p>Archives and Archival Associations) and international assistance and advice (e.g. 
</p>
<p>International Council on Archives, Archivists without Borders); 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Plan</i> to deposit their archives in the country where the violations occurred and the 
</p>
<p>commission operates, preferably in existing national archives, duly taking into account 
</p>
<p>considerations of the security, integrity and accessibility of the archives. New and 
</p>
<p>specialized archives may need to be created until such time as the national archives are able 
</p>
<p>to adequately handle records of truth commissions. In the event of the possible loss, 
</p>
<p>mutilation, poor preservation or destruction of the records in the country of origin, truth 
</p>
<p>commissions should keep a complete, scanned and/or digitalized copy of the records in a 
</p>
<p>secure facility outside the country or consider temporary preservation in a secure repository 
</p>
<p>in a second jurisdiction or with an international institution;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Consider </i>criteria having to do with preservation, accessibility, and trustworthiness 
</p>
<p>of the host institution in deciding on the adequate repository.b  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Stipulate</i> that the access policy of truth commission archives should maximize 
</p>
<p>public accessibility, while respecting applicable privacy concerns, including in particular 
</p>
<p>assurances of confidentiality provided to victims and other witnesses as a precondition of 
</p>
<p>their testimony. Access to truth commission archives may not be denied on grounds of 
</p>
<p>national security or other grounds unless the restriction is in full compliance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Note</i> that maximizing future accessibility has an impact on many operations of a 
</p>
<p>commission throughout its lifetime, including, for example, on the process of taking 
</p>
<p>statements and other contact with victims and witnesses who should be advised that their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> a Both sets of recommendations build on well-established definitions on the &#8220;right to know&#8221; and on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;archives&#8221; as stipulated in, among other places, the Updated Set of principles for the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity; see report of the independent expert 
</p>
<p>Diane Orentlicher to update the Set of principles to combat impunity, E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>8 February 2005. 
</p>
<p> b For example, ISO 16363 defines a practice for assessing the trustworthiness of digital repositories.  </p>


<p>contributions to the commissions may be accessible in the future under specified 
</p>
<p>conditions; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Establish</i> guidelines for access to truth commission records, which shall take into 
</p>
<p>account: 
</p>
<p> (a) General access rules, such as what was previously public should remain 
</p>
<p>public; victims, families, investigative and prosecutorial authorities, as well as legal defense 
</p>
<p>teams, should have unhindered access to information on their specific case; there should be 
</p>
<p>a presumption of public access to all State information with only limited exceptions; a 
</p>
<p>procedure to make effective the right of access should be established; whatever access rules 
</p>
<p>are determined for various categories of potential users (for example, victims, legal 
</p>
<p>representatives, journalists, academics, and members of the general public) should apply to 
</p>
<p>all members of the given category without discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (b) Categorization of records enabling familiar distinctions between types of 
</p>
<p>documents (e.g. reports of own investigations, records of own meetings, victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>testimonies, documents obtained from other institutions, organizations, or private persons 
</p>
<p>etc.) that will allow for a differentiated approach in facilitating access, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>general access rules, to each type of document/collection; 
</p>
<p> (c) The need for effective mechanisms of reference services, as well as new 
</p>
<p>technological advances in managing archives; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Develop</i>, with the support of national and international expertise and assistance, 
</p>
<p>provisions and measures to secure and preserve national archives, including by building 
</p>
<p>effective and sustainable record management and archival systems, which includes, i.a., 
</p>
<p>secure and adequate premises and clear appraisal policies; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Elaborate</i> policies concerning relevant records and archives of non-State actors, 
</p>
<p>including private businesses, so as to maximize effective management and access of these 
</p>
<p>records by the truth commission.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Possible recommendations by truth commissions 
</b></p>
<p>16. Regarding their recommendations on archives and the establishment of national 
</p>
<p>archival policies that concern records containing information on gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, truth commissions are 
</p>
<p>encouraged to: 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Address</i> the issue of reform of national archival legislation and institutions to 
</p>
<p>encourage the establishment of modern, accessible, and reliable archives which are 
</p>
<p>essential for the long-term preservation and use of records containing information on gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations should include that reform efforts ought to be conducted with the 
</p>
<p>participation of public institutions, civil society, and archival experts; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Make </i>recommendations to preserve and actively use national archives, including 
</p>
<p>archives of security services;  
</p>
<p>19. <i>Call for </i>independent oversight over the archives, including of archives of formerly 
</p>
<p>repressive regimes; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Recommend </i>the creation of archival laws, freedom of information legislation, data 
</p>
<p>protection legislation and transparency requirements within other laws, which take into 
</p>
<p>account the right to information, the right to know the truth, and the specificity of the 
</p>
<p>records dealing with human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law; </p>


<p>21. <i>Recommend</i> to the responsible authorities that they increase the capacity and where 
</p>
<p>necessary the resources of State and local archival actors; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Recommend </i>the provision by the State of information to the public on legal and 
</p>
<p>practical requirements for access to archives;  
</p>
<p>23. <i>Promote </i>the establishment of comprehensive National Archival systems, including 
</p>
<p>non-governmental records, especially those that are relevant to gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. Improvements in the 
</p>
<p>regulation, disposition, protection and access to non-governmental archives (which does not 
</p>
<p>involve the centralization of <i>all </i>records) will contribute to the establishment of such 
</p>
<p>comprehensive systems, in accordance with international standards; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Recommend </i>to the responsible authorities that they facilitate the work of civil 
</p>
<p>society in the area of archives and ensure an enabling environment in this respect, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international standards; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Reiterate</i> that access to archives, containing records with information on gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, may not 
</p>
<p>be denied to the public on grounds of national security unless the restriction is in full 
</p>
<p>compliance with international human rights law.
