Seven Generations continues robust growth in production 
and funds from operations in the second quarter of 2016
Production rises 116% to exceed 117,000 boe/d
Funds from operations up 56% to more than $197 million
CALGARY, August 4, 2016 – Seven Generations Energy Ltd. produced a record 117,353 barrels 
of  oil  equivalent  per  day  (boe/d)  in  the  second quarter  of 2016,  up  116  percent from  the  second 
quarter of 2015, and up 33 percent from the first quarter of the year.  Second quarter condensate 
production increased 87 percent from the same quarter in 2015 to 38,803 boe/d.  
 
“As  we  bring  new  wells  and  Super  Pads  on-stream,  and  apply  a  combination  of  innovative 
technologies, we are gaining a better understanding of the productive capacity and prolific potential 
of the Kakwa River resource. We have just completed the first full quarter employing the capacity of 
the  Cutbank  processing plant,  which  increased  our field  processing  capacity  to  510 million  cubic 
feet per day (MMcf/d). This gives us the ability to continue our high rate of organic growth and ramp 
up liquids-rich natural gas sales into the U.S. Midwest market,” said Marty Proctor, 7G’s President 
and Chief Operating Officer. 
 
Second quarter funds from operations continued to rise at a strong pace, surpassing $197 million, 
up 56 percent from the second quarter of 2015 due largely to significant production growth despite 
benchmark oil prices that were about 21 percent lower and natural gas prices that were down about 
30  percent.  Second  quarter  funds  from  operations  included  $27.4  million  of  prior-period  royalty 
recoveries attributable to Gas Cost Allowance and a change to field condensate reporting. 
 
Completion innovations boosting initial production rates 
“Our well performance continues to improve resource recovery as we decrease the spacing between 
hydraulic  fractures  in  the  horizontal  section  of  the  well,  pump  more  sand  into  each  fracture  and 
realize improved completions economics through the transition from nitrogen foam completions to 
slickwater.  Our  methodical  testing  of  each  innovation  is  lowering  costs,  boosting  volumes  of  the 
liquids-rich  natural  gas  we  produce  and  creating  competitive  value  for  our  stakeholders,”  said 
Glen Nevokshonoff, 7G’s Senior Vice President, Operations. 
 
Preliminary tests show closer-spaced fractures improve early well life production rates 
Completion  test  results  that  double  the  intensity  of  hydraulic  fractures  are  at  an  early  stage,  but 
initial  indications  are  promising.  For  example,  for  most  wells  completed  in  2015,  7G’s  standard 
spacing was about 110 metres between hydraulic fracture ports, or stages. When that intensity is 
doubled to about 55 metres between stages, results from the first 120 days of production on a series 
of test wells show similar production rates for each fracture regardless of spacing.  
 
“We expect that over an extended period of time fractures, at any spacing, will start to compete with 
each  other to  drain the natural gas  in the rock between  the fractures.  We expect that there  are 
elements of acceleration of production as well as some incremental recovery associated with the 
closer  fracture  spacing.  These  tests  are  designed  to  help  us  understand  the  true  value  and 
incremental  recovery  that  we  might  achieve  from  the  pursuit  of  an  optimal  fracture  spacing,” 
Nevokshonoff said.

Slickwater completions delivering strong production, saving capital, reducing emissions 
Seven  Generations  has  recently  transitioned  from  using  primarily  nitrogen  foam  completions  to 
slickwater hydraulic fractures, which do not use nitrogen. Production results during the first 180 days 
from wells that compare the two methods indicate that slickwater completions result in the same or 
higher condensate production rates, while natural gas production rates are about the same. This 
does  not  mean  total  resource  recovered  over  the  life  of  the  well  will  be  higher,  but  slickwater 
fractures appear to yield better condensate-gas ratios in the early stages of the well and they cost 
significantly less to install. Initial estimates indicate that each stage of a slickwater completion costs 
about  25  percent  less  than  when  using  nitrogen  foam.  In  addition,  slickwater  completions 
substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions by eliminating most of the flaring required to prepare 
the natural gas stream for production during nitrogen foam completions. This environmental benefit 
complements the economic advantage of slickwater completions.  
 
Capital investment on track, maintaining financial strength  
Capital investment for the second quarter was $219 million, down 38 percent from one year earlier 
and remains on track with annual guidance of $900 million to $950 million. At the end of the second 
quarter, 7G had $433 million of adjusted working capital. When 7G’s $813 million revolving credit 
facility is combined with adjusted working capital, the company has about $1.2 billion of available 
funding. 7G plans to fund its 2016 capital program with cash on hand and funds from operations. 
 
Cash flow sustainability remains a core objective 
“We continue to target cash flow sustainability, meaning that we aim to stay on our growth trajectory 
while funding our annual capital investments with our funds from operations – commonly called cash 
flow. That target is in sight as we continue to grow production profitably, at a strong pace to fill the 
excess  capacity  in  our  completed  natural  gas  processing  plants  and  Super  Pads.  We  also  look 
forward  to  completing  our  previously  announced  major  asset  acquisition,  which  will  significantly 
expand the land and resources of our Kakwa River Project. These lands border on our Nest lands 
and we are progressing through the required steps to complete the transaction, which we expect to 
close in August,” said Pat Carlson, 7G’s Chief Executive Officer. 
 
Major asset acquisition 
On  July  6,  2016,  7G  announced  a  transaction  that  will  significantly  expand  its  ownership  in  the 
prolific and low-supply-cost Montney Nest liquids-rich natural gas play, if the conditions contained 
in the purchase and sale agreement between 7G and Paramount Resources Ltd. (Paramount) are 
satisfied. Under the agreement, 7G would acquire  about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of 
daily production (as estimated for the second quarter of 2016), 155 net sections of Montney land 
and  199  million  boe  of  gross  proved  reserves  (based  on  December  31,  2015  evaluations)  for 
approximately $1.9 billion in total consideration consisting of cash, 7G shares and the assumption 
of a portion of Paramount’s debt. The transaction has an effective date of June 1, 2016 and is subject 
to  Paramount  shareholder  approval,  approval  under  the  Competition  Act  and  other  customary 
closing conditions.  
 
“By  adding  these  adjacent  and  early-life  development  lands,  we  expect  to  gain  operational  and 
investment  synergies  in  our  Kakwa  River  Project. This  acquisition  is  expected  to  boost  our  Nest 
lands and gross proved reserves by 47 percent. It increases the expected multitude of ultimately 
recoverable resources where we can deploy our strategic thrust to expand markets for  Canadian 
liquids-rich natural gas,” Carlson said. 
 
Post-acquisition production and capital investment guidance 
Subject to the expected closing of the acquisition, 7G has revised its 2016 guidance for production 
to  120,000  to  125,000  boe/d  and  its  planned  capital  investments  to  be  between  $1.05  billion  to 
$1.10 billion, which includes production and capital investment in the acquired assets during the last 
four months of 2016.

Proven capacity to grow competitively in grossly oversupplied North American market 
Seven Generations has demonstrated its ability to grow and thrive in North America’s oversupplied 
natural gas market by delivering low-cost natural gas, condensate and natural gas liquids. 7G’s firm 
transportation capacity, incrementally rising to 607 MMcf/d on Alliance Pipeline and TransCanada’s 
Nova  Gas  Transmission  Ltd.  system  between  now  and  the  end  of  2018,  provides  a  path  for 
continued growth through late in the decade. However, given the scale of 7G’s resources, continued 
profitable production growth beyond 2020 will likely require market expansion. In that pursuit, the 
company  is  searching  for  market  expansion  opportunities  in  gas-to-liquids  conversion,  electrical 
power generation, petrochemical manufacturing, as well as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) export initiatives. Seven Generations is in a unique position to underpin market 
expansion with its very large inventory of low-supply-cost, liquids-rich natural gas reserves, which 
will  be  substantially  increased  if  the  acquisition  of  Paramount’s  adjacent  Kakwa  River  assets  is 
completed. 
 
Market expansion and integration initiatives gaining traction 
“In recent months, we have  continued to expand and deepen our conversations with a variety of 
market integration proponents looking to connect our large resource base at Kakwa River with new 
markets. We are focused on generating long-term and sustainable value for our upstream assets, 
through  the  integrated  energy  chain,  from  the  wellhead  to  the  consumer  market.  Although  the 
magnitude of our direct investment in midstream projects is expected to be modest, we believe our 
immense low-cost liquids-rich resources can play a very important role in the continued development 
of Canadian energy at home and in overseas markets,” Proctor said. 
 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 
 
  Robust production growth averaging 117,353 boe/d, up 116 percent from the second quarter of 
2015, and up 33 percent from the first quarter of 2016. Liquids made up 59 percent of production, 
with a ratio of about 238 barrels (bbls) of liquids per MMcf of natural gas sales.
  Funds from operations were $197.6 million in the second quarter, up 56 per cent compared to 
the second quarter  of  2015,  despite  a  drop  in  benchmark  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  of  about 
21  percent  and  30  percent  respectively.  Second  quarter  funds  from  operations  included 
$27.4 million of prior-period royalty recoveries attributable to Gas Cost Allowance and a change 
to field condensate reporting.
  7G  increased  production  per  share  by  97  percent  and  funds  from  operations  per  share  by 
40 percent during the second quarter of 2016, compared to the  second quarter of 2015. The 
company’s weighted average diluted share count increased by about 10 percent in the past year 
largely due to the $300 million equity financing in February 2016.
  Second  quarter  capital  investment  was  $219  million,  down  38  percent  compared  to  second 
quarter  2015  and  consistent  with  planned  2016  capital  investments  of  $900  million  to 
$950 million.
  Seven Generations drilled  ten wells and completed 21 wells, taking the number of  producing 
Montney wells to 138. At the end of the second quarter, approximately 49 Nest wells were in 
various  stages  of  construction  between  drilling  and  tie-in.  This  inventory  of  in-progress  wells 
represents significant productive capacity that is planned to be brought on-stream throughout 
2016.

OPERATIONS 
 
Drilling days reduced by 13 percent and completions costs down 20 percent 
Seven Generations drilled ten wells in the second quarter, on average 13 percent faster and at a 
12 percent lower cost than in the second quarter of 2015. Wells averaged 2,685 metres of horizontal 
length, 40.5 days to drill and cost $4.6 million each. 7G ended the second quarter operating five 
drilling rigs, down from ten at the start of 2016. The company expects to run five to six rigs during 
the remainder of 2016. 7G completed 21 wells in the second quarter of 2016, each with an average 
of 4,870 tonnes of proppant, 30 stages, and costing $5.2 million, down 20 percent compared to one 
year earlier.  
 
“We continue to capture incremental efficiencies by drilling wells faster and completing them at a 
lower cost, which remained below $10 million per well in the second quarter,” Nevokshonoff said. 
 
Second  quarter  operations  were  not  without  challenges.  One  of  7G’s  innovative  approaches 
involves drilling wells in batches, which results in leaving some wells dormant for a period of time. 
The pressure integrity of the horizontal section of nine well liners was unexpectedly compromised 
when the liners were left submerged in brine water. Procedural and operational changes have been 
implemented  to  limit  similar  failures  in  the  future.  The  company  expects  to  re-drill  the  horizontal 
section of these wells at a cost of about $2 million per well. This is not expected to impact 7G’s 2016 
capital investment forecast. Despite the delay in bringing on production from these wells, production 
during the first half of 2016 is on track to meet annual guidance.

7G’s ninth Super Pad to start up in Q3, then double capacity to become a Mega Pad 
Seven  Generations  is  taking the  next  step  towards  doubling  the  capacity  of  its  highly-successful 
Super  Pad  drilling  and  production  system. To  date,  Super  Pads  have  been  designed  to  produce 
50  MMcf/d.  7G’s  ninth  Super  Pad  will  be  built  to  operate  initially  at  70  MMcf/d,  then  expand  to 
become  the  company’s  first  Mega  Pad  –  doubling  the  productive  capacity  of  a  Super  Pad  to 
100 MMcf/d. Engineering and procurement of the second condensate stabilization train at the Karr 
plant  is  underway  and  field  construction  is  expected to  start  in  the  third quarter.  This  project  will 
increase the company’s condensate stabilization processing capacity to 60,000 bbls/d and should 
improve  the  company’s  netbacks  by  better  aligning  condensate  specifications  with  pipeline 
requirements.

Financial update 
Second quarter commodity prices again tracked lower than one year earlier, with benchmark oil and 
natural gas prices down about 21 percent and 30 percent respectively, quarter-over-quarter. Second 
quarter operating netbacks were $21.83 per boe after hedging, down 28 percent in the past year 
due  to  lower  benchmark  prices  and  the  expiry  of  higher-priced  hedges  put  in  place  before  the 
commodity price fall. Higher production and continued efficiency gains lowered operating expenses 
by about 12 percent to $4.20 per boe, which helped offset the realized price declines. 
 
Managing market risk 
Seven  Generations  employs  financial  hedges  to  partially  protect  funds  from  operations  against 
commodity price volatility. Seven Generations’ hedge targets include up to 65 percent of forecasted 
condensate  and  natural  gas  volumes  (net  of  royalties)  for  the  upcoming  four  quarters,  up  to 
35 percent of forecasted volumes for the next four quarters after that and up to 20 percent for the 
four quarters beyond that period. Price targets are established at levels that are expected to provide 
a threshold rate of return on capital investment based on a combination of benchmark oil and natural 
gas prices, projected well performance and capital efficiencies.

OUTLOOK 
 
Growth potential continues to expand with planned Montney acquisition 
“Our  opportunities  to  continue  delivering  high-rate,  profitable  growth  remain  strong.  We  are 
achieving  improved  productive  capacity  with  each  well  through  innovations  in  drilling  and 
completions.  Add  to  that  the  development  opportunities  available  if  we  complete  our  planned 
Montney  asset  acquisition,  which  is  expected  to  increase  the  gross  proved  reserves  of  our  Nest 
lands by close to 50 percent,” Proctor said. 
 
Subject to the planned completion of the Montney asset acquisition, Seven Generations has revised 
its  2016  capital  investment  to  between  $1.05  billion  and  $1.10  billion  and  production  to  average 
120,000 to 125,000 boe/d. In 2016, 7G’s liquids are expected to range between 55 and 60 percent 
of total production.

Non-IFRS Financial Measures 
This news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the oil and 
natural gas industry that are not defined under IFRS, including “funds from operations”, “operating 
income”, “operating netback”, “available funding”, “net debt” and “adjusted working capital”. The data 
presented are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation 
or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS 
measures  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  company's  condensed  interim  consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes for the period ended June 30, 2016. 
 
“Operating  netback”  is  calculated  on  a  per  boe  basis  and  is  determined  by  deducting  royalties, 
operating  and  transportation  expenses  from  oil  and  natural  gas  revenue  and,  except  where 
otherwise  indicated,  after  adjusting  for  realized  hedging  gains  or  losses.  Operating  netback  is 
utilized by the company and others to better analyze the operating performance of its oil and natural 
gas assets. 
 
For more information regarding  “funds from operations”, “operating income”, “operating netback”, 
“available funding”, “net debt” and “adjusted working capital”, see "Non-IFRS Financial Measures" 
in  the  company's  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  for  the  three  months  and  six  months 
ended June 30, 2016 filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
 
Reader Advisory  
This news release contains certain forward-looking information and statements that involve various risks, uncertainties and other factors. 
The use of any of the words “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “believe”, “plans”, and similar expressions 
are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  information  or  statements.  In  particular,  but  without  limiting  the  foregoing,  this  news  release 
contains forward-looking  information  and statements  pertaining  to  the  following:  the  resource  potential  and  productive capacity  of  the 
Kakwa River Project; expected continued high rate of profitable growth; expected production and production growth; improvement of well 
economics with decreased hydraulic fracture spacing; increased condensate and natural gas production and cost savings from using a 
‘slickwater’ well completions technique; planned capital investment in 2016; sources of funding for the company’s 2016 capital program; 
expectation that annual funds from operations will begin to outpace capital investments; expected closing of the Acquisition and the timing 
thereof;  the expansion of the company’s land base following the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Montney assets (the 
Assets) from Paramount (the Acquisition); synergies expected upon the completion of the Acquisition; the reserves attributable to the 
Assets to be acquired; expected increase to the company’s proved reserves following the completion of the Acquisition;  the expected 
magnitude  of  the  ultimately  recoverable  resources  following  the  completion  of  the  Acquisition;  the  potential  expansion  of  markets  for 
Canadian liquids rich natural gas; expected transportation and processing capacity; expected midstream investments to be made by the

With respect to forward-looking information contained in this news release, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: 
satisfaction of the conditions to closing of the Acquisition, future oil, NGLs and natural gas prices; the company’s ability to obtain qualified 
8 | S e v e n   G e n e r a t i o n s   E n e r g y   L t d .
staff and equipment in a timely and cost-efficient manner; the regulatory framework governing royalties, taxes and environmental matters 
in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts its business and any other jurisdictions in which the company may conduct its business 
in the future; the company’s ability to market production of oil, NGLs and natural gas successfully to customers; the  company’s future

time; the impact of competition on the company; and the company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. 
 
Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in this forward-looking information as a result of the possible failure of the 
company to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition or the inability to complete the Acquisition and the risks and risk factors that 
are described in the company’s annual information form dated March 8, 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the AIF) and the 
Short Form Prospectus dated July 19, 2016, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, including, but not limited to: volatility in 
market prices and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas and hedging activities related thereto; general economic, business and industry 
conditions; variance of the company’s actual capital costs, operating costs and  economic returns from those anticipated; the ability to 
find, develop or acquire additional reserves and the availability of the capital or financing necessary to do so on satisfactory terms; risks 
related to the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves and resources; negative public perception of oil 
sands development, oil and natural gas development and transportation, hydraulic fracturing and fossil fuels; actions by governmental 
authorities, including changes in government regulation, royalties and taxation or the enforcement thereof; the rescission, or amendment 
to the conditions of, groundwater licenses of the company; management of the company’s growth; the ability to successfully identify and 
make attractive acquisitions, joint ventures or investments, or successfully integrate future acquisitions or businesses; the availability, 
cost or shortage of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or  qualified personnel; the absence or loss of key employees; uncertainty 
associated with estimates of oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and resources and the variance of such estimates from actual  future 
production; dependence upon compressors, gathering lines, pipelines and other facilities, certain of which the company does not control; 
the  ability  to  satisfy  obligations  under  the  company’s  firm  commitment  transportation  arrangements;  the  uncertainties  related  to  the 
company’s  identified  drilling  locations;  operating  hazards  and  uninsured  risks;  the  possibility  that  company’s  drilling  activities  may 
encounter sour gas; execution of the company’s business plan; failure to acquire or develop replacement reserves; the concentration of 
the  company’s  assets  in  the  Kakwa  River  Project  area;  unforeseen  title  defects;  Aboriginal  claims;  failure  to  accurately  estimate 
abandonment and reclamation costs; development and exploratory drilling efforts and well operations may not be profitable or  achieve 
the targeted return; dependence on employees and contractors; third-party claims regarding the company’s right to use technology and 
equipment; expiry of certain leases for undeveloped leasehold acreage in the near future; potential conflicts of interests; actual results 
differing materially from management estimates and assumptions; seasonality of the company’s activities and the Canadian oil and gas 
industry; weather related risks, fires and natural disasters; extensive competition in the company’s industry; changes in the company’s 
credit  ratings;  dependence  upon  a  limited  number  of  customers;  terrorist  attacks  or  armed  conflict;  loss  of  information  and  computer 
systems; security deposits may be required under provincial liability management programs; reassessment by taxing authorities of the 
company’s  prior  transactions  and  filings;  variations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates;  third-party  credit  risk  including  risk 
associated  with  counterparties  in  risk  management  activities  related  to  commodity  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates;  sufficiency  of 
insurance policies; litigation; sufficiency of internal controls; third-party breach of agreements or failure of counterparties to meet their 
commitments; impact of expansion into new activities on risk exposure; risks related to the company’s senior unsecured notes and other 
indebtedness, including potential inability to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement related to the company’s credit facilities 
and/or the covenants in the indentures in respect of the senior secured notes. 
 
The references to reserves that are contained herein are based upon evaluations that were conducted by the  company’s independent 
qualified  independent  reserves  evaluator,  McDaniel  &  Associates  Consultants  Ltd.  (McDaniel),  effective  as  at  December  31,  2015. 
Estimates of the company’s reserves before the completion of the Acquisition are based upon the reports that were prepared by McDaniel 
evaluating the company’s oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, dated March 7, 2016. Estimates of the reserves that are attributable to the 
Assets  to  be  acquired  from  Paramount  upon  the  satisfaction  of  the  closing  conditions  that  are  contained  in  the  purchase  and  sale 
agreement between Seven Generations and Paramount are based upon the report dated July 5, 2016 that was prepared by McDaniel 
evaluating the oil, natural gas and NGL reserves  attributable to the Assets, as at December 31, 2015. The  estimates of reserves are 
estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Both evaluations were prepared in compliance 
with the standards set out in the National Instrument 51-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Oil and Gas 
Evaluation Handbook. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates and the differences may be material. There is no 
assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions made by McDaniel in evaluating the reserves of the company and the Assets will 
be attained and variances could be material. For important additional information regarding the independent reserves evaluations that 
were conducted by McDaniel, please refer to the company’s AIF and the company’s material change report dated July 12, 2016, which 
are available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com.

Seven Generations Energy Ltd. is also referred to as Seven Generations, Seven Generations Energy, 7G or the company. 
 
(1)  Seven Generations has adopted the standard of 6 Mcf:1 bbl when converting natural gas to boes. Condensate and other NGLs are 
converted to boes at a ratio of 1 bbl:1 bbl. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 
bbl is based roughly on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a 
value equivalency at the company’s sales point. Given the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is 
significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl, utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 Mcf: 1 bbl may be misleading as an 
indication of value.
