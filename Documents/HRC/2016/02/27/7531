<p><b>  Mission to Brazil</b>* <b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted an official visit to Brazil 
from 18 to 28 March 2013 on the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p> During its visit, the Working Group met with senior authorities from the 
executive and judicial branches, as well as with State and local authorities. The Working 
Group visited places where persons are deprived of their liberty in Brasilia, Campo 
Grande, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group observed a number of positive initiatives, such as the 
amendments made in 2011 to the Criminal Procedure Code stipulating that preventive 
detention is to be considered a last resort and applicable to those who have committed 
crimes with more than four years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group nonetheless draws attention to a number of issues that need 
to be effectively addressed in order to ensure rigorous protection against the arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty. It noted that, despite the positive legal reforms in the criminal 
justice system, in practice, access to justice for arrested persons and detainees is severely 
deficient in many aspects.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group expresses concern at the excessive use of deprivation of 
liberty in Brazil, which has one of the world&#8217;s largest prison populations, and at the 
</p>

<p>number of persons currently in pretrial detention. In recent years, the number of 
indigenous persons in the prison population has increased by 33 per cent, and they are 
often discriminated against both when preventive measures are applied and when 
punishment is imposed, often involving harsh imprisonment. There is a worrying trend 
towards using the deprivation of liberty as a measure of first rather than last resort, as 
would be required by international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p> As a result of excessive detention, detention facilities are usually overcrowded. In 
some cases, the number of detainees exceeds capacity by 100 per cent.  
</p>
<p> Access to justice for detainees has been weakened by severe lack and sometimes 
absence of effective legal assistance. The majority of those who are in prison are young, 
black men with poor backgrounds who cannot afford a private lawyer. The sheer 
workload of public defenders is also a critical problem that has an adverse impact on the 
right of a detainee to equality and fair trial.  
</p>
<p> The compulsory confinement of drug users and chemical dependents is also an 
issue of concern that raises questions regarding various fundamental human rights, 
particularly given that judicial review is no longer carried out once a drug user has been 
placed in detention.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group acknowledges the challenges that Brazil must face when 
tackling an increasing number of incidents of criminal activities, and that often public 
opinion supports laws and policies that are tough on crime. The Working Group recalls, 
however, that policies and actions relating to the deprivation of liberty at the federal and 
State levels should adhere and conform fully to international human rights standards, the 
same ones that Brazil has endorsed through the agreements it has signed and ratified. 
These international standards clearly provide protection against the arbitrary deprivation 
of liberty. </p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted an official visit to Brazil 
from 18 to 28 March 2013 on the invitation of the Government. The delegation comprised 
two members of the Working Group, Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile) and Vladimir Tochilovsky 
(Ukraine). They were accompanied by staff members of the Working Group secretariat. 
</p><p>2. The Working Group thanks the Government of Brazil for the invitation to visit the 
country. The visit was the eighteenth to Brazil by a human rights mechanism of the United 
Nations. The Working Group was able to carry out the various stages of the visit thanks to 
the full cooperation of the Government. It also thanks the United Nations Development 
Programme for its assistance in preparing the visit. The Working Group also extends its 
appreciation to the civil society organizations that it was able to meet in Brazil. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group benefited from various meetings held with federal and State 
authorities and the valuable information they provided.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group met with senior authorities from the executive and judicial 
branches of the State, including the Minister for Justice; the Minister for Health; the 
Minister and Chief of the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic; the 
Minister and Chief of the Human Rights Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic; the 
Minister and Chief of Staff of the Presidency of the Republic; members of the Superior 
Tribunal of Justice and the National Council of General Public Defenders; a representative 
of the Federal Council of Lawyers Guild of Brazil; the National Council of the Public 
Ministry; the National Council of Justice; the National Secretariat of Public Security; the 
National Penitentiary Department; the National Ombudsman on Human Rights; the Human 
Rights Defence Council; the Secretariat for Policies on Women; the Secretariat for Policies 
on Promotion of Racial Equality; the Health Provision Secretariat; the National Secretariat 
for the Promotion of Children&#8217;s and Adolescents&#8217; Rights; and the National Secretariat for 
the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. In all the cities that it visited, the Working Group met with officials of ministries, 
first-instance judges and prosecutors, and local authorities. In the Federal District, it met 
with representatives of the Tribunal of Justice, the Public Ministry and the Public Defence 
Office, as well as with representatives of the State Secretariats of Public Security, Children 
and Minors, and Justice, Human Rights and Citizenship. In the State of Cear&#225;, the Working 
Group met with representatives of the Tribunal of Justice and the Public Ministry and 
Public Defence, as well as with the Cear&#225; Secretariat of Justice and Citizenship. In Rio de 
Janeiro, it met with representatives of the Tribunal of Justice, the Public Ministry and the 
Public Defence, as well as with the Secretariat of Social Assistance and Human Rights and 
the Secretariat of Security. 
</p>
<p>6. During its visit to S&#227;o Paulo, the Working Group conducted meetings with the State 
Secretariat of Public Security and the State Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration, as 
well as with representatives of the Tribunal of Justice, the Public Ministry and the Public 
Defence Office. Lastly, in Mato Grosso do Sul, the Working Group held meetings with 
representatives of the Tribunal of Justice, the Public Ministry and the Public Defence 
Office, as well as the State Secretariat for Justice and Public Security and the State Agency 
of Administration of the Penitentiary System. In the States visited, the Working Group also 
met with members of Parliament, with representatives of bar associations, representatives 
of international organizations and Brazilian civil society organizations. </p>

<p>7. The Working Group appreciates the fact that it was able to visit all the places of 
detention it had requested and to conduct private interviews with the detainees of its choice, 
without restriction.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group visited places where persons are deprived of their liberty in 
Brasilia, Campo Grande; Fortaleza; Rio de Janeiro; and S&#227;o Paulo. In Cear&#225;, the Working 
Group made an unannounced visit to a police station, and visited the III Detention Facility 
&#8220;Professor Juca Neto&#8221; (Complejo Penitenciario Estadual Itaitinga II) and the Psychiatric 
Unit of the Sanatory and Penal Hospital Ota Lobo. In Rio de Janeiro, it visited the 
Penitentiary Complex of Gineciro in Bangu &#8220;Vicente Piravige&#8221;, as well as the Centre 
Belford Roxo (CAI-Baixada). In the State of S&#227;o Paulo, the Working Group visited the 
Experimental Health Unit (Unidade Experimental de Sa&#250;de) as well as the Temporary 
Detention Facility I de Pinheiros. Lastly, In the State of Mato Grosso de Su the delegation 
visited the Col&#243;nia Agr&#237;cola of Campo Grande. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of institutional and legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and institutional system 
</b></p>
<p>9. The law provides for an independent judiciary. There are specialized courts for 
military, police, labour, juvenile, family matters and elections. Article 92 of the federal 
Constitution establishes that the judiciary is made up of the Federal Supreme Court of 
Justice, the Superior Court of Justice, the federal regional courts, labour courts, electoral 
courts, military courts, federal and State district courts, and judges.  
</p><p>10. The States have the authority to organize their own justice system within the federal 
system, provided that they respect the principles set forth in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>11. Military courts at the federal level comprise a Superior Military Court, military 
courts and judges. Ten judges of the Superior Military Court are active-service military, 
while five of them are civilians. Sentences handed down by the Superior Military Court 
may be appealed before the Federal Supreme Court of Justice. Military courts are not 
competent to tried civilians.  
</p>
<p>12. The National Council of Justice (Conselho Nacional de Justi&#231;a) is the main 
supervising body of the judiciary at the federal level. Within the Council, the Mutir&#227;o 
Carcer&#225;rio monitors and oversees prisons. Every State has a local prison council (conselho 
penitenci&#225;rio) that makes recommendations to judges on whether individual prisoners 
should be paroled, pardoned or have their sentences commuted, as well as whether they 
should be moved to a lower level of security.  
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group was informed that the judiciary was underfunded and often 
subject to political and economic influence. The backlog in federal and State cases 
frequently led courts to dismiss old cases unheard. At the same time, the Working Group 
noted the efforts made by the judiciary, the National Council of Justice and other organs to 
guarantee access to justice throughout the country.  
</p><p>14. The Office of the Public Prosecutor (Promotor P&#250;blico) is responsible for bringing 
criminal charges under federal or State law. Prosecutors rely solely on the investigations of 
the Federal Police and the State Civil Police to establish whether enough evidence exists to 
lay criminal charges. Prosecutors do not have their own investigative capacity.  
</p>
<p>15. Military prosecutors are responsible for bringing criminal charges under federal or 
State law for violations of the Military Penal Code. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>16. Complementary Law No. 80 of 12 January 1994 provides for the creation of public 
defenders&#8217; offices (Defensoria P&#250;blica) in each State. In Brazil today, there are 
approximately 5,500 public defenders, 12,000 prosecutors and 16,000 judges.  
</p><p>17. The Secretariat for Human Rights of the President of the Republic (Secretaria de 
Direitos Humanos da Presid&#234;ncia du Republica) is responsible for elaborating projects and 
coordinating tasks to promote and protect human rights. The office of the National Human 
Rights Ombudsman has received, since its establishment, more than 170,000 complaints of 
alleged human rights violations, including cases of arbitrary detention.  
</p>
<p>18. The Federal Police, operating under the Ministry of Justice, is a small, primarily 
investigative, force.  
</p>
<p>19. Most police forces come under the control of the States. The State police acts under 
the authority of the governors of the State, and is divided into the uniformed military police, 
charged with maintaining order and repressing behaviour that might affect the security of 
citizens, and the civil police, composed of plain-clothed officers who have an investigative 
function. 
</p>
<p>20. The military police is considered an army auxiliary and reserve force. A special 
police court exercises jurisdiction over State military police, except for police members 
those charged with &#8220;wilful crimes against life&#8221; (in which case, common civilian courts are 
competent). Delays in the proceedings of this court have allowed many cases to expire due 
to the statute of limitations.  
</p>
<p>21. Military police officers are tried in military courts, in which judges and penal 
prosecutors hearing cases are military officers. 
</p>
<p>22. The civil police force is responsible for initiating police inquiries (enqu&#233;rito 
policial), which is the first step of a criminal prosecution. The force has a judiciary function 
and operates at State level. The infrastructure of the force includes the agencies responsible 
for identification, criminology and forensic medical examination. 
</p>
<p>23.  Municipalities may constitute their own municipal police to protect property, 
services and facilities.  
</p>
<p>24. The offices of the police Ombudsmen (Ouvidor&#237;as de Policia) in the States were 
created in the 1990s to fill the void left by the lack of action taken by the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s offices in overseeing police agencies. They are external control mechanisms 
tasked with disciplinary oversight of the State police. 
</p>
<p>25. The Internal Affairs Units (Corregedor&#237;as) of the military and civil police forces in 
the States have real investigative capacity for police misconduct, including cases of ill-
treatment or torture.  
</p>
<p>26. The National Penitentiary Department (Departamento Penitenci&#225;rio Nacional), 
which comes under the Ministry of Justice, supervises corrections facilities in each State, 
including their funding needs, and maintains maximum security federal prisons. 
</p>
<p>27.  Brazil does not have a centralized prison authority with executive powers; most 
prisons are under State-level authorities. The Law on Criminal Execution No. 7.210 of 11 
July 1984 regulates the organization of the penitentiary system. The Law on Criminal 
Execution established community councils (<i>conselhos da comunidade</i>) to monitor prisons 
through unannounced visits. Membership in the Council is an unpaid voluntary position 
</p>
<p>28. The Law on Criminal Execution also outlines the functions of the organs of criminal 
prosecution, such as the judge on the application of sentences (Juiz da Execu&#231;&#227;o), the 
Public Prosecution Office (Ministerio Publico) and the Public Defence Office (Defensoria </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Publica). This law regulates all aspects relating to the treatment of prisoners, their rights 
and duties.  
</p>
<p>29. The Law on Criminal Execution provides for three penitentiary regimes: closed 
regime (prisons); semi-open regimes (farming and industrial colonies) and open regimens 
(half-way houses).  
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>30. Human rights treaties have a superior hierarchic level than ordinary domestic laws. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to the protection of human rights, Brazil is a party to the core universal 
international and regional human rights treaties and agreements, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It has 
recognized the specific competences contained in article 14 of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (individual complaints); in 
articles 8 and 9 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women (inquiry procedure); and in articles 21 and 22 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (Inter-State complaints and individual complaints).  
</p><p>32. Brazil is a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Optional Protocol thereto, and to the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Forced Disappearance. It is not a Party to the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families or to the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>33. Concerning the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, Brazil has submitted declarations or reservations to its article 2. 
</p>
<p>34. Brazil has also adhered to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention 
relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols 
additional thereto, the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, 
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Convention against 
Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group was informed during its visit that Brazilian domestic legislation 
and jurisprudence only rarely refer to international human rights principles and norms.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Judicial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>36.  At the national level, the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil of 1988 
affirms, in its Title I, that the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle of the 
State and central to its commitment to the rule of law. The Constitution also indicates that 
the State&#8217;s international relations are governed by the prevalence of human rights.  
</p>
<p>37.  The Constitution provides protection for core fundamental rights, including the 
right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one&#8217;s liberty. Title II of the Constitution defines the 
fundamental rights of all persons, and outlines the State&#8217;s commitment to protecting those 
rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>38. The Constitution also provides<i>, </i>inter alia, for the right to free legal assistance for the 
indigent; the right of arrested persons to specific judicial remedies, such as habeas corpus; 
the right of an arrested person to be informed of his or her rights; the right to have a judicial 
order revoking an illegal arrest and the right not to be imprisoned where the law permits 
release on one&#8217;s own recognizance. Various laws have been enacted in recent years that 
have strengthened the constitutional right to liberty. 
</p>
<p>39. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention. Only judges may decide on the 
validity of any deprivation of liberty. Arrests must be made with a warrant, with the 
exception of suspects caught in the act. Police officers must bring a person detained before 
a judge no later than the day after the person&#8217;s arrest. They may arrest an individual only on 
the basis of a judicial warrant issued by a competent judicial authority, with the exception 
of cases <i>in</i> <i>flagrante delicto</i>. Suspects must be informed of their rights at the time of the 
arrest or before being taken into custody for interrogation. Arrest warrants must be based on 
sufficient evidence.  
</p>
<p>40. The Criminal Procedure Code of 1941 was substantially reformed in 2011. It 
regulates preventive imprisonment and detention. Its article 283 establishes that no person 
may be imprisoned except for <i>flagrante delicto</i> or if decreed in writing, with due 
justification by the competent judicial authority.  
41. Provisional detention is limited to five days under specific conditions, although a 
judge may extend this period. Temporary detention is for an additional five-day period for 
processing. Preventive detention is for an initial period of 15 days.  
</p>
<p>42.  Article 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code establishes that preventive detention 
may be ordered by the judge, ex officio, as a result of a criminal lawsuit or upon the request 
of the Public Prosecutor, the plaintiff or attendee, or by a representative of the police 
authority. According to article 313, preventive detention may also be ordered as a guarantee 
for public order, economic order or if deemed convenient for criminal instruction.  
</p>
<p>43. If a detainee is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, the police are required to inform a judge 
thereon within 24 hours. Use of force during arrest is prohibited unless the suspect attempts 
to escape or resists. The court must charge the individual at the latest by the end of the day 
following the arrest. The chief judicial officer determines whether it should proceed and, if 
so, assigns it to a State prosecutor, who decides whether to issue an indictment.  
</p>
<p>44. The police inquiry (<i>enqu&#233;rito policial</i>) is non-accusatorial and is conducted 
confidentially. At the end of the police inquiry, when the police have gathered enough 
information, the evidence is handed over to a judge, who then passes the case to a public 
prosecutor, who reviews the file and decides whether to file charges.  
</p>
<p>45. The judge may impose precautionary measures, including detention. Detention is 
imposed in order to (a) uphold the public or economic order; (b) allow the criminal 
investigation to proceed without inhibition; and (c) guarantee the future application of 
criminal law. 
</p>
<p>46. Detainees arrested <i>in</i> <i>flagrante delicto</i> must be charged within 30 days of their 
arrest; other defendants must be charged within 45 days. This period may be extended. Bail 
is available for most crimes, but is granted infrequently.  
</p>
<p>47. The law does not provide for a maximum period of pretrial detention, although it is 
estimated at being usually between 80 and 120 days. Authorities may hold detainees for the 
duration of the investigation and subsequent trial, subject to judicial review. If a court 
acquits a defendant who was previously held in detention, the Government must 
compensate the defendant for financial losses as well as for moral prejudice incurred due to 
incarceration.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Constitution provides for the right to a fair and public trial. The law entitles a 
detainee to prompt access to an attorney. Defendants and their attorneys have access to all 
court-held evidence related to their cases. 
</p>
<p>49. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence. They have the right to confront and 
question witnesses. Defendants have a right of appeal to State superior courts and to appeal 
State court decisions to both the Federal Superior Justice Court and the Federal Supreme 
Court on constitutional grounds. 
</p>
<p>50. Cases involving capital crimes are tried before a jury. Judges try those accused of 
lesser offences. Confessions are allowed as evidence, with few restrictions on their use in 
courts. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Asylum seekers, refugees and migrants 
</b></p>
<p>51. Refugee Law No. 9474/97 provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status in 
accordance with the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto. 
The Government also provides temporary protection to persons who may not qualify as 
refugees. Refugee status is granted to approximately 35 per cent of those who apply. The 
Government affords protection against refoulement.  
</p>
<p>52. Provisions for the imprisonment of foreigners for reasons of irregular migration, and 
deportation and extradition procedures, are set out in Law No. 6.815/1980. No detention 
centres for migrants in an irregular situation or asylum seekers are available. In practice, if 
a foreigner detained for immigration purposed declares her or his will to apply for political 
asylum in Brazil, that person is immediately released. 
</p>
<p>53. CONARE, the National Committee for Refugees, is an interministerial body chaired 
by the Ministry of Justice that comprises representatives of the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs, Education, and Labour and Health, in addition to representatives of the federal 
police and civil society organizations. The Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Brazil is also a member of the Committee, although without 
a right to vote; the Federal Public Defender&#8217;s Office (Defensoria Publica da Uni&#227;o) is a 
consultant member.  
</p>
<p>54. Brazil is also a party to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the 
Council of Europe Convention on the Avoidance of Statelessness in relation to State 
Succession. No procedures for determining statelessness status have, however, been 
established.  
</p>
<p>55.  National migration laws seem to be outdated, which results in migrants using the 
asylum process in an attempt to legalize their stay in the country.  
</p>
<p>56. In 2012, CONARE signed an agreement with the Federal Public Defender&#8217;s Office 
to allow public defenders to interview asylum seekers and recognized refugees and to 
represent them in judicial procedures.  
</p><p>57. In 2010, a new law granted permission to the military forces at State borders to 
make arrests and to search persons, vehicles, vessels and aircraft. The inability of border 
agents and migratory authorities to identify persons with international protection needs can 
lead to the detention of asylum seekers, prevention from entering the territory or return to 
their country of origin. Refugees may thus be intercepted as illegal migrants, especially in 
the Amazon region.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive aspects 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Working Group recognizes that the Brazilian authorities are confronting an 
authoritarian culture, the legacy of colonial times and of 21 years of military dictatorship 
(from March 1962 to March 1985). Nonetheless, the federal Constitution of 1988 is a 
modern instrument that consecrates and incorporates international human rights principles 
and norms. IN paragraph 2 of article 5, the Constitution includes among its fundamental 
rights and guarantees other rights that derive from the international treaties to which Brazil 
is a party. The Constitution gives particular force to the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group observed a number of positive recent initiatives, such as the 
amendments made in 2011 to the Criminal Procedure Code stipulating that preventive 
detention is to be considered a last resort and applicable solely to those who have 
committed crimes punished with more than four years of imprisonment. The provision on 
precautionary measures is also progressive, providing alternative measures to the 
deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>60. Law No. 12.403 on precautionary measures, approved in 2011, proposes nine 
alternatives to pretrial detention, such as bail and electronic monitoring. Offenders who 
commit non-violent crimes, which in the case of conviction could carry up to four years in 
prison, are not placed in pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>61. The Law on Penal Execution, amended in 2011, envisages benefits, such as a 
reduction in a prison sentence if the prisoner has taken the initiative to pursue educational 
studies. Positive legislative reforms regarding adolescents who are in conflict with the law 
and in relation to persons with mental disabilities have been enacted as well.  
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group also observed good practices that have the potential to be 
strengthened, which would offer further protection for the right to be free from arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty. Some include existing institutions that can be strengthened, such as 
the National Council of Justice task force, which visits prisons and has assisted in recent 
years in the release of many detainees who were illegally detained. The task force 
conducted reviews of more than 295,000 criminal cases in 2010 and 2011, resulting in the 
release of almost 22,000 prisoners. Similar independent task forces could assist in 
protecting against arbitrary detention if they were to be established at the level of the States 
in Brazil.  
</p>
<p>63. In the State of Rio de Janeiro, a task force was created to address overcrowding in 
prisons. It reviews the sentences and status of inmates to determine whether any should or 
could be released. In July 2011, in the State of S&#227;o Paulo, the National Council of Justice 
began to review the sentences of 94,000 inmates.  
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group commends the Government for the positive efforts it has made, 
particularly through legislative reforms, to improve the situation of deprivation of liberty in 
Brazil.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive recourse to the deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>65. Despite the positive initiatives observed, the Working Group draw the attention of 
the Government to a number of issues that need to be addressed effectively in order to 
ensure rigorous protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group observed that, in practice, access to justice for arrested persons 
and detainees is severely deficient in many aspects. Several prerequisites provide 
fundamental protection against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty; they include core rights 
of arrested and detained persons at the pretrial and trial stages, and after conviction. 
Deprivation of liberty is thus considered to be arbitrary if particular rights to a fair trial are 
violated. These rights relate to the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by law, 
the right to effective legal defence, the right to be tried without undue delay and the right to 
appeal to a higher court.  
</p>
<p>67. Throughout their visit, the members of the Working Group consistently referred to 
international human rights standards, particularly those enshrined in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Brazil has acceded. In particular, article 9 
of the Covenant envisages safeguards against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>68. Although there is no legal maximum fixed term for pretrial detention, a period of 
between 80 and 120 days is normally cited in case law. This period corresponds to the sum 
of all terms legally provided for in criminal proceedings from initial investigation through 
to imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>69.  With a prison population of more than 549,000, Brazil has the largest in Latin 
America and is one of the largest in the world. There are approximately 248 detainees per 
100,000 inhabitants. Even more troubling, around 217,000 detainees (43.5 per cent) are 
awaiting trial in pretrial detention. This percentage is especially significant in the States of 
Amap&#225;, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Amazonas, Sergipe and Piau&#237;. Some 91,600 convicts 
work; 3,392 prisoners are foreigners. 
</p>
<p>70. The female prison population, currently around 38,430 (7 per cent), has, in recent 
years, been growing at twice the rate as that of men. The proportion of indigenous persons 
in the prison population has also increased by 33 per cent. Many people in prison have been 
accused of drug trafficking (24.3 per cent) and offences against property (4 per cent). 
</p><p>71. The members of the Working Group were also informed that indigenous persons 
were often discriminated against both when preventive measures were applied and when 
punishment was imposed, which often involved harsh imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group received serious allegations concerning ill-treatment and abuse 
during apprehension and arrest, as well as during detention in police stations, particularly in 
tort of young Afro-descendants.  
</p>
<p>73. A study presented in 2012 by the Instituto Terra, Trabalho e Cidadania and the 
Pastoral Carcer&#225;ria in the Centro de Deten&#231;&#227;o Provis&#243;ria I of S&#227;o Paulo found that, in Rio 
de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo, pretrial detention was not sufficiently justified in 93 per cent of 
cases (the authority limited itself to invoking <i>in flagrante delicto</i>), and that, in 63 per cent 
of them, the legal argument given to prolong detention was &#8220;public order&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>74. In addition, the backlog and overwhelming number of cases as resulted in increasing 
delays in the judging of cases. Judges hear several criminal cases in a single day as a 
routine practice, which has significantly affected the right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>75. The Working Group observed that judges routinely imprison large numbers of 
people who have been accused of minor offences, such as petty theft. More than one third 
of all persons detained on this charge spend more than 100 days in custody, and many 
spend more time on remand than serving the term to which they are actually sentenced. 
</p>
<p>76. There are 33,000 people in the prisons of the State of Rio de Janeiro, including 
1,600 women. Around 14,000 are in pretrial detention. Some 2,700 people are in a semi-
open regimen. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>77. Approximately 202,000 people are in detention in the State of S&#227;o Paulo, including 
12,600 women. Some 16,000 people are subjected to alternative measures. 
</p><p>78. According to the Law of Penal Execution modified on 30 June 2011, inmates have a 
day removed from their sentence for every 12 hours that they attend classes. 
</p>
<p>79. One worrying trend observed by the Working Group was that deprivation of liberty 
is being used as the first resort rather than the last, as required by international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>80. Detainees are commonly held in police custody and later released without any 
registration, sometimes without being informed of the offences of which they are accused 
or of their rights as detainees. 
</p>
<p>81.  Many detainees interviewed by the Working Group complained that judges and 
prosecutors rarely visited them. They referred to having been victim of the excessive use of 
force, ill-treatment and beatings during apprehension and their detention in police stations. 
</p>
<p>82. The excessive use of pretrial detention contributes to overcrowding, the lack of 
effective separation between convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, and excessive resort 
to condemnatory sentences.  
</p>
<p>83. In addition, owing to poor record keeping and systemic and bureaucratic failings, 
many inmates remained in detention beyond the term of their sentences. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Overcrowding 
</b></p>
<p>84. Brazil has four federal prisons and 1,124 State prisons, 55 of which exclusively for 
women. The total capacity is of these facilities is 355,000;. However, the penitentiary 
system, however, currently holds some 549,000 detainees and prisoners. Most prisons are 
in a precarious situation. Their infrastructure is sub-standard, often inadequate, and the 
number of education, health and welfare professionals working in them is insufficient.  
</p>
<p>85. As a result of excessive detention, detention facilities are usually overcrowded. In 
some cases, the number of detainees was found to exceed the capacity by 100 per cent. In 
addition, this situation could be further exacerbated if the estimated 192,000 arrest warrants 
currently pending were to be executed.  
</p>
<p>86. Despite the amendment made to the Criminal Procedure Code in 2011 to allow for 
alternative measures to detention, the Working Group observed that there had been no 
substantial reduction in the use of detention since the introduction of the amendment. In 
incidences where measures such as bail were applied, the detainee was not able to pay the 
amount required. It should not be assumed, however that these amounts are systematically 
established at a level higher than the paying capability of individuals.  
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group found that deprivation of liberty was imposed even in situations 
where the offence was regarded as minor, such as petty non-violent theft or for non-
payment of child support, raising serious concerns with regard to the application of the 
principle of proportionality. 
</p>
<p>88. Severe overcrowding in prisons and detention centres is prevalent, particularly in the 
States of Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo. In a penitentiary system designed to hold 211,255 
prisoners, there are currently 342,388. The Pinheiros Women&#8217;s Facility in the city of S&#227;o 
Paulo held 1,261 detainees in a building designed to hold 512. There is no a semi-open 
centre for women in Brasilia.  
</p>
<p>89. In the semi-open Agro-Industrial Penal Centre of Gameleira (Mato Grosso do Sul), 
there were, at time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, 630 people deprived of their liberty. Of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>them, 470 were working, 240 outside the centre. Each of them was receiving an amount 
equivalent to the general minimal salary.  
</p>
<p>90. Overcrowding often requires holding convicted prisoners in pretrial detention 
centres.  
</p>
<p>91. In 2010, 57,195 people (12 per cent of the total Brazilian prison population) were 
imprisoned in police precincts (<i>delegac&#237;as</i>). Detainees tend to stay for longer than 24 hours 
because of the lack of space in prison facilities. Police stations were never designed to host 
detainees for long periods. Police officers thus assume guarding functions. In police 
stations, detainees have very limited access to medical care and doctors.  
</p>
<p>92. Public policies that are &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; lead to a harsh trend of mass incarceration, 
while most States have neither the capacity nor the structure to deal with the consequences. 
Endemic overcrowding leads to the mistreatment of prisoners and inadequate facilitates for 
inmates.  
</p>
<p>93. In June 2008, the National Penitentiary Department determined that the number of 
prisoners exceeded the capacity for which the prisons were designed by 40 per cent. 
</p>
<p>94. Overcrowding has led to inmate unrest and a rising number of riots and killings in 
prisons.  
</p>
<p>95. The Working Group considers that overcrowding should be reduced by increasing 
the use of alternative measures of constraint and alternative sentences, particularly for less 
serious offences.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Prolonged pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>96. In the fourth largest prison population in the world, 44 per cent are pretrial 
detainees. During its visit, the Working Group came across cases where prolonged pretrial 
detention lasted for many months, even years. During that period, detainees were often 
unaware of the status of their case.  
</p>
<p>97. The Working Group was constantly informed that a backlog in court cases caused 
substantial and serious delays in trials. Appeals to the higher courts also took a long time to 
be settled.  
</p>
<p>98. The Working Group points out that the excessive recourse to pretrial detention 
contradicts basic rule of law principles and also has implications for detainees, who are 
exposed to threats against their life, physical integrity and health, and to abuses and ill-
treatment by guards and police officers. 
</p>
<p>99. Many pretrial detainees were found to be held in a security level inappropriate for 
the offences that they had allegedly committed. Others had been detained for far longer as 
pretrial detainees as they would have expected if actually sentenced.  
</p>
<p>100. The presumption of innocence enshrined by the Constitution seems to be a practice 
that has been abandoned by judges. Public pressure resulting from the drawn-out nature of 
judicial trials has led to an increasing number of people in pretrial detention. The Working 
Group considers that the high number of detainees in pretrial detention could be a 
consequence of the inability of the criminal justice system to process cases efficiently.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> E. Absence of effective legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>101. Access to legal counsel is guaranteed by article 14, paragraph 3 (d) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights from the outset of detention.1 If a 
detainee cannot afford an attorney, Brazilian law requires the court to provide a public 
defender or private attorney at public expense. Indigents must be provided by a defence 
lawyer paid by the State.  
</p>
<p>102. In its interviews with detainees and prisoners, the Working Group found that free 
legal assistance was not available to all those who needed it. The problem with access to 
justice for detainees has been worsened by a severe lack and, in some cases, the absence of 
effective legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>103. In the State of S&#227;o Paulo, which used to employ private attorneys, a State public 
defender&#8217;s office was established in 2006. Since then, 610 public defenders have been 
working in 41 municipalities. The Public Defender&#8217;s Office of the State of Goi&#225;s was 
opened in June 2011. The first exam for the recruitment of 40 public defenders is under 
way. In the State of Paran&#225;, 87 candidates were approved and posted. In Santa Catarina, the 
system of recruitment of lawyers hired by convention (<i>non concursados</i>) was declared 
unconstitutional. At present, 56 public defenders are on duty and operate in 15 
municipalities of the State. The State of Rio de Janeiro has a 60 year-old and experienced 
public defender&#8217;s system, with more than 800 public defenders (73 exclusively focusing on 
criminal cases), but it constitutes an exception in the context of the whole country.  
104. Public defenders assigned to the penitentiary system should, by law, visit prisons 
and detention centres at least once a week. A common complaint heard from all parties 
interviewed, including members of the judiciary, was that there were not enough public 
defenders or sufficient legal assistance available for those in detention. The majority of 
those in prison are young, indigenous people and Afro-descendants with poor backgrounds 
who cannot afford private lawyers. The Working Group observed in general that the 
majority of those disadvantaged in the criminal justice system, including adolescents and 
women, were poor and could not afford proper legal defence. 
</p>
<p>105. The lack of institutional autonomy and of financial and human resources has 
curtailed the work of public defenders. Their sheer workload is also a critical problem. 
Public defenders who provide free legal aid can have as many as 800 cases at a time, which 
has an adverse impact on the right of a detainee to equality and fair trial. Even in States 
where there is a public defence system, rural areas often do not have public defenders 
assisting those in detention. The heavy work load also prevents public defenders from 
carrying out their responsibilities efficiently.  
</p>
<p>106. The detainees interviewed by the Working Group claimed that they only met their 
public defender at the beginning of their trial (arraignment), which could be months after 
their arrest. In some cases, it took years for a detainee to appear in court. A detainee&#8217;s 
chance of meeting and discussing his or her case before trial was higher if the detainee 
could afford a private lawyer.  
</p>
<p>107. Public defenders do not lack the necessary competency and qualification to carry out 
their responsibilities; the problem relates mainly to the sheer workload that they have to 
manage. Furthermore, <i>pro bono</i> services are often not available to detainees, such as in the 
State of S&#227;o Paulo. Judges informed the Working Group of their own difficulties in 
handling increasing caseloads. In some places, there are insufficient judges to deal with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/CONF.144/28/Rev.1, p. 117. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>criminal cases. In Brasilia, there are only nine public defenders to handle the demands of a 
penal population of 11,500.  
</p>
<p>108. The Working Group encountered many cases where detainees, although entitled to 
such benefits as moving from a closed regime to a semi-open one could not do so owing to 
the absence of legal assistance. Delays in obtaining a judicial order to initiate a process 
were an issue raised constantly throughout the visit of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>109. The mass release of prisoners by the National Council of Judges in recent years 
shows that the criminal justice system is largely incapable of providing effective and 
adequate legal assistance in following up on the cases of detainees.  
</p>
<p>110. The Working Group was also informed of problems experienced by detainees and 
prisoners in communicating with their relatives and lawyers owing to the absence of 
telephones or appropriate channels of communication. It learned of several cases in which 
persons deprived of their liberty had not been able to inform a third person of their choice 
about their detention for prolonged periods of time. To contact their lawyer, detainees were 
often forced to communicate through family members during visits. Detainees without a 
family had no way of contacting their lawyer to obtain information on their case. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Compulsory confinement of drug users 
</b></p>
<p>111. The compulsory confinement of drug users and chemical dependents is also an issue 
of concern. Compulsory confinement is one of the three types of confinement provided for 
in article 6 of Federal Law 10.216/2001; the remaining two are voluntary and involuntary 
confinement. The latter may only be authorized by a medical doctor and at the request of a 
third party, usually a family member or legal representative. This type of confinement is to 
be notified to the Public Prosecutor within 72 hours. 
</p>
<p>112. The excessive use of detention as a punitive measure for drug users raises questions 
regarding various fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>113. In the State of S&#227;o Paulo, compulsory confinement of addicts of crack cocaine and 
other drugs has been introduced in an effort to bring users on the street into detention. At 
the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, 5,335 persons were detained in compulsory 
confinement.  
</p>
<p>114. On 4 January 2013, the Governor of the State of S&#227;o Paulo announced a new 
regional plan to fight drug consumption whereby crack users would be put in compulsory 
psychiatric confinement. To manage confinement, a standing court (Plant&#227;o Judici&#225;rio) was 
established. In a police operation in a neighbourhood of S&#227;o Paulo, more than 2,000 crack 
users were arrested.  
</p>
<p>115. In the State of Rio de Janeiro, most of those targeted under compulsory drug 
treatment are children and adolescents living on the streets. Those detained in this context 
are often placed in facilities unknown to their families or lawyers, who therefore had 
serious difficulties visiting them. 
</p>
<p>116. Habeas corpus is established by law but difficult to apply in practice in the case of, 
for instance, those detained for drug addiction, given that information concerning their 
identity and where they are being held is often difficult to obtain. 
</p>
<p>117. Police agents are said to target drug users in order to arrest them, and have often 
carried out arrests indiscriminately. These measures are also strongly enforced in view of 
the Football Association World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics Games in 2016, 
which Brazil will host. According to the Government, compulsory admission of chemical 
dependents, particularly crack users, does not constitute a punitive measure, since neither </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>drug use nor drug addiction are considered crimes in Brazil. The purpose of the compulsory 
admission measures applied is to provide emergency treatment to chemical dependents that 
are in a particularly vulnerable situation.  
</p>
<p>118. The Working Group noted that judicial periodic reviews are often not carried out 
once a drug user has been put in detention. If no judicial review is conducted, a person may 
be detained for prolonged periods, even when that person is eligible for release. This is a 
cause for concern, given that the number of those arrested for drug-related offences in the 
country is particularly high.  
</p>
<p>119. The Working Group considers that, in all cases, drug addicts should be held in 
compulsory confinement only by judicial order and consent has been sought, if the person 
has refused medical treatment and undergone a medical examination. It should be applied 
for only short periods of time, and only when the drug addict is considered a threat to 
society.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Detention of minors 
</b></p>
<p>120. The Law on Children and Adolescents (No. 8069) of 1990 makes a distinction 
between a child under the age of 12 and an adolescent, between the age of 12 and 18. In 
exceptional cases, the law applies to those between 18 and 21 years of age (young adults). 
It establishes that no child or adolescent should be deprived of her/his liberty unless 
arrested <i>in</i> <i>flagrante delicto</i> or by written and well-founded order of a judicial authority. 
121. Pretrial detention of minors may last a maximum of 45 days. Detention is not to be 
applied in cases where adequate alternative measures are possible. The maximum period of 
detention may not exceed three years, after which the adolescent is released or placed in a 
system of semi-liberty or assisted liberty. Release is compulsory when the offender reaches 
21 years of age. Continued detention should be re-evaluated every six months.  
</p>
<p>122. The Working Group was informed that crimes, offences and misdemeanours 
committed by adolescents and children are considered infractions and recorded in the 
National Registry of Adolescents in Conflict with the Law. Between January and June 
2011, 29,506 adolescents were subjected to socio-educational measures, and 91,321 were 
placed on the National Registry for various infractions. 
</p>
<p>123. In Brasilia, the proportion of minors in detention is five times higher than that in the 
rest of the country.  
</p>
<p>124. The Working Group reiterates the need to employ alternative measures to detention 
only as required by international human rights standards, particularly when dealing with 
minors. It was informed of many cases where minors had been placed in detention for 
minor offences or infractions that did not justify deprivation of liberty.  
</p><p>125. One of the most serious findings of the Working Group related to six adolescents 
currently detained at the Experimental Health Unit (Unidade Experimental de Sa&#250;de) in 
S&#227;o Paulo, which the Working Group was able to visit. The adolescents were originally 
detained for serious and dangerous crimes, and were close to the maximum sentence of 
three-years prescribed by law when they were transferred to the Experimental Health Unit, 
where they were institutionalized without due legal process.  
</p>
<p>126. The Working Group is concerned at the absence of a legal basis for the detention of 
the above-mentioned individuals, particularly in the light of the fact that there is no clear 
deadline to the length of their detention. It was also informed that no effective judicial 
review of these cases had been conducted. Some members of the judiciary interviewed 
believed that their detention might even be unconstitutional. To justify the deprivation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>liberty of these individuals and to respond to the social and media pressure to keep them in 
detention, a law dating back to the 1930s has been used to provide legal support for the 
detention. The law does not comply with the principles and norms enshrined in the 
Constitution of Brazil and in international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>127. The Working Group is of the view that the above-mentioned type of deprivation of 
liberty is arbitrary under international human rights standards, particularly if it is without 
legal basis.  
</p>
<p>128. The Working Group observed that the health and sanitary conditions in the juvenile 
detention centres it visited in Rio de Janeiro were poor.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Deprivation of liberty of persons with mental disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>129. Custodial care of persons with mental disabilities is gradually being abolished; the 
system now provides care in the community, allowing free access to a variety of mental 
health services. Federal Law No. 10.216/2001 on Psychiatric Reform (based on Italian 
legislation) makes it illegal to construct new psychiatric institutions, and provide for 
progressively closing existing structures. Four psychiatric hospitals have been closed in the 
State of Cear&#225;. 
</p>
<p>130. The Working Group was able to gather information regarding the deprivation of 
liberty of persons in the context of psychiatric institutions, and was informed that some of 
these institutions are often used to detain drug addicts as well. 
</p>
<p>131. Currently, some 4,500 persons are deprived of their liberty for mental disabilities.  
</p>
<p>132. Hospitalization in a psychiatric institution is a security measure of an undefined 
duration. In order to leave the psychiatric hospital, relatives of the interned patient must 
sign a commitment to submit the patient to ambulatory treatment for one year. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>133. <b>The Working Group acknowledges the difficult challenges that Brazil faces in 
confronting an authoritarian culture, the legacy of its colonial past and of 21 years of 
military dictatorship. Authorities are also tackling increasing incidents of criminal 
activities, such as homicide, gang violence, drug and human trafficking. In this 
context, the general public often supports governmental laws and policies that are 
tough on crime.  
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>The Working Group nonetheless cautions that government policies and actions 
relating to the deprivation of liberty at the federal and State level should adhere and 
conform fully to international human rights standards, the same ones that Brazil has 
endorsed in the agreements that it has signed and ratified. These international 
standards clearly provide protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>135. <b>The Working Group recognizes that the problems described in the present 
report require cross-cutting and collective action, and should mobilize government 
authorities, representatives of civil society and other stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>136. <b>The Working Group notes that the problems it witnessed during its visit have 
already been discussed in various forums. Indeed, most of those interviewed both in 
both government and non-governmental meetings agreed that these challenges need to 
be addressed. Members of the judiciary also recognized that there is a need for robust 
changes in order to restructure the justice system and to improve access to justice. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>This is a positive revelation, as a clear understanding of the problems and challenges 
faced will, it is hoped, drive actions and initiatives to address these issues effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>The fact that deprivation of liberty is being used as the first resort rather than 
the last, as would be required by international human rights standards, is a worrying 
trend. Brazil has one of the world&#8217;s largest prison populations, and the largest in 
Latin America. 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>The excessive use of pretrial detention contributes to overcrowding, little 
effective separation of convicted prisoners from pre-trial detainees, and excessive 
resort to condemnatory sentences. It should be recalled that excessive recourse to 
pretrial detention also contradicts basic rule of law principles, and also has 
greater implications for detainees, who are exposed to threats against their 
life, physical integrity and health, and of abuse and ill-treatment by guards 
and police officers. 
</b>139. <b>Indigenous persons and Afro-descendants are often discriminated against both 
when preventive measures are applied and when punishment is imposed, which often 
involves harsh imprisonment.  
</b></p>
<p>140. <b>The Working Group received serious allegations concerning ill-treatment and 
abuse during apprehensions and arrest, as well as during detention in police stations, 
particularly in tort of young Afro-descendants.  
</b></p>
<p>141. <b>The Working Group observed that judges routinely imprison large numbers of 
people who have been accused of minor offences, such as petty theft.  
</b></p>
<p>142. <b>Public policies that are &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; lead to a harsh trend of mass 
incarceration, while most States have neither the capacity nor the structures to deal 
with the consequences. Overcrowding should be reduced by increasing the use of 
alternative measures of constraint and alternative sentences, particularly for less 
serious offences. 
</b></p>
<p>143. <b>The Working Group encountered many cases where detainees entitled to 
penitentiary benefits could not do so owing to the absence of legal assistance. Delays in 
obtaining a judicial order to initiate a process was an issue constantly raised 
throughout the visit of the Working Group.  
</b></p>
<p>144. <b>Periodic judicial reviews are often not carried out once a drug user or a 
chemical dependent has been put in detention. In the absence of judicial review, a 
person may be detained for prolonged periods, even when the person is eligible for 
release. This is a cause for concern, given that the number of those arrested for drug-
related offences in the country is particularly high.  
</b></p>
<p>145. <b>The Working Group reiterates the need to employ alternative measures to 
detention of minors as required by international human rights standards. The 
Working group is concerned at the detention of six adolescents at the Experimental 
Health Unit (Unidade Experimental de Sa&#250;de) in S&#227;o Paulo, and at the absence of 
legal basis for their detention, particularly in the light of the lack of any clear deadline 
for their detention. In addition, there has been no effective judicial review of their 
cases.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>146. <b>The Working Group encourages the Government to ensure that the positive 
legislative and administrative developments described in the present report are </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>accompanied by effective implementation measures, in strict compliance with 
international human rights principles and standards.  
</b></p>
<p>147. <b>The Working Group encourages the Government to continue its efforts to 
ensure that its institutional and legal frameworks regarding deprivation of liberty 
conform fully to the human rights standards enshrined in international human rights 
standards and in its legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>148. <b>On the basis of its findings, the Working Group recommends that the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Pay particular attention to reforming military jurisdiction and re-
organizing the police, at both the federal and State levels, including the military 
police, and strengthening the community police (policia comunit&#225;ria) and the 
proximity police (policia de proximidad); 
 (b) Take appropriate measures to ensure that deprivation of liberty is only 
used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that States consider the model of independent special 
commissions for investigation of police officers in cases of alleged misconduct or ill-
treatment;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Take measures alternative to detention for chemical dependents and 
drug users; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that foreign prisoners serve their sentences in their country of 
origin, so that they are able to enjoy the support of their relatives. The authorities 
should also make further efforts to reach bilateral transfer agreements with other 
States similar to those already signed with more than 23 countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that authorities expedite the effective implementation of a public 
defence system in the States of Goi&#225;s, Paran&#225;, Santa Catarina y S&#227;o Paulo; 
 (g) Ensure that the State of Rio de Janeiro makes further efforts to transfer 
detainees from police stations to penitentiary institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that all prisoners who have fulfilled the requisites to be 
transferred to a semi-open regimen are effectively transferred; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Ensure that, in all cases, drug addicts are held in compulsory 
confinement only by judicial order and after consent has been sought, if the person 
has refused medical treatment and has undergone a medical examination. It should be 
applied only for a short period of time, and only when the drug addict is considered a 
threat to society; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Gradually abolish custodial care of persons with mental disabilities. 
</b>149. <b>The Working Group reiterates the need to employ measures alternative to 
detention, as required by international human rights standards, particularly when 
dealing with minors.
