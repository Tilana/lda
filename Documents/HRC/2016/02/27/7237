<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Thirtieth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 3 
</p>
<p><b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil,  
</b></p>
<p><b>political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the right to development  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Methods of work of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention* 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The methods of work take account of the specific features of the terms of reference 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention under Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>resolutions 1991/42, 1992/28, 1993/36, 1994/32, 1995/59, 1996/28, 1997/50, 1998/41, 
</p>
<p>1999/37, 2000/36, 2001/40, 2002/42, 2003/31 and 2004/39, as well as Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 6/4, 10/9, 15/18 and 24/7. In resolution 1997/50, the Commission gave 
</p>
<p>the Working Group not only the task of informing the Commission by means of a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive report, but also of &#8220;investigating cases of deprivation of liberty imposed 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily&#8221; (para. 15). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Functioning of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was set up under Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights resolution 1991/42. The initial mandate of the Working Group was renewed 
</p>
<p>by the Commission and the Human Rights Council. The Council undertook the mandate of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group in accordance with decision 2006/102 and renewed the mandate by 
</p>
<p>resolutions 6/4, 15/18 and 24/7. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate is considered for renewal 
</p>
<p>every three years. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group is organized internally as follows:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Working Group shall elect, at its spring session, a Chair-Rapporteur, a 
</p>
<p>First Vice-Chair and a Second Vice-Chair, for a term of one year, taking due account of the 
</p>
<p>need for rotation among the geographical regions and the gender balance, among other 
</p>
<p>  
 * The present methods of work supersede those contained in the report of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Arbitrary Detention (A/HRC/16/47 and Corr.1, annex). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>considerations. They shall take office at the end of the same session. Each officer can be re-
</p>
<p>elected;  
</p>
<p> (b) The Chair-Rapporteur shall perform the functions conferred upon her or him 
</p>
<p>by the resolution that creates or renews the mandate of the Working Group, the methods of 
</p>
<p>work and the decisions of the Working Group. The Chair-Rapporteur shall represent the 
</p>
<p>Working Group before the Human Rights Council, States and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>She or he shall chair the sessions of the Working Group;  
</p>
<p> (c) The First Vice-Chair should be the focal point of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>individual complaints, while the Second Vice-Chair should be the focal point of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on follow-up on all actions taken by the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> (d) In the exercise of their functions, the Chair-Rapporteur and the Vice-Chairs 
</p>
<p>shall remain under the authority of the Working Group. In the absence of the Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, the First Vice-Chair, or alternatively the Second Vice-Chair, shall temporarily 
</p>
<p>assume the assigned functions of the Chair-Rapporteur as required by the circumstances. In 
</p>
<p>the absence of either Vice-Chair, the remaining Vice-Chair should temporarily assume the 
</p>
<p>assigned functions of the absent Vice-Chair;  
</p>
<p> (e) Each of these three officers shall report fully to the Working Group at the 
</p>
<p>beginning of each session on activities they have undertaken during the intersession, and on 
</p>
<p>any activity undertaken during a session without the other members of the Working Group;  
</p>
<p> (f) The Working Group can appoint at any time a rapporteur on specific issues of 
</p>
<p>interest. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group meets at least three times a year, for at least five to eight 
</p>
<p>working days, generally in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>5. When the case under consideration or the country visit concerns a country of which 
</p>
<p>one of the members of the Working Group is a national, or in other situations where there 
</p>
<p>may be a conflict of interest, that member shall not participate in the discussion of the case, 
</p>
<p>in the visit or in the preparation of the report on the visit. 
</p>
<p>6. During the course of its deliberations, when dealing with individual cases or 
</p>
<p>situations, the Working Group renders opinions, which are incorporated into its annual 
</p>
<p>report submitted to the Human Rights Council. The opinions of the Working Group are the 
</p>
<p>result of consensus; where consensus is not reached, the view of a majority of the members 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group is adopted as the view of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Implementation of the mandate of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>7. The mandate of the Working Group is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty 
</p>
<p>imposed arbitrarily. In the discharge of its mandate, the Working Group refers to the 
</p>
<p>relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as 
</p>
<p>well as to the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, in 
</p>
<p>particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention relating 
</p>
<p>to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as, when appropriate, the following standards: 
</p>
<p> (a) Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
</p>
<p>Detention or Imprisonment; 
</p>
<p> (b) Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; 
</p>
<p> (c) United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty; </p>


<p> (d) United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile 
</p>
<p>Justice (&#8220;The Beijing Rules&#8221;); 
</p>
<p> (e) Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
</p>
<p> (f) International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families, as well as any other relevant standard. 
</p>
<p>8. As a general rule, in dealing with situations of arbitrary deprivation of liberty within 
</p>
<p>the meaning of paragraph 15 of resolution 1997/50, the Working Group shall refer, in the 
</p>
<p>discharge of its mandate, to the following five legal categories: 
</p>
<p> (a) When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty (as when a person is kept in detention after the completion of his 
</p>
<p>sentence or despite an amnesty law applicable to him) (category I); 
</p>
<p> (b) When the deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of the rights or 
</p>
<p>freedoms guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 
</p>
<p>25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (category II); 
</p>
<p> (c) When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating 
</p>
<p>to the right to a fair trial, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 
</p>
<p>the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, is of such gravity 
</p>
<p>as to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character (category III); 
</p>
<p> (d) When asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees are subjected to prolonged 
</p>
<p>administrative custody without the possibility of administrative or judicial review or 
</p>
<p>remedy (category IV); 
</p>
<p> (e) When the deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of international law on 
</p>
<p>the grounds of discrimination based on birth, national, ethnic or social origin, language, 
</p>
<p>religion, economic condition, political or other opinion, gender, sexual orientation, 
</p>
<p>disability, or any other status, that aims towards or can result in ignoring the equality of 
</p>
<p>human beings (category V). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Submission and consideration of communications 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of communications to the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>9. Communications shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the secretariat, 
</p>
<p>giving the family name, first name and address of the sender and (optionally) his or her 
</p>
<p>telephone, telex and telefax numbers or e-mail address. 
</p>
<p>10. As far as possible, each case shall form the subject of a presentation indicating the 
</p>
<p>circumstances of the arrest or detention and the family name, first name and any other 
</p>
<p>information making it possible to identify the person detained, as well as the latter&#8217;s legal 
</p>
<p>status, particularly:  
</p>
<p> (a) The date and place of the arrest or detention or of any other form of 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty and the identity of those presumed to have carried them out, together 
</p>
<p>with any other information shedding light on the circumstances in which the person was 
</p>
<p>deprived of liberty; 
</p>
<p> (b) The reasons given by the authorities for the arrest, detention or the 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty; 
</p>
<p> (c) The legislation applied in the case; </p>


<p> (d) The action taken, including investigatory action or the exercise of internal 
</p>
<p>remedies, by the administrative and judicial authorities, as well as the steps taken at the 
</p>
<p>international or regional levels, and the results of such action or the reasons why such 
</p>
<p>measures were ineffective or were not taken;  
</p>
<p> (e) An account of the reasons why the deprivation of liberty is deemed arbitrary; 
</p>
<p> (f) A report of all elements presented by the source that aim to inform the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the full status of the reported situation, such as the beginning of a trial; 
</p>
<p>the granting of provisional or definitive release; and changes of incarceration conditions or 
</p>
<p>venue or of any other similar circumstances. An absence of information or an absence of a 
</p>
<p>response by the source may lead the Working Group to terminate its consideration of the 
</p>
<p>case. 
</p>
<p>11. In order to facilitate the Working Group&#8217;s work, it is hoped that communications 
</p>
<p>will be submitted using the model questionnaire available from the Working Group&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>secretariat.  
</p>
<p>12. Communications addressed to the Working Group may be received from the 
</p>
<p>individuals concerned, their families or their representatives. Such communications may 
</p>
<p>also be transmitted by Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations as well as by national institutions for the promotion and the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights. In dealing with communications, the Working Group will give consideration 
</p>
<p>to articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-Holders of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>13. In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>resolution 1993/36, the Working Group may, on its own initiative, take up cases that might 
</p>
<p>constitute arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>14. When the Working Group is not in session, the Chair-Rapporteur, or in her/his 
</p>
<p>absence the First Vice-Chair (see para. 3 (c) and (d)), may decide to bring the case to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Consideration of communications  
</b></p>
<p>15. In the interest of ensuring mutual cooperation, communications shall be brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Government and the reply of the latter shall be brought to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>source of the communication for its further comments. They shall be transmitted by the Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur of the Working Group or, if she or he is not available, by the First Vice-Chair (see 
</p>
<p>para. 3 (c) and (d)). In the case of Governments, the letter shall be transmitted through the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva. In the letter the Working 
</p>
<p>Group shall request the Government to reply within 60 days, during which appropriate 
</p>
<p>inquiries may be carried out by the Government so as to furnish the Working Group with the 
</p>
<p>fullest possible information. In the letter the Working Group shall also inform the 
</p>
<p>Government that the Working Group is authorized to render an opinion determining whether 
</p>
<p>the reported deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not. If a reply is not received from the 
</p>
<p>Government within the time limit, the Working Group may render an opinion on the basis of 
</p>
<p>the information submitted by the source.  
</p>
<p>16. However, if the Government desires an extension of this time limit, it shall inform 
</p>
<p>the Working Group of the reasons for requesting one, so that it may be granted a further 
</p>
<p>period of a maximum of one month in which to reply. Even if no reply has been received 
</p>
<p>upon expiry of the time limit set, the Working Group may render an opinion on the basis of 
</p>
<p>all the information it has obtained. </p>


<p><b> C. Action taken on communications 
</b></p>
<p>17. In the light of the information obtained, the Working Group shall take one of the 
</p>
<p>following measures: 
</p>
<p> (a) If the person has been released, for whatever reason, following the referral of 
</p>
<p>the case to the Working Group, the case is filed through an opinion. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>reserves the right to render an opinion, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not the 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty was arbitrary, notwithstanding the release of the person concerned; 
</p>
<p> (b) If the Working Group considers that the case is not one of arbitrary detention, 
</p>
<p>it shall render an opinion to that effect. The Working Group can also make 
</p>
<p>recommendations in this case if it considers it necessary; 
</p>
<p> (c) If the Working Group considers that further information is required from the 
</p>
<p>Government or from the source, it may keep the case pending until that information is 
</p>
<p>received; 
</p>
<p> (d) If the Working Group considers that the arbitrary nature of the detention is 
</p>
<p>established, it shall render an opinion to that effect and make recommendations to the 
</p>
<p>Government.  
</p>
<p>18. The opinions rendered by the Working Group shall be transmitted to the 
</p>
<p>Government concerned. Two weeks after their transmittal, they shall be communicated to 
</p>
<p>the source. 
</p>
<p>19. The opinions rendered by the Working Group shall be brought to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in its annual report.  
</p>
<p>20. Governments, sources and other parties should inform the Working Group of the 
</p>
<p>follow-up action taken on the recommendations made by the Working Group in its opinion. 
</p>
<p>This will enable the Working Group to keep the Human Rights Council informed of the 
</p>
<p>progress made and of any difficulties encountered in implementing the recommendations, 
</p>
<p>as well as of any failure to take action.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Procedure of review of opinions 
</b></p>
<p>21. In exceptional circumstances, the Working Group may, at the request of the 
</p>
<p>Government concerned or the source, reconsider its opinions under the following 
</p>
<p>conditions: 
</p>
<p> (a) If the facts on which the request is based are considered by the Working 
</p>
<p>Group to be entirely new and such as to have caused the Working Group to alter its 
</p>
<p>decision had it been aware of them; 
</p>
<p> (b) If the facts had not been known or had not been accessible to the party 
</p>
<p>originating the request; 
</p>
<p> (c) In the case where the request comes from a Government, on condition that 
</p>
<p>the latter has observed the time limit for reply referred to in paragraphs 15-16 above. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Urgent action procedure 
</b></p>
<p>22. A procedure known as &#8220;urgent action&#8221; may be resorted to in the following cases: 
</p>
<p> (a) In cases in which there are sufficiently reliable allegations that a person is 
</p>
<p>being arbitrarily deprived of his liberty and that the continuation of such deprivation </p>


<p>constitutes a serious threat to that person&#8217;s health, physical or psychological integrity or 
</p>
<p>even to her or his life; 
</p>
<p> (b) In cases in which, even when no such threat is alleged to exist, there are 
</p>
<p>particular circumstances that warrant an urgent action. 
</p>
<p>23. After having transmitted an urgent appeal to the Government, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>may transmit the case through its regular procedure in order to render an opinion on 
</p>
<p>whether the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary or not. Such appeals &#8212; which are of a 
</p>
<p>purely humanitarian nature &#8212; in no way prejudge any opinion the Working Group may 
</p>
<p>render. The Government is required to respond separately for the urgent action procedure 
</p>
<p>and the regular procedure.  
</p>
<p>24. The Chair-Rapporteur, or in his or her absence the First Vice-Chair (see para. 3 (c) 
</p>
<p>and (d)), shall transmit the appeal by the most rapid means to the Minister for Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs through the Permanent Mission of the country concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>25. For the purposes of completing its task, the Working Group frequently pays visits on 
</p>
<p>official mission. These visits are prepared in collaboration with the Government, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies in the field and civil society representatives. The visits are an opportunity for 
</p>
<p>the Working Group to engage in direct dialogue with the Government in question and with 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society, with the aim of better understanding the situation of deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty in the country and the underlying reasons for arbitrary detention. An important part of 
</p>
<p>these missions are visits to detention centres, including penitentiaries, prisons, police stations, 
</p>
<p>detention centres for migrants and psychiatric hospitals. 
</p>
<p>26. When the Working Group receives an invitation by a Government to conduct a 
</p>
<p>country visit, the Working Group responds by inviting the Permanent Representative of the 
</p>
<p>State to the United Nations Office at Geneva to a meeting to determine the dates and terms 
</p>
<p>of the country visit. The secretariat of the Working Group initiates a dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>parties involved in the visit with a view to taking all practical measures to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>mission. The preparation for the visit is conducted in close cooperation with diplomatic 
</p>
<p>authorities of the host country and United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>27. The Government must assure the Working Group that, during the visit, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group will have the opportunity to conduct meetings with the highest authorities of the 
</p>
<p>branches of the State (political, administrative, legislative and judicial authorities) and that 
</p>
<p>it will be able to visit penitentiaries, prisons, police stations, immigration detention centres, 
</p>
<p>military prisons, detention centres for juveniles and psychiatric hospitals. It will be able to 
</p>
<p>meet with all the authorities and officials who affect the personal liberty of persons 
</p>
<p>subjected to the jurisdiction of the host State. The Working Group shall also conduct 
</p>
<p>meetings with international bodies and agencies as well as non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>lawyers, bar associations and other professional associations of interest, national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions, diplomatic and consular representatives and religious authorities. 
</p>
<p>Absolute confidentiality shall be guaranteed during the interviews between the Working 
</p>
<p>Group and persons deprived of their liberty. The Government shall guarantee there will be 
</p>
<p>no reprisals against persons interviewed by the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group shall conduct at least two visits per year, and its delegation will 
</p>
<p>be composed of at least two of its members.  
</p>
<p>29. At the end of its visit, the Working Group shall submit a preliminary statement to 
</p>
<p>the Government, informing it about its preliminary findings. It shall inform the public of its 
</p>
<p>findings by means of a press conference after debriefing the Government. </p>


<p>30. A report shall be prepared by the Working Group, and once adopted it shall be 
</p>
<p>communicated to the Government of the country visited with a view to gathering its 
</p>
<p>observations on factual and legal errors. The final report shall take into consideration the 
</p>
<p>observations of the Government. It shall be published as an addendum to the annual report. 
</p>
<p>31. During the visit, members of the Working Group shall respect the legislation of the 
</p>
<p>host country.  
</p>
<p>32. Two years after its visit, the Working Group shall request the Government to present 
</p>
<p>a report on the implementation of the recommendations formulated in its mission report. 
</p>
<p>All of the stakeholders involved in the visit shall be informed during this follow-up 
</p>
<p>procedure and shall submit their observations. If necessary, the Working Group shall 
</p>
<p>request a follow-up visit to the country concerned.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. Coordination with other human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>33. In order to strengthen the good coordination which already exists between the 
</p>
<p>various United Nations bodies working in the field of human rights (resolution 1997/50, 
</p>
<p>para. 1 (b)), the Working Group takes action as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) If the Working Group, while examining allegations of violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights, considers that the allegations could be more appropriately dealt with by another 
</p>
<p>working group or special rapporteur, it will refer them to the relevant working group or 
</p>
<p>rapporteur within whose competence they fall, for appropriate action; 
</p>
<p> (b) If the Working Group receives allegations of violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>which fall within its competence as well as within the competence of another thematic 
</p>
<p>mechanism, it may consider taking appropriate action jointly with the working group or 
</p>
<p>special rapporteur concerned; 
</p>
<p> (c) If communications concerning a country for which the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council has appointed a special rapporteur, or another appropriate mechanism with 
</p>
<p>reference to that country, are referred to the Working Group, the latter, in consultation with 
</p>
<p>the rapporteur or the person responsible, shall decide on the action to be taken; 
</p>
<p> (d) If a communication addressed to the Working Group is concerned with a 
</p>
<p>situation that has already been referred to another body, action shall be taken as follows: 
</p>
<p>(i) If the function of the body to which the matter has been referred is to deal 
</p>
<p>with the general development of human rights within its area of competence (e.g. 
</p>
<p>most of the special rapporteurs, representatives of the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>independent experts), the Working Group shall retain competence to deal with the 
</p>
<p>matter; 
</p>
<p>(ii) However, if the body to which the matter has already been referred has the 
</p>
<p>function of dealing with individual cases (Human Rights Committee and other treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies), the Working Group shall transmit the case to that other body if the person 
</p>
<p>and facts involved are the same. 
</p>
<p>34. Furthermore, the Working Group shall not make visits to countries for which the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council has already appointed a country rapporteur, or another appropriate 
</p>
<p>mechanism with reference to that country, unless the special rapporteur or the person 
</p>
<p>responsible considers the visit by the Working Group to be useful. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
