<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Armenia</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Working Group conducted a country mission to Armenia between 6 and 15 
September 2010, at the invitation of the Government. During the visit, the Working Group 
held meetings with various authorities of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of 
the State. It also had the opportunity to meet with detainees, prisoners, representatives of 
the civil society and the United Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group visited 14 detention facilities, including prisons with convicted 
and pretrial detainees; police stations and police detention centres; an immigration 
reception centre; psychiatric hospitals; and facilities for women and juveniles. The facilities 
visited were located in Yerevan, Aboviyan, Artik, Goris, Sevan and Vanadzor. Three 
unannounced visits were also made to police stations in Aparan, Goris and Sevan. The 
Working Group was able to privately interview 153 detainees chosen mostly at random. 
</p>
<p> The report describes the institutional and legislative framework with respect to 
deprivation of liberty and human rights in Armenia, since its independence in 1991. It 
refers to important legislative reforms made in recent years that are conducive to creating 
better standards of human rights for persons who are deprived of their liberty. It also 
provides a brief outline of the criminal justice system to elaborate on the context in which 
deprivation of liberty exists. 
</p>
<p>  
 * The summary of the present report is being circulated in all official languages. The report 
</p>
<p>itself, contained in the annex to the summary, is being circulated in the language of 
submission only.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>2 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that, since independence, Armenia has undergone many 
legislative reforms and made positive initiatives to assist in safeguarding against the 
occurrences of deprivation of liberty. The Working Group would like to see greater 
commitment in implementing these laws along with systemic changes to improve the 
practices of the police, prosecution and the judiciary in ensuring that prescribed human 
rights standards are adhered to when a person is deprived of her or his liberty. In this 
respect, the Working Group notes the need to change the practice of &#8220;inviting persons&#8221; as 
witnesses to be subsequently interrogated and arrested by the police as suspects. 
</p>
<p> The independence of the judiciary and of magistrates and judges is a fundamental 
component in establishing a context in which human rights of detainees and prisoners are 
respected. Institutional developments and changes are imperative to guard against illegal 
deprivation of liberty. In that regard, the existence of national mechanisms such as the 
Human Rights Defender&#8217;s Office and the Committee on Human Rights and Public Affairs 
of the National Assembly are critical and the Working Group fully supports these 
initiatives. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings and to safeguard against occurrences of arbitrary 
detention, the Working Group makes a number of recommendations to the Government. 
These recommendations focus on ensuring the protection, inter alia, of the right to due 
process; the independence of judges and magistrates; changes to the law and practice on 
remand and sentencing; and the elimination of the use of torture and ill-treatment of people 
who are deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also notes in its report that the law and practice on remand, in 
relation to sentencing, have resulted in lengthy detentions that are disproportionate to the 
crimes of which a person is convicted. The need to take into consideration the granting of 
early provisional release and the criteria for granting bail or remanding suspects in 
detention, require tightening up with concomitant changes in practice. Violence during 
arrest and interrogation also requires particular attention. Criminal procedure reform should 
aim at regulating the practice of inviting persons as witnesses to police interviews to 
subsequently consider them as suspects, because of the possibility of non-respect of the 
maximum term for police detention and potential violations of their rights. There is a need 
to train police and National Security Service staff to improve this practice. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also recommends better protection for asylum-seekers, refugees 
and migrants in an irregular situation. The rights of asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants 
must be better protected, in particular by allowing the detention to be challenged before a 
judicial authority and review procedures before individuals are turned away at the border 
and returned abroad.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42, whose mandate was assumed by the 
Human Rights Council by its decision 1/102 and extended by resolution 15/18, visited 
Armenia from 6 to 15 September 2010 at the invitation of the State party&#8217;s Government. 
The Working Group&#8217;s delegation was composed of El Hadji Malick Sow, Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Working Group; fellow member Mads Andenas; the Working Group&#8217;s 
Secretary and another staff member from the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, the Working Group was grateful for the ongoing cooperation from 
the Government and the authorities with which it dealt and would like to thank them for 
their collaboration. The Working Group was able to arrange meetings with all the persons 
that it requested.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group visited detention facilities within the capital Yerevan and in 
other cities, including Abovyan, Aparan, Artik, Goris, Sevan and Vanadzor. These 
detention facilities included: the police holding cells in the districts of Yerevan and Sevan; 
prisons such as Aparan; Goris; Nubarashen and Vardashen; the Erebuni Detention Facility; 
the National Military Detention Centre in Yerevan; the Abovyan prisons for juveniles and 
women; the Yerevan Reception Centre for Migrants at Moldovokm Street and two 
psychiatric facilities, Sevan Psychiatric facilities and Vanadzor Psychiatric facilities. The 
Working Group also paid two unannounced visits to police stations at Aparan and Goris 
and one to Sevan Prison. Interviews were carried out privately with detainees and prisoners 
in all of these facilities. The Working Group also tried to conduct, without success, an 
unannounced visit to the detention room for arrivals in an irregular situation at Zvartnots 
Airport in Yerevan.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group held meetings with senior Government authorities, including: 
the Chair of the Constitutional Court; the President of the Criminal Chamber of the Court of 
Cassation; the Chair of the Standing Committee on the Protection of Human Rights and 
Public Affairs of the National Assembly; the Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs; Justice 
and Defence; the Deputy Prosecutor General; the First Deputy Minister of Health; and the 
Chief of Staff of the Police.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group also held meetings with the Human Rights Defender 
(Ombudsman); the Chair and the members of the Board of the Armenian Bar Association; 
the Public Monitoring Group of Police Detention Facilities; the Prison Monitoring Group 
under the Ministry of Justice; magistrates of the Courts of Appeal; first instance judges; and 
former detainees linked to the post-electoral incidents of 1 March 2008 (see paragraph 52). 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group also met with various representatives of civil society and 
members of the opposition parties; representatives of United Nations agencies and 
intergovernmental organizations operating in the country. The Working Group expresses its 
appreciation for their cooperation during its visit. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group expresses its thanks to the Government of Armenia for having 
extended an invitation to visit the country and cooperating before, during and after the visit.  
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group would also like to particularly acknowledge the arduous and 
extensive work carried out by the Armenian Bar Association which is engaged in the 
challenging task of highlighting and resolving the critical issues raised in this report. The 
information that they provided on the legal context of Armenia with regard to deprivation 
of liberty was very valuable.  </p>

</p>
<p>9. The Working Group would like to particularly thank the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator, the United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s Resident Representative and 
her staff for the excellent support providing in organizing and carrying out the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political system 
</b></p>
<p>10. Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 21 September 1991. It 
is a democratic and constitutional republic with a unicameral legislature, the National 
Assembly. The President of the Republic is the head of State and oversees the functioning 
of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of Government. The Prime Minister and 
the ministers hold the executive power in Government.  
</p>
<p>11. The President is elected by the citizens of Armenia for a term of five years. Article 
49 of the Constitution states that the President is to uphold the Constitution and ensure the 
normal functioning of the legislative, executive and judicial authorities.    
</p>
<p>12. The legislative power in Armenia is vested in its National Assembly, which consists 
of 131 members and is elected for a five-year term. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>13. Armenia became a member of the United Nations in 1992 and has acceded to more 
than 50 human rights international treaties and protocols, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol, and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (see appendix II).  
</p>
<p>14. On a regional level, Armenia has acceded to the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 2002 and recognizes the powers 
of the European Court of Human Rights. Since 2009, an estimated 20 judgments have been 
delivered by the Court. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>15. The judiciary of Armenia is responsible for the administration of justice in 
accordance with the Constitution and the laws. The court system is organized into: the 
Administrative Court; basic trial courts; civil and criminal appellate courts; the Court of 
Cassation and the Constitutional Court. The Court of Cassation is the highest judicial body 
presiding over non-constitutional matters and one of its functions is to ensure the uniform 
application of law, its correct interpretation and support in the development of legislation.  
</p>
<p>16. Citizens have the right to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court, which rules on 
the constitutionality of legislation, signed international agreements and electoral issues. It is 
composed of nine members. The Constitutional Court can receive applications from 
citizens who have had their cases decided by all other courts and who still want to 
challenge the constitutionality of decisions made against them. In 2009, the Constitutional 
Court received appeals lodged by 295 persons. 
</p>
<p>17. The Constitution defines the procedure and formation and activities of the Council 
of Justice. It also defines the procedure, activities and formation of the Council of Justice. 
The Council of Justice consists of nine judges elected by secret ballot for a period of five </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>6 
</p>
<p>years by the General Assembly of Judges in Armenia, two legal scholars appointed by the 
President of the Republic and two legal scholars appointed by the National Assembly. The 
Chairman of the Court of Cassation chairs the Council of Justice. The Council of Justice 
oversees matters relating to the independence of judges and can impose disciplinary 
sanction on judges. It also makes recommendations on candidates for judgeships, who are 
then appointed by the President.  
</p>
<p>18. The Court of Cassation has discretionary review authority as the highest judicial 
body over non-constitutional matters. The 2007 Judicial Code assigned new roles to the 
Court of Cassation to the effect that it will provide the uniform application of law and its 
correct interpretation. The authority of the Court of Cassation is defined by the Constitution 
and laws. 
</p>
<p>19. There are approximately 216 judges in Armenia for a population of around  
3.2 million. Fifteen judges are former prosecutors. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The Prosecutor General 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Office of the Prosecutor General is a unified and centralized system headed by 
the Prosecutor General, whose office operates in accordance with the powers granted by the 
Constitution. Among other responsibilities, the Prosecutor General has to operate within the 
powers granted by the Constitution and prescribed laws to instigate criminal charges, 
prosecute, oversee preliminary enquiries and defend the interests of the State in court.  
</p>
<p><b> E. The National Police and the National Security Service 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Law on the Police was passed by the Armenian National Assembly on 16 April 
2001 and the Law on Police Service was passed on 30 June 2002, providing for the 
Ministry of Interior to be restructured and the Penitentiary Division of the Police to be 
transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. The National Police performs its 
functions according to legislation such as the Criminal Procedure Code of Armenia 1998, 
the Criminal Code 2003 and the Law on Treatment of Arrestees and Detainees. The 
National Security Service is responsible for intelligence activities, national security and 
border control. The National Police carries out around 80 per cent of the criminal 
investigations.  
</p>
<p><b> F. The penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>22. The penitentiary system, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, was 
previously administered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Penitentiary Service 
comprises 13 penitentiary institutions. A critical development and reform in the 
penitentiary system was the creation of public supervision bodies consisting of members of 
civil society who have the right to free access to penitentiary institutions to familiarize 
themselves with the conditions therein and to meet with detainees in private. The Prison 
Monitoring Group under the Ministry of Justice and the Public Monitoring Group under the 
Police Department are the two mechanisms which have been given these supervisory roles. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Human Rights Defender (Ombudsman) 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Human Rights Defender&#8217;s Office in Armenia was established in 2004 and has 
significant influence on the human rights situation in the country, particularly in dealing 
with increasing complaints and applications in recent years. The Human Rights Defender </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>aims to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms from violation by the State and 
local self-governance bodies and by their officials. The Human Rights Defender is also 
mandated to create State guarantees and mechanisms for the enforcement and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, including contributing to and facilitating the 
improvement of legislation related to human rights and fundamental freedoms. It also aims 
to bring Armenian legislation into line with the norms and standards of international law.  
</p>
<p>24. The Human Rights Defender is elected by the National Assembly pursuant to article 
83.1 of the Constitution and to the Law on Human Rights Defender 2003. The Defender is 
recognized as an independent and autonomous public official who implements the rules and 
procedures for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms which are being or 
have been violated by State and local governmental and their officials, elected or otherwise. 
Immunity is enjoyed by the Defender during his or her entire term in office and is also 
extended to all documents and communications in her/his possession. 
</p>
<p>25. The Human Rights Defender has free access to any State institution or organization, 
including military units, prisons, preliminary detention facilities and penitentiaries.  
</p>
<p>26. In 2009, an estimated 5,200 complaints were lodged with the Human Rights 
Defender&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p><b> H. The National Assembly Committee on Human Rights and Public 
Affairs 
</b></p>
<p>27. The spheres of activities of this Committee include human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, children&#8217;s rights, gender issues and national minorities. The Committee has a 
supervisory function and receives a number of complaints from the general public. Since 
2007, it has received approximately one hundred complaints. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Constitutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Constitution of the Republic guarantees everyone the right to liberty and 
security, and provides that such rights may be restricted only in the case of lawful detention 
determined by a court sentence on the basis of non-compliance with a law or legal act. The 
Constitution also states that international treaties shall constitute part of the legal system. 
Furthermore, in cases where ratified international treaties define norms other than those 
provided for by laws, the norms of treaties shall prevail. 
</p>
<p>29. The Constitution further states that fundamental human rights and freedoms are an 
ultimate value and that the State should ensure that the protection of fundamental human 
and civic rights and freedoms are in conformity with the principles and rules of 
international law. 
</p>
<p>30. Article 16 expressly provides for the rights to liberty and security; the deprivation of 
these can only be done in accordance with prescribed law and, if an arrested person is not 
detained within 72 hours by a court decision, s/he must be released immediately. Police 
investigators and prosecutors should obtain a warrant from a judge to detain an arrested 
suspect in excess of 72 hours, but those requests are rarely denied. The right to 
compensation for damages is also available to a person who has been wrongly deprived of 
her/his liberty. 
</p>
<p>31. The Constitution expressly states that it shall guarantee the independence of the 
judiciary. It also expressly prohibits torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
and stipulates that an arrested, detained or incarcerated person is entitled to human 
treatment and respect of dignity. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>8 
</p>
<p><b> J. Criminal justice legislation 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Armenian Code of Criminal Procedure details the grounds and the procedure for 
pretrial detention and other measures of restraint to secure the defendant&#8217;s appearance at 
trial. Among the measures of restraint for which the Code of Criminal Procedure provides 
are detention, bail, written obligation not to leave, personal guarantee, an organization&#8217;s 
guarantee and supervision by the commander of the military unit (for military personnel). 
</p>
<p>33. A significant reform is the Law on Treatment of Arrestees and Detainees adopted in 
</p><p>2002. It defines, inter alia, the general principles of legality, equality of arrestees or 
detainees before the law and respect for human rights in compliance with the Constitution, 
the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural Code and well-known principles and norms 
of international law. This law also defines the guarantees for ensuring arrestees&#8217; and 
detainees&#8217; rights, their duties and the procedure for releasing these persons from arrest and 
detention.  
</p>
<p>34. The Law on Arrestees and Detainees provides the specific grounds for keeping a 
person in a place of arrest, which act must be based on an arrest warrant and a court 
decision choosing detention as a means of preventive measure. The court decision must be 
passed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code. It is forbidden to admit and keep a 
person in places of arrest and detention in other cases. 
</p>
<p>35. In accordance with the law, pretrial detention may be applied by court decision if the 
alleged crime is punishable by at least one year of imprisonment, or when sufficient 
grounds exist to suspect that the accused intends to abscond or interfere with the judicial 
proceedings &#8211; in particular by exerting unlawful influence on other persons involved in the 
case &#8211; to tamper with evidence or to commit another criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>36. The Law on Arrestees and Detainees specifically states that it is forbidden to use 
physical violence or inhuman or degrading actions against arrestees or detainees.  
</p>
<p><b> K. Legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>37. The right entitling citizens to effective legal remedies to protect her/his human rights 
is also protected by article 18 of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>38. Armenia has an active public defender system that provides legal assistance to 
citizens. Legal assistance is guaranteed in article 10 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 
Armenia and article 13, paragraph 6, of the Law on Arrestees and Detainees.  
</p>
<p>39. An estimated one third of criminal cases are handled by 56 public defenders and an 
amendment in the law means new staff will be added to this number. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Observations made by the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive aspects 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Working Group would like to acknowledge the positive efforts made by the 
Government in carrying out significant reforms to legislation, particularly the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, which has been amended in order to bring Armenian penal legislation 
into conformity with international standards for fair trial and due process of law. More than 
200 amendments have been approved by the National Assembly during recent years and 
new amendments are currently under consideration. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group also highlights the effort made to improve the physical 
conditions in the prisons and detention centres it visited and, particularly, the good rapport 
between prisoners and detainees and penitentiary guards. During the private interviews that 
it held, the Working Group did not receive any allegations of torture, ill-treatment or abuse 
of power by prison guards. Of the country&#8217;s 40 police detention centres, 33 have been 
refurbished. Another commendable and progressive reform made by the Legislative is that 
of the Penitentiary Code 2004 relating to prison visits. Convicts sentenced to life 
imprisonment were permitted to receive visits by their relatives more often (at least three 
short-term and one long-term visit per year). Prisoners in general have the right to receive 
at least four short-term visits a year. Although the number of visit seems not to be 
sufficient, this has provided necessary contact between prisoners and their families, which 
is particularly crucial for enhancing continuity of family relationships.  
</p>
<p>42. In addition, the Working Group was pleased to learn that detention centres and 
prisons are visited and monitored, on a permanent basis, by the Public Monitoring Group of 
Police Detention Facilities and the Prison Monitoring Group under the Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group welcomes the work carried out by the Constitutional Court and 
the possibility that any citizen may have direct access to the Court. Between January and 
September 2010, the Constitutional Court received 354 constitutional recourses and 
complaints.  
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group also commends the work being carried out by the Human 
Rights Defender, who received and processed 5,200 complaints during 2009. The Working 
Group has taken note of the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of 
Cassation which gives effect to due process requirements based on international human 
rights law and national constitutional law and principles. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges to the administration of justice in relation to deprivation of 
liberty 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The independence of the judiciary, and the right to fair trial and due process 
</b></p>
<p>45. Throughout its visit, the Working Group received information concerning recurrent 
violations of the right to a fair trial and due process of detainees and prisoners. The 
independence of judges and magistrates was also criticized by convicted prisoners who 
reported to the Working Group that evidence submitted on their behalf was not admitted or 
processed and judges had not called defence witnesses to provide information that would 
help their case. Additionally, defence lawyers had difficulties in accessing their trial files. 
This was exacerbated by a practice where prosecutors did not disclose materials to the court 
and were not compelled to do so by the presiding judge. 
</p>
<p>46. The vast majority of cases that were sent to trial resulted in convictions. The 
Working Group is concerned that the lack of internal independence of judges has and will 
adversely affect the right to liberty of citizens as prescribed by the Constitution and existing 
laws. It notes that it is not primarily lack of independence following from interference from 
other branches of the State, but an absence of the necessary independence in the actions of 
magistrates and judges that is problematic. Judges have the heavy responsibility of 
administrating justice and, in reaching that noble objective, they must demonstrate that they 
are independent and impartial in ensuring the right to fair trial and due process of law and 
that the rights of the accused are respected. 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group received information relating to the form of court judgments 
whereby most sentences and judicial decisions lacked proper reasoning and legal basis. 
Some jurists interviewed were of the view that numerous sentences and other judicial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>10 
</p>
<p>decisions follow too closely the requests by the prosecutors. The issue highlighted in these 
discussions was that judges too often did not take into account the arguments made by the 
defence and gave more favourable consideration to the prosecution&#8217;s submissions. The 
Working Group is concerned to hear that a judge had been disciplined because he had 
issued a decision in favour of the defence. In a series of judgments, the Supreme Cassation 
Court has laid down requirements as to the grounds to be given for judgments and ruled 
that this field of law should develop in order to satisfy international human rights standards 
and due process requirements.  
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group notes that the fight against corruption currently carried out by 
the Government also has implications on the independence of the judiciary. Judges seem to 
be limiting themselves in the application of justice, ordering harder penalties in fear of 
being perceived as not sufficiently firm in combating corruption or complicit in corruption.  
</p>
<p>49. The principle of equality of arms between accusation and defence is one of the basic 
prerequisites of a fair trial. The Working Group received information that magistrates and 
judges were favouring and granting requests to the prosecutor and rarely giving regard to 
those coming from the defence. A number of convicted prisoners were also of the view that 
the judge had not acted as an independent and impartial authority but as a legal official at 
the same level, or even at an inferior level, to that of the prosecutor. The Working Group 
considers it important to point out that, if the principle of equality of arms between 
prosecution and defence is not fully observed and guaranteed by the judge, justice can not 
been rendered.   
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group received allegations that prosecutors are more defenders of the 
State than defenders of society and the law, adhering to a principle of presumption of guilt, 
instead of a presumption of innocence. The courts are perceived more as a body rubber-
stamping the decisions of the prosecutor than a defender of citizens&#8217; rights or due process 
guarantees. Prosecutors very much overshadow defence lawyers during trials: this has 
serious implications for the legal profession.  
</p>
<p>51. Many detainees interviewed stated that they have no need for the services of a 
defence lawyer because such services are, at the end of the day, of little use. These 
detainees maintain that it is more important to have good relations with the investigators 
and prosecutors. Many detainees in remand did recognize the importance or the benefits of 
having a defence lawyer and seemed to have even less confidence in public defenders. 
Although the Government has made serious efforts to guarantee legal counsel at public 
expense to defendants who otherwise cannot afford counsel, many detainees stated that they 
perceived public defenders as the colleagues and friends of prosecutors who they may even 
be colluding with them. This was one reason given by many defendants for preferring to 
argue their own case in court. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group would also like to reiterate the significance of the remedy of 
habeas corpus in protecting citizens against violations relating to deprivation of liberty. The 
Working Group has consistently emphasized that habeas corpus in itself is a human right 
and necessary in order for persons to take proceedings before a court, so that the court may 
decide without undue delay upon the lawfulness of that person&#8217;s detention and order the 
release where detention is not lawful. Moreover, State parties to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights should note that article 2 thereof obligates State parties to 
ensure that an effective remedy is provided to any person deprived of their liberty and 
whose rights have been violated. 
</p>
<p>53. The Working Group notes that, in some cases, the State sent certain individuals to 
other countries without observing normal extradition procedures. An existing agreement 
between the National Police of Armenia and the Police of the Russian Federation allowed 
for this practice. This agreement is understood to be based on a regional agreement </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>involving the Community of Independent States. Decisions on sanction and/or refusal to 
extradite are made by the Prosecutor General where the case is in the pretrial proceedings. 
Four persons were extradited in 2010 owing to decisions made by the Prosecutor General.  
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group is also concerned that the selection of judges should not be 
done at the discretion of the President but rather that the President should only endorse the 
candidates put forward for judgeship: such an amendment to the law would be to ensure 
genuine safeguard of the independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Arrest and detention of persons linked to the 1 March 2008 incidents 
</b></p>
<p>55. One of the critical events in recent Armenian history was the presidential election of 
19 February 2008 and its aftermath, when clashes occurred between law enforcement 
agents and political opposition activists who held public demonstrations against the election 
results. Mass arrests and detentions occurred and 10 individuals were killed and 200 
injured. Investigations were then carried out that targeted the organizers of the 
demonstrations. More than 5,000 persons were arrested for several hours and 110 
opposition activists were charged and tried under charges such as &#8220;mass disorders&#8221;, 
&#8220;possession of weapons&#8221;, &#8220;resisting arrest&#8221; or &#8220;usurpation of State authority&#8221;. The 
Government later issued amnesty to many of those who were imprisoned in relation to 1 
March incidents. The Working Group reviewed the situation of 13 persons detained in 
relation to the 1 March 2008 demonstration and was able to hold private interviews with 
five of them in various prisons. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group received information that decisions relating to detentions and 
arrests of political opposition members had been inappropriately documented and were 
often not in conformity with international standards or with national legislation. Rather than 
being the exception, pretrial detention was put into practice widely without proper legal 
grounds.  
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group also received information that the relatives of detainees linked 
to the 1 March events had been detained to apply pressure on members of the political 
opposition. Information has been documented regarding serious due process violations, 
including detention incommunicado and lack of access to a lawyer of choice. Youths have 
also been detained for handing out pamphlets in support of the opposition parties. The 
Working Group also received information that 200 of the wounded were representatives of 
the police who were injured trying to prevent the demonstration. 
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group would like to reiterate the fundamental importance of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly and association, 
and the important role that the Government has in ensuring that these rights are protected in 
conformity with the Constitution, prescribed national laws and international laws and 
standards on human rights. It would also like to see an improvement in the situation of 
those who wish to exercise these rights, particularly during significant milestones such as 
governmental elections.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Police custody, investigation and the &#8220;practice of inviting persons&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>59. The practice of &#8220;inviting persons&#8221; to present themselves to police stations as 
witnesses was consistently criticized and pointed out to the Working Group during its visit. 
Police arrest individuals and hold them for up to 72 hours on the argument that they are 
material witnesses and, therefore, not suspects. A lot of the criticism was levelled at the 
recurrence of this practice and the treatment of suspects and invitees when in police 
custody. This practice is aggravated by the fact that suspects are invited to police stations 
under the pretext that they are material witnesses, only for them to have their status altered 
(from witness to suspect) during their time in custody, without any prompt court ruling or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>12 
</p>
<p>legal counsel present. Sometimes, police officers hold persons beyond the statutory 72 
hours and later change their status from witnesses to suspects, without the invitee having 
had access to a lawyer or informed of his rights as required by law. 
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group notes that excessive powers attributed to the police, the 
National Security Services and border guards facilitate the arrest and detention of many 
individuals without an arrest warrant issued by a judicial authority. Arrests are often not a 
consequence of a preceding police investigation, rather people are detained in order to be 
investigated. This affects not only the rights to personal freedom, free trial and presumption 
of innocence, but also the right to the security of person.  
</p>
<p>61. Many detainees and prisoners who were interviewed by the Working Group reported 
having been subjected to ill-treatment and beatings at police stations. Further, police and 
National Security investigators use pressure, including ill-treatment, to obtain confessions, 
as a central part of their investigations. Many detainees further reported that prosecutors 
and judges refused to admit evidence of ill-treatment to court proceedings. Many cases of 
beatings during arrest and interrogation while in detention were not reported because of fear 
of retribution. In other cases, individuals were beaten and then detained by police until they 
recovered, before being admitted to the penitentiary system, so that no medical examination 
would be carried out. Interviews and meetings with NGOs and legal professionals provide 
further support for these assessments.  
</p>
<p>62. During its visit, the Working Group received information that two persons died in 
detention while in police custody. According to the information received, they committed 
suicide. However, the Working Group considers that investigations by external, 
independent bodies are necessary, and inquests should be conducted into each case as soon 
the death takes places. 
</p>
<p>63. With regard to prison conditions, the Working Group supports the recommendation 
by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe that Armenia improve 
public monitoring of penitentiary institutions, with particular emphasis on ensuring that the 
group of public observers includes independent and impartial representatives from civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group notes that the Prison Monitoring Group for police detention 
facilities is a critical mechanism for those who are detained by police. However, their 
mandate allows them only to visit holding cells, which hinders their investigative functions. 
The Working Group would like to see an expansion of this important group&#8217;s mandate in 
order to ensure the rights of detainees and prisoners are respected. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Deprivation of liberty within the military 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group was able to visit the military detention facility in Yerevan and 
interview detainees in private.  
</p>
<p>66. Arrest and detention within the military service is regulated by the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, although the military has its own military police, which undertakes 
investigations. The Working Group notes the positive initiative taken to reform disciplinary 
measures and the new draft code in place. Nevertheless, the Working Group received many 
reports relating to the difficulty that civil society and international organizations face in 
accessing information about those who are held in military detention. These concerns relate 
mainly to the treatment of military personnel in detention and in the military itself.  
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group notes with concern information on brutality against military 
personnel by commanders and the deaths that have been reported to have occurred within 
the military, without proper investigations carried out. There is also concern that abuse and 
ill-treatment of military personnel is used obtain information from victims who are being </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>investigated. Investigations carried out by investigators on crimes committed in the Army 
are under the control of Military&#8217;s Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which is part of the Prosecutor 
General&#8217;s Office, rather than the Ministry of Defence. The Working Group reiterates the 
constitutional guarantee for all citizens of Armenia, civilian and military alike, to be free 
from torture, ill-treatment and inhuman treatment.  
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group also received information regarding the arrest and 
imprisonment of 80 conscientious objectors of the Jehovah Witness faith. In recent years, 
young men of this faith have been imprisoned due to their refusal to enlist in the military 
and participate in the alternative civil service offered to enlistment. The Working Group 
was told that the alternative civil service, established by a 2003 Act, is not functioning in 
practice. The Ministry of Defence in Armenia has expressed its readiness to discuss the 
possibility of reducing the length of alternative service to an acceptable limit. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Prolonged duration of pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Working Group notes that a serious problem relating to pretrial detention exists 
in Armenia. Arrest and detention are used to prevent a suspect from fleeing, destroying 
evidence or preventing him or her from committing a future offence. The Working Group 
observed that people are held in police stations for longer than the three hours established 
by the law.  
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group further notes that the norm which establishes that suspects may 
be held up to 72 hours without charge in pretrial police detention facilities is generally 
respected and followed in practice. After 72 hours of detention, a great majority of people 
are either indicted or released. The law stipulates that pretrial detention cannot be extended 
beyond 12 months. This norm is usually respected in practice. The problem occurs when a 
trial begins, as there is no established time limit for its conclusion. Prosecutors regularly 
request and receive from judges trial postponements, on the grounds that they require more 
time to prepare for trial. Postponements are used as an excuse to prolong investigations. On 
the other hand, prosecutors claim that the responsibility for the postponement of trials 
belong to the defence lawyers, because they usually argue that they need more time to 
prepare their defence. 
</p>
<p>71. The consequence of a trial being delayed often means that a person can be detained 
without trial for an indefinite period, and many of those interviewed by the Working Group 
fell into this category. During the Working Group&#8217;s visit, the average prison population 
comprised 3,728 inmates, of whom 422 were pretrial detainees and 305 detainees whose 
trials were in progress. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Lack of use of alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group observed a significant trend towards the use of detention as 
both a means to hold people in remand and court sentencing. Detention was habitually 
extended for the maximum possible period and alternatives to detention were rarely used. 
Additional problems also involve defence motions for bail, and other alternatives, being 
rejected or ignored.  
</p>
<p>73. Although the law provides for a bail system, bail is not sufficiently applied in 
practice. The case-law of the Court of Cassation establishes that bail can be granted even 
for serious crimes and particularly serious crimes. However, lower courts do not apply that 
case-law. Prisoners are thus required to serve the totality of their sentences, even when the 
law provides for the possibility of conditional release. This has consequences not solely for 
the overcrowding of prisons, but also the penitentiary regime, given that prisoners are 
deprived of both a key element of motivation to observe good behaviour while in prison 
and the possibility to advance the process of reintegration into society.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>14 
</p>
<p>74. In practice, judges appeared to decide whether the arrested person should remain in 
detention without reviewing what grounds existed for the arrest in the first place, essentially 
operating on the assumption of legality of police actions. If a judge does not inquire into the 
existence of reasonable grounds for arrest, judicial review falls short of international fair-
trial safeguards. Limiting the scope of judicial enquiry to a mechanical application of 
custodial or non-custodial measures pending trial undermines the very raison d&#8217;&#234;tre of 
judicial involvement in this stage of the proceedings: to maintain an effective safeguard of 
the right to liberty. It also leaves unaddressed fundamental concerns that influence the 
outcome of prosecutions. This was evidenced by the handling by courts of defence motions 
during the trials &#8211; such as motions aimed at excluding some of the evidence related to 
allegedly illegal or arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>75. Judicial review of arrest and authorization of detention did not fully satisfy the 
relevant international standards and national legal requirements. Court decisions for 
detention were not always reasoned properly and did not address the facts in the individual 
cases, but rather contained standard general phrases. Access by the defence to information 
regarding detention orders was also prohibited. The Working Group notes that the ratio in 
prisons between people in pretrial detention and those convicted seems proportional and 
adequate, with approximately one quarter of detainees on remand. 
</p>
<p>76. Detention should be regarded as the most severe measure of restraint and used as a 
measure of last resort only if less restrictive measures cannot ensure the proper conduct of 
the defendant and due administration of justice. The Human Rights Committee has stated 
that pretrial detention must not only be lawful, but also necessary and reasonable in the 
circumstances. It has recognized that the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits the 
authorities to hold people in detention as an exceptional measure if it is necessary to ensure 
appearance for trial, but it has given a narrow interpretation of the &#8220;necessity&#8221; requirement. 
It has noted that suspicion that a person has committed a crime is not sufficient to justify 
detention pending investigation and indictment. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Early provisional release 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Working Group notes that, in Armenia, early provisional release is a 
problematic issue and the failure to apply such release has negative consequences, 
including the overcrowding in prisons and the non-release of prisoners in situations of good 
behaviour and justified reintegration to society. This issue was raised repeatedly throughout 
the visit, as there does not seem to be any clarity or transparency relating to decisions made 
by the committees determining this matter. Exact standards and criteria are unclear as to 
how membership may be selected and the lack of an appeal mechanism makes justified 
parole unlikely. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Proportionality of sentencing 
</b></p>
<p>78. The issue of proportionality of court sentences is a matter of concern to the Working 
Group. A number of prisoners interviewed revealed that they were serving severely long 
and harsh sentences for crimes such as corruption, bribery and organized crime. A number 
of women interviewed at Abovyan prison reported that they were serving sentences of 
between 10 and 13 years for crimes such as trafficking, theft, swindling and embezzlement, 
all of which carry maximum sentences. Their sentencing seemed to exceed even the 
statutory provisions for these crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Working Group was able to visit and interview juvenile prisoners in Abovyan 
prison. It notes with concern the absence of an effective system of juvenile justice in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>Armenia, particularly the absence of specific laws, procedures and juvenile courts. Legal 
proceedings for juveniles are regulated by chapter 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>80. While Armenian legislation provides several essential standards regarding juvenile 
justice, issues relating to prevention, alternative punishment and rehabilitation for minor 
offenders remained unsolved. Cases were reported of physical abuse of juveniles when they 
enter the criminal justice system. There were no special standards of interrogation of 
juveniles who were suspects, accused, witnesses and victims, nor were there special court 
procedures for juveniles. There were no well-established alternatives to deprivation of 
liberty of juveniles. Other issues of serious concern relate the excessive use of pretrial 
detention for juveniles, the length of pretrial detention, the termination of secondary 
education in pretrial detention and the absence of rehabilitation and reintegration 
programmes for juveniles after their release. 
</p>
<p>81. The Working Group, in light of the mentioned problems, noted a serious need for 
psychiatric and psychological assistance to those in the juvenile prison as quite a number of 
them showed apparent signs of attempted suicide. According to the Government, two cases 
of suicide attempts have been investigated between 2008 and 2010. 
</p>
<p>82. Recent legislative changes allow convicted teenagers to serve their complete 
sentence in Abovyan rather than be transferred to a prison intended for adults. Recent 
positive reform of the Criminal Code &#8211; through the introduction of fines and probation and 
community service &#8211; has helped to reduce the number of detainees.  
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group understands that, despite the lack of a specialized system for 
juveniles, the number of juvenile prisoners and detainees is low in comparison with other 
countries in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental health 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Working Group was able to visit two psychiatric facilities outside Yerevan, the 
Sevan Psychiatric Hospital and the Vanadzor Psychiatric Facility, and was able to meet and 
speak with resident patients. The 2004 Law on the Psychiatric Service governs the 
internment of patients in these institutions, by decision of medical commissions composed 
by three medical doctors. Decisions by medical commissions can not be challenged before 
a judicial authority but are subjected to review by the same body every six months. 
</p>
<p>85. The Working Group noted the good relationships between the administration and 
psychiatric patients. It understands that the challenges faced by these two institutions relate 
more to access of resources for the care of patients and maintenance of the facilities, than to 
problems relating to deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p><b> 11. Migrants in irregular situation, refugees and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>86. Armenia has ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in 1993 
and is also a party to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and to 
the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The Law on Refugees and Asylum 
in Armenia largely conforms to international standards regarding the arbitrary detention of 
asylum-seekers and refugees as reflected in the 1951 Convention. The legal asylum 
framework is regulated by the Constitution, legislation adopted by the National Assembly 
and executive decisions. The Constitution refers to political asylum and provides protection 
against refoulement. The State Migration Service is the main body responsible for the 
asylum system and migration issues in Armenia.   
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group observes that the Government is granting asylum and refugee 
status in accordance with the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The Government is 
also providing temporary protection to individuals who may not qualify as refugees.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>16 
</p>
<p>88. The Working Group notes the positive move by the Government to establish the 
Yerevan Reception Centre and visited this facility in which asylum-seekers and people 
demanding a refugee status are kept in adequate conditions, being free to go outside during 
the day hours. They are kept there during the entire duration of their legal procedures. 
</p>
<p>89. However, a related issue is legislative inconsistency in the matter: the Law on 
Refugees exempts from criminal prosecution asylum-seekers who enter Armenia illegally, 
while the Law on State Borders considers all persons illegally crossing the border as 
transgressors. Border guards consider themselves bound by the Law on State Borders and, 
in practice, illegally entering asylum-seekers are detained by border officials and turned 
over to National Security Services for criminal investigation.  
</p>
<p>90. Illegal entry into the country is considered a penal offence, in breach of international 
law. Persons illegally crossing the State party&#8217;s borders are usually condemned to 18 
months&#8217; imprisonment. However, arrivals in an irregular situation, such as people entering 
the Armenian territory without the necessary entry visa, or those who overstay beyond the 
date of its expiry, are usually subjected to a fine and deported from the country, with 
prohibition to return to the country during a determined period. The Working Group has 
noted concerns about the opportunity to claim asylum when refugees are turned away at the 
border. There are further concerns about the treatment of border-crossing as a criminal 
offence in this context.   
</p>
<p>91. The Working Group is aware that migrants in an irregular situation who have 
entered Armenia through Zvartnots Airport are held in a special room and can be detained 
there for periods longer than 72 hours, which is the prescribed maximum time under the 
Law on Refugees and Asylum. The Working Group attempted twice &#8211; without success &#8211; to 
have access to this room but regrets that it was not so authorized by the relevant officials. 
No information was then obtained as to the procedures on treating those that are kept in this 
dwelling. The Working Group is concerned that a lack of identification and referral 
mechanisms for persons held in such a dwelling may result in prolonged &#8220;detention-like&#8221; 
situation for persons kept in this place. 
</p>
<p>92. The Working Group would like to ensure that clear procedures are also in place in 
dealing with persons who fear being extradited to their country of origin due to fear of 
torture, ill-treatment or death and who clearly have an intention of seeking asylum. The 
involvement of the Government of Armenia in the South Caucasus border management 
project to improve border security and the state border management is a positive step. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Problems of deprivation of liberty in Armenia are linked to the lack of 
independence of its magistrates and judges and the lack of impartiality of its 
prosecutors. Many judges fear that they would face retribution should they return an 
acquittal on sensitive cases. No judge has ever been prosecuted for having illegally 
deprived a person of her or his liberty. However, there are judges who have been 
prosecuted for having ordered a person&#8217;s release. Judges are clearly perceived as 
being under the influence of prosecutors.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group notes significant developments in institutional and 
legislative reforms since Armenia gained its independence in 1991. It reiterates the 
importance of such reforms in dealing with acts relating to deprivation of liberty that 
are obsolete and contrary to the international law. It commends the Government in 
this regard and encourages it to continue with judicial reforms in order to bring its 
legislation into line with its obligations under international human rights law. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>The Working Group is concerned, however, by the endemic practices carried 
out by institutions such as the Army, the Police, National Security services and border 
control personnel that are gross violations of human rights. The recurrent use of the 
force and ill-treatment of arrested and detained persons and prisoners should be 
expressly prohibited. Most instances of abuse of detainees occur in police stations. The 
Working Group also calls on the Government to abide by its obligations under 
various human rights conventions, including the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and ensure that its 
citizens are rigorously protected against such treatment when investigated, arrested or 
detained. Impunity should effectively be prevented and punished by the establishment 
and implementation of the necessary laws. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group notes with great concern that judges, magistrates and law 
enforcement agents are widely perceived to be weak and face corruption, and that the 
independence of the judges and magistrates has been consistently questioned by 
citizens, civil society and international organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Violations of the right to a fair trial seem to be systematic and have distorted 
the role of judges and magistrates as impartial arbiters. Public confidence in the 
administration of justice seems to be very low. The Working Group would like 
reiterate the importance as fundamental entitlements of persons who are deprived of 
their liberty of ensuring the adversarial nature of trials, the principle of equality of 
arms, respect for the presumption of innocence, the right to defence and the right to 
be free from torture and ill-treatment. Laws and practices need to ensure that these 
rights are safeguarded. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group recalls that detainees have the right to a fair and public 
hearing by an independent and impartial judicial authority, as stated in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and principles of international customary law 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Progress has been made in reforming penitentiaries and detention centres, 
mainly through the renovation of older facilities and the construction of newer ones. 
However, at some prisons, the Working Group found overcrowding, poor sanitation, 
minimal medical care and a lack of sufficient ventilation. The Government must 
guarantee the right to safety of all prisoners. Overcrowding seems to facilitate 
corruption in prison in several ways, including payment for moving to less-
overpopulated cells. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group notes that the Government is well-aware of the remaining 
areas in which there is room for improvement to the system governing deprivation of 
liberty (as identified in this report) and appreciates that they are being addressed. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group would like recommend that the 
Government:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Consider that the law and practice on remand in relation to sentencing 
have resulted in lengthy detention that is disproportionate to the crimes of which a 
person is convicted. Arrests warrants should be shown at the moment of the arrest 
and detainees should immediately be informed of all their rights. It is necessary to 
take into consideration the granting of early provisional release and the criteria for 
granting bail. Detaining suspects on remand requires tightening up with concomitant 
changes in practice; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>18 
</p>
<p> <b>(b) As part of criminal procedure reform, regulate the practice of &#8220;inviting 
witnesses&#8221; or suspects to police interviews, where potential violations of rights may 
occur. Efforts should be made to stop violence during arrest and interrogation. Police 
and National Security services training needs to take into account the prohibition of 
the use of torture, ill-treatment and degrading treatment on arrestees, detainees, 
prisoners and citizens alike; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Systematically investigate all cases of police, military and National 
Security services abuse to avoid impunity and put an end to widespread ill-treatment 
of detainees; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) Ensure proper and thorough investigation of torture and ill-treatment 
cases, holding perpetrators accountable and making investigations public to the 
Armenian people, without jeopardizing the investigative process. Ensure thorough 
consideration of all accusations of torture made in courts and, if confirmed, 
inadmissibility of evidence obtained in such a way. Ensure full protection of persons 
deprived of their liberty from torture and ill-treatment, as per the State obligations 
under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment; article 7 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
article 17 of the Constitution of Armenia; and other relevant national legislation, such 
as the Criminal Code and article 2 of the Law on Treatment of Arrestees and 
Detainees; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure systematic civil society participation in the monitoring and 
investigation of police stations and prison facilities. In this regard, it should ensure 
access for a police monitoring group to all premises and facilities of the police where 
persons are detained; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Implement training and capacity-building of all State law enforcement 
agencies such as the police, National Security Services and military personnel on 
international human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Amend the Law on State Borders and the Criminal Code to incorporate 
provisions exempting asylum-seekers from detention for illegal entry into the country 
and improve detention conditions and detainees&#8217; access to information on asylum 
procedures and legal counsel; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Establish proper reception facilities at the Zvartnots International 
Airport and at all major land entry points; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(i) Establish a programme to provide all border guards with initial and
