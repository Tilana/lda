APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 11, 12, 13 & 14 OF 2001
(Labasa Mag. Ct. Crim. Case Nos.705, 706, 707, 708 & 709/2000)

Between:

ETUATE TURANAMU
Appellant

And

STATE
Respondent

Mr. A. Sen for the Appellant
Mr. J. Rabuku for the State

JUDGMENT

The appellants appeals are against sentence. He was given a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment by the Magistrates Court at Labasa as follows:


	(a)	Cr. App. 11/2001	for Burglary and larceny from dwelling house, Keeping Arms & Ammunition without licence - 3 years on 1st Count and 12 months on 2nd Count concurrent.

	(b)	Cr. App. 12/2001	for Criminal Trespass - 6 months concurrent

	(c)	Cr. App. 13/2001 	For Resisting arrest  12 months concurrent

	(d) 	Cr. App. 14/2001	for Burglary and Keeping arms without licence - sentenced to 3 years and 12 months respectively - concurrent


After considering the plea for reduction of sentence by the learned counsel for the appellant and upon considering the submission of Prosecution opposing the appeals, I find there is no merit in the appeals.

The appellant has committed serious offences. He has a number of previous convictions for similar offence and was previously given 2 ½ years imprisonment for burglary.

The sentences are neither harsh nor excessive and are not wrong in principle.

The appeals are dismissed.
