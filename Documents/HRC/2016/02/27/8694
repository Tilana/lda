<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Guinea was held at the 3rd meeting, on 4 May 2010. The delegation of 
Guinea was headed by the State Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs, African Integration 
and Francophonie, Bakary Fofana. At its 7th meeting, held on 6 May 2010, the Working 
Group adopted the report on Guinea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guinea: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ghana and 
Japan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Guinea: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GIN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Guinea through the 
troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal period review. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation of Guinea stated that the participation of Guinea in the 
universal periodic review exercise demonstrated the commitment of the Transitional 
Authority to human rights and their universal value as the basic tool for political and social 
reforms undertaken since the signing of the Ouagadougou Agreement on 15 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>6. In conformity with the directives of the Human Rights Council, the national report 
was drafted following a methodology emphasizing a consultative and participatory 
approach. To that end, the Prime Minister set up an inter-ministerial committee with the 
task of drafting the national report, on 11 September 2009.  For three days, it worked in 
close collaboration with non-governmental organizations working in the human rights field.  
</p>
<p>7. The issue of human rights has always been and remains one of the main concerns of 
the various constitutional Governments that have come to power since the independence of 
Guinea in 1958.  Each constitution has reaffirmed Guinea&#8217;s attachment to the Charter of the 
United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and regional instruments on 
human rights. Fundamental rights set forth in those constitutions have led to the 
formulation of legislative texts and regulations for the protection of human rights and for 
the punishment of perpetrators of human rights violations.  </p>


<p>8. However, a lack of political will has affected the implementation of national and 
international legislation on human rights. That deficiency has led to serious and massive 
human rights violations by successive Governments.  Denunciations and complaints, linked 
to political instability and lack of security, have resulted in massive uprisings and general 
disputes. In December 2008, in circumstances in which the State was incapable of carrying 
out its functions, the National Council for Democracy and Development took power 
through a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, raising high hopes for change. Unfortunately, disagreements on 
issues related to good governance have affected the new course. Human rights violations, 
which commenced in June 2006, have continued up to September 2009.    
</p>
<p>9. The signature of the Ouagadougou Agreements created favourable conditions for a 
return to peace and the prevention of social tensions throughout the country. The 
Transitional Authority, an outcome of the Ouagadougou Agreements, is committed to the 
holding of free, fair and transparent elections. As a first step, it began a review of basic 
laws, the electoral code and other legislation, such as the civil code, which will form the 
institutional regulatory framework for ensuring that human rights are respected individually 
and collectively.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation pointed out that the blossoming of associations, unions and non-
governmental organizations marked an important stage in the history of Guinea, a process 
that ultimately led to the establishment of the National Human Rights Directorate and the 
Guinean Observatory for Human Rights. Simultaneously, the development of a very active 
network of associations with a great deal of autonomy has helped to lend new impetus to 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Hundreds of associations have become 
indispensable and responsible partners of the public authority and have seen their fields of 
action broadened.    
</p>
<p>11. The delegation noted that the Constitution and the Criminal Code enshrine the 
sacred nature of human life and human beings. As a consequence, law prohibits all attacks 
against life and physical integrity. Nevertheless, Guinean law has maintained the death 
penalty for the most serious crimes. Although courts mete out such sentences, the 
Government has been observing a de facto moratorium since 2002. Additionally, various 
measures have been undertaken to effectively combat all forms of violence, such as female 
genital mutilation and sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>12. Repression through the abuse of authority, especially by law enforcement officials, 
has been rarely undertaken. In that regard, the Transitional Authority is committed to 
ending impunity, which has been the cause of complaints that have recently been a source 
of great concern in the country. The Constitution and various legislative texts make 
freedom and fundamental rights top priorities of the legal system. The transitional body, 
under the leadership of General S&#233;kouba Konate, has undertaken an institutional reform 
designed to consolidate the State&#8217;s capacity to prevent and punish human rights violations. 
A better-controlled executive power, a strengthened parliament and an independent 
judiciary are the main components of the process of institutional reform. Reinforcing the 
rule of law is a long process, fraught with obstacles and challenges, that the Government 
should address with the help of the international community and through harmonious work 
by political parties.  
</p>
<p>13. Poverty and illiteracy are major obstacles to the exercise and enjoyment of human 
rights, such as access to potable water, electricity, sufficient and good-quality food, health, 
adequate housing and education. Therefore, the introduction of human rights and 
humanitarian law in the curriculums of universities and vocational schools, especially those 
for law enforcement officials and armed forces, should be provided for in the Constitution 
as a governmental responsibility. All forms of the abuse of women and children, including 
traditional practices, should be progressively eliminated through awareness-raising and 
information programmes for the population.  </p>


<p>14. Slow and complex legal proceedings affecting the credibility of courts and tribunals 
are another concern that the Constitution and new laws will tackle. Guaranteeing access to 
rights and to the judicial institutions -- making the citizen closer to the legal system -- is 
part of the reform efforts of the Transitional Authority. Other commitments undertaken by 
the Transitional Authority include combating arbitrary arrest, prolonged illegal detention 
and abuse against freedom of speech, and ensuring the right to assemble and demonstrate, 
press freedom and the right to freely choose one&#8217;s representatives.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation added that the universal period review, as a mechanism for 
international cooperation, combines a process of self-evaluation with an assessment by 
peers with a view to reinforcing State institutional capacities. In that connection, the review 
will assist the Government in continuing the renaissance begun through the Ouagadougou 
Agreements. Lack of respect for human rights had become a system of government and was 
the cause of much suffering among the Guinean people. Transition bodies are composed of 
men and women of goodwill who themselves have been the victims of human rights 
violations. Nonetheless, the cooperation and assistance of the international community are 
needed, and the first step in that regard is the opening of an OHCHR office in Conakry.  
</p>
<p>16. Replying to advance questions, the delegation stated that freedom of opinion and 
expression, freedom of reunion and association, freedom of public gathering and freedom 
of the press have constitutional value in the Guinea legal system and are protected by the 
law and by State institutions.  
</p>
<p>17. The Criminal Code, the Electoral Code and the law on political parties will be 
reinforced by new institutions for the protection of human rights, resulting from the 
constitutional reform, in addition to the Independent National Commission on Elections.   
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the right to life and physical integrity, extrajudicial executions, the 
excessive use of force, and other forms of violence, including sexual violence, a pool of 
judges is, as a result of the events on 28 September 2009, currently conducting an inquiry in 
order to ascertain the gravity of human rights violations, their perpetrators and the degree of 
personal responsibility, to gather evidence and to bring before appropriate courts those 
responsible for massacres. This work follows the reports of the United Nations Commission 
of Inquiry and the National Commission of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p>19. The opening of an OHCHR office in Conakry will resolve all questions related to 
the issuance of a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders.   
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the ratification of international instruments, the Government has 
entrusted an interministerial commission with the task of studying the possibility of 
adhering to optional protocols.  
</p>
<p>21. The delegation stated that the financial law envisages a limited amount of resources 
for improving the living conditions of detainees. However, the largest portion of the budget 
of the Ministry of Justice is devoted to such expenditure. In addition, a number of non-
governmental organizations are monitoring the availability of food and hygiene as well as 
health conditions in prisons and other detention centres.  The judge for the execution of 
sentences determines detention modalities for each convicted person, including release on 
parole and alternative sentences.  
</p>
<p>22. The strategy for the elimination of harmful traditional practices and stereotypes is 
based on the application of repressive laws, on the one hand, and on the implementation of 
awareness and education mechanisms and programmes regarding issues such as early 
marriage and female genital mutilation, on the other. Perpetrators of female genital 
mutilation can be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.    
</p>
<p>23. The Transitional Authority has undertaken constitutional reforms designed to 
reinforce legislative tools and regulations aimed at ensuring respect for human rights on the </p>


<p>part of defence and security forces. No exceptional situation can justify human rights 
violations. The military justice code and the establishment of a military tribunal will 
contribute to the Government&#8217;s efforts in this field.  
</p>
<p>24. The establishment of the National Directorate for Human Rights and the opening of 
an OHCHR Conakry office will resolve the difficulties related to the late submission of 
periodic reports to treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>25. The reform of the judiciary is one of the Government&#8217;s priorities. Among other 
measures, the Guinean Observatory for Human Rights, created by the Prime Minister, is 
acting on the basis of the Paris Principles. The Government plans to make the Observatory 
a fully independent constitutional institution. 
</p>
<p>26. Several legislative initiatives, including the ratification of a number of ad hoc 
international instruments and transnational cooperation, have been undertaken with respect 
to child trafficking and forced labour. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 36 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations expressed appreciation for Guinea&#8217;s national report and for the comprehensive 
presentation made by the Guinean delegation. They acknowledged the difficulties faced by 
Guinea in a period of transition, and welcomed efforts for the establishment of lasting peace 
and democracy.  Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the 
present report.  
</p>
<p>28. Norway acknowledged that Guinea was in transition and noted the recent positive 
developments towards free elections and civilian rule. It acknowledged efforts to 
investigate the events of 28 September 2009. It was concerned about the situation of 
women. It believed that civil society organizations played an important part in fostering a 
culture of human rights and that their active participation was essential to a meaningful 
universal period review process. Norway made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. Brazil welcomed policies aimed at improvements in women&#8217;s health and progress in 
HIV/AIDS treatment, notably the reduction in the cost of medicine. Brazil noted with 
satisfaction the transitional Government&#8217;s efforts to re-establish democracy and its 
cooperation with regional and international organizations. It hoped that the next elections 
would represent a step towards peace and stability. It welcomed the adoption of resolution 
13/21 of the Council. It appealed to the international community to aid Guinea&#8217;s efforts. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. While admitting that poverty, illiteracy and the lack of human and financial 
resources hampering Guinea&#8217;s progress in the promotion and protection of human rights, 
Indonesia stated that the report attested to Guinea&#8217;s clear political will to tackle those 
shortcomings. It was encouraged to note genuine efforts to meet international obligations 
by gradually establishing a human rights framework and by educating judges, lawyers, 
public servants and army and police officers about human rights. Indonesia made a 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p>31. Germany appreciated Guinea&#8217;s cooperation in adopting its resolution at the 
thirteenth session of the Human Rights Council and its decision to cooperate with OHCHR 
with a view to opening a country office. It noted that, while the national report stated that 
freedom of association and assembly was a constitutional principle, the OHCHR 
compilation expressed concerns regarding the closing of newspapers in 2008 and 
allegations of torture in the context of a general strike in 2007. Germany asked about </p>


<p>measures to prevent violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and 
freedom of association and assembly. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. India appreciated Guinea&#8217;s efforts to empower rural women and to address 
trafficking and female genital mutilation. It noted that, owing to the steady deterioration in 
its economy over the previous decade, poverty remained the main obstacle to the protection 
of human rights. It encouraged Guinea to establish an independent national human rights 
institution in full compliance with the Paris Principles and to consider ratifying the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>33. Pakistan highlighted the fact that more than 1,300 non-governmental organizations 
were licensed in Guinea and that the country had acceded to all core human rights 
instruments. It noted the challenges faced by Guinea in the fields of social development, 
politics, the economy, education and health. It mentioned the Ouagadougou Agreement of 
January 2010 as an excellent opportunity to become a democratic nation and accelerate 
development. Pakistan welcomed the establishment of the Observatory for Democracy and 
Human Rights and the National Directorate for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
It noted that Guinea needed financial and technical assistance in its efforts to promote and 
protect human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. France made reference to the military junta period, during which the human rights 
situation had deteriorated, and the period following the 2010 Ouagadougou Declaration, 
during which the authorities had demonstrated their interest in cooperating with the 
international community. The commitment to human rights had been demonstrated through 
the agreement for the establishment of an OHCHR country office and the adoption of a 
resolution by the Human Rights Council in March 2010. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Hungary wished to acknowledge Guinea&#8217;s support for the Human Rights Council 
resolution on the strengthening of technical cooperation and consultation services. Hungary 
also wished to recall that the Security Council, in its presidential statement of 28 October 
2009, had reaffirmed the need for national authorities to fight impunity and bring 
perpetrators to justice. With respect to violence against women, it echoed the appeal made 
in 2007 by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Hungary 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Belarus noted that the report outlined problems facing Guinea as it sought to 
overcome its political and social crisis and the measures undertaken to ensure respect for 
political, civil, social and cultural rights. It asked about Guinea&#8217;s priorities in seeking to 
overcome the crisis, programmes for improving the health of women and children, and 
ways in which Guinea was seeking international support. It noted that Guinea intended to 
ensure education for all. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Slovenia welcomed the fact that Guinea had ratified many of the core human rights 
instruments and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; however, it noted 
that many reports to treaty bodies were overdue. It asked if there was any plan to submit 
those reports. With regard to the massacre of unarmed civilians on 28 September 2009 in 
Conakry, it asked about concrete measures to hold accountable the persons responsible for 
those crimes. It also noted the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women at the prevalence of violence against women and girls, 
while it highlighted its commitment to the abolition of the death penalty. Slovenia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. The delegation of Guinea emphasized the fact that the draft version of a new 
constitution provided for the establishment of an independent national human rights 
institution. The Constitutional Court would also monitor the separation of powers among 
the executive, the parliamentary assembly and the judiciary. </p>


<p>39. Regarding the events of 28 September 2009, the delegation stated that the Deputy 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court had visited Conakry and toured the country 
in the aftermath of the massacres. The Court had decided that crimes committed during that 
period could be defined as crimes against humanity and had given the Guinean authorities 
sixth month to initiate legal procedures for the determination of facts and cases.   
</p>
<p>40. The death penalty has been part of the Criminal Code since Guinea&#8217;s independence 
in 1958. A de facto moratorium was declared in 2002, and debates on the total abolition of 
death penalty &#8211; in particular on how the issue should be approached by society at large -- 
resurfaced in 2009.  
</p>
<p>41. The delegation also referred to the creation of a favourable context for the holding of 
the elections in June 2010. The deployment of observers from international organizations 
and the establishment of a national independent council would play a crucial role in 
monitoring the fairness of the electoral process. With regard to freedom of the press, the 
establishment of a new body -- the High Authority on Communications -- with a 
substantive mandate would help to eliminate negative effects and attitudes against media 
freedom. Finally, security and defence forces would be restructured under the supervision 
of the United Nations.   
</p>
<p>42. Spain highlighted Guinea&#8217;s commitment to and cooperation with the Commission of 
Inquiry established by the Secretary-General to investigate the events of September 2009. It 
welcomed Guinea&#8217;s decision to sign a country-office agreement with OHCHR. Noting that 
Guinea had subscribed to a number of international human rights instruments, Spain 
emphasized that further efforts to implement obligations undertaken would be appropriate. 
It highlighted the fact that the death penalty was not applied to minors. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Switzerland welcomed the appointment of the transitional Government and urged it 
to make every effort to return to democratic standards, towards which the upcoming 
elections constituted a key stage. Switzerland made reference to impunity, the harassment 
of journalists and freedom of expression. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. China commended Guinea for its efforts to prevent and treat diseases, improve 
health care and increase school enrolment and agricultural activities so as to realize the 
right to food, health and education. It noted the difficulties and challenges faced by Guinea 
as a developing country. It called on the international community to continue to provide the 
necessary resources and technical support. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Chad noted with satisfaction that Guinea was a party to various international and 
regional human rights instruments and wished Guinea a full political recovery following the 
events of 28 September 2009. Chad made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the progress 
made by the transitional Government towards a return to civilian democracy through the 
elections to be held on 27 June 2010. However, it remained concerned about the serious 
human rights violations that had occurred in Conakry on 28 September 2009. It stated that 
those responsible must be held to account, and it welcomed the statement of the 
International Criminal Court that it would investigate if Guinea&#8217;s authorities did not. It 
encouraged Guinea to support the establishment of an OHCHR office and urged it to 
submit outstanding reports to the Human Rights Committee. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. Mexico recognized and encouraged Guinea&#8217;s cooperation with OHCHR, which had 
strengthened its institutional framework. It highlighted Guinea&#8217;s efforts in welcoming 
refugees. Mexico was aware of the challenges faces by Guinea, particularly in the context 
of political instability. It urged the implementation of the Joint Declaration of Ouagadougou 
of 15 January 2010 in order to make the transition towards democracy and rule of law, </p>


<p>particularly through the elections set for June, which should be in accordance with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Canada was pleased to see improvement with regard to the attention provided to 
human rights in Guinea, to which the open and collaborative spirit of the new President had 
contributed. However, it noted that human rights challenges and limited resources required 
a focus on priority sectors. A return to constitutional order and the rule of law was a 
prerequisite. Canada expressed concerns at the culture of impunity, notably the events of 
September 2009, which required a reform of the judicial system. Canada congratulated 
Guinea on its collaboration with OHCHR and the opening of an office in the country. 
Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Malaysia appreciated the fact that Guinea recognized its challenges and constraints 
in improving social development and protecting human rights. It noted that, given the 
commitment, the efforts and engagement undertaken by Guinea with the international 
community, the country would be able to make progress in terms of the social, economic 
and political well-being of its people. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Israel regretted the human rights violations occurring in Guinea, including those 
related to the military coup on 23 December 2008 and the bloody incidents at the Conakry 
stadium on 28 September 2009. It fully supported the activities of the International Contact 
Group in Guinea to monitor the conduct of free and fair elections. It highlighted the 
country&#8217;s readiness to work with the international community and committed itself to 
assisting in the country&#8217;s progress, specifically in empowering women and combating 
poverty, as well as in the fields of health, agriculture and education. Israel made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Netherlands highlighted Guinea&#8217;s cooperation with the Commission of Inquiry 
following the events of September 2009, its cooperation with the Human Rights Council on 
resolution 13/21, and its decision to work with OHCHR in opening a country office. It 
noted Guinea&#8217;s fragile human rights situation. It reiterated concerns about violence against 
women and girls, including sexual violence. It was alarmed by the high incidence of female 
genital mutilation and the impunity of its perpetrators. It welcomed the Law on 
Reproductive Health, prohibiting all forms of female genital mutilation. It expressed 
concern that Guinea was a country of origin, transit and destination for human trafficking. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Argentina thanked Guinea for its national report and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Belgium condemned the massacre of September 2009, which had resulted in 150 
deaths, hundreds cases of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the 
rape of at least 100 women, and other forms of sexual violence. Belgium welcomed 
Guinea&#8217;s constructive attitude regarding the adoption of the Human Rights Council 
resolution. Belgium noted with regret that, despite the fact that there had been no execution 
since 2002, death sentences were still being passed and might be applied. Belgium made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Slovakia welcomed Guinea&#8217;s adoption of a Child Code in 2008. There were, 
however, areas of concern, such as the excessive use of force by armed security forces to 
dispel the demonstration of September 2009, which had caused loss of life, a high number 
of injuries, sexual abuse and the large-scale destruction of property; and the conditions in 
prisons and detention centres, especially the lack of the necessary infrastructure, which had 
resulted in overcrowding, malnutrition and inadequate health care that was far below 
international standards. Slovakia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>55. Sweden reiterated its condemnation of the violent crackdown by security forces on 
the political demonstrations of 28 September 2009, noting that the violence that had </p>


<p>occurred during those events, including sexual attacks on women, had been unacceptable. It 
asked about measures to ensure the right to life, physical integrity, and equal enjoyment of 
human rights by women, as well as measures to combat ethnic discrimination. It noted that 
the postponement of presidential elections since the military coup of 2008 had denied the 
Guinean people their right to participate in government. It noted that persons expressing 
their views or seeking to participate in the political process had been abused, detained and 
killed. It asked about measures taken to restore democracy and constitutional order. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Japan was concerned about the deterioration of the human rights situation in Guinea 
following the coup last September, while it welcomed developments that had occurred 
since the Ouagadougou Agreement of 15 January 2010. It noted that the presidential 
election scheduled for 27 June was an important step in consolidating democracy. It 
highlighted its concern over the fact that discrimination against women remained in the 
country&#8217;s culture and customs. Japan made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>57. The Republic of Korea hoped that Guinea would heed the views and 
recommendations offered at the present universal periodic review session so as to deliver 
improvements in its human rights situation. It welcomed initiatives to empower rural 
women and improve women&#8217;s health through the establishment of relevant institutions and 
through budgetary increases. It noted improvement in the net enrolment ratio in primary 
and secondary schools. While Guinea faced challenges at the political, economic and social 
levels, it noted that these should not affect the commitment to human rights. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. The United States of America welcomed the signing in January of the Ouagadougou 
Agreement and the establishment in February of a transitional Government. It remained 
concerned about human rights violations committed by the security forces, such as killings, 
sexual assaults, arbitrary detention and torture, which had ensued from the country&#8217;s 
political and social crises. It stated that the end of the military regime presented an 
opportunity for democratic progress, but that undisciplined security forces not subject to 
civilian control could derail this transition. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation of Guinea stated that there would be no duplication of roles or 
functions between the National Human Rights Directorate and the national human rights 
commission envisaged in the draft constitution. The first body would be responsible for the 
Government&#8217;s statuary obligations vis-&#224;-vis the United Nations and the treaty bodies 
system, while the second body would draw the attention of the Constitutional Court to new 
laws possibly infringing constitutionality and would ensure the protection of human rights 
defenders.  The President had concluded the first reading of the draft constitution and was 
evaluating whether there was a need for a second reading.  Among other innovations, the 
Law on Media would decriminalize press offences, and all electoral lists should include at 
least 30 per cent women candidates in order to be considered valid.   
</p>
<p>60. The delegation noted the existence of a five-year national programme against female 
genital mutilation, as well as repressive measures. Life imprisonment and the death penalty, 
which were included in the Criminal Code with regard to violence against women and 
children, would be envisaged for the most serious cases.  
</p>
<p>61. Bulgaria welcomed Guinea&#8217;s ratification of several of the principal United Nations 
human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It 
noted that the national report stated that the right of citizens to freely choose their leaders in 
regular elections had been enshrined in all constitutional texts, but it expressed concern at 
recent political developments. It asked how Guinea would ensure a return to constitutional 
order, guarantee the right to freely elect representatives, and implement its pledge to hold

system and impunity, and noted its efforts to restore the rule of law. Ghana made 
recommendations.

three priorities to be addressed with the assistance of the international community: the fight 
against impunity, the reform of the judiciary and the reform of the security and defence 
services.  The delegation thanked the members of the Working Group for the frank and
