<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/12, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to present an annual report to the Council 
containing information on relevant developments in the work of United Nations human 
rights bodies and mechanisms, as well as on the activities undertaken by OHCHR at 
Headquarters and in the field, that contribute to the promotion of and respect for the 
provisions of the Declaration on Minorities on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National 
or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report describes the efforts made by OHCHR and the United Nations 
human rights machinery to strengthen the implementation of the provisions contained in the 
Declaration on Minorities. It provides illustrative examples of the activities and the 
initiatives undertaken at Headquarters and by several field presences that contribute to the 
implementation of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights at Headquarters and in the field 
</b></p>
<p>3. OHCHR continued to pursue a range of activities to advance the promotion and 
implementation of the Declaration on Minorities, in accordance with the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan  for the biennium 2010-2011. The first 
thematic priority under the Plan is countering discrimination, in particular racial 
discrimination and discrimination on various other grounds, which frequently results in 
exclusion and marginalization. Problems affecting minority communities are often linked to 
violations of the principle of non-discrimination, which in turn contribute to the denial of 
effective participation by minorities in decisions, including those affecting them.  
</p>
<p>4. In 2011, the High Commissioner expressed concerns about the situation of 
minorities in various public statements. In January 2011, she condemned the attacks 
targeting religious groups in several countries across the world, and urged States to 
demonstrate their determination in combating such violence and in rooting out 
discriminatory laws and practices affecting religious minorities. The High Commissioner 
also expressed concerns about the challenges faced by minorities witnessed during her 
country visits, including the situation of Roma in Europe. 
</p>
<p>5. At the beginning of 2011, OHCHR issued a publication entitled &#8220;Minority Rights: 
International Standards and Guidance for Implementation&#8221;, which provides guidance on 
standards and mechanisms pertaining to the protection of minorities, as well as a checklist 
for developing programmes and projects on minorities. OHCHR also published a booklet 
on the contents of the Declaration on Minorities, accompanied by soundbytes, which 
capture the essence of each provision and are accompanied by photographs of minorities 
around the world. 
</p>
<p>6. In April 2011, during its annual meeting of the heads of OHCHR field presences, 
OHCHR dedicated a session to the protection of indigenous peoples and minority rights. 
Participants in the session explored strategies that could be implemented to advance the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities.  
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR contributed substantively to a two-day training workshop on minority 
rights and development, held in Strasbourg, France, on 17 and 18 November 2011. The 
workshop was organized by the Bratislava Regional Centre of the United Nations </p>


<p>Development Programme (UNDP) in cooperation with Minority Rights Group 
International. Issues relating to the need to secure the effective participation of minorities in 
efforts to improve sustainable development and overcoming their marginalization in 
poverty reduction strategies were addressed. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Policing and minority communities 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since 2008, OHCHR has organized four regional consultations with a view to 
encouraging the participation of minorities in the administration of justice by means of law 
enforcement and, more specifically, policing. The goal of the consultations has been to 
gather effective practices in the field of policing and minority communities. Previous 
annual reports of the High Commissioner contained summaries on the consultations. 
</p>
<p>9. Building on the results of the consultations and the information shared with regard 
to effective practices and the challenges that are to be tackled to combat exclusion and to 
move towards greater participation and representation of minorities in the police service, 
OHCHR held its fourth expert consultation on the theme of effective practices in policing 
and minority communities in the Asia Pacific in Bangkok in May 2011. 
</p>
<p>10. Similarly to the three previous consultations, the goal of fourth consultation was to 
provide a forum for discussions and exchange of experiences with a view to gather 
effective practices in policing and minority communities from the region. All the had the 
overall objective of creating a tool in the form of a set of guidelines that could serve to 
provide law enforcement agencies with advice on how best to approach the inclusion of 
minorities in policing by means of participation and representation.  At the consultation, 
participants explored regional challenges to and opportunities for increasing the 
representation and participation of minorities in policing, and identified effective practices 
for maintaining police professional standards of conduct vis-&#224;-vis minorities. It brought 
together experts from Australia, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and 
Thailand, as well as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families. A number of United Nations agencies and programmes 
were represented, including the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), UNDP, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and 
the International Organization for Migrations (IOM). The Human Rights Commission of 
Thailand and the non-governmental organization Minority Rights Group International and 
Forum Asia also participated in the consultation. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to the effective participation of minorities in policing, the practices 
shared during the consultation reinforced, inter alia, the conclusions that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The representation and participation of minorities in policing can only be ensured 
through an inclusive recruitment strategy that is holistic, transparent and accountable  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The participation of minorities in policing can be effectively encouraged through 
positive measures and quotas 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Due respect for minority identity dress symbols can be accommodated as long as it 
does not hinder the implementation of the tasks of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Enhanced recruitment of minorities does not require that the criteria for recruitment 
be reduced, but can be achieved 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An independent monitoring mechanism of performance that is based on neutrality 
and dignity is essential </p>


<p>&#8226; Training in promoting effective policing should focus on changes in behaviour 
leading to changes in attitude  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Trust in the police service and the community can be encouraged through effective 
communication 
</p>
<p><b> B. Training workshop on minority rights 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 2 and 3 June 2011, OHCHR conducted a regional training workshop on the 
protection of the rights of minorities for OHCHR staff members based in the South-East 
Asia region, as well as for staff members from UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and the United 
Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) 
working in the same region. 
</p>
<p>13. The training workshop, which was held in Bangkok with the support of the OHCHR 
Regional Office, was part of the ongoing efforts of the Office to provide training aimed at 
strengthening the mainstreaming capacity of OHCHR field presences and United Nations 
country teams. The training also sought to integrate the protection of the rights of minorities 
into country and regional strategies and development programmes, including by creating 
consultative mechanisms to support agencies on policy issues affecting minorities. This 
training activity also resulted in greater understanding of definitions, standards, 
mechanisms and implementation strategies in addressing the protection of the rights of 
persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Minorities fellowship programme 
</b></p>
<p>14. In its efforts to build the capacity of civil society actors, OHCHR offers a fellowship 
programme for persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. 
In 2011, following extensive consultations and revisions, the programme has been further 
improved and the presence of fellows from the two linguistic components programme 
(English and Arabic) as one group coincided with the annual session of the Forum on 
Minority Issues. The programme was conducted from 14 November to 16 December 2011 
and brought to Geneva persons belonging to minorities from Canada, Iraq, Kenya, 
Mauritania, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Yemen. Through the fellowship 
programme, OHCHR offers minorities an opportunity to gain knowledge about the United 
Nations system and the mechanisms dealing with international human rights in general and 
minority rights in particular. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2011, for the first time, the fellowship programme included joint sessions with the 
participants of the Global Advocacy Programme, organized by Minority Rights Group 
International in partnership with OHCHR and aimed at building the capacity of minority 
rights advocates. 
</p>
<p>16. Furthermore, a position of senior fellow was created in 2011 with the aim of giving 
an experienced minority rights expert an opportunity to gain further practical knowledge 
and working level experience by directly contributing to the programmes and activities of 
the OHCHR Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section. The first senior fellow, from the 
Uighur minority in China, she worked at OHCHR from October to December 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Inter-Agency Group on Minorities  
</b></p>
<p>17. The Inter-Agency Group on Minorities convened its seventh meeting on 4 October 
2011, pursuant to article 9 of the Declaration on Minorities. According to Article 9, the </p>


<p>specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system are to contribute 
to the full realization of the rights and principles set forth in the Declaration on Minorities. 
The Inter-Agency Group is a mechanism for cooperation and coordination on minority 
issues among United Nations organizations, specialized agencies, funds and programmes, 
which contribute to the full realization, protection and promotion of the rights of persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. The meeting, which 
brought together representatives from OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF, the International Labour 
Organization, IOM and Minority Rights Group International, and benefited from the 
presence of the recently appointed independent expert on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k. She 
provided an overview on her background and shared information on her vision of her 
mandate for the next three years. The meeting offered an opportunity to share activities 
undertaken by all agencies throughout 2011 and to share OHCHR planned activities for the 
commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on 
Minorities in 2012, as well as to explore avenues for enhanced collaboration to advance the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Forum on Minority Issues  
</b></p>
<p>18. The fourth session of the Forum on Minority Issues, held on 29 and 30 November 
2011, focused on the theme &#8220;Guaranteeing the rights of minority women&#8221;. OHCHR also 
organized a preparatory briefing for minority representatives prior to the session. At the 
session, the Forum examined concrete measures and recommendations aimed at 
guaranteeing the rights of minority women. Building on the work carried out during the 
first three sessions of the Forum and the recommendations emanating from that work, the 
fourth session was focused on rights and opportunities for minority women to have access 
to education, to take part effectively in economic life, to have access to labour markets and 
to participate fully in social, cultural and political life. The Forum also provided 
participants with opportunities to highlight positive initiatives and good practices for the 
protection and promotion of the rights of minority women. The results of the fourth session 
of the Forum will be reported to the Human Rights Council in more detail by the 
independent expert on minority issues, in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/15. 
</p>
<p>19. On 29 November 2011, OHCHR organized a side event to the session of the Forum 
entitled &#8220;Empowering minority women to claim their rights: identifying effective 
practices&#8221;. The side event provided an opportunity for participants to share effective 
practices relating to the various tools and approaches for the empowerment of minority 
women to claim their rights. It also advanced a better understanding of strategies and 
practices that minority women can use not only to secure their effective participation at the 
community level but also to ensure that the communities to which they belong benefit from 
their contributions. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Regional and country engagement activities 
</b></p>
<p>20. Activities carried out at the regional and country levels in relation to advancing the 
protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities included monitoring, support for 
legal reform, technical cooperation, capacity-building andawareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR continued its engagement in promoting and protecting the rights of national 
and ethnic minorities in Central Asia, notably through its Regional Office for Central Asia 
based in Bishkek. In this context, OHCHR organized a regional conference entitled, 
&#8220;Advancing the rights of minorities in Central Asia: effective participation in public life&#8221;. 
The conference, the first such regional event on national and ethnic minority rights in </p>


<p>Central Asia, was held in Bishkek on 21 and 22 June 2011, and was co-organized with the 
United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia and the Centre 
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Bishkek. It brought 
together representatives of Governments, national human rights institutions, minorities and 
civil society organizations from Central Asia, as well as United Nations agencies and 
international organizations and experts, to discuss possible ways of improving the effective 
participation of minorities in the Central Asia region in different spheres of life. Particular 
emphasis was placed on participation in public life. In the concluding statement, the 
participants pledged to strengthen their efforts to further improve minority participation in 
their respective countries and to continue dialogue on minority issues. 
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR has also been actively involved in the consultations surrounding the 
creation of the &#8220;Concept of ethnic policy and consolidation of society in Kyrgyzstan, and 
plan of action until 2015&#8221;, and has been working with the authorities, the Ombudsman and 
other partners in addressing human rights concerns relating to the protection of minorities. 
</p>
<p>23. The OHCHR Regional Office for Europe submitted recommendations to the 
European Commission on the national strategies for Roma integration, which the 
Commission welcomed before the meeting of the Platform for Roma Inclusion, held on 17 
and 18 November. On 6 and 7 June 2011, the Office, in cooperation with the City of 
Ostrava, organized a two-day workshop on a human rights-based approach to policy and 
budgeting for the advancement of the right to housing for disadvantaged and marginalized 
groups, including Roma. Participants included representatives of civil society organizations 
and of the Roma. In addition, the Office has been closely involved with civil society 
organizations, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders concerning the 
forced eviction of Irish Travellers from Dale Farm, the largest Traveller site in the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>24. The OHCHR Human Rights Adviser in the Republic of Moldova worked closely 
with the Government, civil society, and other partners such as the European Union, OSCE 
and the Council of Europe in order to assist in the design of a new Roma inclusion plan of 
action for Moldova (2011-2015). In addition, the office worked with UN-Women and 
UNDP, under the auspices of United Nations Resident Coordinator&#8217;s Office, the Embassy 
of Sweden and civil society actors to hold the country&#8217;s first major conference on the 
Romani Holocaust and contemporary discrimination and exclusion of Roma, on 20 and 21 
October 2011. 
</p>
<p>25. In May 2011, the OHCHR Human Rights Adviser to the United Nations country 
team in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia conducted three human rights 
workshops on strengthening inter-ethnic dialogue for national actors participating in the 
joint United Nations project (UNDP, UNICEF and UNESCO). The workshops dealt with 
minority rights and rights-based approaches to programming for minorities. For the 
occasion, the Declaration on Minorities was translated into two of the six languages spoken 
in the country. 
</p>
<p>26. The OHCHR Regional Office for Central America offered technical assistance to 
national human rights institutions in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama to increase 
awareness of human rights in relation to Afro-descendant populations and to promote a 
standardized way of dealing with their complaints. The Office has consistently advocated 
for inclusion of Afro-descendant populations in the common country assessment and the 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework of Belize, Costa Rica and Panama.  
On 26 September 2011, the Office held a seminar that brought together 50 international 
human rights experts and representatives of Afro-descendant non-governmental 
organizations, national human rights institutions, racial equality bodies and United Nations 
agencies from Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama to discuss progress made and the challenges faced in </p>


<p>each country to enhance the protection of the rights of Afro-descendants, to mark the 
International Year for People of African Descent and to agree on a set of priority actions. 
</p>
<p>27. In an effort to implement the recommendation of the Working Group of Experts on 
People of African Descent1 to provide training for specific professional groups such as 
police officers, lawyers, judges and teachers to address stereotypes and prejudice directed at 
Afro-Ecuadorians, the Human Rights Adviser in Ecuador elaborated several training 
modules on the rights of Afro-Ecuadorians addressed to police, armed forces, national 
human rights institutions and the judicial sector. The modules will be included in the formal 
training curricula of these four State institutions. Moreover, the Human Rights Adviser is 
providing technical assistance and support to the national human rights institution, as well 
as to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  regarding specific publications on human 
rights and Afro-Ecuadorians. 
</p>
<p>28. The OHCHR office in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is following up on the 
situation of Bedouin refugees in the West Bank under the Israeli occupation. The Office is 
addressing the concerns that their livelihood and food security have been negatively 
affected by the expansion of Israeli settlements and &#8220;closed&#8221; areas (such as military zones 
and natural reserves) and that the Bedouin community has been gradually and 
systematically dispossessed of its land and faces constant attempts to displace it from their 
homes. 
</p>
<p>29. On 7 June 2011, the High Commissioner presented her follow-up report on  the 
situation of human rights in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, as requested by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution S-15/1. In her report, the High Commissioner described how 
50,000 Libyan civilians had fled the country&#8217;s Western mountains region and crossed into 
southern Tunisia. Most of the refugees were reportedly ethnic Berbers (Amazhir) fleeing 
fighting and indiscriminate attacks. 
</p>
<p>30. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution S-16/1, , requested OHCHR to deploy a 
mission to the Syrian Arab Republic to investigate all alleged violations of international 
human rights law and to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the 
crimes perpetrated, with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring full accountability. The 
High Commissioner presented her report to the Council at its eighteenth session, when she 
described how economic grievances were particularly strong in traditionally poor areas, 
including the north-eastern and border areas, such as Dar&#8217;a. They also reinforced long-
standing issues of discrimination and neglect suffered by specific ethnic and religious 
groups, in particular the Kurds, who inhabit the North-East and who had been deprived of 
their basic civil, economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p><b> G. International Year for People of African Descent 
</b></p>
<p>31. In its resolution 64/169, the General Assembly proclaimed 2011 as the International 
Year for People of African Descent. In many countries, Afro- descendants constitute 
numerical minorities whose generally non-dominant positions in their societies underline 
the need for the adoption and implementation of measures to allow them to exercise their 
rights to the fullest. During 2011, OHCHR implemented a framework for action to combat 
discrimination against people of African descent as an overarching policy document that 
guided its engagement with the fight against discrimination directed at people of African 
descent. Some of the activities that OHCHR carried out in the context of the Year include:  
</p>
<p>  
 1 See A/HRC/14/18, para. 130. </p>


<p>&#8226; the organization of a panel discussion at the sixteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council on the full enjoyment of the human rights of people of African descent  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the commemoration of the International Day against Racial Discrimination, which 
had people of African descent as its theme  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the servicing of the tenth session of the Working Group of Experts on People of 
African Descent, which had the International Year as its focus 
</p>
<p><b> III. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>32. Human rights treaty bodies have regularly raised issues relating to minority rights. 
While they have, on a number of occasions, acknowledged the achievements made by 
States, they have also issued a range of observations and recommendations for additional 
measures that States need to take in relation to minority rights in order to comply with their 
treaty obligations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>64. With regard to the report submitted by Turkmenistan (CAT/C/TKM/CO/1), the

<p><b> B. General comments  
</b></p>
<p>78. At its 102nd session, the Human Rights Committee adopted its general comment 
No.34, on the freedoms of opinion and expression (CCPR/C/GC/34). The Committee 
encouraged free and uncensored press or other media, and observed that, in order to protect 
the rights of minority media users and for them to be able to receive a wide range of 
information and ideas, States parties should take particular care to encourage independent 
and diverse media. With regard to the right of access to information, the Committee 
observed that, under article 27, a State party&#8217;s decision-making that may substantively 
compromise the way of life and culture of a minority group should be undertaken in a 
process of information-sharing and consultation with affected communities.    
</p>
<p>79. At its seventy-ninth session, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination adopted its general recommendation No. 34, on racial discrimination against 
people of African descent (CERD/C/GC/34). The Committee highlighted the right of 
people of African-descent to enjoy all human rights on the basis of equality and non-
discrimination, including the rights to property, to cultural identity, to protection of their 
traditional knowledge and to prior consultation in decisions which might affect them. 
Referring to the continued racial and institutional discrimination of people of African 
descent, the Committee observed that overcoming the structural discrimination that affects 
people of African descent called for the urgent adoption of special measures (affirmative 
action). For the exercise of the rights of people of African descent, the Committee 
recommended that States parties take general and special measures and take into full 
consideration racial discrimination against women and children of the people of African 
descent. The Committee also recommended protecting the people of African descent from 
hate speech and racial violence through the administration of justice, and that State parties 
guarantee the people of African descent civil and political, economic, social and cultural 
rights and facilitate their access to citizenship and education. 
</p>
<p>80. In 2011, the Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted its general comment No. 
13, on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence (CRC/C/GC/13). 
Children are often the victims of violence, who are marginalized, disadvantaged and

<p>discriminated against and lack the protection of adults responsible for defending their rights 
and best interests, including minority children. The groups of children likely to be exposed 
to violence include those who are from other ethnic minorities and minority religious or 
linguistic groups.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Statements  
</b></p>
<p>81. On 2 March 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
expressed alarm at the violent clashes taking place in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and their 
impact on the situation of foreign citizens and minority groups living in the country. The 
Committee drew attention to the excessive use of force against the civilian population in the 
country and acts of violence against foreigners, as well as the reported exodus of 
populations from neighbouring countries. It also called on the international community and 
the United Nations system to seek urgent measures to protect non-citizens, migrant 
populations, migrant workers, refugees and other minority groups in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya and avoid the risk of inter-ethnic violence and divisions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>82. In its resolution 16/6, the Human Rights Council extended the mandate of the 
independent expert on minority issues for three years. 
</p>
<p>83. The independent expert conducted a mission to Rwanda from 31 January to 7 
February 2011, after which she emphasized that Government efforts to forge unity and 
social cohesion behind a Rwandan national identity and to diminish ethnicity as a 
mobilizing and destructive force in society should not in any way restrict, and were not 
incompatible with, the rights of individuals and communities to freedom of expression and 
to freely identify as belonging to an ethnic group. She also conducted an official visit to 
Bulgaria from 4 to 11 July 2011, where she called upon the Government of Bulgaria to 
match European Union and non-governmental organization-inspired policies on Roma 
integration with Government-led implementation and the financial resources necessary to 
improve living conditions of the Roma in Bulgaria. 
</p>
<p>84. At its seventeenth session, the Human Rights Council appointed Rita Izsak as the 
new independent expert on minority issues. She succeeded Gay MacDougall, who was 
appointed as the first mandate holder in 2005 and whose mandate was renewed in 2008. 
</p>
<p>85. During the reporting period, other special procedures mandate holders also looked 
into the situation of minorities within their respective mandates, as seen in the recent report 
of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session 
(A/66/290). In his report, the Special Rapporteur pointed out that the strategic response to 
expressions deemed as offensive or intolerant was more speech that educates about cultural 
differences; that promotes diversity and understanding; more speech to empower and give 
voice to minorities, for example, through the support of community media and their 
representation in mainstream media. Expressions of opinion and dissent, religion and belief, 
including by persons belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups, should never be subject 
to restrictions.  
</p>
<p>86. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/40), the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance addressed the human rights situation of Roma. In his report, the Special 
Rapporteur aimed to show that, despite the wide range of measures taken by States to 
eliminate racism and racial discrimination against Roma, the Roma continued to be </p>


<p>discriminated against in a number of areas. The Special Rapporteur also analysed the 
situation of low-caste peoples, who they generally suffer from multiple forms of 
discrimination on account of race, religious belief, descent and occupation.  
</p>
<p>87.  In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its eighteenth session 
(A/HRC/18/44), the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance  noted positively the adoption of 
national action plans and policies to combat racism and to promote the social integration of 
individuals belonging to minorities. He expressed concern about extremist political parties 
and movements and their ability to blame specific groups of individuals for the insecurity 
and socio-economic problems experienced by the population. The information received by 
the Special Rapporteur seemed to show that vulnerable groups of individuals, such as 
members of minorities, Roma and Sinti, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, continued 
to be the main victims of violence and attacks perpetrated or incited by extremist political 
parties, movements and groups, who also often regarded themselves as the only legitimate 
holders and guardians of the national identity of a given country. 
</p>
<p>88. In his report presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session (A/66/313), 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance pointed out that ethnic minorities and people of African 
descent remained particularly affected by a historical legacy, notably in the areas of health, 
housing, employment, education, administration of justice, as well as political 
representation and empowerment.  
</p>
<p>89. During an interactive dialogue between the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religious beliefs and the Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session, the mandate holder 
declared  that religious instruction in the public school system should always go hand in 
hand with specific safeguards to protect members of religious or belief minorities, with a 
minimum requirement that members of minorities should have the possibility of opting out 
of religious instruction that went against their own convictions.  
</p>
<p>90. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/33), the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants affirmed that the political participation of 
ethnic and racial minorities represented an issue of special concern.  
</p>
<p>91. Some thematic mandate holders also addressed the rights of minorities during their 
country visits. In her report on her mission to Ireland from 10 to 15 January 2011 
(A/HRC/17/34/Add.2), the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty stressed that reductions to disability services, community and voluntary services, 
and Traveller supports, as well as cuts to social protection, all had the potential to impede 
the delivery of essential services to the most vulnerable. The independent expert urged 
Ireland to develop, with the meaningful participation of the Traveller community, a new 
national Traveller health strategy in order to support the Traveller community&#8217;s enjoyment 
of the right to health on equal footing with the rest of Irish society.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>92. Other thematic mandate holders issued joint statements to express concern about 
particular situations affecting minorities. Expressing their outrage and condemning in the 
strongest terms the ambush and killing on 2 March 2011 of  Shahbaz Bhatti, several 
mandate holders issued a statement in which they highlighted that this was not only an 
attack on an individual but also on the rights of all religious minorities and on human rights 
in Pakistan. They added that the shocking assassination of Mr. Bhatti would spark fear in 
all those belonging to minorities in Pakistan, and that the Government must respond in the 
strongest terms possible to protect them, in both law and practice.  
</p>
<p>93.  On 5 August 2011, the independent expert on minority issues<b> </b>and the<b> </b>Special 
Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context issued a press </p>


<p>release wherein they urged the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to 
find a negotiated settlement to the eviction stand-off with 86 Irish Traveller families. They<b> 
</b>called on the Government of the United Kingdom to find a peaceful and appropriate 
solution, and adequate alternative housing for the Traveller families faced with forced 
eviction from Dale Farm, Essex, before the end of August. More than 300 people, a third of 
the Dale Farm Traveller community, including 110 children, were facing the imminent 
threat of forced eviction. On 19 October 2011, the forced eviction took place in a context of 
violence.  
</p>
<p>94.  On 1 November 2011, a group of special procedures mandate holders, including the 
independent expert on minority issues, voiced grave concern over reports of heavy security 
measures in and around the area of the Tibetan Buddhist Kirti monastery, which houses 
some 2,500 monks, and other monasteries in Aba County, an area of Sichuan province 
inhabited by many ethnic Tibetans in south-west China. The mandate holders also called on 
the Chinese authorities to respect fully and uphold the rights of minorities, including their 
rights to freely practice their religion and culture. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>95. At its sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth sessions, the Human Rights Council 
adopted the reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on various 
countries. 
</p>
<p>96. Issues concerning minorities were raised, and recommendations included, inter alia, 
the adoption of concrete measures to avoid discrimination, exclusion and marginalization and 
to protect the rights of minorities and eliminate discrimination against religious minorities; 
effective measures to increase the political participation of minorities, including in public 
administration, and the participation of minorities in cultural, social and economic life; the 
participation of minority women; and the adoption of measures to guarantee the rights of 
minorities to education in their own language and to have equal access to quality education. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The present report reflects the important developments evident in the 
implementation of article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights, article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minorities, and with regard to the promotion and protection of minority rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>general. The findings of human rights mechanisms, however, show the numerous 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges and obstacles that impede full implementation. The international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community must recognize that the protection of minority rights is not only a human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights imperative but constitutes a key element in conflict prevention. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>remove obstacles to the establishment of conditions for the expression and promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the identity of minorities and ensure that such conditions are in line with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on Minorities and other key international standards</b>. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the 
Declaration on Minorities in 2012 will provide an opportunity to draw attention to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of the Declaration while assessing challenges and obstacles to its 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation, and to identify effective practices for implementation of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</b>
