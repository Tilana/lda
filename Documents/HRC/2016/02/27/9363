</p>
<p><b>Executive summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited the Republic of Equatorial Guinea 
from 8 to 13 July 2007, at the invitation of the Government. The visit included the capital, 
Malabo, located on Bioko Island, and the cities of Bata and Evinayong, on the mainland. The 
Working Group held meetings with the country&#8217;s highest authorities, including the 
Prime Minister, the Presidents of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court and members 
of those bodies, the Minister of National Defence and the Governor of Centro-Sur Province. 
Meetings were also held with representatives of civil society, criminal lawyers, former detainees 
and the families of people in detention. 
</p>
<p> The report gives an account of the Working Group&#8217;s visits to Malabo central prison, 
known as &#8220;Black Beach&#8221;, to the prisons of Bata and Evinayong, and to the cells of the 
Malabo police headquarters and the Bata police station and <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i>. The Working Group 
was able to interview, in private and without witnesses, approximately 200 detainees. 
</p>
<p> The report describes the country&#8217;s institutional and legal framework, referring in particular 
to the legal framework for detention as part of the criminal justice process. Noteworthy among 
the positive aspects were the cooperation extended to the Working Group by the Government 
and its commitment to ensure that the criminal justice system meets international human rights 
standards, as well as the enactment on 2 November 2006 of Act No. 6/2006 on the prevention 
and penalization of torture, and of the Organization Act on the Judicial Service Council, 
notwithstanding the fact that, in the opinion of the Working Group, that law does not go far 
enough to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. The improvement of infrastructure at 
prisons and police stations is also worthy of note, in particular at Malabo central prison, as is the 
work being done in the prisons by the National Human Rights Commission, and the initiatives 
taken in relation with legal training and human rights. 
</p>
<p> Areas of concern identified by the Working Group include the fact that laws and 
regulations inherited from the colonial era and dating back to the Franco dictatorship in 
Spain are still in effect and enforced, among them the Criminal Code, the Criminal 
Procedure Act and the Code of Military Justice, which contain principles and standards 
incompatible with the 1995 Constitution and international instruments. It is also noteworthy that 
Organization Act No. 4/2002 on the legal status of the judiciary does not provide sufficient 
guarantees for the independence of the judiciary or of judges and law officers, and that the police 
and the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i>, which often carry out arbitrary arrests and detentions, have excessive 
powers. 
</p>
<p> The report also notes the excessive power of the armed forces which effectively control the 
prisons, carry out arrests, and exercise military jurisdiction over civilians. Secret detentions and 
the abduction of opposition politicians in neighbouring countries are of particular concern. The 
report describes cases of people detained for merely exercising their political rights; it looks into 
the detention of illegal immigrants at police stations, notes the absence of effective defence 
rights and limitations on legal aid, refers to the physical conditions of detention as a contributing 
factor to the lack of adequate defence and cites the lack of an effective registration system at 
prisons and police stations.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> The report concludes that the country cannot truly develop unless the current economic 
growth is accompanied by institution-building, the application of the rule of law and the genuine 
exercise of human rights. The Working Group presents 13 recommendations for the Government 
of Equatorial Guinea, emphasizing the urgent need to overhaul the country&#8217;s legal framework in 
order to bring it into line with the 1995 Constitution and international instruments; to provide 
legal guarantees for the independence of the judiciary; to amend the current laws governing 
habeas corpus, <i>amparo</i> and constitutional review; to strengthen the National Human Rights 
Commission and civil society organizations; and to establish a modern juvenile court system. 
The Working Group also recommends avoiding incommunicado detention of illegal immigrants 
and facilitating consular access; immediately halting the practice of secret detention; and 
resolving the status of persons deprived of their liberty for merely exercising a right. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was extended for three 
years by Human Rights Council resolution 6/4 of 29 September 2007, visited the Republic of 
Equatorial Guinea from 8 to 13 July 2007 at the invitation of the Government. The delegation 
was composed of Manuela Carmena Castrillo (Spain) and Soledad Villagra de Biedermann 
(Paraguay), the Secretary of the Working Group, another official from the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and two interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group expresses its gratitude to the Government of Equatorial Guinea and 
the representatives of civil society with whom it met during its visit for their cooperation. The 
Working Group enjoyed the cooperation of the central Government and the provincial and local 
authorities, in a context of collaboration and transparency. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The visit included the capital, Malabo, located on Bioko Island, and the cities of Bata and 
Evinayong, on the mainland. The Working Group held meetings with the Prime Minister, the 
Presidents of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court and members of those bodies, the 
Vice-Prime Minister responsible for human rights, the Minister of National Defence and senior 
officials of the Ministry of National Security, including the Director and the Assistant Director of 
National Security, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Director of the Penitentiaries 
Service, the Vice-Chairperson and two members of the National Human Rights Commission, the 
Governor of Centro-Sur Province in Evinayong, the wardens of Malabo central prison (known as 
&#8220;Black Beach&#8221;) and the prisons of Bata and Evinayong, and military and police authorities in 
Bata. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group also held meetings with representatives of United Nations agencies in 
Malabo, representatives of the country&#8217;s civil society, defence attorneys specialized in criminal 
law, former detainees and the families of people in detention. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group visited Malabo central prison (&#8220;Black Beach&#8221;), Bata prison, 
Evinayong prison and the cells of the Malabo police headquarters and the Bata police station and 
<i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i>. It was able to hold private interviews with approximately 200 detainees at those 
facilities, without the presence of witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional and political framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Political system 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is a young country which declared its independence 
on 12 October 1968 and whose Constitution was adopted on 17 January 1995. Thus, while the 
Constitution establishes that Equatorial Guinea is a sovereign, independent, republican, unitary, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>social and democratic State which recognizes political pluralism (art. 1), its legal framework is 
still not sufficiently developed: new laws which have been shaped in accordance with the spirit 
and principles of the Constitution coexist with the Spanish law that was in force during the 
dictatorship of General Franco. 
</p>
<p>7. Many of the enactments that make up the legal order in Equatorial Guinea date back to 
before independence and were declared applicable by Decree No. 4/80 of 3 April 1980. These 
laws were in force in Spain prior to 1968. Moreover, they have not been harmonized with other 
enactments which, though unsystematized, remain in force, such as the Code of Military Justice 
of 17 July 1945, and no consideration has been given to whether they are compatible with the 
current Constitution and the laws adopted since 1995. 
</p>
<p>8. Article 1 of the Constitution also establishes that the supreme values of Equatorial Guinea 
are unity, peace, justice, freedom and equality. Respect for the human person, for human dignity 
and freedom and other fundamental rights are among the principles that govern the country&#8217;s 
society (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>9. In the Preamble to the Constitution and in article 8, the State reaffirms its commitment to 
the principles of international law and to the rights and obligations that stem from the various 
international instruments governing the international organizations of which Equatorial Guinea is 
a member. 
</p>
<p>10. The legislative branch consists of a unicameral parliament, the House of Representatives of 
the People, whose 80 members are directly elected by universal suffrage for a period of five 
years. The executive branch is headed by a Prime Minister, who is the leader of the majority 
party in the House and who is appointed by the President. The body responsible for 
implementing national policy, which is determined by the President, is the Council of Ministers. 
</p>
<p>11. The President is the Head of State, and personifies the nation. He is elected for a period of 
seven years by direct universal suffrage. The President exercises the power to govern through the 
Council of Ministers. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>12. Article 83 of the Constitution provides that the judiciary shall exercise the judicial power 
of the State and shall be independent of the legislative and executive branches. Article 86 states 
that the Head of State shall be the first magistrate of the nation and shall guarantee the 
independence of the judiciary. The members of the Supreme Court are appointed by the 
President for a period of five years. Professional judges and officials of the justice system are 
appointed and dismissed in accordance with procedures laid down by law (Constitution, art. 91). 
</p>
<p>13. The structure, functioning and legal status of the Higher Council of Justice are governed by 
Organization Act No. 4/2002 of 23 May 2002. Article 6 of the Act establishes that the Council 
shall oversee the competitive procedure for the selection, promotion and induction of law 
officers and judges, but this has not yet been put into effect. Article 2 of the Act specifies that the 
Council shall be chaired by the Head of State. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>14. Act No. 3/1984 of 20 June 1984 on the jurisdiction of courts and judges merely establishes 
the various classes of courts and tribunals and their respective jurisdictions. 
</p><p>15. The criminal justice system is composed of tribunals at different levels: local courts, 
investigating judges of first instance, territorial high courts and the Supreme Court. 
16. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial body for all jurisdictions and is competent to 
hear appeals on points of law against final rulings handed down by the criminal divisions of the 
territorial high courts. 
</p>
<p>17. The Constitutional Court was established to guarantee constitutional principles, standards 
and laws. It is composed of a president and four members appointed by the President of the 
Republic, two of whom are nominated by the House of Representatives of the People. Its main 
function is to review the constitutionality of legislation. Constitutional challenges may be filed 
by the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General or the House of 
Representatives of the People, by a qualified majority vote. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
</b></p>
<p>18. The main function of the Office of the Attorney-General is to ensure strict compliance with 
the Constitution and with laws and other decrees and resolutions issued by State bodies at all 
levels: national, regional, provincial, municipal and local, relating both to citizens of the country 
and to resident foreigners (Constitution, art. 92). The Attorney-General and his deputies are 
appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic (art. 93). 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Military justice system 
</b>19. The Code of Military Justice was adopted in Spain on 17 July 1945, i.e., in the midst of the 
post-civil war era. It gives the military courts extremely broad jurisdiction over a long list of 
civilian offences, including national security offences, offences against the country&#8217;s territorial 
integrity and crimes of lese-majesty. 
20. Under this Code, extremely summary trials are conducted, in which the defence attorney 
may be either a military officer or an ordinary lawyer. There is no possibility of appeal. As for 
non-military offences, i.e., criminal offences covered by the ordinary law, article 257 of the 
Code of Military Justice provides that the Criminal Code (adopted on 28 March 1963) must be 
applied both to members of the military and to civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  National Police and <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> 
</b></p>
<p>21. The National Police have jurisdiction in the cities, and the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> has jurisdiction in 
rural areas. Both are under the authority of the Ministry of National Security. This division of 
functions has developed in practice and is not based on any legal provision. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>22. There is no specific law governing the penitentiary system. There are five main prisons. 
There are no women&#8217;s prisons, reformatories or juvenile custodial institutions, nor are there any 
military prisons. Despite coming under the authority of the Ministry of National Security, the 
prisons are in fact run by the military. 
</p>
<p>23. The former Spanish Criminal Procedure Act, which is applied pursuant to Decree-Law 
No. 4/1980 of 3 April 1980, sets out a series of general principles governing the penitentiary 
system. According to this Decree-Law, the Spanish Prison Regulations adopted by decree 
on 2 February 1956 are applicable in Equatorial Guinea. 
</p>
<p>24. Article 520 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that the treatment of a prisoner, 
whether convicted or in pretrial detention, must occasion the least possible suffering for the 
person in question and for his or her reputation. It also defines possible restrictions on freedoms 
and communications, and stipulates that prisoners must be separated according to sex, age, 
education and criminal record. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal framework for detention under criminal justice procedures 
1.  Obligations under international human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea has ratified seven of the main United Nations human 
rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its 
Optional Protocol and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. With 
regard to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, to which Equatorial Guinea acceded on 9 August 2002, the State party entered a 
reservation concerning the competence of the Committee against Torture. As noted above, 
article 8 of the Constitution establishes that the State shall observe the rights and obligations 
deriving from the international instruments to which it is party. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Constitutional guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>26. Article 13 of the Constitution establishes the rights and freedoms of citizens. It provides 
inter alia that individuals may be deprived of their liberty only by means of a judicial warrant, 
except in cases established by law or flagrante delicto cases. Every prisoner must be informed of 
the reasons and grounds for his or her detention. The presumption of innocence is recognized 
until guilt is proven in judicial proceedings. Any sentencing must take place subsequent to a trial. 
The rights to a defence attorney and to legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings are also 
recognized. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Criminal procedure 
</b></p>
<p>27. The main features of the legal framework for detention are described in the Spanish 
Criminal Procedure Act of 14 September 1882, applied in Equatorial Guinea pursuant to 
Decree-Law No. 4/1980 of 3 April 1980. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>28. Any person is authorized to detain another in cases of flagrante delicto. Soldiers often 
arrest and detain people, despite the fact that they are not specifically authorized to do so unless 
the person is caught in the act of committing an offence. Arrests are often carried out by 
members of the police, generally acting under the orders of the civil authorities (provincial 
governors, Government representatives and army officers). Most arrests are carried out without 
production of an arrest warrant. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Judicial police 
</b></p>
<p>29. Article 282 of the Criminal Procedure Act assigns to the judicial police the task of 
investigating offences committed in its territory or jurisdiction and of carrying out the necessary 
inquiries to ascertain who the perpetrators are. 
</p>
<p>30. Under article 492, the police shall, and must, detain any person who is in the act of 
committing an offence or fleeing, who is under trial or sentenced, and persons who are suspected 
by the police themselves of being the perpetrators of offences. Article 496 of the Criminal 
Procedure Act further establishes the obligation of the police, within 24 hours after an arrest, 
either to release the person in detention or to bring him/her before a competent judge. In Spain, 
during the period when the Criminal Procedure Act was in force, this 24-hour period was 
extended to 72 hours under what was then Spain&#8217;s Fundamental Law, known as the &#8220;<i>Ley del 
Fuero de los Espa&#241;oles</i>&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Lex fori</i> of the Spanish people&#8221;). 
31. The Constitution of Equatorial Guinea makes no mention of a maximum period of police 
detention, although Act No. 4/2002 of 23 May 2002, which established the police courts, 
provides in article 4, paragraph 1, that &#8220;once the 72 hours have elapsed, if the police 
investigation has not been completed, the police authority shall bring the detainee before the 
courts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Habeas corpus 
</b></p>
<p>32. Habeas corpus proceedings are governed by Act No. 18/1995 of 11 October 1995. Persons 
who consider that they are being unjustly detained must have access to a judge, who should 
normally be the investigating judge of first instance for the place of detention. The judge must 
rule without delay whether the detention is legal. 
</p>
<p>33. Article 3 of the Act lists the cases in which it must be considered that the detention is 
illegal, for example when guarantees have not been respected, or established procedures have not 
been followed, when the person has been illegally held in an unauthorized facility, or when the 
maximum period of detention has been exceeded without the detainee having access to a judge. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Investigating judge 
</b>34. The investigating judge must see persons detained by the police within a maximum 
of 72 hours. He must decide in the following 72 hours on the detainee&#8217;s release, pretrial 
detention or release on bail (Criminal Procedure Act, art. 497). The investigating judge has </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>sole competence to order pretrial detention. To facilitate the proper discharge of this duty, 
Organization Act No. 4/2002 of 20 May 2002 established police courts, which must operate on a 
round-the-clock basis, 365 days a year. 
</p>
<p>35. Police courts are responsible for receiving persons detained by the police. Under article 3 
of Act No. 4/2002, a warrant is required for deprivation of liberty in all but flagrante delicto 
cases. The investigating judge&#8217;s decision is appealable, under article 518 of the Criminal 
Procedure Act. Appeals can be made either by the detainee or by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
before the criminal division of the territorial high court. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Cases in which pretrial detention may be authorized, and its duration 
</b>36. Pretrial detention may be ordered solely by the investigating judge, and only in specific 
circumstances, in particular for offences punishable by more serious penalties than correctional 
detention (<i>prisi&#243;n reformatoria</i>) (Criminal Procedure Act, art. 503). Correctional detention is a 
sentence of between six months and six years, and is the lightest sentence provided for in the 
Spanish Criminal Code of 28 March 1963. In exceptional cases, pretrial detention may be 
ordered even where the sentence does not exceed six years, when the detainee has a criminal 
record or when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that he will not appear before the judicial 
authority when summoned to do so. Detainees must be released as soon as their innocence has 
been proven (Criminal Procedure Act, art. 528). 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Solitary confinement during pretrial detention 
</b>37. Under article 506 of the Criminal Procedure Act, solitary confinement may be ordered 
during pretrial detention, but its duration must be restricted &#8220;to the time that is absolutely 
necessary for carrying out the investigations into the offence&#8221;. As a general rule, the maximum 
time provided for is five days. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the pretrial proceedings the role played by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is limited 
to that of prosecuting party (or one of the prosecuting parties, since there may also be a private 
prosecuting party); the Office is not involved in the investigating judge&#8217;s decision to order 
pretrial detention. Its role of defining offences and leading the prosecution is only relevant 
during the trial itself, in accordance with article 649 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Criminal proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>39. Proceedings are conducted in the court of first instance or the criminal division of the 
territorial high court, depending on the offences charged. Courts of first instance deal with wilful 
wrongdoing of a less serious and flagrant nature (Act No. 3/1984 of 20 June 1984 on the 
competence of tribunals and courts, art. 12). The criminal division of the territorial high court 
tries all other offences, subject to the exceptions provided for in the Criminal Procedure Act in 
which competence is granted to other courts (for example, criminal cases against members of the 
Government, and other authorities, which must be tried by the Supreme Court). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>40. Prosecution functions are exercised by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the private 
prosecuting party. The accused person must always be assisted by defence counsel. Minor 
offences are tried by local courts and, in these cases, there is no need for defence counsel. 
Sentences handed down by local courts in proceedings for minor offences are appealable to 
courts of first instance. Sentences handed down by courts of first instance are appealable to the 
criminal division of the territorial high court. Sentences handed down by the criminal division of 
the territorial high court are appealable on points of law to the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p><b>9.  Access to legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>41. Under article 13, paragraph (r) of the Constitution, all citizens have the right of defence at 
all stages of the proceedings. However, the Criminal Procedure Act provides that the presence of 
a lawyer is required only during the oral proceedings. Article 652 of the Criminal Procedure Act 
provides that, once the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has made the case for the prosecution, the 
courts shall provide a defence lawyer to accused persons who do not have one. 
</p>
<p>42. There is no specific legal requirement concerning free legal assistance. This is provided in 
practice through the official appointment of defence lawyers by bar associations. 
</p>
<p><b>10.  Detention of minors and juvenile justice 
</b>43. Under the former Spanish Criminal Code of 1963, which is in force in Equatorial Guinea, 
the minimum age of criminal responsibility is 16 years. Although the Code provides for 
extenuating circumstances for persons aged between 16 and 18, no specific provisions exist 
regarding their detention, including pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>44. Decree-Law No. 4/1980 refers to the <i>Tribunal Tutelar de Menores</i> (minors&#8217; court) 
established by the Spanish law of 11 June 1948. In Spain this court was responsible for trying 
offences committed by minors aged under 16. However, the Working Group has no evidence 
that this minors&#8217; court is in operation in Equatorial Guinea. There are no special courts for 
minors. Minors who commit less serious offences are usually taken to police stations, where they 
sometimes spend several days or weeks and are then handed back to their families, sometimes on 
the condition of carrying out community work. Minors who commit serious offences are sent to 
prisons for adults if they have reached the age of criminal responsibility - 16 years. 
</p>
<p><b>11.  Detention of foreigners 
</b></p>
<p>45. There are no legal provisions covering persons who enter the country illegally or remain 
after their entry visa has expired. Nor is the detention or holding of foreigners provided for in 
law. Equatorial Guinea requires an entry visa for all foreign nationals other than citizens of the 
United States of America. 
</p>
<p>46. The police routinely carry out raids and checks on city streets and highways, with the aim 
of identifying and detaining foreign nationals who have entered the country without the 
necessary visa, or who have remained in the country illegally after their visas have expired. 
Undocumented foreigners detained by the police are held indefinitely in police station cells, 
pending expulsion. </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Cooperation of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Working Group benefited from the Government&#8217;s cooperation during its visit. The 
Group was able to inspect the detention centres it had requested prior authorization to visit. It 
was able to hold private meetings in these facilities with all the detainees it wished to speak to, 
without the presence of witnesses. 
</p>
<p>48. The only exception occurred towards the end of its inspection of Black Beach prison in 
Malabo. In response to the Working Group&#8217;s well-founded suspicion that Juan Ondo Abaga, 
Felipe Esono Ntutumu, Florencio Ela Bibang and Antimo Edu Nchama - who had been 
kidnapped in other countries and brought to Equatorial Guinea - might be being kept in one of 
the prison&#8217;s old wings separate from the ones already visited, and the Group&#8217;s request to visit the 
wing in order to speak to those persons, the Group was forced to terminate its visit and leave the 
prison. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Commitment to meet international human rights 
standards in the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  New legislation and accession to international instruments 
</b></p>
<p>49. Following the promulgation of its first Constitution, Equatorial Guinea made various 
changes to the legal system it had inherited from the colonial era, which have had positive effects 
for the democratic functioning of the State and for the protection of the individual and collective 
rights of citizens. In recent years the Government has acceded to the main international human 
rights instruments, thus sending out a clear sign of its political commitment to ensuring the 
observance of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>50. Especially positive is the promulgation of Act No. 6/2006 on the prevention and 
penalization of torture, on 2 November 2006, and the Organization Act on the Judicial Service 
Council, despite the fact that it does not sufficiently guarantee the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>51. Given the historical background of this young country, Act No. 6/2006 on the prevention 
and penalization of torture is of particular significance for the proper conduct of criminal 
procedure. The articles of the Act explicitly state that the practice of torture is prohibited and 
define as torture those acts carried out by police officers, in the course of their duties, that cause 
a person physical or mental pain or suffering, with the aim of investigating an offence or 
obtaining information or a confession from the person tortured. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Improving the infrastructure of prisons and police stations 
</b></p>
<p>52. In addition, as a result of the recent discovery of oil reserves, the Government is now able 
to assign sufficient resources to improving the infrastructure of prisons and places of detention. 
In this connection, the process of improving the physical infrastructure of prisons and reforming 
internment institutions has already begun, and training programmes for prison and police 
authorities and officers have been introduced. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>53. A number of prisons have been rehabilitated or are in the process of being built. Malabo 
central prison has been rehabilitated and a new central wing has been built with the necessary 
hygiene and sanitation facilities. In Bata, a new building is being built to replace the current 
central prison, as is a new central police station. There is also a plan to build a new prison in 
Evinayong to replace the current prison. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Work of the National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>54. Another positive development is the work of the National Human Rights Commission, 
which made visits to the country&#8217;s prisons and police stations, including the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i>, in 
February and September 2006. The conclusions of its first inspection tour were published 
in 2006 in a report, which contains reliable, serious and critical information together with 
specific recommendations aimed at improving the situation in prisons and detention centres. 
Another inspection was carried out in March 2007. 
</p>
<p>55. The National Human Rights Commission had no major difficulty in visiting prisons and 
police detention centres in Malabo, Baney and Luba (Bioko Island) and Bata, Evinayong, 
Akurenam, Akonibe, Nsok, Mongomo, A&#241;isok, Nsok-Nsomo, Ebebiyin, Micomiseng, Niefang, 
Mbini and Kogo (mainland). It was particularly successful in reminding local authorities of the 
limits to their powers of arrest and detention of citizens. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Initiatives in legal and human rights training 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Working Group was informed that human rights training courses for police authorities 
and officials are being organized in cooperation with the European Union. The Government 
informed the Working Group of its intention to introduce human rights courses in school 
curricula. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group was also informed of the establishment of the country&#8217;s first law 
faculty, which it is hoped will increase the number of jurists able to join the judiciary, the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the legal profession. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legal standards incompatible with international standards 
</b></p>
<p>58. While the promulgation of the Constitution in 1995 and the accession to the main human 
rights instruments are of considerable importance, it should be noted that the country&#8217;s criminal 
legislation is still essentially the same as that inherited from the colonial era. At the time of 
independence in Equatorial Guinea, the legal standards in force were those of General Franco&#8217;s 
dictatorship. The Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Act, the Code of Military Justice and 
other basic laws relating to detention that are in force today in Equatorial Guinea contain 
principles and standards that are undemocratic and incompatible with the rule of law. A great 
many of these standards run counter to the principles and standards of the Constitution and the 
international instruments to which Equatorial Guinea is a party. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Lack of independence of the judiciary 
</b>59. The Working Group observed that Organization Act No. 4/2002 on the legal status of the 
judiciary does not sufficiently guarantee the independence of judges and law officers. Crucial to 
the independence of the judiciary are both the manner in which judges and magistrates are 
appointed, and their irremovability. Article 6 of the above-mentioned Organization Act provides 
that &#8220;rules shall be established regarding the competitive procedure for the selection, promotion 
and induction of new judges under the terms of this Act&#8221;. The Organization Act does not 
guarantee independence in the appointment of judges or their irremovability. The way in which 
this independence and irremovability are to be guaranteed should be clearly defined in law. 
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group received information to the effect that, in practice, only those lawyers 
who share, or sympathize with, the ideas of the party currently in Government - the Democratic 
Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) - are elected as judges and law officers. Although it was 
impossible to confirm this, the legal provisions do not, in point of fact, guarantee the 
independence or irremovability of judges. The regulations referred to in the above-mentioned 
article 6 do not bridge this legal gap. The criteria on which public competitive examinations 
must be based, and the specific disciplinary sanctions that the Higher Council of Justice can 
impose on judges or law officers to dismiss or suspend them from office must be clearly 
established in law. The lack of such a legal provision means that there is no real independence of 
the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Excessive power of the police 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Working Group observed that both the police and the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> have, in practice, 
excessive powers and authority; this often leads to arbitrary arrests and detentions, which have 
no legal basis whatsoever. Frequently, authorities order arrests and detentions with no legal 
authorization, despite the provisions of Organization Act No. 4/2002 on police courts. Police and 
gendarmes interviewed by the Working Group also cited, as one reason for detention, the need to 
protect detainees from violence on the part of families or neighbours, or the need to punish them 
for acts that are not in themselves illegal.  
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group was also able to observe the general non-compliance with the rule that 
all detainees must be brought before a judicial authority within a maximum period of 72 hours, 
in order for the judge to decide on their release or continued detention. Detention beyond 
the 72-hour limit appears to be a common, widespread practice. The vast majority of the 
detainees interviewed by the Working Group in police stations and <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> offices in 
Malabo and Bata said that they had been held for more than four or five days, and some for over 
a month, without having been brought before the judicial authority. Others stated that they had 
been interviewed not by a judge, but by a court secretary. 
63. The Working Group was able to confirm the detention of persons who stated that they 
were being held because of disputes with relatives or neighbours, or simply owing to civil debts. 
In other cases, arrests of a purely arbitrary nature had been carried out on the basis of an order by 
higher authorities. When police superintendents were asked about this, they stated that the 
detentions had been carried out on the &#8220;orders of a superior&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>64. In none of the cases had detainees filed for habeas corpus as a remedy against their 
arbitrary detention. A number of lawyers who had used this remedy stated that in general it was 
not effective. 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group has the impression that many local, military and police authorities 
consider their powers to include ordering and carrying out the arrest and detention of citizens. At 
no time has any authority, agent or other person responsible for arrests or arbitrary detentions 
ever incurred an administrative or criminal penalty. This means that they enjoy total impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Excessive power of the military 
</b></p>
<p>66. The armed forces have effective control over prisons, which were built inside military 
compounds. Black Beach prison is located inside a former military compound and Bata central 
prison is also located inside an army compound. This results in countless difficulties, particularly 
with regard to access to prisoners. Families wishing to visit a prisoner must first apply to the 
military authorities for access to the military camp. 
</p>
<p>67. According to information received, soldiers often make arrests and detentions, despite not 
having the legal powers to do so. They often set up road checkpoints, especially at the entrance 
to cities, and demand payment of a sum of money for passage. Those who refuse to pay these 
illegal charges are often beaten and arrested. 
</p>
<p>68. There are no legal channels through which persons detained by military authorities can 
claim their rights. Civilians are sometimes tried by military courts. The Working Group has 
previously expressed its views on the nature of military courts, calling into question their 
independence. Accused individuals are not able to meet the costs of their defence, and must use 
the services of officially appointed lawyers, most of whom are army officials and do not provide 
an effective defence. Judges and defenders in military courts are not lawyers or jurists, but 
military officials with no legal training. Frequently, civilians are subjected to summary trials and 
are convicted without having been afforded the guarantees of a fair trial. Nor do they have the 
right to appeal their convictions to a higher court. There is no service of judgements and 
convicted persons cannot obtain a copy thereof. Some persons have only learned of their 
sentences from State radio. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Working Group is particularly concerned by the practice of secret detention. It 
has received information about the kidnapping by Government agents of nationals of 
Equatorial Guinea, who are taken from neighbouring countries to Malabo and held in secret 
detention there. In some cases the authorities have not acknowledged that the persons in question 
are being held in detention, which means that technically they are considered to be missing. This 
is the case for the following four individuals: Juan Ondo Abaga, Felipe Esono Ntutumu, 
Florencio Ela Bibang and Antimo Edu Nchama, who could not be interviewed by the Working 
Group at Black Beach, and who were kept in a separate wing of the prison, according to a letter 
they sent to the Working Group. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>70. According to the complaints received, these four individuals were transferred to 
Equatorial Guinea in a military aircraft and imprisoned in Black Beach. They had official 
refugee status in the countries where they were living. They were kidnapped and subsequently 
detained without the benefit of any legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group also interviewed four other persons who were detained in secret 
for 18 months before being transferred to Bata. During their secret detention, they wore 
handcuffs and leg irons, the marks of which the Working Group was able to observe directly. 
</p>
<p>72. These persons were part of a group of five exiles who were arrested in Libreville 
on 3 June 2004 by members of the Gabonese security forces for their alleged participation in the 
incidents that took place on the island of Corisco in 2004. Ten days after they were apprehended, 
they were handed over to security officials of Equatorial Guinea and transported in secret to 
Malabo. No formal extradition proceedings were observed. For one and a half years they were 
held incommunicado and underwent torture. In 2006, Carmelo Ncogo Mitogo, Jes&#250;s Mich&#225; 
Mich&#225;, Juan Bestue Santander and Juan Mar&#237;a Itutu M&#233;ndez were accused of rebellion, but they 
have not yet been tried. Their defence lawyer has had difficulties meeting with them since he 
saw them on the day they were formally charged. Salvador Ndong Nguema was not charged and 
was released as a result of a presidential pardon. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Lack of an effective defence 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Working Group has observed that the lawyers in criminal proceedings do not provide 
a genuine and effective defence. Recruiting the services of a lawyer is possible only for those 
with sufficient economic resources, as there is no effective system of court-appointed 
representation for all the detainees who require such representation. Furthermore, there is a real 
lack of lawyers in the country, especially outside the cities of Bata and Malabo. Many lawyers 
are also public officials or engage in other remunerated activities. A system of court-appointed 
representation is only available to accused persons formally summoned to appear in court, which 
is likewise very unsatisfactory. The lack of available lawyers to take on court-appointed defence 
cases tends to delay the start of trials.  
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group was informed of the serious difficulties faced by lawyers in defending 
their clients. Lawyers do not have access to police stations, nor can they contact detainees while 
they are held there. The police superintendents interviewed said that they did not see the need for 
or the advisability of such access. If the charges relate to offences of a political nature, the 
difficulties are even greater. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Persons detained for exercising their political rights 
</b></p>
<p>75. During its visit, the Working Group was able to ascertain that a number of detainees are in 
prison for exercising their political rights. These persons are generally accused of having 
committed crimes against the State or offences against the President of the Republic, as defined 
in the Spanish Criminal Code of the colonial era. Some of them are serving particularly long 
sentences, having been convicted by military courts without the guarantees of due process. In 
some cases detainees were tried summarily, without the right to appeal their sentences. 
Non-governmental sources informed the Working Group that about 100 individuals are currently 
in detention for offences relating to the exercise of political rights. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>76. The Working Group also received information relating to the detention for short periods of 
political activists, mainly members of the opposition party, the Convergence Party for Social 
Democracy (CPDS), or the People&#8217;s Union (UP). Other individuals are in detention merely for 
exercising their rights to freedom of opinion, expression, assembly and association, principally in 
rural areas or towns on the mainland. These individuals are detained for short periods in police 
stations or in the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i>, sometimes for up to three or four days, without being formally 
charged. They are generally released after being forced to pay a fine. In other cases, detainees 
have been deprived of their liberty for committing politically-motivated violent acts. 
</p>
<p>77. In the current situation, the number of detentions and prosecutions for merely exercising 
political rights appears to have decreased. As a result of the broad discretion and impunity with 
which the authorities are acting and the fact that the old Spanish Criminal Code is in force and 
applied, that code continues to be used contrary to the Constitution in force and international 
human rights instruments, principally with regard to specific rights, such as freedom of opinion 
and expression, association, assembly and political participation. 
</p>
<p>78. On 8 May 2004, 10 members of the Convergence Party for Social Democracy (CPDS) 
were arrested at Malabo airport and detained for a week in police cells. 
</p>
<p>79. Antonio Eusebio Edu, a 75-year-old member of the Convergence Party for Social 
Democracy (CPDS), resident in Nsok-Nsomo, was arrested for refusing to clean a road in 
May 2006. He was detained for a short period and released after being forced to pay a fine. 
Carlos On&#225; Boriesa, Carmelo Iridi and eight other CPDS activists were arrested in April 2006 in 
Rebola, on the island of Bioko, while taking part in a party meeting. They were taken to Baney 
police station where they were subjected to 50 lashes. The following day they were released 
without charge.  
</p>
<p>80. Four members of the banned Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea (PPGE), Filom&#243;n Ond&#243;, 
Jos&#233; Antonio Nguema, Florencio Ond&#243; and Basilio May&#233;, were arrested in October 2006 in their 
respective homes without any judicial authorization. They were taken to Bata central police 
station and then to the central prison of that city. On 12 November 2006, the investigating judge 
of first instance ordered their immediate release without charge. 
</p>
<p>81. Secundino Boleko Brown was arrested on 28 March 2007 in Malabo. He had just returned 
to the capital city from Spain, where he had been living since 2000. He went voluntarily to the 
Malabo central police station when summoned, where he was unexpectedly accused of taking 
part in protests by members of the Bubi ethnic group in January 1998. Mr. Boleko Brown 
claimed that he had never been questioned, summoned, searched or charged in connection with 
those incidents. On 20 April 2007 he filed an application for habeas corpus with the 
first-instance investigating judge of Malabo. No decision was taken on the application. His 
lawyer was informed that the case would be transferred to a military court. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Foreigners 
</b></p>
<p>82. Despite the lack of any legal basis on which to detain illegal immigrants, the Working 
Group observed that they are systematically apprehended and detained, especially in police cells. 
Given the country&#8217;s recent economic growth, many workers and artisans from neighbouring </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>countries are migrating to Equatorial Guinea to seek better prospects. Many are apprehended by 
the police at roadblocks or during raids carried out by the police on city streets. They are usually 
victims of police corruption and can avoid detention by paying illegal bribes. 
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group was able to interview many immigrants in Malabo central police 
station who were awaiting deportation. Those who have difficulty proving their identity or their 
nationality, or those who come from distant countries, can remain in detention for an indefinite 
period while their situation is being clarified or until they can be deported. The Working Group 
found that the authorities do not provide the minimum conditions of detention as regards food 
and drinking water, sanitary conditions and hygiene. Detainees have to wait to receive food and 
medical aid from the city, which is extremely complicated or even impossible for foreigners with 
no contacts in the population. The Working Group noted the presence in the cells, among adults, 
of a 12-year-old Nigerian boy. 
</p>
<p>84. The Working Group mentions these circumstances because even deportation to 
neighbouring countries seems to be a very slow process. Many detainees stated that they would 
prefer to be returned immediately to their countries of origin rather than remain in detention 
trying to find a way to stay in Equatorial Guinea. The detainees have no way of accessing the 
outside world, or any possibility of appealing against the deportation order or the lawfulness of 
their detention. 
</p>
<p>85. The situation of detained illegal immigrants does not seem to be a priority for the 
Government, as was recognized by the Director General of National Security during his meeting 
with the Working Group. The Government, according to the Director General of National 
Security, has urgent priorities in the areas of health, work, education and infrastructure for its 
own citizens and it does not wish to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. 
</p>
<p>86. The number of areas for improvement faced by the current Government of 
Equatorial Guinea may explain the fact that the situation of detained illegal immigrants is not a 
priority. However, the dramatic situation noted by the Working Group obliges the Government 
to adopt immediate urgent measures to allow detainees to appeal against their detention and 
deportation and to prevent the serious violation of their human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Conditions of detention as a contributing factor  
to the lack of adequate defence 
</b></p>
<p>87. Even though, as mentioned above, the physical conditions of some prisons, such as 
Black Beach, have improved significantly and there are plans quickly to improve the conditions 
of others, the Working Group found that the old prisons of Bata and Evinayong do not meet the 
necessary minimum conditions of habitability. Of the 177 prisoners in Black Beach at the time 
of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, 124 were in pretrial detention. The situation is similar in other 
prisons in the country, with the exception of Evinayong prison, which held 11 prisoners at the 
time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit, all of them convicts. 
</p>
<p>88. The cells in the police stations of Malabo and Bata and the Bata <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> are proof, 
however, of an intolerable situation. When the Working Group visited the Malabo central police 
station, it observed that, for the most part, it is made up of mere huts which do not offer even </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>minimum hygiene or comfort. Its cells are packed, mainly with a large number of foreign 
immigrants in administrative detention. They are not even allowed, for security reasons, to go 
out into the communal courtyard. 
</p>
<p>89.  Unlike Malabo, almost no foreign citizens are being held in Bata police station. This 
police station has only one detention area: a small room in which, in total darkness and filth, 
some 40 detainees are crowded together. Not only are there no beds, cots or mattresses, there is 
not even enough space for all the detainees to lie down at the same time to sleep on the floor. 
Furthermore, there is no separation between men, women, children or adolescents. The Working 
Group spoke, in that cell, to a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old girl.  
</p>
<p>90.  Despite the fact that Equatorial Guinea has acceded to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, many of the detainees 
interviewed in the police stations and the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> reported that they had been tortured or 
ill-treated. The marks left by blows were visible on many of them. Torture and ill-treatment are 
widely practised and the guilty parties are never punished, so that they are able to act in a climate 
of impunity. There is no effective means of applying for redress for cases of torture, physical 
harassment or ill-treatment in prisons or police stations. Nor is there any possibility, in the 
prisons, of effectively lodging appeals to challenge punitive measures imposed by the prison 
authorities, such as the use of handcuffs, leg irons or chains, or confinement in punishment cells.  
</p>
<p>91.  The circumstances described seriously limit the detainees&#8217; defence options, an essential 
aspect of due process which is covered by the Working Group&#8217;s mandate. The situation of the 
detainees in police stations and the <i>Gendarmer&#237;a</i> is even worse in this respect, given that they are 
denied contact with the outside world.  
</p>
<p>92.  During its visit to Evinayong prison, the Working Group interviewed Felipe Ond&#243; Obiang, 
leader of the Republican Democratic Force (FDR) political party, and protestant pastor 
Bienvenido Samba Momesori. Felipe Ond&#243; Obiang was arrested in March 2002 along 
with 150 other people, including various members of his family, friends, FDR party members 
and sympathizers. The majority of them claimed to have been the victims of severe torture while 
they were in pretrial detention. They were accused of subversion, attempting to overthrow the 
Government, and rebellion, during an attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat which took place in 1997. They 
were prosecuted in May 2002 before a civil court, allegedly without the guarantees of due 
process. Felipe Ond&#243; Obiang was sentenced to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment. The Working Group 
observed the serious restrictions to which he is subjected in his prison life, which include being 
shackled every night to sleep.  
</p>
<p>93.  Reverend Bienvenido Samba Momesori, a member of the Bubi ethnic group from the 
island of Bioko, was prosecuted together with 110 other people in May 1998 in a summary trial 
before a military court that lasted only five days and failed to meet minimum guarantees of due 
process. He was sentenced to death. In September 1998, the President of the Republic commuted 
his sentence to 30 years&#8217; imprisonment. In October 2002, he obtained a presidential pardon and 
was released. However, he was rearrested on 26 October 2003 for failing to respect the 
conditions of the presidential pardon. He was transferred to Evinayong prison without his family 
being informed. He has been in solitary confinement several times.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>94.  Felipe Ond&#243; Obiang and Reverend Bienvenido Samba Momesori are 2 of the 11 people 
detained in Evinayong prison, but they are the only ones who are not allowed to leave the prison 
during the day to try to find work or additional food. 
</p>
<p>95.  The Working Group also interviewed in Black Beach four of the South Africans accused of 
working as mercenaries and of being involved in the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of March 2004. They 
claimed to have been severely tortured while in pretrial detention. The Working Group observed 
that they are forced to wear leg irons.  
</p>
<p>96.  The four South African nationals accused of being mercenaries had marks from the torture 
they have suffered on their hands, legs and feet. They are subjected to extremely harsh 
conditions of detention. Their food is limited to what they receive from the prison authorities 
because, unlike other prisoners, they do not have access to additional food from the city.  
</p>
<p><b>J.  Lack of a registration system 
</b></p>
<p>97.  The Working Group confirmed that there is no systematic registration of information 
relating to persons held in detention, covering such matters as the dates detainees enter and leave 
police stations; the names of the arresting officers; the names of the judicial authorities before 
which they appear and the corresponding dates; or the different authorities responsible for the 
detainees. Some police stations keep entry registers separate from books recording departures, as 
well as report books and incident logs, but there is no verifiable and effective registration system. 
At Evinayong prison the Working Group was informed that the registers were in the court. A 
registration system is essential for ascertaining a detainee&#8217;s situation at any point in time and, 
above all, for preventing the occurrence of cases of enforced disappearance and other serious 
violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98.  Equatorial Guinea has enormous potential for economic development. The discovery of 
large oil reserves points to the advent of an era of great economic prosperity in the near future. 
However, the Working Group confirmed, and it could not be otherwise given the recent history 
of the country, that institution-building is still limited and the human rights culture has not taken 
sufficient root in institutions, in public moral awareness, or in the attitudes of individual citizens. 
The Working Group considers that there cannot be true development in the country if the current 
economic growth does not go hand in hand with institution-building, the enforcement of the rule 
of law and the genuine exercise of human rights. 
</p>
<p>99.  The Working Group noted the progress made by the Government of Equatorial Guinea 
over the past few years towards providing the country with a legal framework, in conformity 
with the international instruments it has ratified, to enable it to develop into a democratic State. 
But this is not enough. There is a clear need to supplement this system as soon as possible, and at 
the same time to promote the determinants of balance between the different powers of the State, 
particularly the genuine independence of the judiciary. Only in this way would it be possible to 
prevent the continued occurrence of situations such as kidnapping abroad and secret detention, as 
referred to in this report, which belong to a past that is totally incompatible with the current 
positive process of change noted by the Working Group.  </p>

<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b>  On the basis of the situation encountered during its visit to the country and the 
conclusions set out above, the Working Group invites the Government of the Republic of 
Equatorial Guinea to consider and apply the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  To adopt the necessary measures to put an immediate end to the practice of 
secret detentions. The situation of Juan Ondo Abaga, Florencio Ela Bibang, 
Felipe Esono Ntumu and Antimo Edu Nchama, detained in secret in Black Beach prison, 
should be immediately remedied, as they were kidnapped in foreign countries where 
they had international refugee status;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  To resolve the situation of the deprivation of liberty of individuals detained for 
simply exercising a right recognized by international human rights law, such as the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the right of assembly, the right of association and 
political participation (the exercise of which rights cannot be punished);  
 (c)  To consider the desirability of an urgent revision of the national criminal law 
framework, to bring it into line with the 1995 Constitution and the international 
instruments to which Equatorial Guinea is a State party. The Working Group therefore 
invites the Government to consider drafting a new criminal code and a new code of 
criminal procedure in accordance with those instruments. The Criminal Code should 
establish sentences that correspond to the seriousness of the offences defined, and provide 
for the possibility of community service and alternatives to imprisonment. The possibility 
of establishing systems of restorative justice should also be examined. There is an urgent 
need for the periodic publication of laws in an official gazette; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  It is necessary to establish by law an independent judiciary. All the necessary 
measures should be taken to guarantee, in law and in practice, the independence of judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers, in accordance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of 
the Judiciary and the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the 
General Assembly in 1985 and 1990, respectively. In that connection, the possibility of 
revising the Judiciary Organization Act should be studied. The objective conditions in 
which competitive examinations for the appointment of judges and law officers are to be 
conducted shall be established by law, as shall the disciplinary measures to which they 
could be liable, in order to guarantee their independence and irremovability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e)  Judges and law officers should make periodic visits to prisons and police 
detention centres and the advisability of establishing criminal enforcement tribunals 
should be examined; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f)  The Working Group invites the Government to bring the legal framework for 
the organization, functioning and jurisdiction of military courts into line with international 
principles and standards. In that connection, the jurisdiction of military courts should be 
limited exclusively to military offences committed by armed forces personnel and they 
should have no jurisdiction to try civilians. Disputes as to the jurisdiction of military </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/4/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>courts, in particular with regard to appeals against detention, should be settled by civil 
courts. The need to draft and promulgate a modern code of military justice that is 
consistent with the Constitution and the international instruments in force should be 
considered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g)  Training for authorities, officials and police officers should continue. The 
training should aim to prevent human rights violations and abuses, and at the same time 
prevent and eradicate impunity. Human rights training courses should be extended to 
judges and law officers of all grades, members of the Office of the Attorney-General, 
lawyers, court-appointed defence counsel, regional and local authorities, and military 
officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h)  The current application procedures for habeas corpus, <i>amparo</i> and 
constitutional review should be revised and redesigned with a view to making them easier 
to use and more effective as remedies against violations of constitutional guarantees and 
human rights, and in particular against arbitrary detention. Lawyers should be guaranteed 
free access to police stations in order to be able to interview detainees from the beginning 
of their detention so that they can exercise these remedies. Likewise, lawyers&#8217; access to all 
prisons should be guaranteed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i)  The national budget should guarantee the resources required to ensure the 
effective functioning of the justice administration system as well as the prison and police 
detention system. The necessary resources should be made available to ensure the provision 
of sufficient and adequate food, medical care, sanitation facilities and minimum conditions 
of habitability for persons detained in prisons and police stations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j)  The authorities should take concrete steps and measures aimed at promoting, 
protecting and strengthening civil society institutions, in particular non-governmental 
organizations working in the field of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k)  The National Human Rights Commission should be strengthened and granted 
the facilities necessary to continue its visits to prisons and police detention centres; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l)  As far as possible, the detention of foreigners who enter the country without the 
necessary visa or who remain in the country once their visa has expired should be avoided. 
If the detention is necessary to ensure their expulsion from the country, a reasonable 
maximum duration of detention should be established. During their detention these 
persons should enjoy all the rights recognized to persons deprived of liberty by 
international instruments. The access of consular representatives to foreigners detained in 
prisons and police stations should be facilitated, and detainees should be able to 
communicate with their respective consulates. The situation of foreigners held in 
incommunicado detention should also be reviewed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m)  The possibility of establishing a modern juvenile justice system should be 
examined and the presence of minors in prisons and detention centres alongside adults 
should be prohibited.
