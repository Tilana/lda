</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> relevant provisions of declarations and programmes with regard to

meetings, inter alia, the Mar del Plata Action Plan on Water and Development and

</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/60), chap. I. 
</p>

<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> regional commitments and initiatives promoting the further 
realization of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation, including the Protocol on Water and Health, adopted by the Economic 
Commission for Europe in 1999, the European Charter on Water Resources, adopted by the 
Council of Europe in 2001, the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first Africa-South 
America summit in 2006, the message from Beppu, adopted at the first Asian-Pacific Water 
Summit in 2007, the Delhi Declaration, adopted at the third South Asian Conference on 
Sanitation in 2008, and the Sharm el-Sheikh Final Document, adopted at the Fifteenth 
Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned 
Countries in 2009,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve 
fully the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing, in that context, the resolve of 
Heads of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration, to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe 
drinking water, and to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as 
agreed in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
(&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of Implementation&#8221;),  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 884 million people lack access to improved 
water sources as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund in their 2010 Joint Monitoring Programme report, and that over 2.6 billion 
people do not have access to basic sanitation, and alarmed that approximately 1.5 million 
children under 5 years of age die and 443 million school days are lost every year as a result 
of water and sanitation-related diseases, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that international human rights law instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entail 
obligations for States parties in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> resolution 8/7 of 18 June 2008, in which the Council established the 
mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the independent expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including the progress in 
collecting good practices for her compendium,1 and the comprehensive, transparent and 
inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for 
her thematic reports, as well as the undertaking of country missions;  
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Recalls</i> General Assembly resolution 64/292 of 28 July 2010, in which the 
Assembly recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human 
right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Affirms</i> that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived 
from the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and 
human dignity;  
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Calls upon</i> the independent expert to continue to pursue her work regarding 
all aspects of her mandate, including to clarify further the content of human rights 
obligations, including non-discrimination obligations in relation to safe drinking water and 
</p>

<p>sanitation, in coordination with States, United Nations bodies and agencies, and relevant 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the second annual report of the independent 
expert2 and takes note with interest of her recommendations and clarifications with regard 
to both the human rights obligations of States and the human rights responsibilities of non-
State service providers in the delivery of water and sanitation services; 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
realization of all human rights, and that the delegation of the delivery of safe drinking water 
and/or sanitation services to a third party does not exempt the State from its human rights 
obligations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizes</i> that States, in accordance with their laws, regulations and public 
policies, may opt to involve non-State actors in the provision of safe drinking water and 
sanitation services and, regardless of the form of provision, should ensure transparency, 
non-discrimination and accountability; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To develop appropriate tools and mechanisms, which may encompass 
legislation, comprehensive plans and strategies for the sector, including financial ones, to 
achieve progressively the full realization of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, including in currently unserved and underserved areas;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To ensure full transparency of the planning and implementation process in 
the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation and the active, free and meaningful 
participation of the concerned local communities and relevant stakeholders therein; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To pay particular attention to persons belonging to vulnerable and 
marginalized groups, including by respecting the principles of non-discrimination and 
gender equality; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To integrate human rights into impact assessments throughout the process of 
ensuring service provision, as appropriate; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To adopt and implement effective regulatory frameworks for all service 
providers in line with the human rights obligations of States, and to allow public regulatory 
institutions of sufficient capacity to monitor and enforce those regulations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To ensure effective remedies for human rights violations by putting in place 
accessible accountability mechanisms at the appropriate level; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recalls</i> that States should ensure that non-State service providers: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Fulfil their human rights responsibilities throughout their work processes, 
including by engaging proactively with the State and stakeholders to detect potential human 
rights abuses and find solutions to address them; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Contribute to the provision of a regular supply of safe, acceptable, accessible 
and affordable drinking water and sanitation services of good quality and sufficient 
quantity;  
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Integrate human rights into impact assessments as appropriate, in order to 
identify and help address human rights challenges; 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/15/31. </p>


<p>(<i>d</i>) Develop effective organizational-level grievance mechanisms for users, and 
refrain from obstructing access to State-based accountability mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 10. S<i>tresses </i>the important role of the international cooperation and technical 
assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system, 
international and development partners as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development 
partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing 
development programmes in support of national initiatives and action plans related to the 
enjoyment of access to safe drinking water and sanitation;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue to report, on an annual basis, to 
the Council and to submit an annual report to the General Assembly;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to ensure that the independent expert receives the resources necessary to enable 
her to discharge her mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item and in accordance with its programme of work.
