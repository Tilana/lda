<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 11/8 of 17 June 2009, 15/17 of 30 September 2010, 18/2 of 
</p>
<p>28 September 2011, and 21/6 of 27 September 2012 on preventable maternal mortality and 
</p>
<p>morbidity and human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its review 
</p>
<p>conferences, including the outcome document of the 15-year review of the Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action contained in Commission on Population and Development resolution 2009/1 of 3 
</p>
<p>April 2009, Commission on the Status of Women resolutions 54/5 of 12 March 2010 and 
</p>
<p>56/3 of 9 March 2012, and all relevant agreed conclusions of the sessions of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on the Status of Women, World Health Assembly resolution 67.15 of 24 May 
</p>
<p>2014, the targets and commitments regarding the reduction of maternal mortality and 
</p>
<p>universal access to reproductive health, including those contained in the 2000 Millennium 
</p>
<p>Declaration, the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 and the outcome document of the High-
</p>
<p>level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, and Commission on Population and Development resolution 2012/1 of 
</p>
<p>27 April 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that, despite the impressive reductions in maternal mortality rates 
</p>
<p>achieved since 1990, in 2013 there were an estimated 289,000 maternal deaths of women 
</p>
<p>and girls, which are largely preventable, and that millions more women and girls suffer 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>serious, and sometimes lifelong, injuries, which have severe consequences for their 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their human rights and their overall well-being, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that increased political will and commitment, cooperation and technical 
</p>
<p>assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-
</p>
<p>based approach can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing this rate, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of 
</p>
<p>the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, 
</p>
<p>the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to 
</p>
<p>sustainable development in general, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Urges</i> all States to renew their political commitment to eliminate preventable 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels due 
</p>
<p>to primary and secondary causes, and to strengthen their efforts to ensure the full and 
</p>
<p>effective implementation of their human rights obligations, as well as their relevant 
</p>
<p>commitments as addressed in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and 
</p>
<p>its review processes, including the commitments relating to sexual and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>and reproductive rights, the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals, in particular the goals on improving maternal health and promoting gender equality 
</p>
<p>and empowering women, including through the allocation of necessary domestic resources 
</p>
<p>to health systems and the provision of the necessary information and health-care services in 
</p>
<p>relation to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p>including the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and 
</p>
<p>cooperation arrangements, including by honouring existing commitments and considering 
</p>
<p>new ones, and the exchange of effective practices and technical assistance to strengthen 
</p>
<p>national capacities, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, 
</p>
<p>addressing the impact that discrimination against women has on maternal mortality and 
</p>
<p>morbidity; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels to address the 
</p>
<p>interlinked root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as gender inequalities, all 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination and violence against women, early childbearing, early marriage, 
</p>
<p>poverty, malnutrition, harmful practices, lack of accessible and appropriate health-care 
</p>
<p>services, information and education, and to pay particular attention to eliminating all forms 
</p>
<p>of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, utilizing a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach for delivering sexual and reproductive health for all; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/27/20. </footnote> and calls upon States and encourages 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all relevant actors, including Governments, regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions, and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations to continue to disseminate the technical guidance and to apply it, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>as appropriate, when designing, implementing and reviewing policies and evaluating 
</p>
<p>programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Calls</i> <i>upon</i> all relevant United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, 
</p>
<p>within their respective mandates, to provide technical cooperation and assistance to States, 
</p>
<p>upon their request, to support the implementation of the technical guidance; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> the High Commissioner to promote enhanced awareness and 
</p>
<p>utilization of the technical guidance, to bring the technical guidance to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General and all United Nations entities with mandates relevant to maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality and morbidity and human rights, and to continue dialogue on the issue of 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity with all relevant actors in order to accelerate 
</p>
<p>the realization of the rights of women and girls and the achievement of Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal 5 by 2015; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare, from within existing resources, 
</p>
<p>in consultation with States, United Nations agencies and all other relevant stakeholders, a 
</p>
<p>follow-up report on how the technical guidance has been applied by States and other 
</p>
<p>relevant actors, to be presented to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-third session; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
