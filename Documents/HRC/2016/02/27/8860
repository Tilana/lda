<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief on her mission from 30 April to 8 May 2009 to 
the Republic of Serbia, including a visit to Kosovo.1 Given the painful history of the whole 
Balkans region and the deep suffering of individuals and communities caused by violence, 
atrocities and wars, the Special Rapporteur notices that the scars of these conflicts remain, 
even though all communities yearn for sustainable peace and reconciliation. She notes that, 
regrettably, racism as well as religious issues contributed to the recent conflicts. The 
Special Rapporteur underlines that interfaith consultations at the grass-roots, national and 
regional levels are vital to promote understanding, tolerance and respect between and 
among the various communities. In addition, the rule of law and the functioning of 
democratic institutions are prerequisites for the effectiveness of these strategies, which seek 
to encourage real dialogue in an open and pluralistic environment.  
</p>
<p> The first part of the present report focuses on the status of freedom of religion or 
belief in central Serbia and Vojvodina. The Special Rapporteur gives an overview of 
pertinent international human rights standards, the domestic legal framework on freedom of 
religion or belief and the religious demography. With regard to issues of concern in central 
Serbia and Vojvodina, the Special Rapporteur highlights discrimination against minority 
religious or belief communities; violent attacks against places of worship; intra-religious 
tensions; and the implementation of the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious 
Communities. The Special Rapporteur recommends reform of this law, which has been 
criticized for its discriminatory effects, especially with regard to religious communities not 
considered &#8220;traditional&#8221;. Furthermore, the Ministry of Religious Affairs should be more 
transparent and streamline the registration process in order to ensure equal access and 
treatment in the application procedure for all religious communities wishing to register. The 
Special Rapporteur also reminds the authorities of their duty to remain neutral and 
impartial, which precludes any State measures favouring a particular leader or specific 
organs of a divided religious community. All places of worship need to be fully respected 
and protected<b> </b>and the State should take adequate measures to prevent all acts or threats of 
violence.  
</p>
<p> In the second part of the report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the status of 
freedom of religion or belief in Kosovo. In terms of issues of concern for her mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur highlights incidents of violence and incitement to racial or religious 
hatred, the controversy about the issue of wearing religious symbols in educational 
institutions, and intra-religious and inter-religious tensions. The Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the reconstruction of cultural and religious heritage sites damaged or 
destroyed during the violence of March 2004 remains of utmost importance. She 
recommends that the relevant authorities take swift action and devise creative measures to 
counter coercion and violence in the name of religion. She also reminded religious leaders 
of their responsibility to play a constructive role so that freedom of religion or belief can be 
enhanced in a democratic, non-discriminatory and depoliticized manner. Lastly, the whole 
international community should send a clear message that violence and incitement to racial 
or religious hatred will not be tolerated.

full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and without prejudice to the status of 
Kosovo. </p>

<p><b> I. Freedom of religion or belief in Central Serbia and 
Vojvodina 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief carried out a mission to Serbia. The Special Rapporteur visited the municipalities 
of Belgrade, Novi Sad, Subotica, Novi Pazar and Vrnja&#269;ka Banja from 30 April to 5 May 
2009, pursuant to her mandate, to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment 
of the right to freedom of religion or belief and present recommendations on ways and 
means to overcome such obstacles.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Government of Serbia has 
extended, since October 2005, an open invitation to all thematic special procedures 
mandate holders. She is also grateful for the good cooperation during her visit in April/May 
</p><p>2009. In Belgrade, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with several 
Government officials, including the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Internal 
Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Religious Affairs, the Minister for 
Human and Minority Rights and the Minister for Education. She also held talks with the 
Chairperson of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, the President of the 
Supreme Court and the Ombudsman for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was able to collect first-hand information and 
documents on the status of freedom of religion or belief in central Serbia and Vojvodina. 
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur spoke with representatives of various religious or 
belief communities, including from the Baptist Church, the Evangelical Christian Church, 
the Hare Krishna community, the Islamic community in Serbia, the Islamic community of 
Serbia, the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, the Jewish community, the Montenegrin Orthodox 
Church, the Pentecostal Church, the Reformed Christian Church, the Roman Catholic 
Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Seventh-Day 
Adventist Church and the Slovak Evangelical Church. In addition, civil society meetings 
were held with academics, journalists, human rights defenders and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the religious representatives and other 
interlocutors for the information and opinions they shared with her. She is also very grateful 
for the excellent logistical support provided in Belgrade by the office of the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>5. The right to freedom of religion or belief is enshrined in various international human 
rights instruments.2 These include articles 2, 18-20 and 26-27 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights; article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights; article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women; article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; articles 2, 14 and 30 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child; and article 12 of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 15-20 and E/CN.4/2006/5, annex. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Apart from the latter 
convention,3 Serbia has ratified all of the other above-mentioned human rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>6. In addition, various United Nations bodies, including the General Assembly and the 
Human Rights Council, have issued relevant declarations and resolutions on freedom of 
religion or belief. Of these instruments, of particular relevance for the mandate are articles 
2, 18 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1981 Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic legal framework on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>7. According to article 11 of the Constitution, Serbia is a secular State, churches and 
religious communities are separated from the State, and no religion may be established as a 
State or mandatory religion. According to its article 21, all direct or indirect discrimination 
based on any grounds, inter alia on religion, is prohibited. Freedom of thought, conscience, 
belief and religion as well as the right to retain one&#8217;s belief or religion or change them by 
choice are guaranteed by article 43 of the Constitution. Furthermore, no person has the 
obligation to declare his religious or other beliefs. Parents and legal guardians have the 
right to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their 
own convictions.  
</p>
<p>8. Pursuant to article 43 of the Constitution, freedom of manifesting religion or beliefs 
may be restricted by law only if it is necessary in a democratic society to protect the lives 
and health of people, the morals of democratic society, the freedoms and rights guaranteed 
by the Constitution, public safety and order, or to prevent the inciting of religious, national 
and racial hatred. In addition, activities of political parties aiming at a forced overthrow of 
the constitutional system and violations of guaranteed human or minority rights, inciting 
racial, national or religious hatred are prohibited by article 5 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>9. Article 44 of the Constitution states that churches and religious communities are 
equal and free to organize independently their internal structure, religious matters, to 
perform religious rites in public, to establish and manage religious schools, social and 
charity institutions, in accordance with the law. The Constitutional Court may ban a 
religious community only if its activities infringe the right to life, the right to mental and 
physical health, the rights of the child or the right to personal and family integrity, public 
safety and order, or if it incites religious, national or racial intolerance (article 44 of the 
Constitution). 
</p>
<p>10. The 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities provides for the status of 
legal entity for churches and religious communities that are registered in accordance with 
the law. Article 10 of the law explicitly names five &#8220;traditional&#8221; churches (the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Slovak Evangelical Church, the 
Christian Reformed Church and the Evangelical Christian Church) and two &#8220;traditional&#8221; 
religious communities (the Islamic community and the Jewish community) as those which, 
in Serbia, have historical continuity spanning centuries and whose legal status was gained 
on the basis of special laws. Article 11 emphasizes that the Serbian Orthodox Church has 
played an exceptional historical, nation-building and civilizing role in the shaping, 
preservation and development of the identity of the Serbian people.  
</p>
<p>  
 3 On 11 November 2004, the State of Serbia and Montenegro signed the International Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families but did not ratify 
it. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The procedure for registration of churches and religious communities on the register 
maintained by the Ministry responsible for religious affairs is stipulated in articles 17 to 25 
of the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities. No religious organization may 
be registered the name of which contains a name or part of a name expressing the identity 
of a church, religious community or religious organization that has already been entered in 
the register or has submitted an application for entry beforehand. Pursuant to article 18, 
religious communities that are not considered &#8220;traditional&#8221; according to article 10 have to 
supply a memorandum with the names and signatures of the founders comprising at least 
0.001 per cent of adult citizens of Serbia who are resident in Serbia according to the most 
recent official population census, or foreign citizens with permanent residence on the 
territory of Serbia. 
</p>
<p>12. According to article 20 of the 2006 Law, the Ministry responsible for religious 
affairs may reject an application for registration of a religious organization if its goals, 
teachings, ceremonies or activities are contrary to the Constitution and public order, or if 
they endanger the life, health, liberty and rights of others, the rights of children, the right to 
personal and family integrity or the right to property. In making a decision on an 
application for entry in the register, the Ministry responsible for religious affairs will also 
take into account the decision of the European Court of Human Rights as well as 
administrative or judicial decisions regarding the registration or activities of a specific 
religious organization in one or more Member States of the European Union. Approval of 
entry, rejection of application, refusal of entry or deletion from the register may be 
appealed administratively. 
</p>
<p>13. The Parliament of the Republic of Serbia adopted a law on the prohibition of 
discrimination in March 2009. The law defines &#8220;discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;discriminatory 
treatment&#8221; as any unjustifiable differentiation or inequitable treatment, i.e. act of omission 
regarding persons or groups, as well as their family members or people close to them, 
performed in an overt or concealed manner, on grounds of, inter alia, religious convictions. 
According to article 18 of the 2009 law, &#8220;discrimination occurs when the principle of 
freedom of expressing one&#8217;s religious beliefs is breached, i.e. if a person or group is denied 
their right to adopt, maintain, express or change their religious beliefs, or to behave in 
accordance with their religious beliefs&#8221;. Shortly before the adoption of the 2009 law, a 
second paragraph was added to article 18 of the law, providing that &#8220;priests&#8217; or other 
religious officials&#8217; actions that are in accordance with the doctrine, beliefs or goals of the 
churches and religious communities&#8221; registered under the 2006 Law on Churches and 
Religious Communities should not be deemed to be discriminatory. Reportedly, pressure by 
religious and conservative groups regarding issues such as religious conversion and free 
expression of sexual orientation had led to a temporary withdrawal of the bill from the 
legislative agenda in early March 2009. An amended anti-discrimination law was finally 
adopted on 26 March 2009 by a narrow majority. 
</p>
<p>14. The 2001 Law on the Census of Population, Households and Housing stipulates that 
no person is obliged to declare his or her religious affiliation and that the census form must 
contain a note on that subject. In addition, article 18 of the Law on the Protection of 
Personal Data provides that data on racial origin, ethnicity and religious or other 
convictions can be collected, processed and rendered for use solely by written consent of 
the citizen. </p>

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Religious demography 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to the 2002 official census, the permanent population of central Serbia 
and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina consisted of 7.5 million people.4 
Approximately 85 per cent of the population was Orthodox Christians, most being members 
of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Roman Catholics comprised another 5.5 per cent and 
Protestants made up around 1 per cent of the population. In addition, 3.2 per cent of the 
population were Muslims. There is also a small Jewish community, comprising around 0.01 
per cent of the population. Another 0.5 per cent was atheists and the religious affiliation of 
4.5 per cent of the population was unknown or undeclared in the 2002 official census. 
</p>
<p>16. The Ministry of Religious Affairs indicated that almost all believers in Serbia were 
registered as belonging to one of the five &#8220;traditional&#8221; churches or two &#8220;traditional&#8221; 
religious communities. The claim that the believers of &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; Protestant churches 
account for only 1 per cent of the Republic of Serbia&#8217;s population, however, has been 
challenged by civil society organizations, which refer to the optional character of the census 
question and argue that many Protestants hesitated to express their confessional affiliation 
owing to their fear of suffering consequences. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Issues of concern for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight some aspects of the status of 
freedom of religion or belief in the Republic of Serbia. In the section below, she focuses on 
the following issues of concern for her mandate: (a) implementation of the 2006 Law on 
Churches and Religious Communities; (b) discrimination against minority religious or 
belief communities; (c) places of worship; and (d) intra-religious tensions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Implementation of the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities 
</b></p>
<p>18. The 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities5 has aggrieved a number of 
religious communities and groups that are seeking registration or have decided to stay away 
from it because of discriminatory effects of the law. The law defines seven &#8220;traditional&#8221; 
churches and religious communities, which benefit from automatic registration and 
exemptions with regard to paying administrative and property taxes. Religious communities 
that are not considered &#8220;traditional&#8221; have to be re-registered according to the 2006 Law on 
Churches and Religious Communities. However, there seems to be some lack of clarity 
with regard to the number of signatures required for &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; communities in order 
to apply for registration. The Minister for Religious Affairs stated that the statutory 
threshold of 0.001 per cent according to the most recent official population census would 
mean that around 100 people were required for the application. However, members of 
religious minorities informed the Special Rapporteur that initially only 75 signatures were 
required and this threshold was raised in 2006 by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. 
</p>
<p>19. Several &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; communities complained about the denial of legal status 
by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, sometimes despite court judgements in favour of their

Gender &#8211; Data by Municipalities&#8221; (http://webrzs.statserb.sr.gov.yu/axd/en/Zip/CensusBook3.zip); the 
preface highlights that &#8220;on the territory of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohia, the 
census will be accomplished only when all necessary conditions will be fulfilled.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 5 Concerning the draft law, see E/CN.4/2005/61/Add.1, para. 210; E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, paras. 336-
340; and A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, paras. 275-276. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>registration. Article 19 of the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities is 
allegedly used by the authorities to arbitrarily prevent the registration of religious 
organizations whose name contains a name or part of a name expressing the identity of a 
church, religious community or religious organization which is already registered. The 
Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the Ministry of Religious Affairs seems to 
interpret substantive rules of internal laws and orders of &#8220;traditional&#8221; churches to the 
detriment of other groups. For example, when rejecting the application for registration of 
the &#8220;Montenegrin Orthodox Church Eparchy for the Republic of Serbia&#8221;, the Ministry 
argued that only a church with a centuries-long continuity and a canonical priesthood could 
be a constituent part of the universal, ecumenical Christian community, and therefore 
recognized as an Orthodox church.6 The Ministry of Religious Affairs claimed that the 
religious community &#8220;Montenegrin Orthodox Church&#8221; had never existed and therefore 
could not have been recognized by other Orthodox churches.7 In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the State has a duty to remain neutral and 
impartial in exercising its regulatory power and in its relations with the various religions, 
denominations and beliefs.8 The autonomy of religious communities is an essential 
component of pluralism in a democratic society, where several religions or denominations 
of the same religion coexist.9 
</p>
<p>20. Reportedly, the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Dacia Felix was registered in April 
2009 and accorded equality with other &#8220;traditional&#8221; churches and religious communities 
recognized by the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities. Previously, article 2 
of the relevant regulations already provided that &#8220;with the consent of the Serbian Orthodox 
Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church&#8217;s organizational unit of Banat shall be entered in 
the register.&#8221;10 The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the State must not 
condition the granting of certain rights, including the registration of a religious community 
and the recognition of its legal status, on the agreement of another religious community. 
However, that appears to be part of the standard approach taken by the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs. 
</p>
<p>21. During the Universal Periodic Review session held in December 2008, the 
Government of Serbia stressed that the question of the law on churches and religious 
communities should be observed as a transitional law that is subject to changes, and that 
churches and religious communities could submit complaints regarding its implementation 
to the Supreme Court (A/HRC/10/78, para. 55). However, the Government also indicated 
that changes in the law or the bringing of a new law that would allow automatic 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Ministry of Religious Affairs, decision 080-00-45/2007-01 of 18 June 2008. On 11 December 2009, 
</p>
<p>the Government of Serbia informed the Special Rapporteur that this decision was annulled by the 
Supreme Court on procedural grounds and that the Ministry of Religious Affairs has called on the 
applicants to amend the documentation. 
</p>
<p> 7 Ibid. In its letter of 11 December 2009 to the Special Rapporteur, the Government emphasized that 
the registration of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was rejected &#8220;not only because of the term 
&#8216;Orthodox&#8217; in its name, but also because of the fact that an organizational unit of the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, the Montenegrin Metropolitanate, would allow the name Montenegrin Orthodox 
Church, at whose head is also a Metropolitan, to be interchangeable with the organizational unit of the 
Serbian Orthodox Church causing confusion about that Church, its goals and type of association 
involved&#8221;.

<p>registration, i.e. recognition of all churches and religious organizations, was difficult to 
accept as such practice did not exist in European states (A/HRC/10/78/Add.1, para. 34). 
The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate her wish that the Government reflect on the 
2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities. At a minimum, the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs should be more transparent and streamline the registration process in 
order to ensure equal access and non-discriminatory treatment in the application procedure 
for all religious communities that wish to register. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Discrimination against minority religious or belief communities 
</b></p>
<p>22. The distinction made between &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religious 
communities also contributes to a number of questionable practices. One relates to the 
existence of a privileged role for &#8220;traditional&#8221; churches and religious communities, for 
example in respect to their access to, and representation in, public bodies. Members of 
religious minorities highlighted in this regard that the council of the Republican 
Broadcasting Agency, which regulates the mass media in Serbia,11 is currently chaired by a 
bishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church. This fact was quoted as an indication for the 
problems faced by minority religious or belief communities.  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, the recently adopted anti-discrimination law provides for specific 
exemptions of the prohibition of discrimination with regard to actions of priests or other 
religious officials which are in accordance with the doctrine, beliefs or goals of registered 
churches and religious communities. Members of civil society organizations emphasized 
that this exemption was introduced shortly before the adoption of the 2009 Law on the 
Prohibition of Discrimination in its article 18 due to lobbying efforts by &#8220;traditional&#8221; 
churches and religious communities, inter alia, in order to protect priests against charges of 
discriminating against others on grounds of sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that religious instruction classes in the first 
years of primary and secondary schools were in practice only available for members of 
&#8220;traditional&#8221; churches and religious communities. In addition, some children belonging to 
&#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religious minorities have reportedly been forced to attend Serbian 
Orthodox liturgies in the context of school events despite their parents&#8217; clear objection 
against such activities. In addition, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses reported that some of their 
members have lost custody of their children when they were involved in divorce cases with 
a spouse who was not a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness and they alleged that the judgements were 
biased on the basis of the parents&#8217; religious affiliation.  
</p>
<p>25. Members of religious minorities also reported that their engagement in humanitarian 
aid activities during the 1990s was publicly criticized as a concealed approach for &#8220;buying 
souls&#8221; and indoctrinating children. In recent years, &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religious minorities 
have been described by police officers, teachers and in the media as &#8220;dangerous cults&#8221;,

States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all 
forms of discrimination and to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for 
his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of the parents or legal 
guardians. At the same, the Special Rapporteur calls upon public officials, teachers and the 
media to play a more constructive role in promoting religious tolerance. She would like to 
refer to General Assembly resolution 63/181, in which the Assembly urges States to step up 
their efforts to ensure that all public officials and civil servants, including members of law

<p>enforcement bodies and educators, in the course of fulfilling their official duties, respect all 
religions or beliefs and do not discriminate for reasons based on religion or belief, and that 
all necessary and appropriate education or training is provided.12 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Places of worship 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was informed about violent attacks against places of 
worship of different religious communities. In comparison to previous years,13 the number 
of attacks appears to be declining since 2007. However, members of religious minorities 
alleged that the relevant authorities lacked willingness to investigate and convict the 
attackers. If perpetrators were prosecuted, they were reportedly only charged with violating 
public order instead of the more serious charge of inciting religious, national and racial 
hatred. In addition, the police and judicial authorities do not seem to provide the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs with adequate information on such cases. 
</p>
<p>27. Members of &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; religious communities voiced their concerns about 
problems they are facing in acquiring or using places of worship. Furthermore, they 
complained about delays and administrative obstruction with regard to building or 
renovation permits, even though the relevant authority of the local government, in drawing 
up urban plans, is required by article 32 of the 2006 Law to examine the expressed needs of 
churches and religious communities for the construction of religious facilities. 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to restitution of nationalized property, only registered churches or 
religious communities can benefit from the 2006 Law on the Restitution of Property to 
Churches and Religious Communities. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this law 
only provides for the restitution of property confiscated by the State after 1945. This cut-off 
date seems to be to the detriment of the Jewish community, most of whose property was 
seized before 1945 during the Second World War. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to refer to the recommendation of the European Commission against Racism and 
Intolerance14 to ensure that all religious communities enjoy the right to restitution of their 
nationalized property, without any distinction whatsoever and irrespective of the date at 
which they were deprived of their property. The authorities of the Republic of Serbia 
indicated that the above-mentioned 2006 law deals only with the restitution of property that 
was seized from churches and religious communities, whereas the restitution of property 
belonging to persons from those communities will be regulated by a separate law. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Intra-religious tensions 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was informed about serious intra-religious tensions between 
the &#8220;Islamic community in Serbia&#8221;, based in Novi Pazar, and the &#8220;Islamic community of 
Serbia&#8221;, based in Belgrade.15 Conflicts between the opposing fractions of the Islamic 
community have on several occasions provoked violent attacks, including the use of fire 
weapons. Subsequently, the authorities have restricted some public gatherings in the 
Sandzak region due to security reasons.

<p>March 2009 (CommDH(2009)8, para. 228): &#8220;According to one opinion expressed to the 
Commissioner, the split had been caused by government intervention. Others argued that the 
government had been too passive in the face of this crisis. The Minister of Religion himself said that 
he very much regretted the current schism in the Islamic communities in Serbia, but stressed that the 
State could and should not interfere with any religious community including the Muslim community.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Minister for Religious Affairs indicated that his Ministry was cooperating with 
the two communities, which are both registered. This approach seems noteworthy since 
article 15 of the 2006 Law on Churches and Religious Communities recognizes the Islamic 
community&#8217;s legal continuity which it had acquired in compliance with a 1930 Law on the 
Islamic Religious Community of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. According to members of 
civil society organizations, the fact of having registered two Islamic communities shows 
that the Ministry of Religious Affairs is not consistent in its registration practice with 
regard to competing strands within a religion. The Special Rapporteur would like to remind 
the authorities of their duty to remain neutral and impartial, which precludes any State 
measures favouring a particular leader or specific strands of a divided religious community. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>31. The Special Rapporteur visited some multi-ethnic and multi-religious 
municipalities in central Serbia and Vojvodina, where an atmosphere of religious 
tolerance seems to flourish. In this regard, she would like to reiterate that interfaith 
consultations at the local, national and particularly regional levels are important to 
promote understanding, tolerance and respect between and among the various 
communities. In addition, the rule of law and the functioning of democratic 
institutions are prerequisites for the effectiveness of these strategies, which seek to 
encourage real dialogue in an open and pluralistic environment. Several State 
institutions can and should continue to play a pivotal role in healing wounds, 
contributing to reconciliation and building respect for the principles of human rights, 
including freedom of religion or belief. The issues of equality and non-discrimination 
on the basis of religion or belief should be among the Government&#8217;s priorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>32. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would recommend a reform and proper 
implementation of the current law on churches and religious communities in order to 
restore the confidence amongst various communities. It seems vital that the Ministry 
of Religion is more transparent in its decision-making and strictly abides by the duties 
of neutrality and impartiality. As outlined in her report to the Commission on Human 
Rights (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58), registration should not be a precondition for 
practising one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal personality and related 
benefits. In the latter case, registration procedures should not be cumbersome and 
remain uncomplicated so that the procedure itself does not become a stumbling block 
for registration, for example with regard to the required number of signatures of 
founders. Registration should not depend on reviews of the substantive content of the 
belief, the structure or the clergy. In addition, no religious group should be 
empowered to decide about the registration of another religious group.  
</b></p>
<p><b>33. Concerning places of worship, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to 
General Assembly resolution 55/254, in which the Assembly calls upon States to exert 
their utmost efforts to ensure that religious sites are fully respected and protected in 
conformity with international standards and in accordance with their national 
legislation. The Assembly also calls upon all States to adopt adequate measures aimed 
at preventing all acts or threats of violence, destruction, damage or endangerment, 
directed against religious sites. 
</b></p>
<p><b>34. The Special Rapporteur noticed that the voices of those individuals who do not 
profess any religion and those who are dissenters within their communities or 
dispassionate about religions are being marginalized. These individuals are neither 
realistically reflected in the latest census nor given an opportunity to institutionally 
express their views in matters of religion or belief. A truly pluralistic society is the 
backbone of a democratic system. Theistic, atheistic and non-theistic believers as well </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3

<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>as those who do not profess any religion have an important role to play in building 
that pluralism.  
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Freedom of religion or belief in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that all reference in the present report 
to &#8220;Kosovo&#8221;, whether to the territory, institutions or population, should be understood in 
full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and without prejudice to the 
status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p>36. From 5 to 8 May 2009, the Special Rapporteur visited the municipalities of 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, Gra&#269;anica/Gra&#231;anic&#235;, Prizren, Gjakov&#235;/Djakovica and De&#231;an/De&#269;ani. In 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina she had the opportunity to meet with the Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister, 
the Kosovo Minister for Justice and the Kosovo Vice-Minister for Culture Youth and 
Sports. The Special Rapporteur also held talks with the Chairperson of the Council for 
Cultural Heritage of the Kosovo Assembly and with the Kosovo Acting Ombudsperson.  
</p>
<p>37. In order to collect first hand information on the status of freedom of religion or 
belief in Kosovo, the Special Rapporteur also spoke with leading representatives of various 
religious or belief communities from the Evangelical Protestant Community, the Islamic 
community (including the Sufi groups of Helveti Dervish in Prizren and Bektashi in 
Gjakov&#235;/Djakovica), the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, the Roman Catholic Church and the Serbian 
Orthodox Church (both in Belgrade and in De&#231;an/De&#269;ani). Further talks were held with 
members of different civil society organizations and journalists. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of high-level representatives 
of international and regional organizations. These meetings included the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for the United Nations Interim Administration 
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the European Union Special Representative and the Head of 
Mission in Kosovo of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. She also 
met with representatives of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the European Union Rule of Law Mission, 
the Council of Europe and the Reconstruction Implementation Commission for Serbian 
Orthodox Religious Sites in Kosovo. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s programme in Kosovo was 
ably coordinated by UNMIK and the OHCHR stand-alone Office in Kosovo and she is 
extremely grateful to them for their excellent support.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>39. Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, on 10 June 1999, the 
Security Council in its resolution 1244 (1999) decided on the deployment in Kosovo, under 
the auspices of the United Nations, of international civil and security presences. The main 
responsibilities of the international civil presence include, inter alia, maintaining civil law 
and order, protecting and promoting human rights, as well as assuring the safe and 
unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Kosovo.  
</p>
<p>40. According to UNMIK regulation no. 2001/9 (para. 3.2), the Provisional Institutions 
of Self-Government shall observe and ensure internationally recognized human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including those rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal 
Declaration on Human Rights; the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols; the International Covenant on Civil </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>and Political Rights and the Protocols thereto; the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the European 
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; and the Framework Convention for the 
Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>41. In 2004, the Government of Serbia and Montenegro explained its inability to report 
on the discharge of its own responsibilities with regard to the human rights situation in 
Kosovo, and suggested that, owing to the fact that civil authority is exercised in Kosovo by 
UNMIK, the Human Rights Committee may invite UNMIK to submit to it a supplementary 
report on the human rights situation in Kosovo.16 The Human Rights Committee noted in 
2004 that, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), Kosovo currently 
remained a part of Serbia and Montenegro as a successor State to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, albeit under interim international administration, and that the protection and 
promotion of human rights was one of the main responsibilities of the international civil 
presence. It also noted the existence of provisional institutions of self-government in 
Kosovo that were bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by 
virtue of UNMIK regulation no. 2001/9 and considered that the Covenant continued to 
remain applicable in Kosovo. The Human Rights Committee encouraged UNMIK, in 
cooperation with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, to provide, without 
prejudice to the legal status of Kosovo, a report on the situation of human rights in Kosovo 
since June 1999. Subsequently, the State party also requested the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child to seek information related to the 
implementation of the respective treaties in Kosovo from UNMIK.17 The Human Rights 
Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considered the 
reports of UNMIK in July 2006 and November 2008, respectively.18 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to the protection of human rights at the regional level, it has been 
pointed out that, even though the standards contained in the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms must be observed by the 
Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, the people in Kosovo cannot claim its 
violation before the European Court of Human Rights.19 In addition, the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms according to its 
article 59 is only open to the signature of the members of the Council of Europe. On 9 
December 2008, the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) reached initial 
operational capacity, taking over parts of the UNMIK role in policing, police monitoring 
and providing international judges and prosecutors. EULEX works under the general 
framework of United Nations Security Resolution 1244 (1999), has a unified chain of 
command to Brussels and reports to the United Nations Security Council. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic legal framework on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Security Council in its resolution 1244 (1999) authorized the Secretary-General 
&#8220;to establish an international civil presence in Kosovo in order to provide an interim 
administration for Kosovo under which the people of Kosovo can enjoy substantial 
autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and which will provide transitional

<p>administration while establishing and overseeing the development of provisional 
democratic self-governing institutions to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life 
for all inhabitants of Kosovo&#8221;. UNMIK regulation no. 2001/9 provides that communities 
and their members shall have the right to preserve sites of religious, historical or cultural 
importance to the community, in cooperation with relevant public authorities and to operate 
religious institutions.  
</p>
<p>44. The 2004 Anti-Discrimination Law, promulgated by UNMIK regulation no. 
2004/32, is designed to prevent and combat discrimination, including those based on 
religion or belief, to promote effective equality and to apply the principle of equal 
treatment. Its article 6 provides that all persons exercising a public function shall ensure 
that those parties to whom they award a public contract, loan, grant or other benefit, will 
sign a document which states that they will act in compliance with the 2004 Anti-
Discrimination Law and will respect and promote a non-discrimination policy when 
carrying out their obligations related to such a public contract, loan, grant or other benefit. 
</p>
<p>45. UNMIK, by its regulation no. 2006/48, promulgated effective the Law on Freedom 
of Religion in Kosovo, adopted by the Assembly of Kosovo on 13 July 2006. However, 
UNMIK also revised article 5, paragraph 4, of the law to read as follows: &#8220;All religions and 
their communities in Kosovo including the Islamic Community of Kosovo, the Serbian 
Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Jewish Religious community and the 
Evangelical Church shall be afforded every protection and enjoyment of the rights and 
freedoms provided by this law.&#8221; While this change should have been reflected in the final 
official text, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the full text of the 2006 Law on 
Freedom of Religion in Kosovo, as available online at the website of the Assembly of 
Kosovo, still reflects the initial version of article 5, paragraph 4.20 
</p>
<p>46. Article 1, paragraph 2, of the 2006 Law on Freedom of Religion in Kosovo 
enumerates the various components of the right to freedom of religion or belief, as also 
stipulated in article 6 (a) to (i) of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. According to article 4 of the 
2006 Law on Freedom of Religion in Kosovo, the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief 
may not be abused by inciting, provoking or stimulating religious or racial intolerance or 
hatred, by impairing the right to life, the right to physical or mental health, the rights to 
children or the right to respect for private and family integrity. Its article 5 affirms that there 
shall be no official religion and that religious communities shall be separated from public 
authorities. The formation of a religious association which, by name or statute, purports to 
be officially linked to or recognized by a specific religious community is prohibited by 
article 6 without the consent of the said community. Religious communities are free in the 
determination of their religious identity and they shall independently regulate and 
administer their internal organization. 
</p>
<p>47. Following the declaration of independence21 by the Kosovo authorities in February 
2008, the Assembly of Kosovo passed a constitution for Kosovo on 9 April 2008, which 
</p>
<p>  
 20 &#8220;Religious communities in Kosovo enjoy all the rights with this Law.&#8221; (see page 3 of www.assembly-
</p>
<p>kosova.org/common/docs/ligjet/2006_02-L31_en.pdf); however, the website also includes a remark 
that this Law is applicable together with UNMIK regulation no. 2006/48 of 24 August 2006 
(www.assembly-kosova.org/?cid=2,191,197). 
</p>
<p> 21 On 8 October 2008, the General Assembly adopted resolution 63/3 in which it requested the 
International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the following question: &#8220;Is the 
unilateral declaration of independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo 
in accordance with international law?&#8221;. The advisory proceeding before the International Court of 
Justice was still ongoing at the time of writing the present report </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>entered into effect on 15 June 2008. The Secretary-General noted in a recent report22 that 
Kosovo authorities continued to act on the basis of the &#8220;Constitution of the Republic of 
Kosovo&#8221; and made public statements, asserting that they had no legal obligation to abide by 
Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). At the same time, the Government of the Republic 
of Serbia as well as many Kosovo Serbs reject the authority of Kosovo institutions derived 
from the &#8220;Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo&#8221;. The United Nations has adopted a 
position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo&#8217;s status.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Religious demography 
</b></p>
<p>48. The lack of a recent official census and the boycott by various communities to past 
census exercises in Kosovo makes all statistical data approximate. With regard to the 
religious demography, it is estimated that out of the 2 million people living in Kosovo, 
about 85 per cent are Muslims, 5 per cent are Serbian Orthodox Christians, 3 per cent are 
Catholics, 1 per cent are Protestants and 6 per cent belong to other religions or are atheists 
or agnostics. 
</p>
<p>49. Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors pointed to the perceived correlation 
between ethnicity and religious affiliation, since the majority of Albanians in Kosovo are 
Muslims with a small Catholic minority, whereas most Serbs living in Kosovo are members 
of the Serbian Orthodox Church. They referred to significant changes in Kosovo&#8217;s religious 
demography, especially with regard to the proportion of ethnic Albanians and Serbs due to 
massive displacements before, during and after the military intervention of North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) troops in Kosovo in spring 1999.23 
</p>
<p><b> E. Issues of concern for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight some aspects of the status of 
freedom of religion or belief in Kosovo. In this chapter, she will focus on the following 
three issues of concern: (a) violence and incitement to racial or religious hatred; (b) 
religious symbols; and (c) intra-religious and inter-religious tensions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Violence and incitement to racial or religious hatred 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is worried about acts of violence and incitement to racial or 
religious hatred perpetrated against Muslims and Serbian Orthodox Christians, respectively.  
</p>
<p>(a) Situation of Muslims 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is usually confronted with cases of discrimination 
targeting members of religious minorities in a given society. In Kosovo, however, the vast 
majority of the population is Muslim, mostly of Albanian ethnicity, who have suffered 
enormously, indeed as others, from the persecution of the Milo&#353;evi&#263; regime in the 1990s. 
Discrimination and repression was followed by armed conflict involving the loss of lives, 
disappearances and abductions, massive displacement and forcible expulsions affecting 
mainly Kosovo Albanians, but also Kosovo Serbs and members of other ethnic groups. The 
deterioration of the humanitarian crisis prompted the military intervention in the spring of

</p>
<p>1999, the withdrawal of Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo in June 1999, and 
the subsequent creation of an interim international administration. 
</p>
<p>53. In this regard, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has 
recently convicted some former high-ranking Yugoslav and Serbian political, military and 
police officials for crimes against humanity (deportation; other inhumane acts: forcible 
transfer; murder; and persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds pursuant to 
article 5 of the Tribunal&#8217;s Statute) as well as for violations of the laws or customs of war 
(murder pursuant to article 3). In its judgement of 26 February 2009, the Trial Chamber 
found that there was a widespread and systematic campaign of violence directed against the 
Kosovo Albanian civilian population during the course of the NATO airstrikes in 1999, 
conducted by forces under the control of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbian 
authorities, during which there were incidents of killing, sexual assault, and the intentional 
destruction of mosques.24 The Presiding Judge emphasized that the deliberate actions of 
these forces during this campaign caused the departure of at least 700,000 Kosovo 
Albanians from Kosovo in the short period of time between the end of March and 
beginning of June 1999. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur noted that the people in Kosovo are still struggling with the 
aftermath of those traumatic times. They are facing a huge challenge in shaping a common 
future in which the rights of religious minorities must also play a central role. According to 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, healing comes through justice rather than through 
revenge or reprisals. It is vital for every society to be based on the rule of law as well as to 
respect and protect human rights, including freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>(b) Situation of Serbian Orthodox Christians 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed by the reports she received about looting, 
arson attacks and violence against Serbian Orthodox believers and their places of worship 
in March 2004. She was informed that numerous lives were lost and that 4,000 Serbs and 
Roma were driven out of their homes. 36 Serbian Orthodox Churches, monasteries and 
other religious sites were damaged or destroyed on 17 and 18 March 2004. The places of 
worship that were attacked date as far back as the fourteenth century and two of them are 
listed by UNESCO as major sites of universal significance. In addition, 76 monasteries and 
churches had already been damaged or destroyed between June and October 1999. The 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also complained that some Serbian Orthodox 
monasteries and religious sites were being presented by the Kosovo authorities without 
mentioning their Serbian origin and cultural heritage.25 There are also long-standing 
disputes about cadastral records concerning some land surrounding religious sites, for 
example with regard to Visoki De&#269;ani monastery. In addition, 5,250 tombstones in 254 
graveyards were reportedly destroyed and many of the tombs were desecrated by scattering 
around the bones. Many Serbs and Serbian Orthodox clergy are afraid when moving 
outside of Serb enclaves since their convoys have reportedly been stoned.

</p>
<p> 25 UNMIK and other key international players intervened on several occasions subsequent to complaints 
of the Serbian Orthodox Church that the approach of the Kosovo authorities was aimed at 
disregarding the cultural and historical identity of Serbian people in Kosovo. However, the Kosovo 
authorities seem to persistently use the term &#8220;Byzantine&#8221; cultural heritage for Serbian Orthodox 
monasteries and patrimonial sites in official reports and public presentations. </p>

</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was informed by UNMIK that, as at January 2007, a total of 
326 individuals26 had been investigated in municipal and district public prosecutors&#8217; offices 
concerning criminal offences committed during the March 2004 riots in Kosovo. A further 
157 charges were handled in Minor Offences Courts resulting in 116 sentences. In addition, 
as of April 2008, a total of 35 defendants27 were prosecuted by international prosecutors 
and convicted of 70 crimes in relation to the events of March 2004, including for 
aggravated murder, inciting ethnic hatred and causing general danger.

<p>57. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s international and local interlocutors were unanimous that 
they were caught by surprise in 2004 and had not seen any warning signs before the attacks 
on Serbian Orthodox believers and their religious sites. It is therefore important for all 
actors involved to remain vigilant in detecting any emerging religious tensions and to be 
proactive in preventing the recurrence of such violence. In addition, any acts of violence or 
incitement to racial or religious hatred should be investigated and the perpetrators must be 
prosecuted and sanctioned. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed that on 30 
March 2007, a projectile was fired from a rocket-launcher towards the Visoki De&#269;ani 
monastery which caused serious damage to the tiled roof covering the wall that surrounds 
the monastery. Subsequently, a Kosovo Albanian was convicted on 19 September 2008 by 
the UNMIK district court in Pej&#235;/Pe&#263; to a prison sentence of three and a half years. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the situation of internally 
displaced persons who are members of religious minorities. A recent UNHCR report 
indicates that most of the 210,000 internally displaced persons from Kosovo are from 
minority communities (Serbs, Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians) and in addition almost 20,000 
people are still displaced within Kosovo itself, with some 2,200 living in collective 
centres.28 In this context, the Special Rapporteur would also like to refer to the follow-up 
mission from 28 June to 4 July 2009 by the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons. In his report (A/HRC/13/21/Add.1), the 
Representative of the Secretary-General notes that the number of returns to, and within, 
Kosovo has been disappointingly low, even though a considerable section of the internally 
displaced persons population still seems willing to exercise their right to return. While 
security and freedom of movement for minority communities in Kosovo has improved, 
today&#8217;s chief obstacles to sustainable returns are the entrenched patterns of discrimination, 
lack of access to employment and livelihoods and too few schools for minorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Religious symbols 
</b></p>
<p>59. The issue of wearing religious symbols in educational institutions has been a matter 
of controversy. The Kosovo Ministry of Education has prohibited the wearing of 
headscarves, while the legal basis seems to be unclear. In  2004, the Ombudsperson 
issued an opinion stating that the prohibition should apply only to teachers and school 
officials, but not to students. In 2007-2008, the Ombudsperson Institution received a large 
</p>
<p>  
 26 A total of 200 individuals have been indicted (of which 134 were convicted, 8 acquitted, 28 cases 
</p>
<p>dismissed and 30 pending), 48 charges were dismissed, 4 are suspended or not being pursued, 35 
were transferred to other courts (for instance with regard to minor offences) and 29 cases remain 
open. 
</p>
<p> 27 Of these 35 defendants, 14 received prison sentences and 21 received suspended sentences. 16 
defendants have filed appeals or announced the intention to do so. One defendant prosecuted by an 
international prosecutor in relation to the riots was acquitted, and the prosecutor in the case has filed 
an appeal, which is pending with the appellate court. The verdicts against the remaining 19 
defendants are final. Approximately ten cases, which needed further action, are currently handled by 
EULEX International Prosecutors.

<p>number of complaints from high school students who had not been allowed by the school 
authorities to wear headscarves in schools. The Acting Ombudsperson concluded, inter alia, 
that they were discriminated on the basis of their religion or belief and underlined that their 
fundamental right to exercise their religion was protected by human rights standards. In 
addition, two women in Prizren complained that they applied for teaching positions in 
secondary schools but were not hired based on their religious convictions and the fact that 
they wore headscarves.  
</p>
<p>60. With regard to the issue of wearing religious symbols, especially in public schools, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that each case has to be decided according 
to its own circumstances. For an analysis of the applicable legal framework and 
international case law, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her report to the 62nd 
session of the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 36-60). She would 
like to reiterate that freedom of religion or belief may be invoked both in terms of the 
positive freedom of persons who wish to wear or display a religious symbol and in terms of 
the negative freedom of persons who do not wish to be confronted with or coerced into it.  
</p>
<p>61. On the one hand, the right to education of pupils who have been expelled for 
wearing religious symbols and also the rights of parents or legal guardians to organize life 
within the family in accordance with their religion or belief may be at stake. On the other 
hand, the authorities may invoke the denominational neutrality of the school system and the 
desire to preserve religious harmony in schools. However, any limitation must be based on 
the grounds of public safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others; respond to a pressing public or social need; pursue a legitimate aim; 
and be proportionate to that aim.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Intra-religious and inter-religious tensions 
</b></p>
<p>62. There are also disturbing indicators about intra-religious tensions within the Islamic 
community in Kosovo. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur has received reports about 
extreme forms of religious practices that are thrust upon other members of the community. 
There were at least three cases where moderate Muslim religious leaders were allegedly 
threatened and beaten for opposing radical religious approaches advocated by different 
groups within the Islamic community in Kosovo. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
reiterate that freedom to manifest ones&#8217; religion or belief may be subject to limitations that 
are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Violence in the name of religion cannot be 
accepted. She urges the relevant authorities to take all necessary and appropriate action to 
combat intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, also 
inside the communities. 
</p>
<p>63. In addition, inter-religious tensions continue in Kosovo. Members of small Christian 
minorities reported that they were encountering abuse, threats and violent attacks from 
some members of different religions, especially with regard to missionary activities. 
Reportedly, local newspapers and websites had also indicated names and contact details of 
Christian missionaries, requesting them to stop converting Muslims. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about the vulnerable situation of converts who face 
problems with the community of their former religion. According to international human 
rights standards, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion also includes the 
freedom to change one&#8217;s religion or belief. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize 
that theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs as well as the right not to profess any religion 
or belief are protected. </p>

<p><b> F. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>64. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur noticed that the scars of the previous 
decade&#8217;s conflicts remain, even though all communities yearn for sustainable peace 
and reconciliation. She is well aware of the painful history of the whole Balkans region 
and the deep suffering of individuals and communities caused by violence, atrocities 
and wars. The Special Rapporteur notes that, regrettably, racism and religious issues 
contributed to the recent conflicts. Indeed, most of her interlocutors emphasized that 
religious issues in this region are closely interlinked with ethnicity and historical 
experience. 
</b></p>
<p><b>65. In Kosovo, there have been recent instances of violence and threats directed 
against religious communities. At the same time, many of her interlocutors told the 
Special Rapporteur that the society has historically been characterized by a culture of 
religious tolerance. Yet, as detailed above (see paras. 50-63), there are a number of 
serious issues of concern with regard to freedom of religion or belief which need to be 
addressed adequately by the various actors.  
</b></p>
<p><b>66. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur would like to formulate the following 
recommendations for the consideration of (a) UNMIK and the international presence 
in Kosovo; (b) the Kosovo authorities; (c) the religious communities and their leaders; 
and (d) the whole international community. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations for the consideration of the United Nations Interim Administration 
Mission in Kosovo and the international presence in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p><b>67. The reconstruction of cultural and religious heritage sites that had been 
damaged or destroyed during the violence in March 2004 remains of utmost 
importance. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that a year-long stalemate over the 
tendering procedures for reconstruction projects was overcome by the parties at a 
meeting of the Reconstruction Implementation Commission on 12 May 2009, with the 
participation of representatives of the Kosovo Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, 
the Serbian Orthodox Church, the institutes for the protection of monuments from 
Belgrade and Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, and UNMIK. 
</b></p>
<p><b>68. Furthermore, it is vital to continue efforts in order to ensure safe conditions for 
the sustainable return of displaced persons, in particular those belonging to religious 
minorities. The Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the conclusions of the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons (A/HRC/13/21/Add.1) and she joins his recommendations addressed to the 
European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) to pay particular attention to 
housing, land and property cases involving displaced parties to prevent miscarriages 
of justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Recommendations for the consideration of the Kosovo authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. The Special Rapporteur recommends the relevant authorities to take swift 
action and devise creative measures to counter the worrying trend of coercion and 
violence in the name of religion or belief. In addition, any advocacy of national, racial 
or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 
must be vigorously investigated and the perpetrators must be prosecuted in 
accordance with international human rights law. In this regard, article 20, paragraph 
2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is an important tool for 
the protection of persons from discrimination, hostility or violence because of their 
national, racial or religious identity.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.3

<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>70. The Special Rapporteur would also like to refer to the concluding observations 
of the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/UNK/CO/1, paras. 20-21), which was 
concerned about the widespread discrimination against minorities in Kosovo and 
noted that members of minority communities have only limited access to the conduct 
of public affairs. Further efforts should be made to increase the representation of 
minority communities, including members of religious minorities, in the judiciary and 
to improve their access to public service.  
</b></p>
<p><b>71. The Kosovo authorities should exert their utmost efforts to ensure that 
religious sites are fully respected and protected and to take additional measures in 
cases where they are vulnerable to desecration and destruction. The Kosovo 
authorities should also aim to foster a culture of tolerance and respect for the diversity 
of religions and for religious sites, which represent an important aspect of the 
collective heritage of humankind. In general, further efforts should be made by all 
actors to improve the communication between the Kosovo authorities and the Serbian 
Orthodox Church. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Recommendations for the consideration of religious communities and their leaders 
</b></p>
<p><b>72. One of the tools for promoting religious tolerance is a meaningful inter-
religious and intra-religious dialogue, particularly in order to address contentious 
issues that religious leaders can resolve amicably through negotiations rather than 
confrontation. The Special Rapporteur would urge a more cooperative attitude in this 
regard, especially from the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo. At this 
critical moment, religious leaders have a responsibility to play a constructive role so 
that freedom of religion or belief can be enhanced in a democratic, non-
discriminatory and depoliticized manner. The religious leaders&#8217; public positions have 
a direct impact on their communities and can have either positive or detrimental 
effects on religious harmony.  
</b></p>
<p><b>73. Ultimately, dialogue at the grass-roots levels as well as joint meetings or artistic 
events that bring together from different religious backgrounds may help in building 
bridges between the communities and seeking reconciliation. In this regard, the 
General Assembly emphasizes in its resolution 63/181 the importance of a continued 
and strengthened dialogue among and within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with 
broader participation, including of women, to promote greater tolerance, respect and 
mutual understanding. The Assembly also stresses the need to address the rise of 
religious extremism that affects the rights of individuals, as well as the misuse of 
religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and 
other relevant instruments. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Recommendations for the consideration of the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>74. It is vital to send a clear message that violence and incitement to racial or 
religious hatred will not be tolerated. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s concern (CCPR/C/UNK/CO/1, para. 12) about the 
continuing impunity enjoyed by some perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity committed prior to the UNMIK mandate and about ethnically motivated 
crimes perpetrated since June 1999, including those committed in March 2004, as well 
as the failure to effectively investigate many of these crimes and bring perpetrators to 
justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. One of the lessons learned from the violent conflicts in the past decade is to 
remain vigilant in detecting any emerging religious tensions and to try defusing them 
before they suddenly deteriorate and turn violent. In this regard, the Human Rights 
Council, the system of special procedures and the treaty bodies have an important </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>early warning function. Due attention must also be given to early signs of intolerance 
that may not be human rights violations themselves, but that may ultimately lead to 
religious discrimination. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
stands ready for any further consultations and follow-up to the present report.
