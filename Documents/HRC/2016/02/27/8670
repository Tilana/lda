</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur conducted a country 
visit to Kyrgyzstan from 30 September to 9 October 2009. The purpose of the mission was 
to examine existing problems related to the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes and their adverse effects on human rights. In particular, the visit 
focused on three areas: uranium tailings; obsolete or banned pesticides; and mercury waste. 
During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met with a wide range of Government 
representatives and non-State actors, and visited dump sites or storage facilities for 
hazardous chemicals or wastes in Orlovka, Kara-Balta and Kant. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made by the country in addressing 
the serious transboundary threats that uranium tailings pose to the health and the 
environment of Central Asian countries, as well as in attracting international support for a 
long-term solution to this problem. He also notes with satisfaction the efforts undertaken by 
the Government of Kyrgyzstan to promote and protect the human rights of individuals and 
communities living in the vicinity of tailings sites and storage facilities for obsolete 
chemicals. These measures include the elaboration of a national plan to protect human

<p>health and the environment from the adverse effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) 
and the implementation, with the support of the international community, of urgent 
recovery measures for high-priority tailings sites. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress made, the Special Rapporteur identifies a number of key 
challenges in the areas of radioactive waste and chemicals management. He formulates 
several recommendations on measures to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, the adverse 
effects that radioactive waste and hazardous substances, including pesticides, pose to the 
health and the environment of affected individuals and communities. These 
recommendations include:  
</p>
<p> (a) Relocation of the most dangerous uranium tailings and POP pesticides to 
more secure locations;  
</p>
<p> (b) Rehabilitation of abandoned mines, uranium tailings and waste storage 
facilities to prevent environmental contamination and unauthorized access;  
</p>
<p> (c) Comprehensive assessment of the harmful impact of radioactive and 
hazardous substances on the health of individuals and communities living close to tailings 
sites and storage facilities for hazardous chemicals;  
</p>
<p> (d) Improvement of the existing regulatory framework on radioactive waste and 
chemicals management in order to ensure its consistency with international norms and 
standards; 
</p>
<p> (e) Clarification of the roles and functions of the different ministries and State 
agencies with responsibilities in the areas of radioactive waste and chemicals management, 
and creation of appropriate mechanisms to ensure better coordination and cooperation 
among these institutions; 
</p>
<p> (f) Organization of public information campaigns and awareness-raising 
initiatives on the risks that radioactive and hazardous waste storage facilities pose to local 
populations and the environment and on safety measures to reduce these risks.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights conducted a 
country visit to Kyrgyzstan from 30 September to 9 October 2009. He would like to thank 
the Government of Kyrgyzstan for allowing him to carry out a very informative and 
productive visit.  
</p>
<p>2. The agenda for the visit of the Special Rapporteur was arranged in close cooperation 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
in Kyrgyzstan and the Regional Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) for Central Asia. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank all those involved in 
the preparation of his mission for their valuable cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p>3. The aim of the mission was to examine, in the spirit of cooperation and dialogue, 
existing problems relating to the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products 
and wastes and their adverse effects on human rights, with a view to making concrete 
recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control, reduce and eradicate 
these phenomena. In particular, the visit offered the Special Rapporteur a valuable 
opportunity to consider the progress made, and the difficulties encountered, by Kyrgyzstan 
in reducing the transboundary threats that uranium tailings, obsolete or banned pesticides 
and mercury waste pose to the health and the environment of countless individuals and 
communities living in Central Asia. 
</p>
<p>4. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with senior representatives of the 
following: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Kadyrbek Sarbaev; the Ministry of Emergency Situations; the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Water Resources and Processing Industry; the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Surveillance of the Ministry of Health; the State Agency for Environmental Protection and 
Forestry; and the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources. The Special 
Rapporteur also met members of the Parliament (Jogorku Kenesh), representatives of 
United Nations specialized agencies, programmes and bodies, academics, civil society 
organizations and representatives of the private sector.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a number of sites where toxic 
and dangerous products and wastes are stored, including uranium tailings in Orlovka and 
Kara-Balta, as well as storage facilities for obsolete pesticides and chemicals in Kant. 
During the course of the on-site visits, the Special Rapporteur was able to meet local 
residents. He also visited analytical laboratories in Bishkek and Orlovka.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General information 
</b></p>
<p>6. Kyrgyzstan is located at the juncture of two major mountain systems: the Tien Shan 
and the Pamir. About 94 per cent of its territory lies over 1,000 metres above sea level, and 
more than half is at an elevation higher than 2,500 metres. The climate is sharply 
continental: air temperature varies from -40&#176;&#1057; in the winter to +40&#176;&#1057; in the summer. 
</p>
<p>7. Due to its geological features and climatic conditions, the country is exposed to 
many forms of natural disasters, including mudslides and landslides, flooding during the 
snow-melt, avalanches and others. The whole country is classified a zone of high tectonic 
activity, and an estimated 40 per cent of the population lives in a zone, which includes 
Bishkek, that is at risk of earthquakes reaching a strength of 9 on the Richter scale. The 
most vulnerable areas are valleys where human settlements, transport and other 
infrastructure are concentrated. Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts are the areas most frequently </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>affected by earthquakes. The latest deadly earthquake stuck Osh oblast in October 2008, 
killing more than 70 people. 
</p>
<p>8. The total population was 5.3 million in 2007. Bishkek, the capital and the largest 
city, has approximately 900,000 inhabitants; Osh, the second largest city, has a population 
of 220,000. About two thirds of the population live in rural areas. Almost half of the 
population lives below the national poverty line. Significant disparities exist between urban 
and rural areas: in 2007, the urban poverty level was 28.3 per cent, as opposed to 55 per 
cent in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>9. High unemployment rates, decreases in living standards and lack of social protection 
force a large number of individuals to leave their villages to find employment opportunities 
and a better standard of living elsewhere, either abroad or within the country. About 
400,000 citizens leave the country every year. Most choose to migrate, both legally and 
illegally, to Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. The number of Kyrgyz labour migrants 
officially registered as living and working in these countries was about 600,000 in August 
</p><p>2009. The main direction of internal migration flows is from the impoverished south to the 
more prosperous northern regions, in particular to the capital city. Since independence 
(1991), the population of Bishkek has almost doubled because of the large inflow of 
migrants. 
</p>
<p>10. Kyrgyzstan is rich in natural resources. It possesses substantial reserves of gold and 
water, and also produces mercury, uranium, antimony, beryllium and rare earth metals. 
Kumtor, an open-pit gold mine located in the Tien Shan mountains, is one of the largest 
gold deposits in the world. In 2005, the mine&#8217;s production accounted for 6.2 per cent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP) and 38.5 per cent of industrial output. The decline in gold 
output that the country experienced in recent years has significantly slowed the overall 
growth of the Kyrgyz economy, although growth rates recovered in 2007. 
</p>
<p>11. Agriculture also continues to be a significant economic sector. Although its share of 
GDP has declined since the mid-1990s &#8211; mainly owing to the start of large-scale gold 
mining in the country &#8211; agriculture still accounts for around one third of GDP, and employs 
more than 50 per cent of the total labour force. Because of the country&#8217;s mountainous 
topography, animal husbandry remains a significant part of the agricultural output. Main 
crops include tobacco, cotton, vegetables and fruits.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>12. Kyrgyzstan is a party to seven core international human rights treaties and five 
protocols, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol. 
Pursuant to these treaties, the country has undertaken an obligation to protect individuals 
and communities within its jurisdiction by eliminating, or reducing to a minimum, the risks 
that hazardous products and wastes pose to the enjoyment of several human rights, 
including the rights to life, the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, safe and healthy working conditions, food, safe drinking water, adequate 
housing, access to information and public participation. 
</p>
<p>13. Kyrgyzstan has ratified a number of multilateral environmental agreements 
regulating the sound management and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, 
including the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous 
Wastes and their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the 
Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.  
</p>
<p>14. It is also a party to several conventions negotiated under the auspices of the United 
Nations Economic Commission for Europe, including the Convention on Access to 
Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in 
Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention), the Convention on Environmental Impact 
Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention) and the Convention on the 
Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents.  
</p>
<p>15. International agreements ratified by Kyrgyzstan are incorporated into national 
legislation (art. 12, para. 3, of the Constitution) and can be directly applied in national 
courts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional and legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Constitution, approved by referendum in October 2007, has supreme legal force 
and direct application in Kyrgyzstan. It recognizes a number of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including the right to life (art. 14), the right to healthy and safe 
conditions of work (art. 28) and the right to protection of health (art. 34). According to 
article 35, the citizens of Kyrgyzstan have the right to a healthy and safe environment, as 
well as the right to obtain compensation for damage caused to their health or property by 
activities involving the exploitation of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>17. Since its independence, Kyrgyzstan has enacted a number of legislative and 
regulatory acts to protect the environment and natural resources. They include Framework 
Law No. 53 of 16 June 1999, on environmental protection, which lays down the basic 
principles of environmental protection in many regulatory areas, including waste 
management, hazardous chemicals and access to environmental information and education, 
and Law No. 54 of 16 June 1999, on environmental expertise, which provides detailed 
regulations on the environmental impact assessment procedure to assess the adverse impact 
that economic or other activities may have on the environment. A draft environmental code 
is currently being reviewed by the Parliament. The code seeks to codify in a single legal 
instrument environmental norms previously scattered in a large number of laws and 
regulations, some of which will be repealed de jure or de facto. 
</p>
<p>18. Law No. 168 of 1 August 2003, on radiation safety of the population of the Kyrgyz 
Republic, and Law No. 57 of 26 June 2001, on tailings and mining dumps, are aimed at 
protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of ionizing radiation 
sources. The former defines the main responsibilities of the Government, ministries, State 
agencies and local administrations in the area of radiation safety, and lays down general 
rules for the protection of the local population and the environment in the event of a 
radioactive accident. The latter establishes basic principles to monitor the safety of uranium 
tailings and mining dumps and ensure the sound storage, transport, disposal or recycling of 
the radioactive materials they contain.  
</p>
<p>19. Kyrgyzstan has adopted several laws and regulations on the sound management, 
transport and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. In accordance with the existing 
regulatory framework, hazardous products and wastes fall into different categories: 
pesticides, highly toxic chemicals, potentially toxic chemicals, industrial or domestic 
wastes, oil products, medicines and medical wastes, uranium tailings and waste dumps.  
</p>
<p>20. The registration of potentially hazardous chemicals is carried out in accordance with 
Law No. 60 of 26 June 2001, on the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the 
population, Government Resolution No. 376 of 27 July 2001, on measures to protect the 
environment and human health from the adverse effects of some hazardous chemicals and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>pesticides, and Resolution No. 279 of 13 July 1995, on the National Registry of Potentially 
Toxic Chemicals, which are aimed at collecting information on the intrinsic properties and 
potential uses of hazardous chemicals, their possible adverse effects on human health and 
the environment, and the measures and precautions to be adopted to ensure their proper 
handling, management and disposal. Law No. 12 of 25 January 1999, on chemicalization 
and plant protection, and Regulation No. 62 of 5 March 2003, on the registration of 
pesticides and agrochemicals1 lay down the rules and procedures for the testing and 
registration of pesticides.  
</p>
<p>21. The management and disposal of toxic wastes is regulated by Law No. 89 of 13 
November 2001, on industrial and domestic waste. The national definition of hazardous 
wastes is in accordance with annexes I and II of the Basel Convention. Licences for 
hazardous waste management are issued pursuant to Law No. 12 of 3 March 1997, on 
licensing. Restrictions on the transit, import and export of hazardous wastes and other 
wastes for final disposal and for recovery are regulated by Government Resolution No. 193 
of 6 April 1999, on measures to control the transboundary movement of hazardous and 
other wastes.  
</p>
<p>22. The issues of access to information, participation in decision-making and access to 
justice are dealt with in the Constitution as well as in several legislative and regulatory acts, 
including the Law on environmental protection, the Law on environmental expertise, Law 
No. 943-XII of 2 July 1992, on health protection, and Law No. 167 of 1 August 2003, on 
occupational safety and health. Law No. 213 of 28 December 2006, on access to 
information held by public authorities and local administrations, seeks to promote the 
effective implementation of the Aarhus Convention, but the procedures currently in place 
are not sufficiently detailed to make its legal provisions applicable in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>23. Unlike other countries in the region, Kyrgyzstan has not established a regulatory 
body with overall responsibility for nuclear and radiation safety. The control over 
enterprises mining or processing uranium ores, the management of abandoned radioactive 
and toxic waste dump sites, and the protection of the population and the natural 
environment against radioactive contamination fall under the jurisdiction of a number of 
ministries, State agencies, regional and local governments, scientific institutions, State-
owned analytical laboratories and private enterprises, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Department for Monitoring and Forecasting Emergency Situations and 
Managing Tailings, of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, which is responsible for the 
management and monitoring of uranium tailings and waste dumps of closed enterprises in 
order to prevent possible threats to the safety of population and the environment arising 
from environmental or man-made disasters. The Department is also responsible for the 
rehabilitation and the recultivation of uranium tailings; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance, of the 
Ministry of Health, which monitors the implementation of relevant health and safety 
standards to prevent possible adverse effects caused by radioactive and toxic materials or 
wastes on human health; 
</p>
<p> (c) The State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry, which 
monitors, through the issuance of licences and a system of periodic inspections, the 
activities of functioning mining enterprises to prevent environmental contamination. The 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>Agency also maintains contacts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
is responsible for the implementation of relevant IAEA standards;  
</p>
<p> (d) The State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources, which exercises 
control over the rational use and conservation of mineral resources by mining enterprises 
and provides expert advice on issues concerning radiation safety. 
</p>
<p>24. Several Government bodies, scientific institutions and private laboratories collect 
and analyse data on the radiological or ecological safety of radioactive and toxic waste 
storage facilities, including:  
</p>
<p> (a) The State Agency for Hydrometeorology (Kyrgyzhydromet) under the 
Ministry of Emergency Situations, which monitors radioactive contamination of the 
atmosphere in Bishkek and other major cities through daily measurements; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance of the 
Ministry of Health, which monitors the radioactivity of drinking water and surface-water 
samples;  
</p>
<p> (c) The Ministry of Emergency Situations, which sporadically measures 
radiation levels in and around tailing sites, usually at the request of local communities or 
after natural processes which could endanger the stability of the tailings;  
</p>
<p> (d) The GeoPribor Scientific Engineering Centre at the Institute of Geo-
mechanics and Mineral Prospecting of the National Academy of Sciences, which monitors 
dangerous natural or anthropogenic processes and their possible impact on the safety of 
dams in tailings and waste dumps;  
</p>
<p> (e) Private radio-ecological or geochemical laboratories, such as the Chui 
Ecological Laboratory in Kara-Balta, which monitor radioactivity levels at the request of 
private enterprises or Government agencies.  
</p>
<p>25. As in the case of radioactive waste management, several ministries, State agencies, 
local authorities, scientific institutions, and State-owned and private laboratories have 
competencies in the field of chemicals management. They include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Department of Chemicalization, Plant Protection and Quarantine, of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry, which tests and 
approves fertilizers and pesticides that can be used in Kyrgyzstan, keeps a Government list, 
and oversees the import, management, transport and utilization of chemicals in agriculture;  
</p>
<p> (b) The Ministry of Health, which coordinates overall policy on chemical safety 
and manages the National Registry of Potentially Toxic Chemicals. Its Department of 
Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance monitors the use of pesticides and fertilizers in 
agriculture in order to prevent their possible adverse effects on human health; 
</p>
<p> (c) The State Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry, which monitors 
the implementation of existing legislation on chemicals and waste management to prevent 
possible adverse effects on the environment and serves as the Government focal point for 
the implementation of the Basel Convention, the Stockholm Convention and the Rotterdam 
Convention. The Agency also issues licences to authorize the transboundary movement and 
disposal of toxic substances, including persistent-organic-pollutant (POP) pesticides. 
</p>
<p>26. These institutions also monitor the impact of pesticides and agricultural chemicals 
on human health and the environment. The laboratories of the Department of 
Chemicalization, Plant Protection and Quarantine, for example, measure residual 
concentrations of pesticides, including DDT and products of its decomposition, in crops, 
soil, water and air. The laboratories of the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Surveillance determine the levels of pesticides in foodstuffs, soil, drinking water and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>workplace air, while the Department of Environmental Monitoring of the State Agency for 
Environmental Protection and Forestry collects and analyses air, water and soil samples to 
monitor the impact of pesticides on the environment. 
</p>
<p>27. A number of Governmental or inter-agency commissions have been established to 
facilitate coordination and cooperation between different ministries and State agencies with 
responsibilities in the field of radioactive waste or chemicals management. Commissions 
are headed, as a rule, by the minister or a deputy minister, and organizational aspects are 
handled by the lead agency (usually, the Ministry of Emergency Situations for radioactive 
waste management and the Ministry of Agriculture for pesticides). Such commissions are 
usually established on an ad hoc basis either to fulfil a specific task, as is the case with the 
coordination committee charged with elaborating a national implementation plan in 
compliance with the requirements of the Stockholm Convention, or to cover specific 
aspects of radioactive waste or chemicals management. At present, there are no 
mechanisms to facilitate consultation and coordination between central Government bodies 
and local administration. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that since independence the country 
has ratified, or acceded to, several international human rights and environmental treaties, 
and played an active role in international and regional forums to address human rights and 
global or regional environmental issues.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan to address the significant threats that uranium tailings and hazardous waste 
dumps pose to human health and the environment, as reflected in two major strategic 
documents on environmental protection and sustainable development adopted by the 
Government in recent years.  
</p>
<p>30. The Country Development Strategy for 2009-2011, which is the mid-term overall 
development strategy of the Government, includes the rehabilitation of radioactive and 
hazardous dump sites among its strategic priorities related to environmental protection. 
This goal is linked to the Strategy&#8217;s mid-term objective of ensuring the safety of the 
population and territories of Kyrgyzstan and its neighbouring countries from emergencies 
involving radioactive and toxic contamination. The Ecological Security Concept 2007-2020 
also includes the sound management and rehabilitation of uranium tailings and toxic waste 
dump sites among the country&#8217;s long-term priorities in the field of environmental 
protection. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government of Kyrgyzstan has successfully managed to attract funds from 
donors and international organizations to build country capacity and preparedness to tackle 
the transboundary threats that uranium tailings and hazardous waste dumps would pose to 
the local population and the environment in case of natural disasters. At present, the 
Ministry of Emergency Situations is implementing a total of 33 project proposals, 
amounting to a total of US$ 142 million. For instance, the World Bank is implementing a 
project to minimize radiation exposure in the Mailuu-Suu area and to improve the 
effectiveness of emergency preparedness and response by national and subnational 
authorities and local communities. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe is carrying out several projects to improve the socio-economic situation in towns 
affected by uranium tailings and hazardous waste dumps by creating conditions for 
generating income, such as the provision of grants and microcredits to women and young 
people to run small businesses. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>32. The Government of Kyrgyzstan is also playing an instrumental role in raising 
international awareness and mobilizing donor assistance to find a long-term solution to the 
serious transboundary threats of contamination of groundwater resources and rivers located 
in the Central Asian region and their possible adverse effects on the local populations. On 
29 June 2009, the Government and UNDP organized a high-level international forum in 
Geneva entitled &#8220;Uranium Tailings in Central Asia: Local Problems, Regional 
Consequences, Global Solution&#8221;. The forum brought together high-level delegations from 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, members of the donor community, 
representatives of international and regional organizations and financial institutions, and 
experts from the region to discuss radioactive management issues in the region.  
</p>
<p>33. In the final joint declaration, participants reaffirmed their readiness to resolve 
problems of radioactive and toxic waste through joint actions, and stressed the importance 
of preventive measures to rehabilitate contaminated areas in accordance with the highest 
safety standards and best mining practices. They also highlighted the importance of 
international and regional cooperation in addressing the transboundary threats posed by 
uranium legacy sites, and urged the international community to continue supporting Central 
Asian countries in their efforts in this area. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to congratulate the Government of Kyrgyzstan 
for the progress made in the field of chemicals management. In July 2006, the State adopted 
a national plan to implement its obligations under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent 
Organic Pollutants. The plan aims at protecting human health and the environment from the 
adverse effects of POPs. A preliminary inventory of existing stockpiles of POP pesticides 
and POP-contaminated sites has been elaborated on the basis of the national 
implementation plan. Priority measures as defined in the plan include the harmonization of 
national legislation with international laws on POPs, the creation of a National 
Coordination Committee and Chemical Safety Centre, the establishment of a POP 
inventory, national capacity-building on monitoring and evaluation, the elimination of 
stockpile sites, the improvement of public awareness and education, and the promotion of 
research. 
</p>
<p>35. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the enabling legal and 
regulatory framework established to facilitate access to environmental information held by 
public authorities. He also commends the involvement of non-governmental organizations 
and the general public in decision-making processes, for example in the discussion of draft 
legislation or in environmental-impact assessment procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Uranium tailings 
</b></p>
<p>36. The countries of Central Asia were the main suppliers of uranium in the former 
Soviet Union. Large-scale uranium ore mining and processing in the region led to the 
creation of a large amount of radioactive and toxic wastes, which have been stored in waste 
dumps and tailings.  
</p>
<p>37. Uranium tailings are a by-product of milling, which is the process of grinding the 
ore and adding chemicals, usually sulphuric acid, to extract the uranium it contains. Mining 
and milling remove hazardous constituents from the ore and convert them to a fine sand, 
then sludge, whereby the hazardous materials become more susceptible to dispersion in the 
environment. In addition to radioactive materials (uranium, thorium-230 and radium-226), 
the sludge contains heavy metals (lead, arsenic, mercury, rare-earth metals) and chemical 
reagents used during the milling process.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that unless properly managed to ensure 
their long-term stability and security, uranium tailings and waste dumps pose significant 
threats to the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to life and the right to health.  
</p>
<p>39. Acute exposure to ionizing radiation can cause burns and radiation sickness, and, 
depending on the dose, can result in death within hours or days. Long-term, low-level 
(chronic) exposure is known to cause various forms of cancers, and can also have other 
adverse health effects, including damage to the nervous system, genetic defects and mental 
retardation in children. Exposure to heavy metals like lead, mercury or arsenic can also lead 
to severe long-term health effects, including cancer and damage to the nervous, digestive, 
reproductive and respiratory systems. In particular, lead has long been associated with the 
permanent reduction of the cognitive capacity of children, even at extremely low levels of 
exposure. 
</p>
<p>40. Today, Kyrgyzstan hosts 92 uranium tailings and waste dumps containing more than 
254 million cubic metres (about 475 million tons) of radioactive or toxic wastes. The 
Ministry of Emergency Situations is responsible for the management of 36 tailings and 25 
dumps of closed mining enterprises which were abandoned after the fall of the Soviet 
Union, whereas tailings and waste dumps of functioning mining companies remain under 
the control of the enterprises. Major sites include Mailuu-Suu, Min-Kush, Ak-Tyuz, 
Orlovka and Kara-Balta.  
</p>
<p>41. Radioactivity levels vary from one site to another, with open and dilapidated sites 
having higher levels of radioactivity. In Mailuu-Suu, for example, background radiation on 
the surface of the tailings is between 100 and 600 microroentgens per hour (mR/hr) (the 
maximum permissible level is 17 mR/hr), and radioactivity levels in private houses are four 
times higher than the maximum permissible levels. According to some experts, radiation 
levels in certain places can be as high as 2,000-3,000 mR/hr.2 
</p>
<p>42. Potentially dangerous natural processes were not taken into account during the 
planning and construction stages of radioactive or toxic waste storage facilities. Most sites 
are located near towns and villages, in mountainous areas characterized by high seismic 
activity and soil erosion processes typical of mountainous regions (floods, mudslides and 
landslides). Natural phenomena such as earthquakes or floods can damage the dam or 
destroy it altogether, while seepage may cause contamination of surface water and 
groundwater resources.  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, most tailings sites are situated near the banks of transboundary rivers 
(Naryn, Mailuu-Suu, Chu, Sumsar) that form the base of the large water basin of the 
Central Asian region. Since Kyrgyzstan is situated at the upper portion of the region&#8217;s water 
basins, a natural disaster at one of the sites would quickly spread radioactive and toxic 
wastes into the neighbouring countries, threatening the life, health and environment of an 
estimated five million people living in the densely populated Ferghana or Chui valleys. 
</p>
<p>44. In December 1964, one of the tailings dumps in Ak-Tyuz was damaged by 
mudflows, and around 600,000 cubic metres of radioactive and toxic wastes flowed into the 
Kichi-Kemin and Chu Rivers. This resulted in the contamination of the lower part of the 
Kichi-Kemin Valley, which is shared with Kazakhstan. In 2002, an examination of soils 
near the Chu River in Kazakhstan showed continued high levels of thorium, its decay

</p>

Geneva, 29 June 2009, p. 84. Available from  http://www.un.org.kg/en/un-in-kyrgyzstan/what-we-

<p>products, and other toxins, which are peculiar to rare-earth production.3 Less serious 
accidents took place in Mailuu-Suu in 1994 and 2002, when mudslides blocked the course 
of the Mailuu-Suu River and threatened to submerge another waste site. 
</p>
<p>45. Many tailings sites and waste dumps of closed enterprises lie in dilapidated 
conditions, without any fencing or warning signs to prevent unauthorized access. Due to the 
low awareness of the consequences of exposure to the radioactive and hazardous materials 
contained in these sites, local populations sometimes break into abandoned uranium mines 
or scavenge in tailings and dump sites to collect metal structures, construction materials, 
electrotechnical equipment and cables which are later sold on the black market or used for 
construction and domestic needs. In recent years, two men died in Kadji-Sai and one died in 
Mailuu-Suu after collecting contaminated scrap metal at the tailings. Furthermore, people 
graze animals on the tailings and use the heavily contaminated drainage water of tailings 
for animal husbandry and agriculture, thereby exposing themselves to additional sources of 
ionizing radiation through contaminated meat, dairy products or vegetables.  
</p>
<p>46. During his visit to uranium legacy sites, the Special Rapporteur witnessed the 
serious social impact that the curtailment of uranium production has had on local 
communities that once relied heavily on the uranium ore mining and processing industry. 
Although no comprehensive study has been carried out to analyse the magnitude of this 
problem, poor socio-economic conditions are visible in almost every populated area and 
region where uranium mining and processing were carried out.  
</p>
<p>47. The economic decline of these once booming towns can be seen in the overall 
worsening of living conditions, characterized by high unemployment rates, deterioration in 
the quality of education and health care and limited access to sources of pure drinking water 
and uncontaminated food products. The lack of employment opportunities and the 
environmental degradation caused by the uranium ore mining and processing industries 
have in turn forced large parts of the working-age population, in particular men, to migrate 
to Bishkek or abroad. 
</p>
<p>48. Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes that the lack of any form of control to prevent 
unauthorized access to abandoned uranium mines or radioactive waste storage facilities 
poses a remote, but potentially serious, risk of possible terrorist theft of radioactive 
materials. In recent years, the Central Asian region has witnessed political instability and 
the spread of religious extremism, with some of the Central Asian Islamist groups believed 
to have terrorist ties. Kyrgyzstan does not possess highly enriched uranium (which can be 
used to produce nuclear weapons); however, it is uncertain whether highly radioactive 
materials &#8211; which could be used to produce radiological dispersal devices (&#8220;dirty bombs&#8221;) &#8211; 
exist inside the tailings or in abandoned equipment at these sites, due to large-scale 
abandonment after the break-up of the Soviet Union and lack of access to Soviet-era 
documents. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Obsolete and banned pesticides 
</b></p>
<p>49. During Soviet times, almost 5,000 tons of pesticides were used annually in the 
country, and pesticides containing POPs, which were outlawed during the Soviet era, 
accounted for 30 per cent of the total quantity. According to a preliminary inventory, 104.7 
tons of outdated or banned pesticides, including 31.9 tons of POPs, are buried at 183 sites 
in the regions of Osh, Chui, Issyk-Kul and Naryn.4 However, the Special Rapporteur was

 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>informed that stockpiles existing in the country could be significantly larger, since large 
quantities of obsolete or banned pesticides appear to be stored on private farms.  
</p>
<p>50. Obsolete pesticides are usually stored in warehouses or burial sites that do not meet 
basic safety requirements. Burial areas are not fenced off and/or marked with warning 
signs, and local populations are generally not aware of the dangers associated with the 
improper handling or use of chemicals stored in the warehouses. Some of these sites have 
been fully or partly destroyed, and construction materials have been removed and used to 
build houses, mosques or shelters for domestic animals. Other stores have been re-equipped 
to be used for different purposes, such as for storing agricultural produce. In many cases, 
the pesticide packaging has been damaged, and pesticides have been washed away by rain, 
causing widespread environmental pollution. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur considers that obsolete and banned pesticides, including 
POP pesticides, represent one of the major environmental challenges the country faces 
today. He notes that chronic, low-level exposure to hazardous pesticides that had expired or 
were outlawed during Soviet times could cause a wide range of potentially life-threatening 
medical conditions, including cancer, kidney and liver dysfunction, hormonal imbalance, 
immune system suppression, birth defects, premature births, reproductive disorders and 
learning disabilities. The adverse impact of chronic, low-level exposure to pesticides on 
human rights, including the rights to life and to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, has been explored by this mandate (see 
E/CN.4/2006/42). 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also notes that POP pesticides, such as DDT or dieldrin, are 
particularly harmful to human health and the environment. POPs persist in ecosystems for 
long periods, and accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms, including humans. 
Such pollutants have the potential to harm humans and other organisms even at 
concentrations that are commonly found in ordinary foods. There is good medical evidence 
linking POPs to potentially fatal illnesses, including various forms of cancer, birth defects 
and reproductive and neurological disorders. POPs are particularly harmful to the 
developing foetus and to infants, which are exposed to them through breast milk.  
</p>
<p>53. High levels of DDT and other POPs have been found in the soil and in surface water 
and groundwater resources around many burial sites, as well as in vegetable oil, meat, dairy 
products and vegetables throughout the country. According to a study carried out by the 
Ministry of Health in 2004, samples of breast milk of women who live in rural areas in the 
south showed high levels of DDT and other POP pesticides, and POPs were also found in 
the placenta and amniotic fluid of over one third of pregnant women examined. Children 
from southern regions are more often diagnosed with iron-deficiency anaemia, tuberculosis, 
viral hepatitis and acute respiratory viral infections than children from other areas of the 
country. Furthermore, the incidence of some hormone-dependent tumours, such as breast 
and ovarian cancers, has increased among women from cotton- and tobacco-growing areas.  
</p>
<p>54. Due to the lack of proper control at the storage facilities and the low standards of 
living of rural populations, banned pesticides are sometimes stolen from burial sites, and 
either sold in local markets or smuggled into neighbouring countries, especially Uzbekistan. 
In addition, obsolete, prohibited or poor quality pesticides, such as DDT manufactured in 
China, continue to be illegally imported into and exported out of the country due to the lack 
of adequate controls at the borders with China and Tajikistan. Such pesticides are 
frequently unlabelled or are labelled with information that farmers or agricultural workers 
cannot read (because they are not in local languages or because of insufficient literacy).

</p>
<p><b> C. Mercury 
</b></p>
<p>55. The mercury plant in Khaidarkan, wedged in the remote mountains of southern 
Kyrgyzstan, began operating in 1941, and is today the world&#8217;s last known mercury mine 
which supplies primary mined mercury to the global market. While other mercury mines 
elsewhere in the world have closed their activities under the pressure of growing 
international concern regarding mercury pollution, the remoteness of Khaidarkan and its 
unfavourable climatic and geographic conditions have so far discouraged any effort to 
identify alternatives to mercury mining. The majority of the population &#8211; about 10,000 
people &#8211; is directly or indirectly employed by the mercury mine, which explains the 
apparent indifference of many people in town to the threat that mercury mining poses to 
their health and the surrounding environment. 
</p>
<p>56. Mercury was widely used in thermometers and scientific instruments (due to its 
unique chemical properties), as well as in many other products and processes. Its use, 
however, is being reduced throughout the world due to its toxicity and the availability of 
substitutes. Certain forms of mercury and its compounds can damage neurological 
development and affect internal organs. Effects are most pronounced in pregnant women, 
infants and children. Mercury can spread far and wide through air and water, and is 
ingested by fish and other marine life, where it becomes concentrated as it moves up the 
food chain. 
</p>
<p>57. Mercury contamination poses a significant risk to the local population and the 
environment. Mercury mining and processing in Khaidarkan has generated over 13 million 
tons of slag, 4 million tons of tailings and several million tons of waste rock, which have 
been deposited in close proximity to the town.5 Next to these huge deposits, there also is a 
smaller sludge pond that contains several thousand tons of high concentration mercury 
waste originating from the mercury purification process. Due to the lack of containment, 
water drains from these waste sites, polluting surrounding agricultural lands and surface 
and groundwater used for irrigation or drunk by cattle in the area.  
</p>
<p>58. Limited studies on the impact of mercury on the health of local population have 
shown that mercury has accumulated in various tissues and parts of the body (hair, blood, 
urine) of the persons analysed. Maximum levels were registered among workers employed 
in the mercury plant. Higher concentrations of mercury were also observed in children&#8217;s 
blood and in the milk of nursing mothers. Although no comprehensive study has been 
carried out to assess the extent of mercury contamination, elevated mercury concentration, 
often exceeding maximum allowable concentration norms, have been recorded in air and 
water resources in areas surrounding large enterprises that are currently producing or had 
produced mercury in the Batken and Osh oblasts. 
</p>
<p>59. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the United Nations 
Environment Programme have assisted Kyrgyzstan in developing an action plan on primary 
mercury mining in the country and its impact on human health and the environment. The 
aim of the action plan, which is currently being considered by the Government, is to 
facilitate the closure of the mine and the replacement of the present mercury mining 
operations in the area with other viable economic activities (small-scale gold mining, non-
metallic mining, agriculture and artisanal activities). The plan is also aimed at raising public 
awareness on the harmful impact of mercury on health and the environment and at

<p>identifying environmentally acceptable and economically affordable rehabilitation 
techniques to deal with contaminated waste and land. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, according to information received, 
an increasing amount of mercury is illegally imported into the country and obtained by 
artisanal or small-scale miners from &#8220;unofficial&#8221; sources for gold refining. He is concerned 
that artisanal or small-scale miners may not use safety equipment such as gloves, dust 
masks, boots and glass retorts in the course of extracting and processing gold or be aware of 
the risks associated with handling mercury or other dangerous chemicals used for the 
amalgamation of gold. The Special Rapporteur also notes that existing legislation, which 
prohibits the use of mercury and other dangerous products during the extraction process, is 
not properly enforced due to the lack of sufficient financial and human resources. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Legislative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes that despite the efforts made by Kyrgyzstan to 
implement the various human rights and environmental agreements to which it has become 
a party, the existing legal framework on the sound management and disposal of hazardous 
products and wastes remains obsolete and not effectively harmonized with international 
norms and requirements. He notes in particular that most of the legislation on 
environmental protection is of a framework nature, and requires the adoption of more 
detailed laws or regulations to be effectively applied. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
regrets that the draft environmental code, which seeks to develop a comprehensive legal 
framework for environmental protection in accordance with the international environmental 
obligations undertaken by the country, has not yet been adopted. 
</p>
<p>62. The existing regulatory framework on radioactive waste management and radiation 
safety needs to be elaborated and developed further in several areas. Radiation and 
environmental safety norms and standards are obsolete. Existing laws and regulations do 
not clearly define the procedures to be followed in the event of a natural or man-made 
disaster resulting in the release of radioactive or toxic materials into the environment, nor 
do they specify the measures that need to be adopted to prevent such accidents and ensure 
the sound management of uranium tailings and waste dumps. Furthermore, there is a critical 
lack in the regulatory basis for the rehabilitation and recultivation of uranium tailings, for 
licensing procedures and for monitoring. 
</p>
<p>63. Norms and standards on chemicals management are scattered over a great number of 
laws and regulations. The Special Rapporteur notes that some chemical substances fall into 
more than one category, which makes it difficult to identify the applicable legal regime, 
while others do not seem to be covered by any regulation. He is of the view that this 
situation of legal uncertainty risks  undermining the protection of human health and the 
environment from the threats arising from the unsound handling, management, use, 
transport and disposal of hazardous chemical products. 
</p>
<p>64. In Kyrgyzstan, a number of ministries, State agencies and local authorities are 
involved in the design, implementation, enforcement and monitoring of legislation and 
policies on radioactive waste and chemicals management, with no strict delineation of 
functions and little coordination of their respective actions. This situation makes it difficult 
to identify the role and specific competencies that different institutions have. Furthermore, 
their functions and responsibilities often overlap, since they are identified not on the basis 
of a specific group of substances (for example pesticides, highly toxic or potentially toxic 
substances, radioactive substances and wastes), but rather on the nature of their activities 
(health care, environmental protection and so on).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the overlapping functions carried 
out by these Government authorities, and the lack of an effective mechanism to ensure their 
coordination and cooperation, have so far hampered the efforts undertaken by Kyrgyzstan 
to minimize the adverse effects that the unsound management and disposal of hazardous 
chemicals and radioactive wastes have on the enjoyment of human rights. He is aware that 
several governmental and inter-agency commissions have been established on an ad hoc 
basis to facilitate a coordinated approach on specific aspects of radioactive waste or 
chemicals management, but is of the view that a better coordinated approach is needed in 
order to eliminate the duplication of responsibilities that characterizes the current system of 
radioactive waste and chemicals management. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at 
the lack of effective mechanisms to facilitate consultation and coordination among central 
Government bodies and regional and local administrations. 
</p>
<p>66. In the last decade, the country has experienced a number of institutional changes in 
its Government, which have in turn affected the institutional framework for the 
management of hazardous products, including pesticides, and toxic wastes. One of the 
negative consequences of this frequent restructuring is the lack of management continuity. 
For instance, a new environmental authority &#8211; the State Agency for Environmental 
Protection and Forestry &#8211; was created in 2005 after its separation from the structure of the 
former Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations and established as an independent 
body under the Government. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the 
current status of the national environmental authority, which is lower than that of a 
ministry. The Director of the Agency does not participate in Cabinet meetings. 
Furthermore, a State agency is not as well positioned as a ministry to organize and manage 
the activities of an inter-agency commission.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the status of uranium tailings, toxic 
waste and pesticide storage facilities is not monitored in a systematic way due to the lack of 
sufficient human, technical and financial resources. This situation has so far prevented 
Kyrgyzstan from carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the impact that radioactive 
wastes, POP pesticides and other hazardous substances have on the environment and on the 
health of people living in the regions where storage facilities are located. As a result, no 
Governmental institution or private laboratory possesses comprehensive information on the 
radiological or ecological safety of these storage facilities and the potential risks they pose 
to local populations and the environment.  
</p>
<p>68. Ministries and State agencies do not have adequate financial resources, the technical 
means or sufficient expertise to ensure the adequate maintenance and rehabilitation of 
existing storage facilities for radioactive or toxic wastes. State-owned analytical 
laboratories are both understaffed and overloaded, and suffer from a regular brain drain of 
specialists possessing knowledge and skills in this field. A lack of equipment needed for the 
calibration of instruments for measuring radioactivity compromises the accuracy of the data 
obtained. Private radio-ecological laboratories, such as the Chui Ecological Laboratory in 
Kara-Balta, usually have better equipment and instruments for monitoring and measuring 
radioactivity levels, but there is no unified approach in their work, and no coordination with 
the work carried out by Government agencies. They also suffer from limited financial 
resources, a shortage of qualified staff and lack of equipment needed for the verification 
and calibration of instruments needed for measuring radioactivity. 
</p>
<p>69. Control over the activities of private enterprises is hampered by the existing 
restrictions on access to industrial sites. Enforcement authorities, including the State 
Agency for Environmental Protection and Forestry, can carry out only one annual planned </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>inspection, regardless of the risk posed by the industrial site. Further inspections need to be 
requested, and authorized, in advance. This results in increased risk of accidents and 
persistent non-compliance.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Access to information 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned that despite the serious risks that 
radioactive waste and obsolete pesticides pose to human health and the environment, public 
awareness on these issues remains alarmingly low. Information on the status of the uranium 
tailings and waste dumps is limited, especially at the local level, due to failures of the 
primary data collection system owing to inadequate infrastructure and resources for 
continuous environmental monitoring. In addition, lack of knowledge of these issues and 
poor reporting by journalists negatively affect the quality of information provided by the 
mass media. 
</p>
<p>71. Local populations near contaminated areas often poorly perceive the real or potential 
dangers that hazardous substances pose to their health. For example, several 
misconceptions on radiation exposure persist, such as the idea that exposure to low levels of 
radiation is beneficial to health. Apart from small-scale initiatives undertaken at the local 
level, no information campaign or awareness-raising activity has been organized to inform 
local populations and the public in general about the potential harmful impact posed by 
radioactive waste and obsolete pesticides and the measures to be adopted to minimize the 
risks. The limited information available at the local level also negatively affects the right of 
local communities to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of strategies 
aimed at reducing the risks posed by hazardous products and wastes dumped or stored near 
their villages.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that health and safety legislation 
concerning chemicals management is not effectively enforced, and that employees in the 
chemical or energy sector who handle hazardous chemicals are often unaware of the risks 
that these chemicals pose to their health and the protective measures they must adopt in 
order to reduce these risks. Similarly, farmers and the public in general have limited access 
to information on chemicals available in the country, including chemicals that are illegally 
imported or exported. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that hazardous chemicals 
are usually sold at the local markets by unqualified persons, and that instructions on how to 
use the pesticides and minimize health risks are either unavailable or provided in foreign 
languages (mainly in Chinese). 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that despite the efforts undertaken by 
Kyrgyzstan to transpose the Aarhus Convention into national legislation, some challenges 
still exist in the implementation of the country&#8217;s normative framework on access to 
information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice on environmental 
matters. The country has not yet developed a detailed strategy or an action plan for the 
implementation of the Aarhus Convention. The general public is still not sufficiently 
familiar with the Aarhus Convention, and the lack of training opportunities for civil 
servants hinders public involvement in the decision-making process.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur also notes that there is no or insufficient information on 
many aspects of the state of the environment, as highlighted above. When information is 
available, it is often accessible only in hard copy at public offices in Bishkek and other 
major cities, which hinders access to information for individuals or organizations from rural 
areas. Electronic information is scarce, and access to it is in practice limited to those 
individuals and organizations having access to the Internet. </p>

<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b> G. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the country has neither defined its 
national priorities for foreign funding in the areas of radioactive waste and chemicals 
management nor elaborated a clear strategy to guide foreign donors. International financing 
and technical assistance from abroad have not always been used as efficiently as they 
should due to the lack of effective coordination among the various ministries, State 
agencies and regional and local authorities involved in the design and implementation of 
legislation and policies on radioactive waste and chemicals management. He also notes that 
while the donors have set up their own strategy - the Joint Country Support Strategy - to 
improve the efficiency of their assistance to the country, too often they follow their own 
development strategies, which are not always country-needs oriented.

<p>76.<b> The mission to Kyrgyzstan allowed the Special Rapporteur to learn more about 
the legislation, policies and practice of the country in the field of sound management 
and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. In particular, the mission 
offered a valuable opportunity to assess the progress made and difficulties 
encountered by the State in addressing the adverse effects of uranium tailings, 
obsolete or banned pesticides and mercury waste on the enjoyment of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> In order to assist the country in identifying and prioritizing its action in the 
field of radioactive waste and chemicals management, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to recommend the adoption of the following measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Priority measures 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kyrgyzstan take, as a matter of 
priority and with the assistance and support of the international community, all 
appropriate measures to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, the threats that uranium 
tailings, toxic waste dumps, obsolete or banned pesticides and mercury waste pose to 
the enjoyment of human rights of thousands of people living close to these sites.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Such measures should include the relocation of the most dangerous uranium 
tailings and persistent-organic-pollutant pesticides to more secure locations and the 
rehabilitation of abandoned mines, uranium tailings and waste storage facilities to 
prevent soil and water contamination caused by the seepage and leaking of radioactive 
and toxic materials.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Existing facilities for the storage of radioactive and hazardous waste and 
banned pesticides should be fenced off, marked with warning signs and controlled by 
armed guards in order to prevent unauthorized access by the population to 
contaminated materials. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the lack of comprehensive 
information on the radiological or ecological safety of radioactive and hazardous 
waste storage facilities and the potential risks they pose to local populations and the 
environment has so far hampered the efforts undertaken by the country to protect 
affected individuals and communities from the impact of radioactive and hazardous 
materials on their human rights, including the right to life, the right to health and the 
right to a safe environment.

<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Kyrgyzstan to 
implement, as a matter of priority and with the technical support of the United 
Nations Institute for Training and Research and the United Nations Environment 
Programme, the action plan on primary mercury mining in Kyrgyzstan. In view of the 
serious adverse impact that mercury may have on public health and the environment, 
the Special Rapporteur urges the country to consider closing, as soon as reasonably 
practicable, the mine in Khaidarkan, and replacing the present mercury mining 
operations with other viable economic activities.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on Kyrgyzstan to develop and implement, in close 
consultation with the affected local communities, programmes aimed at improving the 
socio-economic conditions in villages and towns that once relied heavily on the 
uranium and mercury ore mining and processing industries. Priority actions should 
include the creation of new employment opportunities and the improvement of access 
to education, health care and safe drinking water.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on Kyrgyzstan to finalize the adoption of the 
draft environmental code. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kyrgyzstan review and expand its 
regulatory framework on radioactive waste management and radiation safety in order 
to ensure its consistency with international norms and standards on radiation safety 
and the security of radioactive sources.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The Special Rapporteur also recommends that Kyrgyzstan review its 
normative framework on chemicals management, and consider adopting a 
comprehensive law on chemicals management. Such a law should rationalize existing 
norms, standards and procedures to protect human health and the environment from 
the threats arising from the unsound handling, management, use, transport and 
disposal of hazardous chemical products. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Considering that the country is situated at the upper portion of the region&#8217;s 
water basins, and taking into account the transboundary threat posed by radioactive 
and toxic wastes stored on its territory, the Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government of Kyrgyzstan to consider ratifying the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary 
Watercourses and International Lakes and its Protocol on Water and Health.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes that the role and functions of the various 
institutions responsible for the implementation and enforcement of national legislation 
on radioactive waste and chemicals management at the central, provincial and local 
levels should be better defined, and appropriate mechanisms should be developed in 
order to ensure better coordination and cooperation among these institutions.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> As recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
Kyrgyzstan should consider establishing an independent regulatory body with overall 
responsibility for radioactive waste management and radiation safety, and allocate 
adequate human, financial and technical resources to enable it to carry out its 
functions.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>91.<b> The Government should also consider reviewing the status of the State Agency 
for Environmental Protection and Forestry, with a view to raising it to that of a 
ministry. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Enforcement and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kyrgyzstan provide, with the 
support of the donor community, adequate human, technical and financial resources 
to the ministries, State agencies, and local authorities which are responsible for the 
implementation and enforcement of national legislation on radioactive waste and 
chemicals management.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Government should also allocate, with the support of the donor 
community, adequate financial resources, technical means and expertise to State-
owned analytical laboratories, so as to improve their capacity to ensure accurate 
measurements of radiation and chemical pollution.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on relevant international organizations such as 
the World Health Organization and IAEA to organize professional trainings for staff 
of analytical laboratories and provide laboratories with state-of-the-art equipment 
needed to monitor radioactivity levels and to calibrate the instruments used for 
measuring radioactivity. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The current system of environmental inspections should be reviewed. Existing 
restrictions on access to industrial sites should be eliminated, and inspection 
authorities should be granted the power to carry out, in addition to the annual 
planned inspection, additional inspections without prior notice whenever the safety 
situation at the industrial site so requires. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kyrgyzstan adopt all appropriate 
measures to combat the illegal import and export of hazardous products, including 
mercury and banned pesticides, to and from the country, including the allocation of 
adequate human and financial resources to custom authorities and the provision of 
training opportunities for custom officials. The country should also strengthen its 
capacity to prosecute and punish environmental crimes by, inter alia, organizing 
appropriate training opportunities for judges and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Right to information and participation 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> People living near radioactive or hazardous waste storage facilities are often 
unaware of the serious risks that long-term exposure to radioactive or toxic materials 
or substances poses to their health and the environment. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that Kyrgyzstan ensure, through public information and awareness-
raising campaigns, access to information on the status of tailings and waste dumps, on 
the adverse effects of exposure to radioactive materials or hazardous substances, and 
on the safety measures to minimize these risks.  
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Information on chemical products sold in the country should be available, 
accessible, user-friendly, adequate and appropriate to the needs of all stakeholders. 
People handling hazardous chemicals, such as farmers and employees in the chemical 
or energy sector, should receive appropriate information and training on such 
chemicals and their intrinsic properties, and on how to use them in ways that 
minimize adverse health consequences. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to consider ratifying the Convention concerning Safety in the Use of 
Chemicals at Work, 1990 (No. 170) of the International Labour Organization. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Kyrgyzstan should develop a detailed strategy or an action plan for the 
implementation of the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in 
Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus 
Convention). Such a plan should envisage the organization of adequate training 
opportunities and information campaigns to familiarize civil servants and the general 
public with the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that better assessment and prioritization of 
required action at the country level is needed in order to ensure a more efficient use of 
international financing and technical assistance in the areas of radioactive waste and 
chemicals management.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> He also wishes to emphasize that, in accordance with the Charter of the United 
Nations, international cooperation for the realization of civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights is an obligation of all States. He therefore calls on the donor 
community, international and regional organizations, financial institutions and the 
private sector to continue to provide the Government of Kyrgyzstan with assistance 
and financial support in order to enable it to strengthen the protection of individuals 
and communities within its jurisdiction from the adverse effects of uranium tailings, 
obsolete or banned pesticides, mercury and other hazardous wastes.
