<p> I. Introduction.............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="4">1. In 2004, the Government of the United States, through the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), launched the Rescue and Restore Victims of Trafficking campaign 
as a national effort to raise awareness about human trafficking through the media, 
coalition&#8211;building and training. This campaign also includes the National Human 
Trafficking Resource Centre (NHTRC), a 24-hour national telephone and e-mail hotline 
that provides victims of trafficking with assistance, law enforcement, social services 
providers and good Samaritans. From December 2007 through September 2008 alone, 
NHTRC received a total of 4,147 calls, including 553 tips regarding possible human 
trafficking incidents, 398 requests for victim care referrals, 949 calls seeking general 
human trafficking information, and 167 requests for training and technical assistance. Of 
calls referencing potential trafficking situations, 40 per cent referenced trafficking of 
foreign nationals, while nearly 18 per cent referenced trafficking of United States citizens 
or legal permanent residents. HHS also initiated a United States Domestic Trafficking in 
Persons Notification Pilot Program to increase public awareness of and victim assistance 
for United States citizens and legal permanent resident who are victims of trafficking. The </footnote> 3

that relate to trafficking is a challenge found by the Irish Human Rights Commission. The 
Commission has also noticed a lack in consistency and interpretation in application of the 
indicators of a trafficking victim. The Islamic Human Rights Commission faces a number 
of challenges, including a lack of any comprehensive laws on prevention, a lack of a single 
and unified definition on the issue, a lack of supportive measures to protect victims, a lack 
of training courses, the existence of discriminatory laws, a lack of monitoring and a lack of 
a comprehensive database to gather information. The Islamic Human Rights Commission 
itself lacks sufficient means to take effective action. The National Human Rights 
Commission of Nepal reported that challenges to its work include a lack of skilled human 
resources and coordination, a weak network of NGOs, lack of integration between policy 
and practice and a lack of a national database.

<p>  B. Good practices and opportunities when applying a human rights-based  
   approach to criminal justice responses ...........................................................  33&#8211;<footnote name="3">4. Jamaica highlighted the need for a dedicated taskforce within the national police to 
deal with human trafficking and robust anti-trafficking legislation to ensure that the 
Government allocates more funds for investigation and to increase the vigour with which 
perpetrators are prosecuted. In Germany, the Principles and Guidelines correspond to the 
German standards and have already been incorporated into daily police work. Cooperation 
between police and specialized NGOs has proven to be a successful practice to further 
improve the incorporation of a human rights perspective into the practical application of the 
Principles and Guidelines to combat trafficking in women. For example, the impact of anti-
trafficking measures on the crime situation is measured each year via the annual situation 
report on trafficking in persons, which is published by the Bundeskriminalamt 
(www.bk.de). The Federal Criminal Police Office has also initiated research programmes 
carried out either by the Institute of Criminology or by a commissioned institution. In 
Mauritius, a Child Protection Unit has been set up in collaboration with the Police 
Department to provide immediate assistance, as appropriate, and protection to child victims 
of abuse, especially sexual abuse. Also, a Day Care/Drop-in Centre was launched in 
December 2003 in Bell Village, Mauritius, to assist child victims of sexual abuse and </footnote>7 11

<p>  C. Good practices and opportunities when applying a human rights-based  
   approach to prevention ...................................................................................  38&#8211;<footnote name="4">0. In Canada in 2009 the Minister of Public Safety announced a partnership with the 
Canadian Crime Stoppers Association to launch a national awareness campaign. The 
partnership provides access to Crime Stoppers&#8217; national 1-800 tip-line. Canada also 
reported on its commitment to comprehensive implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) policy on combating trafficking in human beings. This policy 
represents a political commitment to prohibit forces and civilian personnel deployed under 
NATO command from engaging in human trafficking activities or facilitating them. Efforts 
are being undertaken to ensure that the necessary knowledge, values and skills are provided 
to all Canadian Forces members and civilian contractors engaged on international missions, 
such as the anti-trafficking training which was provided to all law enforcement officers who 
were selected to participate in the international peacekeeping missions in Haiti and C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire.

</p>
<p>  D. Challenges in applying a human rights-based approach .................................  47&#8211;<footnote name="5">6. Anti-trafficking policies cannot succeed without a human rights framework that 
changes the paradigm of how law enforcement officials and civil society view trafficking 
victims and those who participate in their exploitation by creating the demand that fuels the 
market, noted The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women. It pointed out that a strong 
way to promote collaboration at the national level is to demonstrate coherence at the 
international level by various United Nations agencies and in particular UNODC and 
OHCHR, for example, working together to promote a rights-based approach to trafficking. 
The inclusion of the benchmarks in the Principles and Guidelines in the terms of any 
established mechanism to review the United Nations Convention on Transnational 
Organized Crime would be one effective and tangible way of achieving such coherence. In 
addition, the Global Alliance referred to the appropriation of the &#8220;rights&#8221; discourse by 
States who talk of implementing a &#8220;rights-based approach&#8221; without upholding human rights 
in their anti-trafficking responses in practice. Without addressing broader abuses of 
migrants trafficking will continue apace.  </footnote>7 15 </p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 11/3 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in which the Council requests the 
Office of the High Commissioner to organize a &#8220;two-day seminar aimed at identifying 
opportunities and challenges in the development of rights-based responses to trafficking in 
persons with a view to acknowledging emerging good practice and further promoting the 
practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking&#8221; (para. 9). In accordance with the resolution, a seminar was held in 
Geneva on 27 and 28 May 2010.,   
</p>
<p>2. In addition, the Human Rights Council further requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner &#8220;to disseminate the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking, and to collect the views of the stakeholders, including 
Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized 
agencies and programmes, regional bodies, non-governmental organizations and national 
human rights institutions, on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines, as well as on 
experiences and emerging good practices while applying them, and to make available to the 
Council a compilation of these views as an addendum&#8221; to the report from the two-day 
seminar (A/HRC/15/27).  
</p>
<p>3. To inform the compilation, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) requested the views of the various stakeholders by note verbale in July 2009. 
The present report was prepared on the basis of information received from Member States, 
namely:1 Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Indonesia, 
Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Panama, Qatar, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic, Togo, United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and Uruguay. Information has 
also been received from other sources, including: United Nations entities, such as the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Development 
Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice 
Research Institute (UNICRI); intergovernmental organizations, namely: the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE), including the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, 
the Council of Europe and the Organization of the Islamic Conference; non-governmental 
organizations such as ECPAT International, Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, 
Coalition against Trafficking in Women and International Federation Terre des Hommes; 
and national human rights institutions from India, Ireland, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Luxembourg, Nepal and Spain. The present report also takes note of the contributions to the 
two-day seminar.  
</p>
<p>4. The report is structured as follows: section II provides a brief introduction and 
background to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, while section III constitutes a compilation of experiences and emerging good 
practice with respect to applying a human rights-based approach in the context of 
identification, victim protection, criminal justice responses and prevention. Finally, the 
compilation also highlights challenges identified by stakeholders in applying a human 
rights-based approach to human trafficking.  
</p>

 1  Information received from Member States is available for consultation at the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1

</p>
<p><b> II. Introducing the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>5. In July 2002 the High Commissioner for Human Rights transmitted a set of 
Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking to the 
Economic and Social Council (E/2002/68/Add.1). In her report accompanying this 
document, the High Commissioner explained that development of the Principles and 
Guidelines was the response of her Office to the clear need for practical, rights-based policy 
guidance on the trafficking issue. She noted that OHCHR had adopted the Principles and 
Guidelines as a framework and reference point for its own work on this issue and 
encouraged States and intergovernmental organizations to make use of them in their own 
efforts to prevent trafficking and to protect the rights of trafficked persons (E/2002/68, para. 
62). 
</p>
<p>6. The Principles and Guidelines are the result of a wide-ranging, informal consultation 
involving individual experts and practitioners, as well as representatives of United Nations 
agencies and programmes and other intergovernmental organizations working on 
trafficking and related issues. Their purpose is to promote and facilitate the integration of a 
human rights perspective into national, regional and international anti-trafficking laws, 
policies and interventions. 
</p>
<p>7. As the title suggests, the Principles and Guidelines are divided into two parts. The 
first part contains 17 principles which, taken together, are intended to provide a solid basis 
for the development, implementation and evaluation of a rights-based response to 
trafficking. The principles have been designed for use as a checklist against which laws, 
policies and interventions can be measured. The principles are organized under four 
headings: the primacy of human rights; preventing trafficking; protection and assistance; 
and criminalization, punishment and redress. The principles included under the first 
heading are applicable to intervention at all stages of the trafficking cycle: recruitment, 
transportation and subjection to exploitation. The principles included under the subsequent 
three headings identify the object and parameters of intervention at different times in the 
cycle of trafficking: preventive measures before a person becomes trafficked; measures for 
the protection of and assistance to persons who have become trafficked; and criminal and 
civil proceedings against traffickers. 
</p>
<p>8. The second part of the document contains a series of 11 guidelines, most of which 
relate back to and expand upon one or more of the principles. The guidelines are intended 
to provide practical direction to States, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and others on the steps that can be taken to ensure that the key 
principles are translated into effective and realistic responses. The Principles and 
Guidelines establish a framework for good practice and, using accepted international legal 
standards, provide more specific and detailed guidance for States in areas such as 
legislation, criminal justice responses, victim detention and victim protection and support. 
</p>
<p><b>  Use of the Principles and Guidelines by United Nations agencies and 
others 
</b></p>
<p>9. Since 2002 the Principles and Guidelines have been cited in numerous policy 
documents and interpretive texts including, most significantly, the <i>Legislative Guides for 
the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime and the Protocols thereto</i>2 (UNODC) and the commentary on the provisions of the

practice with respect to applying a human rights-based approach in the context of 
identification, victim protection, criminal justice responses and prevention.  </footnote>. </p>

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.<b>3</b> 
Resolutions adopted by various European bodies and the Organization of American States 
have recommended that the Principles and Guidelines be used in integrating human rights 
as a normative framework for counter-trafficking work. There is wide support for and use 
of the Principles and Guidelines amongst the United Nations agencies most involved in this 
issue, including the Division for the Advancement of Women, UNICEF, UNIFEM, the 
United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking in the Greater Mekong Sub-
region (UNIAP), the United Nations Development Programme, UNICRI,<b>4</b> UNODC and the 
ILO.<b>5</b> The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children has 
adopted the Principles and Guidelines as a foundation and a framework for her work and 
has been using them as a tool for assessment and review of specific situations at the country 
level and in evaluating the effectiveness of national and regional anti-trafficking strategies. 
Intergovernmental organizations, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union and IOM, as well 
as non-governmental organizations, including Amnesty International, Anti-Slavery 
International, Human Rights Watch, Global Rights, ECPAT International, Physicians for 
Human Rights, Save the Children, and the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, have 
referred to the Principles and Guidelines in their research and advocacy efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Experiences and emerging good practice in applying the 
Recommended Principles and Guidelines  
</b></p>
<p>10. The majority of the respondents affirmed in their responses that a human rights-
based approach to combating trafficking now enjoys widespread support and that there is 
growing agreement as to the key elements of an effective rights-based approach to 
trafficking. Generally, the replies indicated that the Principles and Guidelines have been 
instrumental in guiding the development of rights-based responses and are widely used in 
shaping strategies and actions against trafficking and ensuring the incorporation of a human 
rights approach in law and policy. 
</p>
<p>11. In terms of legal development, Algeria, Guatemala, Guyana and the Syrian Arab 
Republic, among others, have been guided by a human rights-based approach in general 
and the Principles and Guidelines in particular when developing or revising anti-trafficking 
legislation. For example, Guyana has been guided by the Principles and Guidelines in 
implementing anti-trafficking strategies such as the 2005 Combating Trafficking in Persons 
Act.  
</p>
<p>12. In the area of policy development, Bahrain, Finland, Spain and Qatar and others 
indicate that the Principles and Guidelines have served as guidance. For example, Finland 
revised its governmental action plan in 2008 to fully include the human rights approach to 
combating trafficking. The Ombudsman for Minorities &#8211; serving as the National 
Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings since January 2009 &#8211; has identified the 
Principles and Guidelines as a useful tool in evaluating Finnish anti-trafficking strategies 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 3  <i>Council of Europe Treaty Series</i>, No. 197 (2005). The Convention entered into force on 1 February 
</p>
<p>2008. As of 30 November 2009, 26 States had ratified it and it is open for accession to all States -both 
members and non-members of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p> 4  UNICRI implemented the Principles and Guidelines in particular in the development of training 
curricula, see &#8220;Trafficking in Human Beings and Peace-Support Operations: Pre-Deployment/In-
Service Training Programme for International Law-Enforcement Personnel&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 5  ILO has extensively used the Principles and Guidelines, see: <i>Human Trafficking and Forced Labour 
Exploitation: Guidelines for Legislation and Law Enforcement </i>(Geneva, ILO, 2005); B. Olateru-
Olagbegi and A. Ikpeme,<i> Review of Legislation and Policies in Nigeria on Human Trafficking and 
Forced Labour</i>, (Geneva, ILO, 2006);<i> Combating Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation: A 
Resource Kit for Policy-makers and Practitioners</i> (Geneva, ILO, 2008). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>and activities and making recommendations for improvement. The Principles and 
Guidelines will be used in drawing up recommendations for action to further develop 
legislation and measures against trafficking by the end of 2010. Spain reported that the 
Principles and Guidelines have inspired national policy development, including the Integral 
Plan to Combat Human Trafficking  for Purposes of Sexual Exploitation, which was 
adopted in December 2008. 
</p>
<p>13. Others, including Belgium, Colombia, Estonia and Slovakia, underlined that the 
Principles and Guidelines have guided the implementation of the already existing anti-
trafficking policy framework at the national level.  
</p>
<p>14. Despite application of the Principles and Guidelines as per the above, the responding 
national human rights institutions generally underlined that it is too early to comment on 
the effectiveness of the use of the Principles and Guidelines at the national level, given 
various social and economic conditions. 
</p>
<p>15. The Principles and Guidelines and the human rights-based approach have reportedly 
also played an important role in the development of standards and policy at the 
intergovernmental level. For example, the Council of Europe used the Principles and 
Guidelines to strengthen its Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, 
including in it a number of the provisions enshrined in the Principles and Guidelines as 
legally binding norms. Indeed, the &#8220;Explanatory report&#8221; to the Convention affirms that &#8220;the 
human rights of trafficked persons shall be at the centre of all efforts to prevent and combat 
trafficking and to protect, assist and provide redress to victims&#8221; (para. 125), as stipulated in 
the first principle of the OHCHR Principles and Guidelines. By imposing strict legal 
obligations on parties to comply with the requirements and measures contained in the 
Convention, this legal instrument safeguards and promotes the same values and principles, 
which are enshrined in the Principles and Guidelines. The Convention entered into force on 
1 February 2008. At 30 November 2009, it had been ratified by 26 Council of Europe 
member States,6 and had been signed but not yet ratified by another 15.<footnote name="7">Andorra, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Lithuania, Netherlands, San 
Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. </footnote> The Convention is 
not restricted to Council of Europe members; non-members and the European Community 
also may become Party to the Convention.  
</p>
<p>16. OSCE advocates the human rights-centred perspective, and facilitates its integration 
into national laws, policies and interventions. OSCE also supports the integration of the 
human rights perspective at the regional and international levels. It remains at the core of 
all OSCE programmatic anti-trafficking activities based on the relevant OSCE political 
commitments of 2000-2008. The commitments, starting from 2002, were elaborated taking 
due account of the OHCHR Principles and Guidelines. The OSCE Office for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights has devoted much of its work to promoting the 
establishment of national referral mechanisms in participating States as part of a rights-
based approach to trafficking. The Organization of the Islamic Conference reported on the 
establishment of a permanent independent human rights commission to focus on the 
protection of all human rights, including in the context of combating human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>17. The five responding United Nations entities found the Principles and Guidelines to 
be practically useful, in particular alongside other human rights instruments. UNICEF 
found the Principles and Guidelines to be short, straightforward and easy to understand and 
translate into doable activities with little implementation difficulty. The Principles and 
</p>

</p>
<p>France, Georgia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of 
Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Guidelines are of practical assistance in working with Member States, and UNICEF uses 
them alongside other human rights instruments and in particular those focused on child 
rights.   
</p>
<p>18. Key guides and publications developed by the ILO use the Principles and Guidelines 
and refer to their provisions. For example, in 2005, the ILO published <i>Human Trafficking 
and Forced Labour Exploitation: Guidelines for Legislation and Law Enforcement.</i> The 
guide highlights the relevance of key ILO Conventions to the successful implementation of 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (Trafficking Protocol) and refers to the Principles and Guidelines, and 
highlights the link between human and fundamental labour rights. In 2008, the ILO 
published <i>Combating Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation: A Resource Kit for 
Policy-makers and Practitioners</i>. The publication refers to the Principles and Guidelines, 
draws from them and emphasizes the importance of addressing the labour exploitation 
dimension of child trafficking. In collaboration with UNICEF and under UN.GIFT, the ILO 
further published, in 2009, the <i>Training Manual to Fight Trafficking in Children for 
Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation</i>, which is based on the Principles and 
Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>19. UNIFEM and UNODC have also used the Principles and Guidelines in developing 
policies and programmes to address trafficking in different regions of the world. For 
example, UNODC advocates for the implementation of the Principles and Guidelines 
across its programmes and projects, more specifically in the UNODC <i>Toolkit to Combat 
Trafficking in Persons</i>; <i>Combating Trafficking in Persons: A Handbook for 
Parliamentarians</i>, which was developed in the framework of UN.GIFT and in cooperation 
with the Inter-Parliamentary Union (April 2009); and in the Framework for Action for an 
Effective Implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, developed by UNODC in cooperation with other 
international organizations, including OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>20. The Principles and Guidelines have also been useful for the respondent non-
governmental organizations. The Coalition against Trafficking in Women, ECPAT 
International and the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women found the Principles and 
Guidelines and the elaboration of the human rights-approach to trafficking vital, and 
welcomed in particular provisions such as those pertaining to partnership between law 
enforcement and NGOs, and underlined the use of the Principles and Guidelines for 
benchmark analysis of good practice. As an example, International Federation Terre des 
Hommes has taken into consideration the Principles and Guidelines and the UNICEF 
Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking in developing campaign work 
and field projects. In conformity with guideline 8 of the OHCHR Principles and Guidelines, 
the Federation&#8217;s field projects are focused on the provision of care and support for 
trafficked children, recognizing thereby their specific rights and needs as children. 
Moreover, in order to avoid negative impact from its anti-trafficking work, especially with 
regard to trafficking across borders, the Federation drafted a policy paper on the &#8220;Return of 
Foreign Unaccompanied Children&#8221; in Europe. This policy paper elaborates further on the 
Principles and Guidelines by establishing criteria for evaluating whether the return to the 
country of origin serves the best interest of the child, or the contrary.

</p>
<p><b> A. Good practices and opportunities when applying a human rights-based 
approach to identification, victim protection and support 
</b></p>
<p>22. In their responses, stakeholders confirmed that victim protection and support lie at 
the heart of the human rights approach to anti-trafficking. Such protection and assistance 
should be provided on a non-conditional and non-discriminatory basis. As the Principles 
and Guidelines make clear, victims should not be criminalized for status-related offences. 
They should also not be detained in immigration centres, prisons or shelters. Respondents 
pointed out that failure to identify victims of trafficking is a serious obstacle to the 
recognition and protection of their rights. Victims must also be allowed to have access to 
remedies, including compensation, for the harms committed against them. Victims of 
trafficking have a right to be protected against further harm. The situation of child victims 
requires special attention to their vulnerabilities and their special rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Member States 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Czech Republic has taken steps to explicitly raise awareness and focus on 
victim protection. Kazakhstan tries to support the victims individually and also cooperates 
with civil society actors in the process. Slovakia emphasizes the need for supporting 
research and developing an effective model of assistance for the victims. Victim protection 
is a primary focus for the United Kingdom, however encouraging victims to report to the 
authorities remains a challenge. The response of the United Kingdom lists a number of 
projects and measures that have furthered the cause of victim protection (such as the 
National Referral Mechanism, the POPPY Project and the Blue Blindfold campaign as well 
as the United Kingdom-launched European Union Action Plan on Trafficking (2005)) and 
elaborates on the central role of the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre. Through 
its experience, the United States has found that &#8220;restoring victims, both physically and 
psychologically, provides the added benefit of enabling them to more fully participate in 
successful prosecution of the people who exploited them&#8221;. The United States emphasizes 
the difficulties inherent in building trust between the victim and his or her case manager 
among the major challenges it has faced, therefore the Government ensures that trained 
professional coordinators and specialists facilitate the provision of services to the victim. It 
points out that the availability of trained translators and the complex needs of the victims 
continue to pose a challenge.  
</p>
<p>24. Uruguay has recently hosted two international seminars focusing on support 
programmes for victims of trafficking. However, it notes the difficulty in increasing the 
number of special services for victims. A number of countries have developed special 
centres to accommodate victims of sexual abuse and trafficking. Qatar points to the need to 
provide victims with shelter, legal support and a right to appeal to the court and to seek 
redress and remedies, medical and psychological support and translation services. The 
Syrian Arab Republic pays special attention to the vulnerable to ensure their integration 
into society and offers them the right support and respect in order to restore their humanity 
and dignity. An emerging good practice in Togo is the cooperation among various actors in 
providing assistance to victims.  
</p>
<p>25. In Lebanon an effective cooperation exists between the<b> </b>General Directorate of 
Public Security and the Caritas-Lebanon association, where Caritas provides financial and 
medical assistance to victims and runs a 24-hour medical clinic, and assists in providing 
women victims of trafficking with temporary shelter and services to address their basic 
needs. The association also works to secure lasting solutions for their future, including 
voluntary repatriation to their home countries. The National Committee of Facilitation was 
formed, including members of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, General 
Directorate of Public Security, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Labour and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>Caritas-Lebanon, under the supervision of the ILO and others, in addition to the 
representatives of the embassies of the source countries for migrant workers, such as the 
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The aim of this committee is to establish a suitable 
legislation to guard the rights of female domestic workers according to Lebanese law. As a 
result, a model employment contract was created and translated in different languages to 
raise the foreign domestic workers&#8217; awareness of the conditions of employment and their 
rights under Lebanese law, before coming to Lebanon, as well as to assist employers who 
hire foreign domestic workers.  
</p>
<p>26. In Madagascar, trafficking of domestic workers for labour exploitation and domestic 
servitude, as well as trafficking of children in the context of international adoption, are 
major problems. The Government has undertaken various actions to tackle trafficking, 
including the production of a film called <i>Fandrika</i>, to raise awareness of different types of 
internal trafficking within Madagascar, particularly of girl children in the rural areas. The 
Principles and Guidelines have been efficiently used to combat human trafficking in 
Panama; with them in mind, the country has developed activities, programmes and 
strategies against trafficking in the area of victim protection and criminal justice, including 
investigations and prosecutions of the crime. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Intergovernmental organizations  
</b></p>
<p>27. OSCE emphasizes that trafficking should be viewed as a human rights problem 
rather than one of law enforcement or immigration control; this way victims are not 
returned to their countries of origin without access to judicial remedies or without 
information on their rights. Victims are failing to seek health or other assistance for fear of 
being criminalized or denounced or deported (OSCE/Office for Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights). The IOM mission in Ukraine provides comprehensive reintegration 
assistance in cooperation with NGOs and a medical rehabilitation centre for victims of 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>28. With regard to the Council of Europe Convention, the main features and measures 
aimed at preventing trafficking in human beings, protecting its victims and prosecuting 
traffickers are the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Convention is the first international legally binding instrument which 
affirms that trafficking in human beings constitutes a violation of human rights and is an 
offence to the dignity and integrity of the human being, therefore respect for human rights 
and the protection of victims are the paramount objectives of this Convention. Victims 
cannot merely be considered as tools to prosecute traffickers - on the contrary, they are the 
very reason why this modern form of slavery is being fought;  
</p>
<p> (b) No other international text defines victims, leaving it to each State to define 
who is a victim and therefore deserving the measures of protection and assistance. In the 
Council of Europe Convention a victim is any person who is subject to trafficking as 
defined in the Convention. The consent of a victim to the exploitation is irrelevant - victims 
of trafficking must be recognized as such in order to prevent police and public authorities 
from treating them as illegal migrants or criminals;  
</p>
<p> (c) Victims of trafficking are entitled to a wide range of mandatory assistance 
measures, in particular, physical and psychological assistance and support for their 
reintegration into society. Victims have the right to receive compensation and State parties 
must adopt legislative and other measures to guarantee compensation. Victims must be 
granted a recovery and reflection period of at least 30 days to recover and escape from the 
influence of the traffickers and to take a decision on their possible cooperation with the law 
enforcement authorities; a renewable residence permit may be granted to victims either on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>humanitarian grounds and/or on the basis of the victims&#8217; cooperation with the law 
enforcement authorities; 
</p>
<p> (d) The Convention provides for the possibility of criminalizing those who used 
the services of a victim if they were aware that the person was a victim of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>29. UNICEF points out that one of the emerging good practices in developing anti-
trafficking initiatives is the substantive (as opposed to tokenistic) involvement of children 
in the development of programmes and initiatives. The right of the child to have his or her 
views taken into account as per article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is 
reinforced in guideline 8 of the Principles and Guidelines. Furthermore, listening to the 
voices of the victims and their experiences ensures that programmes and projects are 
anchored in addressing the needs and gaps as articulated by those who suffered the crime of 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>30. Through a wide range of technical cooperation projects, the ILO seeks to promote 
and implement international labour standards, including standards related to human 
trafficking. Through evaluation of these projects, the ILO has collected information on 
good practices on the prevention of human trafficking and victim protection, such as (a) the 
importance of understanding risk factors that create vulnerability to trafficking before 
planning interventions, (b) the importance of improved access to basic services for 
marginalized groups, (c) comprehensive national plans on action against trafficking that 
cover all forms of trafficking and provide for specific protection and compensation 
measures (including budgetary allocations), (d) regulation and monitoring of private 
recruitment agencies, including agencies recruiting under disguise, (e) the creation of an 
independent rapporteur on human trafficking, (f) the importance of age-specific outreach 
assistance to children at risk of trafficking, including education to children below the 
minimum working age and skills training, job placement services and decent work for 
youth of working age and (g) efforts to improve data collection with due regard to victim&#8217;s 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>31. According to the Coalition against Trafficking in Women, agreements of 
understanding are needed between source and destination countries; demand for 
commercial sexual exploitation should be targeted by creating disincentives and 
decriminalizing the victims of trafficking; success should be measured by monitoring new 
legislation, the extent to which victims have access to services and the quality of services 
themselves.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. National human rights institutions  
</b></p>
<p>32. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) emphasized the following issues:  
</p>
<p> (a) NHRIs to be allowed to report on the issue of trafficking and victim 
protection to the United Nations human rights treaty-monitoring bodies, such as the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, and also to participate in the substantive sessions of the Human Rights 
Council focusing on the issue of trafficking (National Human Rights Commission of India);  
</p>
<p> (b) OHCHR to take the lead in promoting a broad spectrum of initiatives which 
pursue the objectives set out in guideline 11 (Ombudsman of Spain);  
</p>
<p> (c) Identifying the root causes and factors leading to human trafficking, 
according to the region it occurred and adopting special strategies to address and prevent it; </p>

</b></p>
<p>regularly reviewing and evaluating the existing legal capacity to prevent and combat 
trafficking with a view to adjusting and revising laws and practices incompatible with a 
victim-centred approach (Islamic Human Rights Commission &#8211; Islamic Republic of Iran);  
</p>
<p> (d) Victims are often not properly accommodated to suit their needs, however the 
establishment of an Anti-Human Trafficking Unit within the Irish Department of Justice, 
Equality and Law Reform is an example of good practice in strengthening coordination of 
efforts on providing better protection to victims (The Irish Human Rights Commission); 
</p>
<p> (e) Special focus is needed on improving early warning systems for identifying 
potential victims of trafficking, while taking advantage of their stay in administrative 
centres such as border posts or temporary residence centres for immigrants (CETI); special 
measures to identify and assist unaccompanied children, and incorporating the issue on the 
agenda of the regional administrations; to ensure that agencies and public authorities 
change their perception and focus more on the fight against the exploitation of human 
beings and not primarily on the breach of immigration law and on punishing the victims for 
status-related offenses (Ombudsman of Spain);  
</p>
<p> (f) The establishment of an institutional mechanism at the National Human 
Rights Commission of Nepal responsible for the prevention and protection of the rights of 
trafficked persons and the publication of an annual report on the situation of trafficking, 
especially of women and children, have served as mechanisms to monitor the human rights 
impact of anti-trafficking laws, policies and programmes and in particular how they impact 
on victims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Good practices and opportunities when applying a human rights-based 
approach to criminal justice responses 
</b></p>
<p>33. The responses of stakeholders underlined the increasing awareness of the 
fundamental link between criminal justice responses to trafficking and victim protection. 
The majority of respondents emphasized that criminal justice responses to trafficking 
should be aimed at both ending impunity of traffickers and securing justice for victims. 
This section provides a summary of some of the ideas, experiences and emerging good 
practice shared by stakeholders regarding a human rights approach to criminal justice 
responses.

<p>exploitation, including victims of trafficking, and to help their reintegration in society and 
address their needs of recovery. A special hotline has been made available to the public for 
the referral of cases of child prostitution to the authorities.  
</p>
<p>35. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico, in coordination with the NGO Promujer, 
initiated in October 2009 an International Seminar on Violence against Women and the 
Role of Police, which is directed to the federal, state and municipal levels. The seminar 
included a module on issues related to human trafficking, attempting to raise awareness in 
the police bodies on their primary responsibility for guarding the security and immediate 
well-being of the victims of this crime. Uruguay has created the Committee for the 
Eradication of Commercial and Non-Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and 
Adolescents which spearheaded a law that supports the development of plans to protect 
women, children, and adolescents against trafficking, with particular attention to applying a 
human rights approach to criminal justice. Colombia has created a cross-institutional 
committee dedicated to human rights which also advises the national Government on what 
actions are needed to address trafficking. Argentina gives special consideration in the 
criminal justice system to victims of trafficking, in particular women and children. The 
Syrian Arab Republic suggests employing more women in law enforcement to assist in the 
trafficking investigation process. According to Lebanon, signing formal memoranda of 
understanding which establish close cooperation between law enforcement and civil 
society, particularly service providers, is essential. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Intergovernmental organizations and United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>36. OSCE observed that currently not all stakeholders address trafficking as a human 
rights problem but primarily as a problem of law enforcement and immigration control. 
UNODC stressed that the Principles and Guidelines detail a number of elements that should 
be part of the criminal justice component of a national strategy to address trafficking in 
persons. Effective law enforcement must address not merely the application of law in 
individual cases, but also the broader multi-faceted and highly complex issues relevant to 
the origins, causes and effects of trafficking in persons. This requires a collaborative, multi-
agency, long-term, coordinated, strategic action using the participation and input from all 
levels of society, from local communities and NGOs to migration officials and prosecutors. 
The human rights of trafficked persons must be at the centre of efforts to combat trafficking 
and must be protected at all stages of the law enforcement process. For law enforcers, it is 
essential that trafficked persons are not criminalized but instead that their rights are 
respected and their special needs are addressed, while perpetrators are held accountable. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. NGOs and NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p>37. ECPAT International pointed out that the tendency to criminalize victims is a 
persistent problem in many States. The National Human Rights Commission in India 
pointed out good practices emerged from the Action Research which saw a few cases of 
transborder trafficking resolved. Various nodal officers have been installed in each State 
across the country to deal with the investigation and prosecution of trafficking in 
collaboration with welfare agencies. These nodal officers were trained on how to apply the 
Principles and Guidelines.

<p>including unjust and restrictive migration regimes; global trade policies that exacerbate 
inequalities within and between countries; discrimination against vulnerable groups 
including women, children, migrants and minorities; and the demand for the goods and 
services produced through trafficking. The respondents emphasized their efforts to address 
trafficking through applying a human rights approach to prevention, including focusing on 
measures such as ensuring the empowerment of women, tackling poverty and the lack of 
educational and job opportunities, raising awareness, engaging the larger community, 
working with business and training officials, which are all important strategies to prevent 
trafficking and related exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Member States 
</b></p>
<p>39. Estonia places particular emphasis on preventative actions against trafficking and 
generally its preventative work has been successful. The judicial and legislative organs of 
Guatemala, along with representatives of civil society and intergovernmental organizations, 
formed the Inter-institutional Commission for Combating Human Trafficking in 2004. The 
objective of the Commission is to be an inter-institutional body for consultation, 
management and formulation of initiatives and promotion of consensus for effectively 
combating human trafficking in line with international and national law. As a result of this 
coordination and cooperation, Guatemala has developed a comprehensive public policy 
against human trafficking and for protection of the victims, as well as the Strategic Plan of 
Action for 2007-2017. The Secretariat of Public Security of Mexico has a Prevention and 
Assistance Programme for victims of trafficking, targeting civil servants, tourist services 
and commercial port areas, airports, railway companies and border officials, aiming to 
develop strategies and build the capacity of various institutions to combat and prevent 
trafficking.

<p>Notification Pilot Program provided suspected trafficking victims with information 
regarding benefits and services for which United States citizens may be eligible, simply by 
virtue of their citizenship. As a result, eight participating NGOs identified 240 suspected 
United States domestic trafficking victims, all of whom received from the HHS Notification 
programme information on possible assistance.  
</p>
<p>42. The following specific issues were raised by stakeholders: Indonesia emphasized the 
importance of prevention above all; Latvia approaches the issue with educational and 
victim support activities; Qatar uses religion as a form of education in its preventive work: 
religious leaders in mosques explain how Islam prohibits trafficking; New Zealand&#8217;s main 
focus is on prevention, which has formed the basis for the Plan of Action to Prevent People 
Trafficking; Kazakhstan emphasizes the need for strong cooperation on prevention between 
law enforcement and NGOs, particularly in joint information and awareness-raising 
campaigns: in September 2009, the Ministries of the Internal Affairs, Justice, Education and 
Science, as well as the United States Embassy in Kazakhstan and the Feminist League, an 
NGO, organized a theatre show, entitled <i>Night Stars</i>, for students from Astana, based on 
testimonies of victims of human trafficking, the campaign &#8220;Say NO to Slavery&#8221; involved 
distributing leaflets, information booklets and CDs on the issue; Greece shared its 
experience and good practice in applying measures in the field of education, training, 
awareness raising, domestic and international cooperation in order to prevent trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Intergovernmental organizations and United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Council of Europe has established monitoring mechanisms in its Convention on 
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings to assess the success of combating trafficking; 
the IOM mission in the Republic of Moldova measures success in prevention through 
regular monitoring and evaluation of counter-trafficking projects. Among the main 
measures to prevent trafficking in human beings enshrined in the Convention are 
awareness-raising for persons vulnerable to trafficking and actions aimed at discouraging 
&#8220;consumers&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>44. The UNIFEM South Asia Sub-regional Office has extensively used the Principles 
and Guidelines in the design and implementation of its project entitled &#8220;Improving 
protection for trafficking survivors and vulnerable women and children - human rights 
towards the prevention of trafficking&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>45. In 2007 the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women produced a publication 
entitled <i>Collateral Damage: The Impact of Anti-trafficking Measures on Human Rights 
around the World</i>, which was firmly based on principle 3 of the OHCHR Principles and 
Guidelines. That principle states that anti-trafficking measures &#8220;shall not adversely affect 
the human rights and dignity of persons, in particular the rights of those who have been 
trafficked, and of migrants&#8221;. <i>Collateral Damage</i> was developed in response to the request 
in guideline 3 that States, intergovernmental organizations and NGOs monitor and evaluate 
&#8220;the relationship between the intention of anti-trafficking laws, policies and interventions, 
and their real impact&#8221; and distinguish &#8220;between measures which actually reduce trafficking 
and measures which may have the effect of transferring the problem from one place or 
group to another&#8221;. Through this research, the organization reportedly found that very few 
Government agencies, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and others working in the 
anti-trafficking field have heeded much of the advice of the Principles and Guidelines to 
date. </p>

<p>46. In Nepal, evidence show that trafficking is increasing and the importance of 
effective reporting and monitoring activities is particularly emphasized (National Human 
Rights Commission of Nepal); part of the Spanish action outlined by the Ombudsman of 
Spain has been focused on improving early warning and protection of potential victims of 
trafficking. The Ombudsman reports that Spain has implemented laws emphasizing a plan 
of action to prevent trafficking, as well as assistance and protection to the victims. Spain 
has integrated various recommendations to separate prevention and the treatment and 
assistance given to victims, as a way to streamline prevention, services offered to victims, 
and the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Challenges in applying a human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>47. Despite significant progress in the field of anti-trafficking, challenges remain 
regarding the full application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking. This section provides a summary of the issues identified as 
challenges by different stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Member States 
</b></p>
<p>48. For Germany the major challenge in anti-trafficking is to reach a political consensus 
over the measures to be taken to combat it. A constant challenge in implementing anti-
trafficking policies is to find a balance between these different areas of interest, while 
ensuring that the human rights approach is the guiding principle for all measures taken.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. Specific issues which pose challenges, raised by the stakeholders in their responses, 
included the following: the collection of reliable and comparable statistical data is a 
challenge (Austria, Serbia, Spain); the collection of reliable data and the exchange of 
information, in particular on the issue of trafficking for labour exploitation, needs to be 
strengthened (Germany); effective awareness-raising (Austria, Bangladesh, Uruguay and 
Qatar) and addressing the root causes, such as eradicating poverty (Bangladesh); the 
identification of victims, how to reach the yet unrecognized victims, how to investigate and 
prosecute the perpetrators when victims are just passing through/transiting the country 
(Finland); more effort should be made to sensitize civil society actors about human 
trafficking, emphasizing that the problem goes beyond the area of sexual exploitation and 
that victims should be aware of this (Colombia); difficulty in distinguishing between 
trafficking and other similar crimes, such as migrant smuggling, resulting in unnecessary 
expenditure; the need for annual training seminars due to high turnover in the members of 
the media (Guyana); difficulty for developing countries who face serious economic 
constraints which are likely to impede the necessary steps to tackle trafficking (Jamaica). 
</p>
<p>50. Indonesia noted the low level of knowledge and awareness of human rights and 
trafficking among the general public and lack of trained and qualified professionals 
involved in anti-trafficking; improving coordination between sectoral and regional agencies 
on counter-trafficking, given the vastness of the geographical area covered; lack of 
sufficient and dedicated funding to anti-trafficking activities, especially limited funding to 
develop special social rehabilitation programmes for women and child victims of 
trafficking; the lengthy process and time involved in rehabilitation of victims of trafficking 
in particular; limited number of specialized officials based in the regions and districts; still 
limited engagement of local governments in implementing the strategies of the central 
Government on anti-trafficking; the need to undertake capacity-building programmes for 
social workers; and the need to further develop the monitoring of victims upon return to 
their families.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>51. Further, respondents identified the following issues: insufficient financing hinders 
the full implementation of the Principles and Guidelines (Latvia, IOM-Ukraine); political 
instability limits countries from adopting legislation that addresses human trafficking 
(Lebanon); addressing the existing sociocultural circumstances that render the status of 
women and children more disadvantaged than that of men, and eradicating poverty (Togo); 
strengthening the horizontal cooperation between similar institutions of various countries; 
setting up special victim-centred programmes; ensuring a constant level of adequate human 
resources with a higher degree of training; securing financial resources and ensuring the 
adequate implementation of its own migration law (Panama); societal and cultural values 
often make victims unwilling to report the crime; increase in trafficking, particularly for 
sexual exploitation, in the context of migration during situations of armed conflict (Syria); 
intense migration flow since 2000, increasing the number of individuals pushed by poverty 
and necessity into the hands of traffickers; sensitizing the general public to the dangers of 
trafficking in order to establish a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; attitude; establishing an adequate support 
system for the victims, which should include social, labour and legal aspects of protection 
(Spain); officials involved in applying anti-trafficking legislation need to be trained on the 
victim-centred approach in order to provide greater assistance to victims (Qatar); 
difficulties in encouraging victims to report or to support criminal proceedings and the 
hidden nature of the crime (United Kingdom, Madagascar); asset confiscation is not 
possible without a financial investigation process (Ukraine); availability of translators, 
especially if a victim&#8217;s native language is lesser known; complications inherent in building 
trust between a traumatized victim and his/her case manager; victims&#8217; complex needs, 
especially when a group of victims strains an NGO service provider&#8217;s capacity; and 
ensuring that all levels of law enforcement are trained to identify and protect potential 
victims, rather than to treat them as criminals (United States); creating adequate databases 
to record the trafficking phenomenon. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Intergovernmental organizations and United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>52. IOM in the Republic of Moldova and Georgia noted the difficulty in identifying 
victims of trafficking and the definition of trafficking itself, given that the Principles and 
Guidelines have adopted the Trafficking Protocol definition, which is a crime-orientated 
approach. UNICEF pointed out that challenges lie in the insufficient advocacy and 
promotion of the use of the Principles and Guidelines as a practical tool for practitioners 
tasked with the responsibility of combating trafficking. UNICRI finds it hard to measure 
results and qualitative data of the phenomenon because of the diverse national approaches 
and definitions. UNIFEM has encountered difficulties applying the Principles and 
Guidelines stemming from the multiple layers and hierarchy of relevant rights. For 
example, the legal framework in some countries criminalizes trafficking, which serves to 
scare sex workers, who then avoid authorities. The exclusion of civil society organizations 
from contributing to the identification of trafficking victims is evidence that not all States 
view trafficking as a human rights problem; some view it as more of a law-enforcement or 
immigration-control problem. The global economic crisis has contributed to an increase in 
labour trafficking and the lack of initiatives to identify and investigate labour trafficking 
has left many victims wrongly labelled as irregular migrants (OSCE/Office for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights).  
</p>
<p>53. For the ILO, the following issues are particularly pertinent: (a) commitment by 
member States to support the measurement of human trafficking, including child 
trafficking; (b) identification of victims of trafficking for labour exploitation and referral to 
special assistance measures; (c) overzealous application of immigration law that prevents 
potential victims from seeking justice; (d) ineffective enforcement of laws that criminalize 
the perpetrators of human trafficking; (e) lack of awareness among enforcement bodies on 
trafficking and forced labour (including labour inspectorates); (f) lack of effective </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>cooperation mechanisms; (g) insufficient outreach and service provision for hard-to-reach 
children and families at risk of trafficking; and (h) inadequate measures to prevent human 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>54. ECPAT International has identified the following challenges in implementing a 
human rights and child rights approach to trafficking: effective monitoring and evaluating 
anti-trafficking activities; the lack of understanding of a child rights approach by other 
stakeholders (Governments, law enforcement, private sector) has resulted in low 
prioritization of children&#8217;s issues and lack of specialization of services provided to 
trafficked children; despite a commitment to children, the enforcement of laws to prosecute 
traffickers and implementation of child-friendly procedures during investigation and the 
legal process remain weak, with criminalization of trafficked children still common in 
several countries; the lack of resources towards programmes and initiatives in promoting 
and institutionalizing child rights within Governments and other stakeholders is aggravated 
by the current unfolding global financial crisis which is increasing the vulnerability of the 
most disadvantage populations, including children, while resulting in the reduced ability of 
donor countries to provide traditional support for anti-trafficking work; the &#8220;demand&#8221; for 
child trafficking for sexual exploitation is not sufficiently being addressed by Governments.  
</p>
<p>55. According to International Federation Terre des Hommes, many challenges still 
impede a full implementation of the Principles and Guidelines. Identification of child 
victims of trafficking remains particularly weak. There is still a lack of proper investigation 
by law enforcement authorities into whether the involvement of children in begging and/or 
illegal activities is due to children exploitation and/or trafficking. Moreover, even though 
States increasingly refer to a human rights approach in addressing child trafficking, 
practices such as detention and deportation of children are still applied by some. All States 
need to enhance their efforts to address social exclusion and discrimination to ensure a 
better protection of their citizens against trafficking and other severe human rights 
violations. The Coalition against Trafficking in Women recognizes as a challenge that even 
when States adopt proper laws and legal frameworks, the next critical step - implementation 
and appropriation of funds to support anti-trafficking laws - is frequently absent; demand is 
not addressed as a priority: it is not sufficient for States to adopt laws that recognize human 
trafficking as a crime. The Coalition also found that the Principles and Guidelines lacked a 
clear mandate on important points such as the definition of trafficking which, in its view, is 
disparate to the definition in the Trafficking Protocol. Consequently, some States have 
adopted a partial and limited definition of trafficking in their laws, excluding many victims 
from receiving assistance.
