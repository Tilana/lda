<p>Distr.: General 
12 April 2011</p>
<p>Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on 
Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development, including Principle 7, which states that States should cooperate in a spirit of 
global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the Earth&#8217;s 
ecosystem; that in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation, 
States have common but differentiated responsibilities; and that developed countries 
acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable 
development in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment and of 
the technologies and financial resources they command,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the decision to organize, in 2012, the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and taking note of the invitation of the 
General Assembly, in its resolution 64/236 of 24 December 2009, to organizations and 
bodies of the United Nations to contribute to the preparatory process for the Conference, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Millennium Development Goals, including Goal 7, on ensuring 
environmental sustainability, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that good governance, within each country and at the international 
level, is essential for sustainable development, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
development and environmental needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
the human person is the central subject of development and should be the active participant 
and beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of decisions 1/CP.16 and 1/CMP.6 made at the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, held in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, and in particular the seventh 
preambular paragraph and paragraphs 7, 8 and 12 of decision 1/CP.16, and subparagraphs 2 
(c) and (d) of appendix I to decision 1/CP.16, and desirous to contribute positively to a 
successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, to be held in 
Durban, South Africa, in 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can 
contribute to human well-being and the enjoyment of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i>, conversely, that environmental damage can have negative implications, both 
direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and communities 
around the world, environmental damage is felt most acutely by those segments of the 
population already in vulnerable situations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that many forms of environmental damage are transnational in 
character and that effective international cooperation to address such damage is important 
in order to support national efforts for the realization of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that human rights obligations and commitments have the potential to 
inform and strengthen international, regional and national policymaking in the area of 
environmental protection and promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable 
outcomes,  </p>


<p><i>Urging </i>States to take human rights into consideration when developing their 
environmental policies, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in consultation with and taking into account the views of States Members of the 
United Nations, relevant international organizations and intergovernmental bodies, 
including the United Nations Environment Programme and relevant multilateral 
environmental agreements, special procedures, treaty bodies and other stakeholders, to 
conduct, within existing resources, a detailed analytical study on the relationship between 
human rights and the environment, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council prior to its 
nineteenth session; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides</i> to consider the above-mentioned study and possible next steps at its 
nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council under agenda item 3.
