When we use the terms “Silver Bull Resources, Inc.,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Silver Bull,” we are referring to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. and its 
subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. We have included technical terms important to an understanding of our business under 
“Glossary of Common Terms” at the end of this section. Throughout this document we make statements that are classified as “forward-looking.” 
Please refer to the “Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” section of this document for an explanation of these types of 
assertions.
(cid:160)
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of 
Section(cid:160)27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  “Securities Act”), Section(cid:160)21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
“Exchange Act”) and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of 
applicable Canadian securities legislation. We use words such as “anticipate”, “continue”, “likely”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “will”, 
“projection”, “should”, “believe”, “potential”, “could” or similar words suggesting future outcomes (including negative and grammatical variations) 
to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and 
our perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate in the 
circumstances.
Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties and our actual results could differ from those express or implied in 
these forward-looking statements as a result of the factors described under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including:
•(cid:160)  Results of future exploration at our Sierra Mojada Project;
•(cid:160)  Our ability to raise necessary capital to conduct our exploration activities, and do so on acceptable terms;
•(cid:160)  Worldwide economic and political events affecting the market prices for silver, gold, zinc, lead, and other minerals that may be found
on our exploration properties;
•(cid:160)  The amount and nature of future capital and exploration expenditures;
•(cid:160)  Competitive factors, including exploration-related competition;
•(cid:160)  Our inability to obtain required permits;
•(cid:160)  Timing of receipt and maintenance of government approvals;
•(cid:160)  Unanticipated title issues;
•(cid:160)  Changes in tax laws;
•(cid:160)  Changes in regulatory frameworks or regulations affecting our activities;
•(cid:160)  Our ability to retain key management necessary to successfully operate and grow our business; and
•(cid:160)  Political and economic instability in Mexico and other countries in which we conduct our business, and future actions of the
governments in such countries with respect to nationalization of natural resources or other changes in mining or taxation policies.
These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific factors that could affect us.
All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or 
persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no 
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the 
occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Companies
(cid:160)
We are an exploration stage company and do not currently have any known reserves and cannot be expected to have reserves unless and until a 
feasibility study is completed for the Sierra Mojada concessions that shows proven and probable reserves. There can be no assurance that our 
concessions contain proven and probable reserves and investors may lose their entire investment. See “Risk Factors.”

sampling. This material has been found to contain a sufficient amount of mineralization of an average grade of 
metal or metals to have economic potential that warrants further exploration evaluation. While this material is 
not currently or may never be classified as reserves, it is reported as mineralized material only if the potential 
exists for reclassification into the reserves category. This material cannot be classified in the reserves 
category until final technical, economic and legal factors have been determined. Under the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission’s standards, a mineral deposit does not qualify as a reserve unless the 
recoveries from the deposit are expected to be sufficient to recover total cash and non-cash costs for the 
mine and related facilities and make a profit.

Overview and Corporate Structure
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and 
developing mineral properties. The Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. In 1996, our name was changed 
to Metalline Mining Company (“Metalline”). On April 20, 2011, at an annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders approved the change of our 
name to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. The name change became effective on April 21, 2011. We have not realized any revenues from our planned 
operations and we are considered an Exploration Stage Company. We have not established any reserves with respect to our exploration projects, 
and may never enter into the development with respect to any of our projects.
We engage in the business of mineral exploration. We currently own or have the option to acquire a number of property concessions in Mexico 
within a mining district known as the Sierra Mojada District, located in the west-central part of the state of Coahuila, Mexico.(cid:160)

Our efforts have been concentrated in expenditures related to exploration properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, 
Mexico. We have not determined whether the exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The ultimate realization 
of our investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the success of future property sales, the existence of economically recoverable 
reserves, our ability to obtain financing or make other arrangements for development, and upon future profitable production. The ultimate realization 
of our investment in exploration properties cannot be determined at this time, and accordingly, no provision for any asset impairment that may 
result, in the event we are not successful in developing or selling these properties, has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements.

Property History
Silver and lead were first discovered by a foraging party in 1879, and mining to 1886 consisted of native silver, silver chloride, and lead carbonate 
ores. After 1886, silver-lead-zinc-copper sulphate ores within limestone and sandstone units were produced. No accurate production history has 
been found for historical mining during this period.
Approximately 90 years ago, zinc silicate and zinc carbonate minerals (“Zinc Manto Zone”) were discovered underlying the silver-lead mineralized 
horizon. The Zinc Manto Zone is predominantly zinc dominated, but with subordinate Lead – rich manto and is principally situated in the footwall 
rocks of the Sierra Mojada Fault System. Since discovery and up to 1990, zinc, silver, and lead ores were mined from various mines along the strike 
of the deposit including from the Sierra Mojada property. Ores mined from within these areas were hand sorted and the concentrate shipped mostly 
to smelters in the United States.
Activity during the period of 1956 to 1990 consisted of operations by the Mineros Norteños Cooperativa and operations by individual owners and 
operators of pre-existing mines. The Mineros Norteños operated the San Salvador, Encantada, Fronteriza, Esmeralda, and Parrena mines, and 
shipped oxide zinc ore to Zinc National’s smelter in Monterrey, while copper and silver ore were shipped to smelters in Mexico and the United 
States.
We estimate that over 45 mines have produced ore from underground workings throughout the approximately five kilometer by two kilometer area 
that comprises the Sierra Mojada District.(cid:160)

The Sierra Mojada project is comprised of 40 mining concessions consisting of 21,167 hectares (about 52,305 acres).(cid:160)
(cid:160)This includes 11 concessions 
which we purchased, 17 concessions which were granted by the Mexican government and 12 concessions that are subject to option agreements 
which require further payments from us, as described below.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Our concessions are without known reserves and the project is exploratory in nature.
Twelve of the concessions in the Sierra Mojada project are subject to options to purchase from existing third party concession owners.(cid:160)

Ownership of a concession provides the owner with exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to all minerals located on the concessions, but 
does not include the surface rights to the real property. Therefore, we will need to negotiate any necessary agreements with the appropriate surface 
landowners if we determine that a mining operation is feasible for the concessions. We own surface rights to five lots in the area (Sierra Mojada lot 
#1, #3, #4, #6 and #7). The municipality officials indicate that they will grant the necessary agreements to land that we do not own but may be 
necessary for any mine development, although no binding arrangement has been established. We have entered into preliminary agreements with 
other local communities and with private landholders to obtain surface trespass and use rights to drill water wells, to complete and test water wells, 
and to build water pipelines from well sites to our holdings near Sierra Mojada.
Geology and Mineralization
The Sierra Mojada concessions contain a mineral system which can be separated into two distinct zones; The “Shallow Silver Zone” and the “Zinc 
Zone”. These two zones lie along the Sierra Mojada Fault which trends east-west along the base of the Sierra Mojada range. All of the 
mineralization identified to date is seen as oxide, which has been derived from primary “sulphide” bodies which have been oxidized and remobilized 
into porous and fractured rock along the Sierra Mojada Fault. The formation of a silver rich zone (The Shallow Silver Zone) and a zinc rich zone (The 
Zinc Zone) is a reflection of the mobility’s of the metals in the ground water conditions at Sierra Mojada.
The geology of the Sierra Mojada District is composed of a Cretaceous limestone and dolomite sequence sitting on top of the Jurassic “San 
Marcos” red sediments. This sedimentary sequence has then later been intruded by Tertiary volcanics, which are considered to be responsible for 
the mineralization seen at Sierra Mojada. Historical mines are dry and the rocks are competent for the most part. The thickness and attitude of the 
mineralized material could potentially be amenable to high volume mechanized mining methods and low cost production.
November 2011 Technical Report
On November 25, 2011, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (“SRK”) delivered a technical report on the silver mineralization in the “Shallow Silver Zone” 
of the Sierra Mojada Project in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for 
Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”).(cid:160)
and 3,056 long holes. In total, these contain 157,758 assay records, of which 148,950 records contain silver and zinc assays values.
(cid:160) The resource was estimated from 1,107 diamond drill holes, 34 reverse circulation drill holes, 10,611 channel samples
At an economic cutoff grade of 15 grams/tonne of silver for mineralized material possibly accessible by open pit mining and 70 grams/tonne of silver 
for mineralized material possibly amendable to underground mining, the Report indicates mineralized material of 28.564 million tonnes at an average 
silver grade of 50.4 grams/tonne for the silver pit and 0.282 million tonnes at an average silver grade of 110.9 grams/tonne for the underground 
workings.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources.

Sampling, Analysis, Quality Control and Security
(cid:160)
Our activities conform to mining industry standard practices and very closely follow the Best Practices Guidelines of(cid:160)the Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM).(cid:160)
(cid:160)Sampling is directed and supervised by(cid:160)trained and experienced(cid:160)geologists.(cid:160) Drill core(cid:160)and other samples 
are processed and logged using industry standard methods. Standard samples, duplicates and blanks are periodically entered into the stream of

periodically.(cid:160) We use ALS Chemex  - Vancouver laboratory(cid:160)as our primary laboratory.(cid:160) ALS Chemex is ISO 9001:2000 certified.(cid:160) All analytical results 
that(cid:160)are used in resource models are exclusively from the(cid:160)independent primary laboratory.
Our consultants perform technical audits of our operations, including our formal QA/QC program, and recommend improvements as needed. A

We(cid:160)formerly operated a sample preparation and an analytical laboratory(cid:160)at the(cid:160)project that prepared samples for shipment, and performed QA/QC 
analyses to ensure(cid:160)against cross contamination of samples during preparation, and removed most low -value samples from the flow to the primary 
laboratory.(cid:160) For both cost and perception reasons, the internal laboratory has been shut down and all drill samples are submitted directly to ALS 
Chemex for sample preparation and analyses.
Prior Exploration Activities
We have focused our exploration efforts on two primary locations: the Shallow Silver Zone and the Zinc Zone.(cid:160)
conducted various exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada project, however, to date we have not established any reserves, and the project 
remains in the exploration state, and may never enter the development stage.

After closing the transaction with Dome in April 2010, we focused our exploration activities at Sierra Mojada on the Shallow Silver Zone which lies 
largely at surface. By the end of calendar 2010 an 18,000 meter diamond drilling had been completed.
(cid:160)
The silver contained within the Shallow Silver Zone is seen primarily as silver halide minerals. The zinc contained within the Zinc Zone is contained 
mostly in the mineral hemimorphite and to a lesser amount in the mineral smithsonite. These silver and zinc minerals will probably require a different 
processing plant to recover the contained metals.(cid:160)Intensive geological, mineralogical, metallurgical, and geochemical studies are currently underway 
to better understand the characteristics of the silver mineralization.
2011 Exploration Activities
Drilling Program to Refine the Silver-Zinc Resource Model
Our operations in calendar year 2011 focused on drilling and further defining the Shallow Silver Zone.(cid:160)
drilling was completed primarily on this zone in calendar 2011.(cid:160)
zone of mineralization that is at least three kilometers long, averages about 150 meters wide and about 35 meters thick. It can be seen at surface in 
the western half of the resource area, before dipping at around 10 degrees at the eastern end of the mineralized body. At present, the very eastern 
edge of the mineralization defined so far lies under about 200 meters of alluvial cover.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The entire 3.8 kilometer strike length of the resource appears 
to be amenable to mining by open pit methods.(cid:160)
Centenario Zone is hosted along the “Centenario” fault, a buried east-west trending structure which lies 300 meters to the north of, and runs parallel 
to, the “Sierra Mojada” fault – which hosts the Shallow Silver Zone.

As discussed in Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation we have approved an exploration 
budget of $14.6 million for calendar year 2012. This exploration program includes a planned 41,200 meter drilling program targeting the Centenario 
Zone and the western extension of the Shallow Silver Zone. Additionally, this program includes a planned 5,000 meter underground drilling program 
targeting along the 2.2 kilometer Parrena adit which lies immediately south of the Shallow Silver Zone. The Parrena adit has not been previously 
drilled.
Metallurgical Studies
We have recently hired two metallurgical experts to lead our metallurgical program in 2012. The goal of this program will be to test the silver for heap 
and agitation cyanide leach methods. We will also look to see how any low grade zinc (<1%) which reports with the silver mineralization can be 
recovered. We will also review all of the previous metallurgical work completed on the Zinc Zone.
Continued Improvement of the Sierra Mojada Infrastructure
The Sierra Mojada project office and camp facilities received a major facelift and upgrade in 2011 to improve on the serviceability and utility of the 
facilities and the safety surrounding activity on the grounds of the facility.
Exploration of Land Position
During 2011 we conducted an extensive exploration program on three prospects; “San Francisco”, “Palomas Negros”, and “Dormidos” which lie 
outside the immediate mineralized zone at Sierra Mojada. Initial mapping and prospecting over these areas looked promising. Only San Francisco 
was drilled in 2011, and although intercepting silver and zinc mineralization up to 15 meters in width it is not deemed to be a priority target for 2012. 
Follow up work and drilling are planned on the other two prospects in 2012.
Health and Safety and Environment
A Health, Safety, and Environment audit of the Sierra Mojada project site by outside consultants completed in 2010 and then again in mid-2011 
revealed the project was in need of improved health and safety awareness programs, and facilities.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Training of staff, coupled with new procedures 
and emphasis on safe work practices has greatly improve the safety on the site. New first aid facilities and services provided by trained first aiders 
has also been setup. Since implementing these new safety protocols and awareness programs among employees and contractors the minor accident 
incident rate on the project has been reduced significantly.

Gabon, Africa Licenses and Interests
(cid:160)
We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Dome, own three exploration licenses (Ndjole, Mevang, and Mitzic) each covering approximately 2,000 
square kilometers in Gabon, Africa.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The Mitzic license, the 
Mevang license and the Ndjole license are approximately 150 km east of Libreville, the capital of Gabon.
(cid:160)
(cid:160)These concessions are without known reserves and the project is exploratory in nature.(cid:160)
In November 2006, Dome was granted the Mitzic prospection permit covering 12,800 square kilometers in Gabon.(cid:160)
three areas of the Mitzic prospection permit into three “exploration” licenses, namely the Mitzic exploration license, the Mevang exploration license 
and the Ndjole exploration license, each covering an area of 2,000 square kilometers.

for three years, are transferable and are renewable twice for three year periods. Applications for license renewal were submitted to the government in

The “Mitzic”, “Mevang”, and “Ndjole” exploration licenses take in areas of Archaean basement rocks and Palaeo-Proterozic cover sequences that 
are highly prospective for gold, manganese and iron. An extensive stream sampling campaign conducted by the French geological survey in the 
1970’s and 1980’s identified numerous stream anomalies within these areas that had never been explored with modern exploration methods due to 
the dense cover of equatorial rainforest, low population of the country, and the government’s previous focus on petroleum and forestry. The Mitzic 
exploration license takes in a series of Archaean rocks that include greenstone belts and Banded Iron Formations, rocks and is highly prospective 
for iron ore. The Ndjole and Mevang exploration licenses take in Palaeo-Proterozoic rocks that form part of the Central West African Orogenic Belt, 
and are strongly deformed and metamorphosed to greenschist facies, making them highly prospective for large “orogenic”-type gold deposits. The 
Ndjole license also takes in structural disruptions associated with a second continental-scale structure, the “Ikoye-Ikobe Fault.”(cid:160)

As further set forth below, two of Dome’s licenses, Ndjole and Mevang, are currently being explored pursuant to a joint venture agreement with a 
subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti (“AngloGold”). Dome’s third license, the Mitzic license, has iron ore potential and we are looking for a joint 
venture partner on this license.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Additionally, Dome also has a joint venture interest in the Ogooue license that is owned by AngloGold. Although 
we believe these properties merit future exploration activities, our activities are at a preliminary stage and we do not consider any of the properties 
to be individually material.
(cid:160)
Joint Venture Agreements
In October 2009, Dome and AngloGold, an international gold mining company, entered into two joint venture agreements. The first joint venture 
agreement called the “Ndjole and Mevang Joint Venture agreement” refers to exploration specifically carried out by AngloGold on the Ndjole and 
Mevang licenses which are owned by Dome. The second joint venture agreement called the “Ogooue Joint Venture Agreement” refers specifically 
to exploration carried out by AngloGold on the Ogooue Prospection permit which is owned by AngloGold.
Project management between October 2009 and August 2010 was managed by Dome staff. Effective August 2010 AngloGold assumed the role of 
project manager for both the Ogooue Joint Venture and the Ndjole and Mevang Joint Venture.
Ndjole and Mevang Joint Venture Agreement
Dome is the owner of the Ndjole and Mevang exploration licenses, each comprised of 2,000 square kilometers. Under the terms of the joint venture, 
AngloGold earned a 20% interest by paying Dome $400,000 upon signing of the joint venture agreement in October 2009. AngloGold can earn an 
additional 40% interest by paying Dome $100,000 per year from 2010 through 2012 and by incurring exploration expenditures in the amount of $3.7 
million from 2010 through 2012 at the rate of $1 million in the first year, $1.2 million in the second year and $1.5 million in the third year.(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Once it has earned a 60% interest, AngloGold can earn an additional 10% interest (70% total) by spending $5 million on exploration expenditures 
within two years of earning into a 60% interest as set out above. When the parties have a 70/30 joint venture and if Dome elects not to contribute to 
work programs and budgets, AngloGold can elect to earn an additional 15% interest (85% total) by carrying the project to a completed pre-feasibility 
study. Should AngloGold fail to perform as set out above, a 100% interest in the licenses shall revert to Dome and the joint venture will cease. 
AngloGold is entitled to withdraw from the joint venture after it has spent $1 million on exploration expenditures.
Joint venture dilution provisions apply whereby if Dome is diluted in the future to a joint venture interest of 5% or less due to lack of contribution to 
exploration budgets, its interests will be converted to a 2% Net Smelter Return which can be purchased at appraised value 14 months after 
commencement of commercial production.
A 4,000 meter drill program finished at the beginning of June 2011 on Dome’s Ndjole and Mevang properties.(cid:160)The drilling mainly focused on two 
significant gold anomalies in the Ndjole license which are above 50 parts per billion and both in excess of 5km in length. These anomalies were 
previously identified through mapping and soil sampling in the area and appear to be associated with major lithological contacts and structures in 
the area. Gold intercepts between 1 meter and 13 meters in thickness were encountered with the best intercept being 9 meters at 7.6g/t gold. Most 
intercepts were in the 1 meter to 3 meter range at 1 to 4 g/t gold.
AngloGold currently owns 20% of each the Ndjole and Mevang licences. As of October 31, 2011, AngloGold has incurred expenditures of 
approximately $5.2 million and subject to a payment to Dome of $100,000 on or before October 29, 2012 will acquire 60% of the total project.
Ogooue Joint Venture Agreement
AngloGold acquired a reconnaissance license over an area comprising 8,295 square kilometers in Gabon, Africa. This license was acquired by 
AngloGold for its gold potential. In October 2009, Dome and AngloGold Ashanti entered into a joint venture agreement establishing a joint venture 
in which AngloGold holds an 80% interest and Dome holds a 20% interest.(cid:160)
licensee and assisting with the application.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Dome played a key role in identifying the ground covered by the
AngloGold agreed to spend a minimum of $100,000 on exploration and will fund the first $3 million of exploration expenditures, after which the 
parties will contribute on an 80/20 basis.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Joint venture 
dilution provisions apply and if Dome’s interest in the joint venture is diluted to 5% or less due to lack of contribution to exploration budgets, its 
interests will be converted to a 2% net smelter return which can be purchased at an appraised value 14 months after commencement of commercial 
production.
(cid:160)Should AngloGold not meet its funding obligation, the license will be assigned to Dome.(cid:160)

As of October 31, 2011, AngloGold has spent approximately $300,000 on the Ogooue property. In July 2011 AngloGold applied to reduce the ground 
by applying for an exploration license over areas consider prospect. Dome will hold a 20% interest in this license when it is granted by the 
Government of Gabon.
Gabon Facility
Our facilities in Gabon include three rented offices which double as accommodation for staff. Two of the offices are located in the capital city of 
Libreville, and one field office is located in the village of Ndjole. The Libreville offices include an office-house used by Dome staff to coordinate 
exploration activities involving the Mitzic License, and an office-house used by the Dome-AngloGold Ashanti Joint Venture to coordinate and 
manage exploration activities for the Ndjole and Mevang Licenses. The Ndjole field office is four hours by sealed road due east from Libreville and 
is the main staging point for exploration activities for work on the Ndjole and Mevang licenses. Field based activities from here are run out of tented 
field camps. Electricity for all offices is supplied from the local grid and from light diesel generators for field camps.

Competition and Mineral Prices
Silver and zinc are commodities, and their prices are volatile. During 2011, the price of silver ranged from a low of $26.16 per ounce to a high of $48.70 
per ounce, and the price of zinc ranged from a low of $1,871 per tonne(cid:160)
(cid:160)to a high of $2,473 per tonne. Silver and zinc prices are affected by many 
factors beyond our control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, 
currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political 
and economic conditions and other factors. The competitive nature of the business and the risks we are therefore faced with are discussed further in 
the item entitled “Risk Factors,” below.
The following tables set forth for the periods indicated on the London Metal Exchange high and low silver and zinc prices in U.S. dollars per troy 
ounce and per tonne, respectively. On October 31, 2011, the closing price of silver was $34.24 per troy ounce. On October 31, 2011, the closing price 
of zinc was $1,871 per tonne.

Government Regulation
Mineral exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, 
development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, 
hazardous substances and other matters.(cid:160)
significant governmental regulation and oversight. We will obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our 
exploration program. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes 
and the regulations applicable to the mineral interests we now hold in Mexico and Gabon.
(cid:160)Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined those activities are also subject to
Environment Regulations
Our activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually 
changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the 
environment. We will conduct our operational compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico and Gabon could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and 
increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, 
additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
During fiscal 2011, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.
Employees
We have four employees and three outside consultants of which all are full time. Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V, our wholly-owned 
operating subsidiary in Mexico currently has 39 employees and consultants who are full time.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V., our mineral holding

Item 1A.(cid:160)
(cid:160)RISK FACTORS
(cid:160)
Our securities are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Our business, operating or financial condition could be harmed due to 
any of the following risks. Accordingly, investors should carefully consider these risks in making a decision as to whether to purchase, sell or 
hold our securities. In addition, investors should note that the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not 
presently known to us, or risks that do not seem significant today, may also impair our business operations in the future. You should carefully 
consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our securities.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS:
We are an exploration stage mining company with no history of operations.
We are an exploration stage enterprise engaged in mineral exploration in Mexico and Gabon, Africa. We have a very limited operating history and 
are subject to all the risks inherent in a new business enterprise. As an exploration stage company, we may never enter the development and 
production stages. To date we have had no revenues and have relied upon equity financing to fund our operations. The likelihood of our success 
must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with an 
exploration stage business, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate and will operate, such as under-capitalization, 
personnel limitations, and limited financing sources.
We have no commercially mineable ore body.
No commercially mineable ore body has been delineated on our Sierra Mojada Project or on our exploration licenses in Gabon, Africa, nor have our 
properties been shown to contain proven or probable mineral reserves. SRK Consulting (Canada), Inc. recently completed a technical report on the 
silver mineralization of the “Shallow Silver Zone” at the Sierra Mojada Project. We cannot assure you that any mineral deposits we identify on the 
Sierra Mojada Project, in Gabon or on another property will qualify as an ore body that can be legally and economically exploited or that any 
particular level of recovery of silver or other minerals from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized. Most exploration projects do not result 
in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits. Even if the presence of reserves is established at a project, the legal and economic viability 
of the project may not justify exploitation.
Mineral resource estimates may not be reliable.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of mineralized material such as silver, zinc, lead, and gold, including many factors 
beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that the recovery of mineralized material will be realized. In general, estimates of mineralized 
material are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined, including:
•   geological and engineering estimates that have inherent uncertainties and the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;
•   the judgment of the engineers preparing the estimate;
•   estimates of future metals prices and operating costs;
•   the quality and quantity of available data;
•   the interpretation of that data; and
•   the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results.
All estimates are, to some degree, uncertain. For these reasons, estimates of the recoverable mineral resources prepared by different engineers or by 
the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. As such, there is significant uncertainty in any mineralized material estimate and actual 
deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may differ materially from our estimates.
(cid:160)
17
(cid:160)
Our business plan is highly speculative and its success largely depends on the successful exploration of our Sierra Mojada concessions.
(cid:160)
Although we hold exploration licenses in Gabon, our business plan is focused on exploring the Sierra Mojada concessions to identify reserves, and 
if appropriate, to ultimately develop this property. Further, although we have recently reported mineralized material on our Sierra Mojada Project, we 
have not established any reserves and remain in the exploration stage. We may never enter the development or production stage. Exploration of 
mineralization and determining whether the mineralization might be extracted profitably is highly speculative, and it may take a number of years until 
production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish 
reserves, extract metals from ore and to construct mining and processing facilities.
The Sierra Mojada Project is subject to all of the risks inherent in mineral exploration and development. The economic feasibility of any mineral 
exploration and/or development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of mineral reserves, proximity to 
infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), anticipated production rates, capital and operating costs, and metals prices. 
Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance of necessary permits, and the ability to raise 
further capital to fund activities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks. Because of our focus on the Sierra 
Mojada Project, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of adverse conditions unique 
to the Torreon, Mexico region, as the Sierra Mojada Project is located 250 kilometers north of this area.
Due to our history of operating losses, we are uncertain that we will be able to maintain sufficient cash to accomplish our business objectives.
During the years ended October 31, 2011 and October 31, 2010, we suffered net losses of $12,237,360 and $9,405,490, respectively. At October 31, 
2011, we had stockholders’ equity of $32,991,122 and working capital of $2,424,936. Significant amounts of capital will be required to continue to 
explore and potentially develop the Sierra Mojada concessions. We are not engaged in any revenue producing activities and we do not expect to do 
so in the near future. Currently our sources of funding consist of the sale of additional equity securities, entering into joint venture agreements or 
selling a portion of our interests in our assets. There is no assurance that any additional capital that we will require will be obtainable on terms 
acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delays or indefinite postponement of further exploration of our 
projects. Additional financing, if available, will likely result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.
We may have difficulty meeting our current and future capital requirements.
Our management and our board of directors monitor our overall costs and expenses and, if necessary, adjust our programs and planned 
expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have sufficient operating capital.(cid:160) We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures for our on-
going exploration efforts at our Sierra Mojada Project.(cid:160)We raised in excess of $3 million during our 2010 fiscal year, increased our cash and cash 
equivalent assets by approximately $14.58 million through the merger transaction with Dome Ventures Corporation (“Dome”) that occurred in April 
2010, and raised approximately $5 million in a private placement in fiscal 2011. In addition, we raised approximately $10.5 million from an offering of 
our common stock to certain investors that occurred in December 2011. However, the continued exploration and possible development of the Sierra 
Mojada Project will require significant amounts of additional capital.(cid:160)In addition, in the event AngloGold funds its exploration commitment under the 
joint venture agreements with Dome, we may require additional capital to further our interests in Gabon.(cid:160)As a result, we may need to explore raising 
additional capital during fiscal 2012 and beyond so that we can continue to fully fund our planned activities.(cid:160)The extraordinary conditions in the 
global financial and capital markets have currently limited the availability of this funding.(cid:160)
markets continue, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.(cid:160) Moreover, as a result of a late Form 8 -K filing in 
2011, we are not eligible to use our “shelf” registration statement during the majority of 2012.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Because of that limitation, our ability to quickly access 
U.S. capital markets will be somewhat constrained.(cid:160)
offerings of equity or debt securities, our business, financial condition and exploration activities will be adversely impacted.

(cid:160)If the disruptions in the global financial and capital
(cid:160)
18
(cid:160)
Our exploration activities require significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered.
(cid:160)
Mineral exploration activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive or extractable resources will be 
encountered. There can be no assurance that our activities will ultimately lead to an economically feasible project or that we will recover all or any 
portion of our investment. Mineral exploration often involves unprofitable efforts, including drilling operations that ultimately do not further our 
exploration efforts. The cost of minerals exploration is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. Our drilling and exploration operations may 
be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather 
conditions, compliance with governmental requirements, including permitting issues, and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and 
services.
We primarily rely on a third party to fund the exploration of our interests in Gabon, Africa.
In October 2009, Dome, which became our wholly owned subsidiary in April 2010, entered into two joint venture agreements with AngloGold for the 
exploration of its Ndjole and Mevang exploration licenses in Gabon. In addition, Dome entered into a separate joint venture agreement with respect 
to a license held by a third party - the Ogooue license. Prior to Dome entering into the joint venture agreement with respect to its license, it was not 
engaged in active exploration operations on its Gabon licenses.(cid:160)The terms of the joint venture agreements require AngloGold to fund the initial (and 
current) exploration costs of two of our exploration licenses in order to earn an interest in the project.(cid:160)Should AngloGold elect not to fund the 
exploration commitments under the joint venture agreements, the entire interest in the licenses would revert to Dome and the joint venture will 
cease.(cid:160)Accordingly, we may have to temporarily or permanently scale back exploration of our Gabon licenses and/or attempt to identify another 
third party to fund the exploration efforts.(cid:160)Alternatively, we could suspend our exploration activities in Gabon altogether.
Our financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican 
peso given our focus on the Sierra, Mojada Project.
Our financial condition is affected in part by currency exchange rates, as portions of our exploration costs in Mexico and Gabon are denominated in 
the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to the Mexican peso will have the effect of increasing exploration costs while a strengthening 
U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing exploration costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. Some of our exploration activities in 
Mexico are tied to the peso. The exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar and between the peso and U.S. dollar have fluctuated widely 
in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. We seek to mitigate exposure to 
foreign currency fluctuations by completing a majority of our purchases in U.S. dollars and holding a majority of our cash balances in U.S. dollars.
THE BUSINESS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION IS SUBJECT TO MANY RISKS:
There are inherent risks in the mineral exploration industry
We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the minerals exploration industry including, without limitation, the following:
•   we are subject to competition from a large number of companies, many of which are significantly larger than we are, in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of mining properties;
•   we might not be able raise enough money to pay the fees and taxes and perform the labor necessary to maintain our concessions in good
force;
•   exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves substantial risks, even when conducted on properties known to contain
significant quantities of mineralization, our exploration projects may not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of ore;
•   the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves that meet the requirements for reporting under SEC Industry Guide 7 is
remote and any funds spent on exploration may be lost;
•   our operations are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations relating to exploration and development, permitting procedures,
safety precautions, property reclamation, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution and other environmental protection 
controls and we may not be able to comply with these regulations and controls; and
•   a large number of factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in metal prices, inflation, and other economic conditions, will affect the
economic feasibility of mining.
(cid:160)
19
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Metals prices are subject to extreme fluctuation.
(cid:160)
Our activities are influenced by the prices of commodities, including silver, zinc, lead, gold, and other metals. These prices fluctuate widely and are 
affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations for inflation, speculation, currency values (in particular the 
strength of the U.S. dollar), global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs in major metal producing regions of 
the world.
Our ability to establish reserves through our exploration activities, our future profitability and our long-term viability, depend, in large part, on the 
market prices of silver, zinc, lead, gold, and other metals. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors 
beyond our control, including:
•   global or regional consumption patterns;
•   supply of, and demand for, silver, zinc, lead, gold, and other metals;
•   speculative activities and producer hedging activities;
•   expectations for inflation;
•   political and economic conditions; and
•   supply of, and demand for, consumables required for production.
Future weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices, which could in turn reduce the value of 
our properties, make it more difficult to raise additional capital, and make it uneconomical for us to continue our exploration activities.
There are inherent risks with foreign operations.
Our business activities are primarily conducted in Mexico, and we also hold interests in Gabon, and as such, our activities are exposed to various 
levels of foreign political, economic and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, terrorism, hostage 
taking, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, labor unrest, the risks of war or civil unrest, 
expropriation and nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits, approvals and contracts, illegal mining, 
changes in taxation policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, changing political conditions, currency controls and governmental 
regulations that favor or require the rewarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase 
supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.
Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico and/or Gabon may adversely affect our exploration and 
possible future development activities. We may also be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, 
foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Failure to 
comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure, could result in loss, reduction 
or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests.
The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our operations. In 
addition, legislation in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and/or Gabon regulating foreign trade, investment and taxation could have a material adverse effect 
on our financial condition.
Our Sierra Mojada Project is located in Mexico and is subject to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks.
The Sierra Mojada Project, our primary focus, is in Mexico. In the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, 
which have resulted in changes to existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico’s status as a 
developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required financing for the Sierra Mojada Project or other projects in Mexico in the 
future. Our Sierra Mojada Project is also subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and worker safety, employment 
standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species and 
other matters. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or 
standards.
(cid:160)
20
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Our exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining 
industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to the Sierra Mojada Project. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies 
or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our financial condition. Expansion of our activities will be subject to the need to assure the 
availability of adequate supplies of water and power, which could be affected by government policy and competing operations in the area.
(cid:160)
The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our financial 
condition. Future changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact 
current or planned exploration activities with the Sierra Mojada Project or in respect to any other projects in which we become involved in Mexico. 
Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption of exploration operations or material 
fines, penalties or other liabilities.
Title to our properties may be challenged or defective.
Our future operations, including our activities at the Sierra Mojada Project and other exploration activities, will require additional permits from 
various governmental authorities. Our operations are and will continue to be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, mineral 
exploration, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, 
mining royalties and other matters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on 
reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that 
the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties.
We attempt to confirm the validity of our rights of title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material 
interest. However, we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. The Sierra Mojada property may be subject to prior 
unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected by undetected defects. There may be valid challenges to the title 
of any of the claims comprising the Sierra Mojada property that, if successful, could impair possible development and/or operations with respect to 
such properties in the future. Challenges to permits or property rights, whether successful or unsuccessful; changes to the terms of permits or 
property rights; or a failure to comply with the terms of any permits or property rights that have been obtained, could have a material adverse effect 
on our business by delaying or preventing or making continued operations economically unfeasible.
A title defect could result in Silver Bull losing all or a portion of its right, title, and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. 
Title insurance generally is not available, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure title to individual mineral properties or mining 
concessions may be severely constrained. In addition, we may be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect 
to our properties. We annually monitor the official land records in Mexico City to determine if there are annotations indicating the existence of a 
legal challenge against the validity of any of our concessions. As of December 2011, there were no such annotations, nor are we aware of any 
challenges from the government or from third parties.
In addition, in connection with the purchase of certain mining concessions, it appears that the prior management of Silver Bull agreed to pay a net 
royalty interest on revenue from future mineral sales on certain concessions at the Sierra Mojada project.(cid:160)
applicability of this royalty interest, but if the royalty remains in effect and applies to concessions on which a significant portion of our mineralized 
material is located, the existence of the royalty may have a material effect on the economic feasibility of potential future development of Sierra 
Mojada project.

We are subject to complex environmental and other regulatory risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay, and potentially 
the suspension or termination of our exploration efforts.
Our mineral exploration activities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our mineral properties are 
located. These regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set 
forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. No assurance can be given that 
environmental standards imposed by these governments will not be changed, thereby possibly materially adversely affecting our proposed 
activities. Compliance with these environmental requirements may also necessitate significant capital outlays or may materially affect our earning 
power.
(cid:160)

(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-
compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their 
officers, directors and employees. As a result of recent changes in environmental laws in Mexico, for example, more legal actions supported or 
sponsored by non-governmental groups interested in halting projects may be filed against companies operating in all industrial sectors, including 
the mining sector. Mexican projects are also subject to the environmental agreements entered into by Mexico, the United States and Canada in 
connection with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
(cid:160)
Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our projects are located may adversely affect our exploration activities, make 
them prohibitively expensive, or prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, 
such as the Sierra Mojada Project, or may hold interests in the future, which are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us or 
previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. We may be liable for remediating any damage that we may have caused. The 
liability could include costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the 
payment of fines and penalties.
We may face a shortage of water.
Water is essential in all phases of the exploration and development of mineral properties. It is used in such processes as exploration, drilling, 
leaching, placer mining, dredging, testing, and hydraulic mining. Both the lack of available water and the cost of acquisition may make an otherwise 
viable project economically impossible to complete. Although the work completed on the Sierra Mojada Project thus far indicates that an adequate 
supply of water can probably be developed in the area for an underground mining operation, we will need to complete an additional water 
exploration program to determine if there is sufficient water available for an open pit mining operation.
We may face a shortage of supplies and materials.
The mineral industry has experienced from time to time shortages of certain supplies and materials necessary in the exploration for and evaluation of 
mineral deposits. The prices at which such supplies and materials are available have also greatly increased. Our planned operations could be subject 
to delays due to such shortages and further price escalations could increase our costs for such supplies and materials. Our experience and that of 
others in the industry is that suppliers are often unable to meet contractual obligations for supplies, equipment, materials, and services, and that 
alternate sources of supply do not exist.
Competition for outside engineers and consultants is fierce.
We are heavily dependent upon outside engineers and other professionals to complete work on our exploration projects. The mining industry has 
experienced significant growth over the last several years and as a result, many engineering and consulting firms have experienced a shortage of 
qualified engineering personnel. We closely monitor our outside consultants through regular meetings and review of resource allocations and 
project milestones. However, the lack of qualified personnel combined with increased mining projects could result in delays in completing work on 
our exploration projects or result in higher costs to keep personnel focused on our project.
Our non-operating properties are subject to various hazards.
We are subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, 
flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or 
destruction of, mineral properties or future production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in our exploration activities, 
asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. We may not be insured against all losses or liabilities, either because such insurance 
is unavailable or because we have elected not to purchase such insurance due to high premium costs or other reasons. Although we maintain 
insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that 
could adversely affect our activities.(cid:160)
negatively affect our activities and the price of our common stock.
(cid:160)The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our activities as described above could
We need and rely upon key personnel.
Presently, we employ a limited number of full-time employees, utilize outside consultants, and in large part rely on the personal efforts of our officers 
and directors. Our success will depend, in part, upon the ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We believe that we will be able to attract 
competent employees and consultants, but no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard. If we are unable to engage and 
retain the necessary personnel, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Competition for these professionals is extremely intense.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK:
No dividends are anticipated.
(cid:160)
At the present time we do not anticipate paying dividends, cash or otherwise, on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Future dividends will 
depend on our earnings, if any, our financial requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends.
Our stock price can be extremely volatile.
Our common stock is listed on the TSX and NYSE Amex. The trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide 
fluctuations in response to announcements of our business developments, results and progress of our exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada 
Project and in Gabon, progress reports on our exploration activities, and other events or factors. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme 
price volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their 
operating performance. These fluctuations could be in response to:
•   volatility in metal prices;
•   political developments in the foreign countries in which our properties, or properties for which we perform services, are located; and
•   news reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance.
We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to 
whether our common stock will sustain market prices at or near the offering price, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of 
common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.
Further equity financings may lead to the dilution of our common stock.
In order to finance future operations, we may raise funds through the issuance of common stock or the issuance of debt instruments or other 
securities convertible into common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of common stock or the size and terms of future issuances 
of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have 
on the market price of our common stock. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued shares, or securities 
convertible into common stock, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective security holders.

Current Year Developments
Sierra Mojada Property
In January 2011, our board of directors approved a calendar year 2011 exploration budget of $9.5 million for the Sierra Mojada Property subject to us 
raising additional capital during the first half of calendar year 2011 to fully fund these exploration activities.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As a result of closing a private 
placement with Coeur d’Alene Mines Corporation (“Coeur”) on June 2, 2011 for net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million, we revised the 
exploration budget to $10.5 million for the Sierra Mojada project. This $1 million increase was completely for drilling and related costs.
The 2011 exploration program at the Sierra Mojada Property was designed to build on the drilling activities of 2010. The aim of the program was to 
further define and extend the Shallow Silver Zone. The Shallow Silver Zone is an oxide silver zone (+/- zinc and lead), hosted along an east-west 
trending fracture-karst system set in a Cretaceous limestone-dolomite sequence. At depth, the Shallow Silver Zone appears to merge with the Zinc 
Zone to form a continuous mineralized body over 4 kilometers in length. The different mobility characteristics of the metals in a low temperature 
oxide environment has resulted in a crude zonation of the mineralized body creating a silver rich zone the Shallow Silver Zone and a zinc rich zone 
the Red Zinc Zone.
Mineralized Material Estimate
On November 25, 2011, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (“SRK”) delivered a technical report on the silver mineralization in the “Shallow Silver Zone” 
of the Sierra Mojada Project in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for 
Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”).(cid:160)
and 3,056 long holes. In total, these contain 157,758 assay records, of which 148,950 records contain silver and zinc assays values.
(cid:160) The resource was estimated from 1,107 diamond drill holes, 34 reverse circulation drill holes, 10,611 channel samples
At an economic cutoff grade of 15 grams/tonne of silver for mineralized material possibly accessible by open pit mining and 70 grams/tonne of silver 
for mineralized material possibly amendable to underground mining, the Report indicates mineralized material of 28.564 million tonnes at an average 
silver grade of 50.4 grams/tonne for the silver pit and 0.282 million tonnes at an average silver grade of 110.9 grams/tonne for the underground 
workings.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources.
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under SEC’s Guide 7, does not indicate 
“reserves” by SEC standards.(cid:160)

material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.
(cid:160)We cannot be certain that any part of the Sierra Mojada project will ever be confirmed or converted
(cid:160) Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized
Drilling
During the 2011 calendar year we drilled approximately 37,000 meters at the Sierra Mojada Property which was focused on drilling and further 
defining the Shallow Silver Zone.(cid:160)This drilling was very successful in defining a near -surface oxide silver-zinc-lead zone of mineralization that is at 
least three kilometers long, averages about 150 meters wide and about 35 meters thick. It can be seen at surface in the western half of the resource 
area, before dipping at around 10 degrees at the eastern end of the mineralized body. At present, the very eastern edge of the mineralization defined 
so far lies under about 200 meters of alluvial cover.(cid:160)

“Centenario” fault, a buried east-west trending structure which lies 300 meters to the north of, and runs parallel to, the “Sierra Mojada” fault – which 
hosts the Shallow Silver Zone.
(cid:160)The entire 3.8 kilometer strike length of the resource appears to be amenable to mining by open 
(cid:160)Additionally, a new zone of silver mineralization named the Centenario Zone was identified. The Centenario Zone is hosted along the
As discussed in the “Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity and Capital” resources section below we have approved an exploration 
budget of $14.6 million for calendar 2012. This exploration program includes a planned 41,200 meter drilling program targeting the Centenario Zone 
and the western extension of the Shallow Silver Zone. Additionally, this program includes a planned 5,000 meter underground drilling program 
targeting along the 2.2 kilometer Parrena adit which lies immediately south of the shallow silver zone. The Parrena adit has not been previously 
drilled.

Geological Mapping
In addition to drilling the extensions on the Shallow Silver Zone, a regional mapping and prospecting exploration program focused on the Palamos 
Negros, Dormidos, and San Francisco prospects is underway. The aim of this program is to identify drill targets in these prospects outside of the 
Shallow Silver Zone. During the second half of 2011 12 holes totaling just over 1,500 meters were drilled at the San Francisco prospect. Due to 
resulted being below expectations management is reevaluating further work to be taken in relation to the San Francisco prospect.
Airborne Geophysics
A 1,700 line kilometer “ZTEM” airborne geophysics survey was completed in March of 2011 by Geotech Ltd. a company based in Ontario, Canada. 
The survey was increased from the original 1,550 line kilometer plan to ensure complete coverage of several magnetic anomalies previously 
identified. Ken Witherly of Condor Consulting, Inc., based out of Denver, Colorado provided QA/QC on the data. The aim of this work is to help 
better define potential drill targets within the wider Sierra Mojada area. The results identified a number of buried structures and better outlined 
several lithological units in the area.
Gabon Property
To date, three main coherent gold anomalies above 50 parts per billion (“ppb”) and over 5km in length and up to 1.5km wide and several smaller 
anomalous zones up to 2km in length and up to 1km wide have been identified. Background gold values in the region are less than 5 ppb and results 
above 20 ppb are considered anomalous. Over 25% of the results received to date are above 30 ppb with peak values in excess of 5,000 ppb in the 
soils. The anomalies appear to have strong structural controls concentrating along mapped or inferred lithological contacts, structural breaks, and 
fold hinges. There is also a strong spatial relationship of the gold anomalies to a thick graphitic lithological unit in the area that is thought to 
represent an ideal lithological trap for mineralizing fluids. Initial prospecting in these anomalous zones has identified a number of gold bearing quartz 
veins, many of which run between 2 g/t to 5 g/t gold.
Exploratory drilling has focused on these gold anomalies. East-west trending drill fences have been positioned to test roughly north-south trending 
lithological contacts which are considered as the most favorable sites for gold deposition.(cid:160)
between 1m to 13m in thickness encountered. The best intercept averaged 7.6 g/t gold over 9 meters. Most intercepts were in the 1 meter to 3 meter 
range at 1 to 4 g/t gold. Anomalous silver and manganese were also encountered in some holes.
(cid:160)A total of 5,000 meters was drilled with gold intercepts
Airborne Geophysics
A 5,000 line kilometer VTEM Geophysics survey was completed by Spectrem Air LTD over the Ndjole exploration permit in March 2011. Results 
show a strong electro-magnetic response that has been strongly folded and deformed.
Mapping
Mapping of the main gold prospects was completed in the Ndjole and Mevang licences at 1:20,000 scale. Detailed mapping at 1:5000 scale occurred 
over areas with drilling to better define lithological contacts and local structure.
A large soil sampling and mapping campaign lead by AngloGold targeting the extensions to the known geology is currently underway on the 
property and will continue into 2012.
Management Changes
During 2011, we made significant additional changes in our management and board of directors:
•   On February 14, 2011, Dr. Nicole Adshead-Bell was appointed to the Board of Directors as an independent director.(cid:160)

Results of Operations(cid:160)
Upon the closing of the Merger on April 16, 2010, Dome became our wholly owned subsidiary. The financial results from Dome are included in our 
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended October 31, 
2011.(cid:160)
statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended October 31, 2010, for the

(cid:160)However, because the merger with Dome did not close until April 2010, Dome ’s financial results are only included in our consolidated
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011, we experienced a consolidated net loss of $12,237,000 or approximately $0.11 per share, compared to a 
consolidated net loss of $9,405,000 or approximately $0.12 per share during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010. The $2,832,000 increase in the 
consolidated net loss was primarily due to a $2,529,000 increase in exploration and property holding costs in the 2011 fiscal year from the 2010 fiscal 
year and a foreign currency translation loss of $349,000 in the 2011 fiscal year compared to a foreign currency translation gain of $1,365,000 in the 
2010 fiscal year. This was partially offset by a $1,622,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses in the 2011 fiscal year from the 2010 fiscal 
year.
Exploration and Property Holding Costs
Exploration and property holding costs increased $2,529,000 to $8,373,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $5,844,000 in the 2010 fiscal year primarily due 
to a significantly expanded exploration program on the Sierra Mojada Property as cash constraints limited the amount of exploration activities in the 
portion of 2010 fiscal year prior to the merger previously discussed.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative expenses decreased $1,622,000 to $3,372,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $4,994,000 in the 2010 fiscal year as described 
below.
Stock based compensation was a significant factor for the fluctuations in personnel and directors fees. Overall stock based compensation included 
in general and administrative expenses increased to $928,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $822,000 in the 2010 fiscal year.
Personnel costs decreased $595,000 to $1,369,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $1,964,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to 
$861,000 of severance expense in the 2010 fiscal year due to change in control provisions in the employment agreements of three former executives. 
This expense was offset by higher stock based compensation, which increased to $587,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $340,000 in the 2010 fiscal 
year. Stock based compensation increased due to the issuance of stock options to the new members of management in the 2011 fiscal year. Also, we 
entered into a severance agreement in the 2011 fiscal year with our former Chief Financial Officer Robert Devers whereby he received severance 
payments totaling approximately $165,000 which was paid in April 2011.

(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Office and administrative expenses of $658,000 in the 2011 fiscal year was comparable to $634,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. Significant costs in office 
and administrative include shareholder relations, costs of maintaining our corporate office and listing and exchange fees.
(cid:160)
Professional fees decreased $113,000 to $589,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $702,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. The decrease relates to additional legal 
and accounting costs incurred in the prior year as a result of the Dome merger and the application for listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange offset 
by additional costs in the current year associated with the dual listings on the NYSE Amex and Toronto Stock Exchange.
Directors’ fees decreased $224,000 to $526,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $750,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a 
$141,000 decrease in stock based compensation to $341,000 in the 2011 fiscal year from $482,000 in the 2010 fiscal year as a result of stock options 
granted to new directors and the pro rata stock based compensation of stock options previously granted in August 2010.
We recorded a provision of $204,000 in the 2011 fiscal year for uncollectible value-added taxes compared to a provision of $929,000 in the 2010 fiscal 
year.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The allowance for uncollectible taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors including the length of time the returns 
have been outstanding, general economic conditions in Mexico and estimated net recovery after commissions.
Other Income (Expense)
We recorded other expense of $465,000 in the 2011 fiscal year compared to other income of $1,430,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. This was mainly the 
result of a foreign currency translation loss of $349,000 in the 2011 fiscal year compared to a foreign currency translation gain of $1,365,000 in the 
2010 fiscal year. These foreign currency translation gains and losses are primarily due to the impact of the change in exchange rate between the US 
dollar and Mexican Peso and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between Silver Bull and our Mexican subsidiaries.
Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
During the 2011 fiscal year we primarily utilized cash and cash on hand and proceeds from issuances of common stock to fund exploration activities 
at the Sierra Mojada Property including property concession option purchase agreement payments and for general and administrative 
expenses.(cid:160)
through the exercise of stock options and warrants. As a result of exploration activities and general and administrative expenses offset by the 
financing obtained through equity transactions, cash and cash equivalents decreased from $10,571,000 at October 31, 2010 to $4,240,000 at October 
31, 2011.
(cid:160)During this period, we received $5,805,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through a private placement to Coeur and
Cash flows used in operations for the 2011 fiscal year was $11,503,000 as compared to $9,297,000 for the comparable period in 2010.(cid:160)
was mainly due to the significantly higher exploration costs at the Sierra Mojada Property and increased value added tax receivable payments which 
were partially offset by reduced general and administrative expenses (excluding stock based compensation) as discussed in the results of 
operations section above.
(cid:160)This increase
Cash flows used in investing activities for the 2011 fiscal year was $398,000 as compared to $1,803,000 in cash flows provided by operations for the 
2010 fiscal year. During the 2011 fiscal year we sold equipment for $443,000, purchased equipment for $143,000 and spent $798,000 on the acquisition 
of property concessions as compared to sales of equipment of $9,000, purchases of equipment for $551,000 and payments of $373,000 for the 
acquisition of property concessions in the 2010 fiscal year. The cash outflow for the 2010 fiscal year was offset by cash acquired in the Merger of 
$2,619,000. Equipment purchases decreased and equipment sales increased in the 2011 fiscal year as we are using external contractors for a greater 
portion of the drilling work on the Sierra Mojada Property and acquisition of property concessions increased due to the execution of additional 
concession option purchase agreements and the escalating payment nature of the agreements.
Cash flows provided by financing activities for the 2011 fiscal year was $5,608,000 as compared to $16,607,000 for the 2010 fiscal year. The 
significant decrease in cash flows is due to the $15,072,000 of proceeds from the issuance of common stock including common stock issued related 
to the Dome transaction during the 2010 fiscal year offset by net proceeds of $4,917,000 for the private placement with Coeur completed in the 2011 
fiscal year.
(cid:160)

(cid:160)
Capital Resources
As of October 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,240,000 and working capital of $2,425,000 as compared to cash and cash equivalents 
of $10,571,000 and working capital of $9,072,000 as of October 31, 2010. The decrease in our liquidity and working capital were primarily the result of 
cash used by operating and investing activities including exploration work and acquisition of additional concessions which were partially offset by 
proceeds received from financing activities including the issuance of common stock and proceeds received on the exercise of warrants. The 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities at October 31, 2011 increased as a result of the additional exploration work on the Sierra Mojada Property 
and timing of payments.
(cid:160)
Since inception, we have relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings of our equity securities and warrant 
exercises as our primary sources of financing to fund our operations. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on sales of our securities in order to 
continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance 
that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned 
business activities. Moreover, as a result of a late Form 8-K filing in 2011, we may not be eligible to use our “shelf” registration statement during the 
majority of 2012.(cid:160)
operations by way of financing, including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, our business, financial condition and exploration 
activities will be adversely impacted.
(cid:160)In that event, our ability to quickly access U.S. capital markets will be somewhat constrained.(cid:160)
(cid:160)If we are unable to fund future
December 2011 Offering
During December 2011 we closed registered direct offerings for the sale or 21,050,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.50 per share for gross 
proceeds of $10,525,000. We paid a 6% finder’s fee totaling $94,500 to a Canadian finder with respect to certain non-U.S. purchasers who were 
introduced by them.
Capital Requirements and Liquidity; Need for Subsequent Funding
Our management and Board of Directors monitor our overall costs, expenses, and financial resources and, if necessary, will adjust our planned 
operational expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have sufficient operating capital.(cid:160) We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures 
including for our Sierra Mojada Property.
The continued exploration of the Sierra Mojada Property will require significant amounts of additional capital. In January 2012, the board of directors 
approved a calendar year 2012 exploration budget of $14.6 million for the Sierra Mojada Property and a $1.9 million budget for general and 
administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $12.6 million in cash on hand, and therefore we anticipate that we will need 
to raise additional capital to fully fund the calendar 2012 exploration program at the Sierra Mojada Property and for general and administrative 
expenses. During calendar year 2012 we will continue to evaluate our ability to raise additional capital and we will reduce expenditures on the Sierra 
Mojada property if we determine that additional capital is unavailable or available on terms that we determine are unacceptable. Also, the continued 
exploration of the Sierra Mojada Property ultimately will require us to raise additional capital, identify other sources of funding, or identify another

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial 
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are 
material to our stockholders.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other”. This new guidance on testing goodwill provides an entity 
the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test 
to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an 
entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. ASU 
2011-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with prospective application required. 
The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-05, “Presentation of 
Comprehensive Income.” This update amended the presentation options in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 220, “Comprehensive 
Income,” to provide an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other 
comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-
05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with retrospective application required. The 
adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. 
GAAP and IFRSs.” This update amended explanations of how to measure fair value to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure 
requirements in U.S GAAP and IFRSs. ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 
2011 with prospective application required. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results 
of operations or cash flows.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06 which provides amendments to ASC Topic 820 that will provide more robust disclosures about 
(1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to establish accounting policies and 
make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These 
financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management. We evaluate our 
policies and estimates on an on-going basis and discuss the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. Our 
consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions.
We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — to our consolidated financial 
statements. Our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. We believe 
these consolidated financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates. Our 
consolidated financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using 
different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts, 
adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application:
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions 
about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial 
statements.(cid:160)
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and assumptions are accounted for 
prospectively.
(cid:160)Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical
Significant areas involving the use of estimates include determining the allowance for uncollectible taxes, evaluating recoverability of mineral 
concessions, evaluating impairment of long-lived assets, evaluating impairment of goodwill, establishing a valuation allowance on future use of 
deferred tax assets, determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the merger with Dome and calculating stock-based compensation.
Property Concessions
Costs of acquiring property concessions are capitalized by project area upon purchase or staking of the associated claims. Costs to maintain the 
mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized, 
using the units of production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves. To date, no mineral concessions have reached the 
production stage.
We review and evaluate our property concessions for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable and any impairment in carrying value is charged to operations at the time of impairment. Should a 
concession be abandoned, its capitalized costs are charged to operations. We charge to operations the allocable portion of capitalized costs 
attributable to concessions sold. Capitalized costs are allocated to concessions abandoned or sold based on the proportion of claims abandoned or 
sold to the claims remaining within the project area.
(cid:160)
33
(cid:160)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
(cid:160)
Long-lived assets, comprised of property and equipment subject to amortization, are assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped and tested for 
recoverability at the lowest level that generates independent cash flows from another asset group. In testing the recoverability of the assets, the 
carrying value of the assets or asset groups is compared to the fair value of the assets or asset groups. An impairment loss is recognized as the 
excess of the carrying value over the fair value when an asset or asset group is not recoverable.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and 
intangible assets acquired.(cid:160)
the date of the business combination, by determining estimates of the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing this amount to the fair values 
of assets and liabilities in the reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized.
(cid:160)When multiple reporting units are acquired in one business combination, goodwill is allocated to reporting units as of
We perform goodwill annual impairment tests at April 30 each fiscal year and when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts 
may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level. In performing the impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of our 
reporting units that include goodwill and compares those fair values to the reporting units’ carrying amounts. If a reporting unit’s carrying amount 
exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying 
amount of goodwill over the implied fair value is charged to earnings.
Income Taxes
We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based on temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted at the 
balance sheet date. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least “more likely than not” that the tax position will be 
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial 
statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
with the taxing authorities. This accounting standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in 
interim periods and disclosure.
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe we have met the “more likely than not” standard 
imposed by this guidance to allow recognition of such an asset. Management recorded a full valuation allowance at October 31, 2011 and October 
31, 2010 against the deferred tax assets as it deems future realization would not meet the criteria “more likely than not”.
Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants
We use the Black-Scholes pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock options awarded to employees, officers, 
directors and consultants.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The expected term of the options is based upon evaluation of historical and expected future exercise behavior.(cid:160)

not paid dividends nor do we anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are 
translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Exchange differences arising on translation are disclosed as a separate component of 
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the results of operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)During the year -ended 
October 31, 2010, intercompany transactions and balances with our Mexican and Gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be short-term in nature 
and accordingly all foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
and comprehensive (loss) income during the year-ended October 31, 2010.
On July 7, 2011, we acknowledged our intention to convert certain intercompany loans totaling $13.4 million to equity. Subsequent to July 7, 2011, 
we no longer recognize foreign currency transaction gains or losses on this $13.4 million portion of intercompany loans in the consolidated 
statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
(cid:160)
Item 7A.(cid:160)
(cid:160)QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Risk
We hold substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions. The interest rates 
received on these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash 
balances during the year ended October 31, 2011, a 1% decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period 
of approximately $37,000.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Certain purchases of labor, operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in Canadian Dollars (“$CDN”), Mexican Pesos, Central African 
Francs (“$CFA”) or other currencies.(cid:160)
appreciation of the Mexican Peso, $CDN or $CFA against the US dollar may result in an increase in operating expenses and capital costs in US 
dollar terms.(cid:160)
we maintained the majority of our cash balance in $CDN. Subsequent to the registered direct offerings in December 2011 we maintain the majority of 
cash balances in US dollars. We currently do not engage in any currency hedging activities.
(cid:160)To reduce this risk as of October 31, 2011, we maintain minimum cash balances in $CFA and Mexican Pesos. As of October 31, 2011,
(cid:160)As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Specifically, the
Commodity Price Risk
Our primary business activity is the exploration of properties containing silver, zinc, lead and other minerals. As a result, decreases in the price of 
any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and develop our exploration properties. None of our 
properties are in production and we do not currently hold any commodity derivative positions.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization and Description of Business
(cid:160)
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose 
of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 
1996, at a special directors meeting, the Company’s name was changed to Metalline Mining Company (“Metalline”). On April 20, 2011, at an annual 
meeting  of  shareholders,  the  Company’s  name  change  to  Silver  Bull  Resources,  Inc.  was  approved  and  became  effective  April  21,  2011.  The 
Company’s fiscal year-end is October 31. The Company has not realized any revenues from its planned operations and is considered an Exploration 
Stage Company. The Company has not established any reserves with respect to its exploration projects, and may never enter into the development 
with respect to any of its projects.
The Company engages in the business of mineral exploration. The Company currently owns or has the option to acquire a number of property 
concessions in Mexico (collectively known as the “Sierra Mojada Property”). The Company conducts its operations in Mexico through its wholly-
owned  subsidiary  corporations,  Minera  Metalin  S.A.  de  C.V.  (“Minera”)  and  Contratistas  de  Sierra  Mojada  S.A.  de  C.V.  (“Contratistas”)  and 
through Minera’s wholly-owned subsidiary Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V. (“Minas”).
(cid:160) As  a  result,  Dome  became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company.(cid:160)
On  April  16,  2010,  Metalline  Mining  Delaware,  Inc.,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  was  merged  with  and  into  Dome  Ventures 
(cid:160)Dome ’s  subsidiaries  include  its  wholly-owned 
Corporation  (“Dome”).(cid:160)
subsidiaries Dome Asia Inc., and Dome International Global Inc., which are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Dome International Global 
Inc.’s  subsidiaries  include  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  incorporated  in  Gabon,  Dome  Ventures  SARL  Gabon,  and  African  Resources  SARL 
Gabon,  as  well  as  its  99.99%-owned subsidiary, Dome Minerals Nigeria Limited incorporated in Nigeria. The Company conducts its exploration 
activities in Gabon, Africa through Dome Ventures SARL Gabon and African Resources SARL Gabon. The Company included the financial results 
of Dome and its subsidiaries in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income effective April 16, 2010.
The Company’s efforts have been concentrated in expenditures related to exploration properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in 
Coahuila, Mexico. The Company has not determined whether the exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The 
ultimate realization of the Company’s investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the success of future property sales, the existence of 
economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain financing or make other arrangements for development, and upon future 
profitable  production.  The  ultimate  realization  of  the  Company’s  investment  in  exploration  properties  cannot  be  determined  at  this  time,  and 
accordingly,  no  provision  for  any  asset  impairment  that  may  result,  in  the  event  the  Company  is  not  successful  in  developing  or  selling  these 
properties, has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which 
assumed the Company will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities, or the impact on the consolidated statement of 
operations and comprehensive (loss) income and balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if the going concern assumption was not 
appropriate.  Management  believes  that  the  Company  has  sufficient  financial  resources,  including  the  proceeds  received  in  the  registered  direct 
offerings  described  in  Note  20  and  the  ability  to  adjust  exploration  activities,  to  sustain  operations  over  the  twelve  month  period  beginning 
November 1, 2011. The Company has not generated any revenue from operations and the Company’s continued exploration activities will ultimately 
require the Company to raise additional capital, identify other sources of funding, or identify strategic transactions.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated 
financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
Basis of Presentation
The  Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“GAAP”) and prepared using the accrual method of accounting.
(cid:160)
F-13
(cid:160)
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany 
accounts and transactions. The wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company are listed in Note 1.
(cid:160)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions 
about  future  events  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.  Estimates  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  based  on  historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and assumptions are accounted for 
prospectively.
Significant  areas  involving  the  use  of  estimates  include  determining  the  allowance  for  uncollectible  taxes,  evaluating  recoverability  of  mineral 
concessions,  evaluating  impairment  of  long-lived assets, evaluating impairment of goodwill, establishing a valuation allowance on future use of 
deferred  tax  assets,  determining  the  fair  value  of  assets  and  liabilities  acquired  in  the  merger  with  Dome  (Note  3)  and  calculating  stock-based 
compensation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the title and risks and rewards of ownership pass to the buyer, the selling price is fixed and determinable, 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collection of the sale proceeds is considered probable. As of October 31, 2011, the Company has 
not recognized any revenues.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investment with an original maturity of three month or less.
Property Concessions
Costs of acquiring property concessions are capitalized by project area upon purchase or staking of the associated claims. Costs to maintain the 
mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred. When a property reaches the production stage, the related capitalized costs will be amortized, 
using  the  units  of  production  method  on  the  basis  of  periodic  estimates  of  ore  reserves.  To  date,  no  mineral  concessions  have  reached  the 
production stage.
The Company reviews and evaluates its property concessions for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
related carrying amounts may not be recoverable and any impairment in carrying value is charged to operations at the time of impairment. Should a 
concession be abandoned, its capitalized costs are charged to operations. The Company charges to operations the allocable portion of capitalized 
costs  attributable  to  concessions  sold.  Capitalized  costs  are  allocated  to  concessions  abandoned  or  sold  based  on  the  proportion  of  claims 
abandoned or sold to the claims remaining within the project area.
Exploration Costs
Exploration  costs  incurred  are  expensed  to  the  date  of  establishing  that  costs  incurred  are  economically  recoverable.  Exploration  expenditures 
incurred subsequent to the establishment of economic recoverability are capitalized and included in the carrying amount of the related property.
The Company has been in the exploration stage since November 8, 1993 and has no revenues from operations. The Company is primarily engaged in 
the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Should the Company locate a commercially mineable reserve, the Company would expect to 
actively prepare the site for extraction. Exploration costs expensed during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010 were $8,373,451 and 
$5,843,512, respectively. The exploration costs expensed to date during the Company’s exploration stage amount to $37,329,191.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property and equipment are depreciated using 
the straight-line or accelerated methods, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under construction are depreciated when they 
are  substantially  complete  and  available  for  their  intended  use,  over  their  estimated  useful  lives.  Repairs  and  maintenance  of  property  and 
equipment are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to enhance the service potential of plant and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the 
remaining useful life of the improved asset.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management  reviews  and  evaluates  its  long-lived  assets  for  impairment  when  events  and  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  related 
carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if the future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less 
than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the difference between book value and fair 
value of the asset group, as determined through the application of a present value technique using expected future cash flows to estimate fair value 
in the absence of a market price. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that 
are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. In estimating future cash flows, all assets are grouped at the exploration project level.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and 
intangible assets acquired.(cid:160)
(cid:160)When multiple reporting units are acquired in one business combination, goodwill is allocated to reporting units as of 
the date of the business combination, by determining estimates of the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing this amount to the fair values 
of assets and liabilities in the reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized.
The Company performs goodwill annual impairment tests at April 30 each fiscal year and when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amounts may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level. In performing the impairment tests, the Company estimates 
the fair values of its reporting units that include goodwill and compares those fair values to the reporting units’ carrying amounts. If a reporting 
unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying amount, 
and any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value is charged to earnings.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
determined based on temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted 
at the balance sheet date. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least “more likely than not” that the tax 
position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the 
financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon 
settlement with the taxing authorities. This accounting standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, 
accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” 
standard imposed by this guidance to allow recognition of such an asset. Management recorded a full valuation allowance at October 31, 2011 and 
October 31, 2010 against the deferred tax assets as it deems future realization would not meet the criteria “more likely than not”.
Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants
The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock options awarded to employees, 
officers,  directors  and  consultants.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The  expected  term  of  the  options  is  based  upon  evaluation  of  historical  and  expected  future  exercise

The  Company  also  used  the  Black-Scholes  valuation  model  to  determine  the  fair  market  value  of  warrants.(cid:160)
weighted  average  of  historical  volatility  over  the  contractual  term  of  the  warrant  and  implied  volatility.  The  risk-free interest rate is based upon 
implied yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the contractual term of the option. The dividend yield is assumed 
to be none as the Company has not paid dividends nor does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.
(cid:160)Expected  volatility  is  based  upon

Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common 
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity 
similar to fully diluted loss per share. Although there were stock options and warrants in the aggregate of 6,355,864 shares and 19,217,639 shares 
outstanding at October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, they were not included in the calculation of loss per share because they would have been 
considered anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses 
are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Exchange differences arising on translation are disclosed as a separate component of 
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the results of operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)During the year -ended 
October 31, 2010, intercompany transactions and balances with the Company’s Mexican and Gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be short-
term in nature and accordingly all foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans are included in the consolidated statement 
of operations and comprehensive (loss) income during the year-ended October 31, 2010.
On  July  7,  2011,  the  Company  acknowledged  the  Company’s  intention  to  convert  certain  intercompany  loans  totaling  $13.4  million  to  equity. 
Subsequent  to  July  7,  2011,  the  Company  no  longer  recognizes  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses  on  this  $13.4  million  portion  of 
intercompany loans in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies and Legal Costs
From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. The Company records an 
accrual for the estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is 
probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Disclosure 
of a loss contingency is made by the Company if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred, and either an accrual has not 
been made or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In cases where only disclosure of the loss contingency is required, either 
the estimated loss or a range of estimated loss is disclosed or it is stated that an estimate cannot be made. Legal costs incurred in connection with 
loss contingencies are considered period costs and accordingly are expensed in the period services are provided.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Year
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-06 which provides 
amendments to ASC Topic 820 that will provide more robust disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and (4) the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 
3.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 
2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The 
disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures are 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those years.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The Company does not expect that the full 
adoption of ASU No. 2010-06 will have a material effect on the Company`s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other”. This new guidance on testing goodwill provides an entity 
the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test 
to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an 
entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. ASU 
2011-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with prospective application required. 
The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company`s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In  June  2011,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2011-05,  “Presentation  of  Comprehensive  Income.”  This  update  amended  the  presentation  options  in 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 220, “Comprehensive Income,” to provide an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive 
income,  the  components  of  net  income,  and  the  components  of  other  comprehensive  income  either  in  a  single  continuous  statement  of 
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with retrospective application required. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material 
effect on the Company`s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. 
GAAP  and  IFRSs.”  This update amended explanations of how to measure fair value to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure 
requirements in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
years, beginning after December 15, 2011 with prospective application required. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material 
effect on the Company`s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission did not or are not believed to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 3 – MERGER WITH DOME VENTURES
On April 16, 2010 (the “Merger Date”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company was merged with and into Dome, resulting in Dome becoming a 
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company  (the  “Merger”).  To effect the Merger, Dome stockholders received 0.968818 shares of the Company’s 
common stock for each share of Dome common stock they held as of the Merger Date. Additionally, on the Merger Date, all outstanding warrants to 
acquire Dome common stock were exchanged for warrants to acquire the Company’s common stock on equivalent terms.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As a result of the Merger, 
the holders of the Company’s common stock prior to the Merger Date own approximately 53% of the Company post-merger and the former Dome 
shareholders own approximately 47% of the Company post-merger.
Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Merger Date, the consideration received by Dome shareholders in the Merger 
had a value of approximately $26.7 million as detailed below.

As  of  the  Merger  Date,  the  expected  fair  value  of  other  receivables  and  value-added  tax  receivable  approximated  the  historical  cost.  Property 
concessions  do  not  have  a  useful  life  pursuant  to  the  Company’s  policy  on  property  concessions.  The  Company  estimates  that  the  goodwill 
resulting from the Dome Merger transaction will be not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill represents the expected synergies from combining 
operations of Dome and the Company.
A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and 
assumptions.  The  Company’s  judgments  used  to  determine  the  estimated  fair  value  assigned  to  each  class  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities 
assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results from operations. The Company’s management allocated the acquisition 
cost to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of Dome’s tangible and identifiable assets and liabilities.(cid:160) The 
amount allocated to the property concessions was based on a valuation report prepared by a third party appraisal firm.(cid:160)

NOTE 7 – JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS
In October 2009, Dome and AngloGold entered into two joint venture agreements; the Ogooue Joint Venture Agreement and the Ndjole and 
Mevang Joint Venture Agreement.
Ogooue Joint Venture Agreement
AngloGold  acquired  a  reconnaissance  license  over  an  area  comprising  8,295  square  kilometers  in  Gabon,  Africa.  This  license  was  acquired  by 
AngloGold for its gold potential. The joint venture is an 80/20 joint venture in favor of AngloGold. AngloGold has made a firm commitment to spend 
$100,000 on exploration and will solely fund the first $3 million of exploration expenditures, after which the parties will contribute on an 80/20 basis. 
Joint venture dilution provisions apply whereby if Dome is diluted in the future to a joint venture interest of 5% or less due to lack of contribution to 
exploration  budgets,  its  interest  will  be  converted  to  a  2%  Net  Smelter  Return  which  can  be  purchased  at  an  appraised  value  14  months  after 
commencement of commercial production. Should AngloGold elect not to spend the aforesaid $3 million, the lease shall be assigned to Dome.

Once it has earned a 60% interest, AngloGold can earn an additional 10% interest (70% total) by spending $5 million on exploration expenditures 
within two years of earning into a 60% interest as set out above. When the parties have a 70/30 joint venture, and if Dome elects not to contribute to 
work programs and budgets, AngloGold may elect to earn an additional 15% interest (85% total) by carrying the project to a completed pre-
feasibility study. Should AngloGold fail to perform as set out above, a 100% interest in the licenses shall revert to Dome and the joint venture will 
cease. AngloGold shall be entitled to withdraw from the joint venture after it has spent $1 million on exploration expenditures.

NOTE 8 – VALUE-ADDED TAX RECEIVABLE
During 2008, the Company filed value added (“IVA”) tax returns with the Mexican authorities to recover IVA taxes paid by its Mexican subsidiaries 
from  2005  through  2008.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The  Mexican  authorities  reviewed  the  IVA  tax  returns  filed  and  requested  the  Company  provide  copies  of  supporting 
documentation for amounts filed. During 2008 and 2009, the Company worked extensively with IVA tax consultants and Mexican authorities to 
provide the requested documentation and answer questions related to these tax returns, but was unable to recover the IVA tax amounts.
As the result of these difficulties, the Company applied for authorization before the tax authorities to transfer the tax office jurisdiction to Mexico 
City beginning in the 2012 fiscal year. During December 2011 the Company received this authorization and the Company plans to file IVA tax returns 
in Mexico City including those historical IVA tax returns previously filed in other jurisdictions. 
(cid:160)  
At October 31, 2010, management evaluated the IVA tax receivable and increased the allowance for uncollectible taxes to approximately 15.4 million 
Pesos or $1,241,876. The allowance for uncollectible taxes was estimated by management based upon a number of factors including the length of 
time the returns have been outstanding, general economic conditions in Mexico and estimated net recovery after commissions.
During the year ended October 31, 2011 management evaluated the recoverability of the IVA tax receivable and increased the provision by $204,190. 
Due to the uncertainty of when any IVA taxes will be recovered, the Company continues to reflect the net IVA tax receivable as a long-term asset on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2011.
A summary of the changes in the allowance for uncollectible taxes for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:

The  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  tax  assets  of  $20.6  and  $17.9  million  at  October  31,  2011  and  2010,  respectively,  relates  principally  to  the 
uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions. The Company 
continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized 
prior to their expiration. Based on the Company’s assessment it has determined the deferred tax assets are not currently realizable.
Mexico Tax Legislation
Mexican companies are subject to a dual tax system comprised of ISR (Income Tax) and IETU (Flat Tax). The Mexican subsidiaries are subject to pay 
the greater of the ISR and IETU and therefore the Company determines its deferred income taxes based on the tax regime it expects to be subject to 
in the future. In 2010 and 2011 the ISR rate was 30%.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As a result of the 2010 Tax Reform, the ISR rate will be 30% in 2012, 29% in 2013 and 28% for 
2014 and thereafter the IETU is 17.5% in 2010 and thereafter. 
(cid:160)  
Net Operating Loss Carry-forward Limitation
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards if there has been a 
change in ownership as described in Section(cid:160)382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the Dome merger in April 2010, substantial changes in 
the Company’s ownership have occurred that may limit or reduce the amount of net operating loss carry-forward that the Company could utilize in 
the  future  to  offset  taxable  income.(cid:160)
(cid:160)We  have  not  completed  a  detailed  Section  382  study  at  this  time  to  determine  what  impact,  if  any,  that 
ownership changes may have had on our operating loss carryforwards. In each period since our inception, we have recorded a valuation allowance 
for the full amount of our deferred tax assets, as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As a result, we have not recognized any federal 
or state income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has not identified any unrecognized tax benefits or had any additions or 
reductions in tax positions and therefore a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not presented.
The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2011 and accordingly the Company’s effective tax rate will not be 
materially affected by unrecognized tax benefits.
The following tax years remain open to examination by the Company’s principal tax jurisdictions:

(cid:160) 
(cid:160)
The Company has not identified any uncertain tax position for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit will 
significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
The  Company’s policy is to classify tax related interest and penalties as income tax expense.(cid:160)
underpayment of income taxes as a result of unrecognized tax benefits.(cid:160)

NOTE 16 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value Measurements
(cid:160)
All financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs are expensed when they are incurred, 
unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition of qualifying assets, in which case they are added to the costs of those assets until such time 
as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level(cid:160)1
Level(cid:160)2
Level(cid:160)3
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)
Unadjusted  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  that  are  accessible  at  the  measurement  date  for  identical,  unrestricted  assets  or 
liabilities;
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full 
term of the asset or liability;
Prices  or  valuation  techniques  that  require  inputs  that  are  both  significant  to  the  fair  value  measurement  and  unobservable 
(supported by little or no market activity).
Under fair value accounting, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As  of  October  31,  2011  and  October  31,  2010,  the  Company  had  no  financial  or  non -financial  assets  or  liabilities  required  to  be 
reported for fair value purposes.
The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other receivables, accounts 
payable,  accrued  liabilities  and  expenses  and  accrued  severance  costs  approximate  fair  value  at  October(cid:160)
(cid:160)31,  2010  and  2011  due  to  the  short 
maturities of these financial instruments.
Credit Risk
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  counterparty  to  a  financial  instrument  will  cause  a  financial  loss  for  the  Company  by  failing  to  discharge  its 
obligations. To mitigate exposure to credit risk on financial assets the Company has established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure 
counterparties demonstrate minimum acceptable credit worthiness.
The Company maintains its US Dollar and Canadian Dollar (“$CDN”) cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major 
financial institutions with high credit standings.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Cash deposits held in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(“FDIC”) for up to $250,000 and $CDN cash deposits held in Canada are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (“CDIC”) for up to 
$CDN 100,000. Certain United States and Canadian bank accounts held by the Company exceed these federally insured limits or are uninsured as 
they related to US Dollar deposits held in Canadian financial institutions. As of October 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s cash and cash equivalent 
balances held in United States and Canadian financial institutions included $4,008,674 and $9,522,180 respectively, which was not insured by the 
FDIC or CDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes that using major financial institutions 
with high credit ratings mitigates the credit risk in cash.
The  Company  also  maintains  cash  and  restricted  cash  in  bank  accounts  in  Mexico  and  Gabon.(cid:160)
(cid:160)These  accounts  are  denominated  in  the  local 
currency and are considered uninsured. As of October 31, 2011 and 2010, the US dollar equivalent balance for these accounts was $116,451 and 
$798,418, respectively.
Interest Rate Risk
The  Company  holds  substantially  all  of  the  Company’s  cash  and  cash  equivalents  in  bank  and  demand  deposit  accounts  with  major  financial 
institutions. The interest rates received on these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and cash 
equivalent and restricted cash balances during the year ended October 31, 2011, a 1% decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction 
in interest income for the period of approximately $37,000.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Certain purchases of labor, operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in Canadian Dollars (“$CDN”), Mexican Pesos (“MXN”), Central 
African Francs (“$CFA”) or other currencies.(cid:160)
appreciation  of  the  MXN,  $CDN  or  $CFA  against  the  US  dollar  may  result  in  an  increase  in  operating  expenses  and  capital  costs  in  US  dollar 
terms.(cid:160)
(cid:160)To reduce this risk as of October 31, 2011, the Company maintains minimum cash balances in $CFA and MXN. As of October 31, 2011, the 
Company maintained the majority of its cash balance in $CDN. Subsequent to the registered direct offerings described in Note 20 the Company 
maintains the majority of cash balances in US dollars. The Company currently does not engage in any currency hedging activities.
(cid:160)As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations.(cid:160)

Property Concessions Gabon
(cid:160)
The Company holds title to several property concessions in Gabon, Africa that require the Company to spend minimal amounts each term to renew 
the licenses. Each license is renewable twice with each renewal lasting for three years. The Company must spend 200,000,000 CFA francs in order to 
renew each exploration license for a second term of three years and 400,000,000 CFA francs in order to renew the license for a third term of three 
years. The Company must spend 800,000,000 CFA francs in the third term.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Dome may apply for a mining license at any time during these periods. 
The initial term of these exploration licenses expired on September 18, 2011. The Company applied for renewal in June of 2011 as it had met the 
necessary expenditure requirements and expects to receive the renewal approval in 2012. As of October 31, 2011, one US Dollar approximates 473 
CFA francs.
