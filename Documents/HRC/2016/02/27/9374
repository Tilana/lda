<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the 
Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102 of 6 October 2006. It presents updated information 
on the activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture (the Fund), and 
in particular the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund at its 
twenty-seventh session, which was held in Geneva from 22 to 26 October 2007. The 
High Commissioner for Human Rights approved these recommendations on behalf of the 
Secretary-General. The present report complements the report on the activities of the Fund 
submitted to the General Assembly (A/62/189) on 6 August 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Mandate of the United Nations Voluntary 
Fund for Victims of Torture 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and individuals. In accordance with the practice established by its Board of 
Trustees in 1982, the Fund provides grants to non-governmental organizations that submit 
projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian or other 
forms of assistance to torture victims and their relatives. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of a Board of Trustees 
composed of five members acting in their personal capacity and appointed by the 
Secretary-General with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in consultation 
with their Governments. The Secretary-General in August 2005 appointed the following 
members for a period of three years, renewable once: Krassimir Kanev (Bulgaria), Sonia Picado 
(Costa Rica), Savitri Goonesekere (Sri Lanka), Joseph Oloka-Onyango (Uganda), and 
Derrick Pounder (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>4. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the Fund&#8217;s guidelines. They require a project to 
be presented by a non-governmental organization. The beneficiaries must be direct victims of 
torture and/or direct family members. Priority is given to projects providing direct assistance to 
torture victims. This could consist of medical or psychological assistance; help with social or 
financial reintegration through vocational training for victims; or legal assistance to seek redress 
for victims or members of their families, or process the claims of asylum-seekers. Depending on 
the funds available, the Fund may finance projects to organize training programmes, seminars or 
conferences to allow health-care professionals or other service providers to exchange best 
practices. However, grant requests for projects involving investigation, research, studies, 
publications or similar activities are not admissible. The Fund can provide emergency assistance 
to individuals in countries where no project is receiving support. This type of request is 
examined according to a specific procedure outlined in the guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  TWENTY-SEVENTH SESSION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Board of Trustees held its twenty-seventh session from 22 to 26 October 2007 
and made recommendations for grants for a total amount of US$ 8,582,700 to 191 projects 
in 65 countries. The High Commissioner for Human Rights approved these recommendations 
on 12 November 2007 on behalf of the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>6. In spite of the limited resources available, and consistent with recommendation 3 of the 
Office of Internal Oversight Services on the evaluation of the Fund,<b>1</b> the Board continued its 
practice of financing training and seminars, thus allowing health professionals, social workers, 
lawyers and other service providers to exchange experiences and develop new strategies to 
address the needs of torture victims. The Board recommended an allocation of US$ 97,500 to 
nine organizations for training to be organized in 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>7. Table 1 below indicates the contributions received as of 12 December 2007 and since the 
last report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the activities of the Fund 
(A/62/189), including contributions received between February and October 2007, which have 
been allocated to grants recommended at the twenty-seventh session.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations adopted by the Board  
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Grants awarded for the period January to December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Board expressed satisfaction with the smooth completion of the change in funding 
cycle for grantees, pursuant to recommendation 10 of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,<b>2</b> 
following its evaluation of the functioning of the Fund. For the first time grants have been 
allocated for a future period, January to December of the year following applications, enabling 
organizations to plan their activities more effectively, as the Fund grant would be received at the 
beginning of the calendar year of implementation of the project. 
9. The Board reviewed information prepared by the secretariat concerning 255 projects, 
including the analysis of narrative, financial and audit reports on the use of grants paid in 
previous years. It considered 199 requests for new grants amounting to US$ 14,035,172 for 
projects to be implemented in 2008. 
10. The Board recommended that US$ 7,770,500 be paid in January 2008, and US$ 812,200 
after its twenty-eighth session in February 2008, upon receipt of satisfactory information by 
applicants. In addition, in accordance with the guidelines of the Fund, the Board decided to set 
aside US$ 417,300 to finance projects in priority regions, identified through OHCHR field 
presences during the intersessional period. 
</p>
<p>11. The figure below provides information on the distribution of grants per region for the 
year 2008. The list of organizations subsidized can be found on the webpage of the Fund

</b></p>
<p>12. The Board was pleased to note that its efforts to attract suitable applications from 
organizations working in Africa and Asia and Central Asia resulted in a noticeable increase, over 
previous years, of projects identified and funded in the above regions in 2008.

<p>13. The Board expressed appreciation of the efforts undertaken by the secretariat since its 
previous session to organize assessment visits to projects in the field. From January to 
December 2007, 56 projects in 19 countries had been visited and monitored by OHCHR staff, 
United Nations Human Rights Field Presences and Board members. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Policy decisions 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Board recommended that in cases where awards are received from national or 
international courts as a result of successful litigation, legal fees paid by the Fund need not be 
returned to it, in accordance with the conditions under which the grant was made. However, it 
encourages organizations to use any such awards for the continued protection of victims of 
torture. It also encourages organizations to keep it informed as to how they intend to use any 
such future awards. The Board has requested that the secretariat undertake an assessment of best 
practices of other donors in this respect. 
</p>
<p>15. The Board also discussed the possibility of strengthening the capacity of grantees and has 
requested the secretariat to identify organizations providing good services but facing difficulties 
in fulfilling the requirements of the Fund. At its next session, the Board will consider options 
presented by the secretariat on ways to assist these organizations to meet the requirements of the 
Fund. 
</p>
<p><b>II. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF 
THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Board was pleased to note that 13 out of the 16 recommendations initially made by the 
Office of Internal Oversight Services in its review of the functioning of the Fund<b>3</b> are now 
considered as implemented. The Board noted that the remaining three recommendations dealing

 <p> 
</p>
<p>with multi-year funding, interaction with donors and United Nations entities, and a strengthened 
management system were well under way and would be fully implemented by the end of 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Multi-year funding 
</b></p>
<p>17. Recommendation 6 (b) suggested that the Board consider multi-year project approval for 
three-year periods for projects with a good track record with the Fund. In order to draw on the 
experience of other institutional donors, the Board met with representatives of the 
European Commission, USAID (the United States Agency for International Development), the 
United States Office of Refugee Resettlement, the OAK Foundation and KIOS, the Finnish NGO 
Foundation for Human Rights. The discussion contributed to the development of relevant criteria 
and guidelines on multi-year funding, in particular the identification of grantees to be included in 
a pilot scheme, to be discussed further at the twenty-eighth session of the Board in 
February 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interaction with donors and other United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>18. Recommendation 7 (d) called on the Board to strengthen its interaction with donors and to 
be more proactive in fund-raising by approaching decision makers in donor capitals and by better 
promoting the Fund to actual and potential donors, within the context of an OHCHR global 
fund-raising strategy. It also called on the Board and secretariat to address the issue of greater 
synergies with other United Nations entities. 
</p>
<p>19. The Board held a meeting with Member States during the twenty-seventh session, which 
was attended by some 20 delegations. The Board provided extensive information on its latest 
activities, including field visits by members to Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. It also 
briefed Member States on its stricter guidelines and reporting requirements. The Board provided 
information on the efforts made over the past three years to address the historical geographic 
imbalance in grant allocation, in particular the increase in the share of grants allocated to projects 
based in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe following the outreach work initiated by the 
secretariat. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board was pleased to note that the secretariat had met with representatives of the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss issues of 
common concern, such as monitoring and evaluation of projects, co-funding of projects, 
emergency grants and the dissemination of information about the Fund to UNHCR&#8217;s 
implementing partners. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Strengthened management system 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Board noted with interest the information provided by the secretariat that the 2009 call 
for applications would be electronically based, and encouraged OHCHR to complete the 
technical development of the outstanding components of the grant management system, namely 
the administrative and reporting modules. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ESTIMATED NEEDS FOR 2009 
</b></p>
<p>22. On the basis of the requests received for 2008, it is expected that approximately 
US$ 14 million will be requested for 2009. </p>
