SEVENTH COUNT

Statement of Offence

DRIVING MOTOR VEHICLE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THIRD PARTY POLICY RISK: Contrary to section 4(1)(2) of Motor Vehicle Third Party Insurance Act, Cap. 177.

Particulars of Offence

TANIELA RASUAKI on the 21st day of September, 2003 at Maururu Ba in the Western Division drove a private motor vehicle Registration Number DL 340 on Maururu Road, Ba when there was not in force in relation to the use of the said motor vehicle, a policy of insurance in respect of the motor vehicle Third Party Policy Insurance.

The appellants pleaded guilty to all 7 charges on 26th September 2003. The appellants waived their rights to counsel.

The facts were that on 21st September 2003 at about 2230 hours at Navau, Ba, the appellants together with 4 others punched and threatened with a cane knife, Naresh Chand, Ravindra Singh, Prakash Chand and Jitendra Padarath and robbed those persons of items and goods, having a total value of approximately $6,100.00. In addition, the appellants together with 4 others, on the same date and at about the same time, unlawfully used a motor vehicle, the property of Jitendra Padarath. In addition, the appellant Rasuaki drove the said vehicle without a driving licence and in contravention of the third party policy risk.

The facts were admitted by both appellants.

The appellant Naicovi, was on 2nd May 2001, sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 2 years at Ba Magistrates Court for robbery with violence.

The appellant Rasuaki, has no relevant prior conviction.

The 1st appellant Naicovi is 21 years of age and is a cane cutter and the 2nd appellant is 37 years old and divorcee with elderly parents.

The Learned Magistrate sentenced both accused to a total of 10 years imprisonment. The sentences with respect to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th counts were 5 years imprisonment and the sentences on counts 1 and 2 were ordered to be consecutive with the sentence on counts 3 and 4 and concurrent with each other. Remaining sentences were concurrent with counts 1 and 2.

The Learned Magistrate expressed the view that he had taken account of the totality principle in fixing the sentences.

Winter J. in Waisake Matahau Uluikadavu v State  HAA035 of 2004 considered the relevant authorities for robbery with violence offences. His Lordship concluded that the starting point for home invasions by multiple accused is 6 to 8 years imprisonment.

In this instance, a weapon was used and accordingly the starting point should be at the top end of the range, 8 years. The early plea of guilty entitles both the appellants to a discount of 1/3 thus reducing the sentence to 5 ½ years.

The offence was aggravated by use of violence and which result an injury to the innocent occupants of the farmhouse. It was a planned attack. This aggravation increases the sentence to 7 years.

The appellant Naicovi, having a prior conviction for the same offence of necessity, attracts a more sentence than Rasuaki. I consider an additional 1 year to be appropriate. These penalties are appropriate for counts 1 to 4 inclusive. Nothing has been put to the court with respect to the penalties imposed on counts 5 to 7 inclusive and accordingly they shall remain unaltered.

Counts 1 to 4 inclusive were committed at the same time and the same place with the 4 separate victims being robbed. In these circumstances, it is inappropriate to make the sentences accumulative  Pearce v The Queen [1998] 194 C.L.R 610  as I am of the opinion that the imposition of accumulative sentence was incommensurate with the gravity of the whole of his proven criminal conduct or with his due deserts  Reg v Knight [1981] 26 S.A.S.R. 573 at 576.

It is necessary to apply the totality principle as expressed in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd Edition [1979] pp 56  57  as set out in Mill v The Queen [1988] 166 C.L.R. 59 at 63: -

Where cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour then ask itself, what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.

The resultant and sentences would, in my opinion, be 11 years for the appellant Nacovi, and 9 years for the appellant Rasuaki.

Clearly, the sentence arrived at by the Learned Magistrate is such, that it is within the range and should not be interfered with both respect to the appellant, Rasuaki and is less than I would have imposed for the appellant Naicovi.

Accordingly the appeals are dismissed.
