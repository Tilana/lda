Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
 
Note 1.  Partnership Organization
Energy 11, L.P. (the "Partnership") was formed as a Delaware limited partnership. The initial
capitalization of the Partnership of $1,000 occurred on July 9, 2013. The Partnership is offering
common units of limited partner interest (the "units") on a best-efforts basis with the intention of raising
up to $2,000,000,000 of capital, consisting of 100,263,158 units. The Partnership's offering was
declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 22, 2015.  As of
August 19, 2015, the Partnership completed the sale of the minimum offering of 1,315,790 units.  The
subscribers were admitted as Limited Partners of the Partnership at the initial closing and the
Partnership has been admitting additional Limited Partners monthly since that time.
 
The Partnership's primary investment objectives are to (i) acquire producing and non-producing oil
and gas properties with development potential, and to enhance the value of the properties through
drilling and other development activities, (ii) make distributions to the holders of the units, (iii) engage
in a liquidity transaction after five – seven years, in which all properties are sold and the sales
proceeds are distributed to the partners, merge with another entity, or list the units on a national
securities exchange, and (iv) permit holders of units to invest in oil and gas properties in a tax efficient
basis. The proceeds from the sale of the units primarily will be used to acquire producing and non-
producing oil and natural gas properties onshore in the United States and to develop those properties.
 
The general partner of the Partnership is Energy 11 GP, LLC (the "General Partner"). The General
Partner manages and controls the business affairs of the Partnership. David Lerner Associates, Inc.
(the "Managing Dealer"), is the dealer manager for the offering of the units.
The Partnership's fiscal year ends on December 31.
 
Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
instructions for Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Partnership's audited consolidated financial statements included in its 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2016. 
 
Offering Costs
 
The Partnership is raising capital through an on-going best-efforts offering of units by David Lerner
Associates, Inc., the managing underwriter, which receives a selling commission and a marketing
expense allowance based on proceeds of the units sold. Additionally, the Partnership has incurred
other offering costs including legal, accounting and reporting services. These offering costs are
recorded by the Partnership as a reduction of partners' equity. As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership
had sold 6.7 million units for gross proceeds of $129.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs of
$119.2 million.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Loss Per Common Unit
 
Basic loss per common unit is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of
common units outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per unit is calculated after giving effect to all
potential common units that were dilutive and outstanding for the period. There were no units with a
dilutive effect for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. As a result, basic and
diluted outstanding units were the same. The Class B Units and Incentive Distribution Rights, as
defined below, are not included in loss per common unit until such time that it is probable Payout (as
discussed in Note 6) would occur.

Index
Recent Accounting Standards
In April and May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-10, ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12. Each update clarifies specific
topics originally described in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
ASU 2014-09, released in May 2014, amends the former revenue recognition guidance and provides
a revised comprehensive revenue recognition model with customers that contains principles that an
entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. ASU
2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2016. However, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year in August 2015. The
Partnership is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 as well as the related
subsequent pronouncements released during the current quarter.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation, which
simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows. For public entities, the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership's
consolidated financial statements.
 
Note 3.  Oil and Gas Investments
On December 18, 2015, the Partnership completed its purchase of an approximate 11% working
interest in approximately 215 existing producing wells and approximately 262 future development
locations in the Sanish field located in Mountrail County, North Dakota (the "Sanish Field Assets") for
approximately $159.1 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. During the six months ended June
30, 2016, the Partnership and the sellers ("Sellers") adjusted the purchase price for the settlement of
operating activity that occurred prior to the closing date. The net impact of the purchase price
adjustment was an increase to the purchase price of the asset of approximately $0.5 million. The
Partnership has expensed, as incurred, transaction costs associated with the acquisition of the Sanish
Field Assets. These costs included but were not limited to due diligence, reserve reports, legal and
engineering services and site visits. The Partnership did not incur any transaction costs in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
The Partnership is a non-operator of the Sanish Field Assets. Whiting Petroleum Corporation
("Whiting"), one of the largest producers in this basin, acts as the operator.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the three- and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2015 has been prepared as if the acquisition of the Sanish Field Assets had occurred on
January 1, 2015.  The unaudited pro forma financial information was derived from the historical
Statement of Operations of the Partnership and the historical information provided by the Sellers. The
unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations
that would have occurred had the acquisition of the Sanish Field Assets and related financing
occurred on the basis assumed above, nor is such information indicative of the Partnership's expected
future results of operations.

Note 4.  Note Payable
As part of the financing for the purchase of the Sanish Field Assets, on December 18, 2015, the
Partnership executed a note in favor of the Sellers ("Seller Note") of the assets in the original principal
amount of $97.5 million. The note bears interest at 5% per annum and is payable in full no later than
September 30, 2016 ("Maturity Date"). The Partnership's right to extend the Maturity Date to March 31,
2017 is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) the Partnership must deliver to Seller
written notice of the election to extend the Maturity Date no later than September 1, 2016, (ii) the
Partnership must pay to Seller an extension fee equal to 0.5% of the outstanding principal balance
outstanding at September 30, 2016, (iii) during the extension period and until the note is paid in full, in
cash, the interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of the note will bear interest at the fixed rate
of 7.0% per annum, (iv) the outstanding principal amount of the note as of September 1, 2016 shall not
be in excess of $60 million, and (v) both at the time of the delivery of the extension notice and as of
September 30, 2016, no event of default shall exist under the note or any collateral document. There is
no penalty for prepayment of the note. Payment of the note is secured by a mortgage and liens on all
of the Sanish Field Assets in customary form. In accordance with the Seller Note, because the
Partnership had not fully repaid all amounts outstanding under the note on or before June 30, 2016,
the Partnership paid a deferred origination fee equal to $250,000 during the three months ended June
30, 2016. The deferred origination fee is included in "Other current assets" on the consolidated
balance sheets and will be amortized through the Maturity Date.
7
Index
Interest is due monthly on the last day of each month while the note remains outstanding. In addition to
interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the note, the Partnership must make
mandatory principal payments monthly. Prior to reducing the note balance below $60.0 million, the
Partnership was required to make principal payments in an amount equal to 75% of the net proceeds
the Partnership received from the sale of its equity securities. After reducing the outstanding principal
balance below $60.0 million, the Partnership is required to make principal payments in an amount
equal to 50% of the net proceeds the Partnership receives from the sale of its equity securities until the
note is paid in full. In addition, if the Partnership sells any of the property that is collateral for the note,
the Partnership must make a mandatory principal payment equal to 100% of the net proceeds of such
sale until the principal amount of the note is paid in full.
Pursuant to the First Amendment of the Interest Purchase Agreement, the Partnership was given the
one-time right (exercisable between June 15, 2016 through June 30, 2016) to elect to satisfy the
contingent payment in full by paying to Sellers $5.0 million at the time of election or by increasing the
amount of the Seller Note by $5.0 million. On June 23, 2016, the Partnership exercised this right by
increasing the amount of the Partnership's note with the Sellers by $5.0 million. If the Partnership had
not exercised the one-time right, the contingent payment would have ranged from $0 to $95 million
depending on the average of the monthly NYMEX:CL strip prices as of December 31, 2017 for future
contracts during the delivery period beginning December 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2022.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance on the note was $52.0 million
and $85.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the
note, which approximates its fair market value, was $50.8 million and $81.7 million, respectively. The
carrying value of all of the other financial instruments of the Partnership approximate fair value due to
their short-term nature. The Partnership estimates the fair value of its notes payable by discounting the
future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates consistent with the maturity of a debt
obligation with similar credit terms and credit characteristics, which are Level 3 inputs under the fair
value hierarchy. Market rates take into consideration general market conditions and maturity.
Note 5.  Management Agreement
At the initial closing of the sale of its common units on August 19, 2015, the Partnership entered into a
Management Services Agreement (the "Management Agreement") with E11 Management, LLC, (the
"Former Manager"), and E11 Incentive Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of the Former Manager ("Incentive
Holdings"), whereby the Former Manager agreed to provide management and operating services
regarding substantially all aspects of the Partnership's business. The Former Manager was formed by
Aubrey K. McClendon and he served as its Chief Executive Officer.
Under the Management Agreement, the Former Manager agreed to provide management and other
services to the Partnership including, but not limited to, the following:
 
Identifying and evaluating oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, development, integration, sale
·
or monetization;
Conducting (or overseeing one of its affiliated companies or third-parties to conduct) drilling,
·
completion, production, marketing and hedging operations as the operator of the Partnership's oil and
natural gas properties;
Overseeing the drilling, completion, production, marketing and hedging operations of our oil and
·
natural gas properties operated by other persons or entities;
Identifying and evaluating financing alternatives for acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas
·
properties; and
Managing the financial, accounting and other back office support functions associated with the
·
drilling, completion, production, marketing and hedging of the Partnership's oil and natural gas
properties.
 
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Partnership agreed to pay the Former Manager a
monthly fee.
Upon entering into the Management Agreement, the Partnership issued 100,000 Class B units to
Incentive Holdings. The Class B units entitle the holder to receive a portion of distributions made after
Payout, as described in Note 6 below.
8
Index
The Management Agreement was terminable by the Partnership if, among other reasons, Mr.
McClendon, the Former Manager's key employee, ceased to be employed by the Former Manager and
the Partnership did not approve of a proposed replacement of such key employee. On March 2, 2016,
Mr. McClendon was killed in a car accident. Following Mr. McClendon's death and subsequent
correspondence between the Former Manager and the Partnership, on April 5, 2016, the Partnership
elected not to approve a replacement key employee for Mr. McClendon and exercised its right to
terminate the Management Agreement. Accordingly, the fees under the Management Agreement were
no longer accrued as of the effective date of termination. Also, upon termination of the Management
Agreement and in accordance with the terms therewith, 37.5% of the Class B units owned by Incentive
Holdings were canceled. As of June 30, 2016, the Class B units owned by Incentive Holdings totaled
62,500.
Substantially all of the Partnership's properties are currently being operated by Whiting, an
independent third party. Since the Partnership only owns a non-operating interest in the Sanish Field
Assets, most of the services that the Former Manager had been contracted to perform are being
performed by Whiting, as operator of those properties. Consequently, the Partnership does not
anticipate that the termination of the Management Agreement will have an adverse effect on its
operations.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership incurred fees and reimbursable
costs of approximately $0 and $0.9 million, respectively, under the Management Agreement.
Note 6.  Capital Contribution and Partners' Equity
 
At inception the General Partner and organizational limited partner made initial capital contributions
totaling $1,000 to the Partnership.  Upon closing of the minimum offering the organizational limited
partner withdrew its initial capital contribution of $990, the General Partner received Incentive
Distribution Rights (defined below), and has been and will be reimbursed for its documented third
party out-of-pocket expenses incurred in organizing the Partnership and offering the units.
As of August 19, 2015, the Partnership completed its minimum offering of 1,315,790 common units at
$19.00 per common unit.  In March 2016, the Partnership completed the sale of 5,263,158 common
units at $19.00 per common unit. All subsequent shares of common units are being sold at $20.00 per
common unit. As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had completed the sale of 6,714,383 common units
for total gross proceeds of $129.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs including selling
commissions and marketing expenses of $119.2 million.
 
The Partnership intends to continue to raise capital through its best-efforts offering by the Managing
Dealer at $20.00 per common unit. Under the agreement with the Managing Dealer, the Managing
Dealer receives a total of 6% in selling commissions and a marketing expense allowance based on
gross proceeds of the units sold.  The Managing Dealer will also be paid a contingent incentive fee,
which is a cash payment of up to an amount equal to 4% of gross proceeds of the units sold based on
the performance of the Partnership. Based on the units sold through June 30, 2016, the total
contingent fee is approximately $5.2 million.
Prior to "Payout," which is defined below, all of the distributions made by the Partnership, if any, will
be paid to the holders of units.  Accordingly, the Partnership will not make any distributions with
respect to the Incentive Distribution Rights or with respect to Class B units and will not make the
contingent, incentive payments to the Managing Dealer, until Payout occurs.
  
The Partnership Agreement provides that Payout occurs on the day when the aggregate amount
distributed with respect to each of the units equals $20.00 plus the Payout Accrual.  The Partnership
Agreement defines "Payout Accrual" as 7% per annum simple interest accrued monthly until paid on
the Net Investment Amount outstanding from time to time.  The Partnership Agreement defines Net
Investment Amount initially as $20.00 per unit, regardless of the amount paid for the unit.  If at any time
the Partnership distributes to holders of units more than the Payout Accrual, the amount the
Partnership distributes in excess of the Payout Accrual will reduce the Net Investment Amount.
All distributions made by the Partnership after Payout, which may include all or a portion of the
proceeds of the sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets, will be made as follows:
·
First, (i) to the Record Holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, 35%; (ii) to the Record Holders of
the Outstanding Class B units, pro rata based on the number of Class B units owned, 35% multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Class B units outstanding and the denominator
of which is 100,000; (iii) to the Managing Dealer, as the Managing Dealer contingent incentive fee
paid under the Dealer Manager Agreement, 30%, and (iv) the remaining amount, if any, to the
Record Holders of outstanding units, pro rata based on their percentage interest until such time as
the Managing Dealer receives the full amount of the Managing Dealer contingent incentive fee under
the Dealer Manager Agreement;
·
Thereafter, (i) to the Record Holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, 35%; (ii) to the Record
Holders of the Outstanding Class B units, pro rata based on the number of Class B units owned,
35% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Class B units outstanding and
the denominator of which is 100,000; (iii) the remaining amount to the Record Holders of outstanding
units, pro rata based on their percentage interest.
9
Index
The Partnership may issue up to 37,500 additional Class B units, the amount of Class B units
canceled in conjunction with the termination of the Management Agreement discussed above in Note
5.
  
All items of income, gain, loss and deduction will be allocated to each Partner's capital account in a
manner generally consistent with the distribution procedures outlined above.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership paid distributions of $0.349041 per unit or
$2.1 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership paid distributions of $0.675068
per unit or $3.6 million.
Note 7.  Related Parties
The Partnership has, and is expected to continue to engage in, significant transactions with related
parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm's length and the results of the
Partnership's operations may be different than if conducted with non-related parties.  The General
Partner's Board of Directors will oversee and review the Partnership's related party relationships and
is required to approve any significant modifications to any existing related party transactions, as well
as any new significant related party transactions.
On December 18, 2015, the General Partner appointed Clifford J. Merritt as its President. Prior to
being appointed President, Mr. Merritt provided consulting services to the General Partner. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership paid Mr. Merritt $77,099 and $154,198,
respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately $105,000 and $104,000 of
general and administrative costs were incurred by a member of the General Partner and have been or
will be reimbursed by the Partnership. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
approximately $117,000 and $159,000 of general and administrative costs were incurred by the
General Partner and have been or will be reimbursed by the Partnership. At June 30, 2016,
approximately $105,000 was due to a member of the General Partner.
Note 8.  Subsequent Events
In July 2016, the Partnership declared and paid $0.9 million, or $0.134247 per outstanding common
unit, in distributions to its holders of common units.
In July 2016, the Partnership closed on the issuance of approximately 786,300 units through its
ongoing best-efforts offering, representing gross proceeds to the Partnership of approximately $15.7
million and proceeds net of selling and marketing costs of approximately $14.8 million.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current beliefs and expectations with respect to future
events and are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors
outside our control that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Such factors
include, but are not limited to, those described under "Risk Factors" and the following:
that our strategy of acquiring oil and gas properties on attractive terms and developing those
•properties may not be successful or, even if we successfully acquire properties, that our operations
on such properties may not be successful;
•general economic, market, or business conditions;
 •changes in laws or regulations;
•
•
•
•
•
the risk that the wells in which we acquire an interest are productive, but do not produce enough
revenue to return the investment made;
the risk that the wells we drill do not find hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or, even if
commercial quantities are encountered, that actual production is lower than expected on the
productive life of wells is shorter than expected;
current credit market conditions and our ability to obtain long-term financing for our property
acquisitions and drilling activities in a timely manner and on terms that are consistent with what we
project when we invest in a property;
uncertainties concerning the price of oil and natural gas, which may decrease and remain low for
prolonged periods; and
the risk that any hedging policy we employ to reduce the effects of changes in the prices of our
production will not be effective.
Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon
reasonable assumptions, we cannot assure investors that our expectations will be attained or that any
deviations will not be material. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements speak only as

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's Unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, as well as the information contained in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Overview
The Partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership. The General Partner is Energy 11 GP,
LLC (the "General Partner"). The initial capitalization of the Partnership of $1,000 occurred on July 9,
2013. The Partnership is offering common units of limited partner interest (the "common units") on a
best-efforts basis, with the intention of raising up to $2,000,000,000 of capital, consisting of
100,263,158 common units. The Partnership's initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No.
333-197476) was declared effective by the SEC on January 22, 2015. As of August 19, 2015, the
Partnership completed the sale of the minimum offering of 1,315,790 common units for gross proceeds
of $25 million. Upon raising the minimum offering amount, the holders of the common units were
admitted and the Partnership commenced operations.
11
Index
 
The Partnership has no officers, directors or employees. Instead, the General Partner manages the
day to day affairs of the Partnership. All decisions regarding the management of the Partnership made
by the General Partner are made by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and its officers. The
Partnership's assets owned at June 30, 2016 are non-operated oil and gas wells, substantially all of
which are managed and operated by Whiting Petroleum Company ("Whiting"). Whiting, a publicly
traded oil and gas company, operates the assets on behalf of the Partnership and other working
interest owners.
 
The Partnership was formed to acquire and develop oil and gas properties located onshore in the
United States. The Partnership will seek to acquire working interests, leasehold interests, royalty
interests, overriding royalty interests, production payments and other interests in producing and
nonproducing oil and gas properties. On December 18, 2015, the Partnership completed its purchase
of an approximate 11% working interest in approximately 215 existing producing wells and
approximately 262 future development locations in the Sanish field located in Mountrail County, North
Dakota (the "Sanish Field Assets"). As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership has 217 producing wells,
with approximately 257 future development locations.
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ("NGL") prices are determined by many factors outside of the
Partnership's control. Historically, energy commodity prices have been volatile, and due to geopolitical
risks in oil producing regions of the world as well as global supply and demand concerns, the
Partnership continues to expect significant price volatility. In addition to commodity price fluctuations,
the Partnership faces the challenge of natural production volume declines. As reservoirs are depleted,
oil and natural gas production from Partnership wells will decrease.
Partnership revenues are highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and to levels of
production. Future growth is dependent on the Partnership's ability to add reserves in excess of
production. Dependent on available cash flow, the Partnership intends to seek opportunities to invest
in its existing production wells via capital expenditures, drill new wells on existing leasehold sites
and/or acquire additional reserves.
Results of Operations
The Partnership closed its minimum offering on August 19, 2015.  The Partnership closed on the
purchase of the Sanish Field Assets on December 18, 2015. Other than the payment of fees and
expenses described herein, the Partnership had no other operations during the first six months of
2015. Because the Partnership had no revenues during the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, there is no comparison of results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 to any of the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, except as
otherwise indicated below.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Sales
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were $5.5
million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were $5.2 million, which resulted in a realized price of
$40.17 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were $0.2 million, which resulted in a realized
price of $2.11 per MCF. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were $0.1 million, which resulted in a realized
price of $8.56 per barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE") of production.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, revenues for oil, natural gas and NGL sales were $9.9
million. Revenues for the sale of crude oil were $9.1 million, which resulted in a realized price of
$33.05 per barrel. Revenues for the sale of natural gas were $0.5 million, which resulted in a realized
price of $1.88 per MCF. Revenues for the sale of NGLs were $0.3 million, which resulted in a realized
price of $8.14 per BOE of production.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership's working interest production
volumes totaled 163,444 and 351,641 BOEs, respectively.
The oil, natural gas and NGL production resulted from the Partnership's working interest in producing
properties in the Sanish Field in North Dakota and the associated horizontal wells on that leasehold.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Lease Operating Expenses ("LOE")
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, LOE was $0.9 million and $1.9 million,
respectively, and LOE costs per BOE of production were $5.44 and $5.41, respectively.
12
Index
Gathering and Processing Expenses
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, gathering and processing fees were $0.2 million
and $0.5 million, respectively. Gathering and processing costs per BOE of production were $1.27 and
$1.46, respectively.
From time to time, expenses will be incurred on a producing well to restore or increase production. For
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, workover expenses were $50,000 and $88,000,
respectively. Workover expenses per BOE of production were $0.31 and $0.25, respectively.
 
Production Taxes
North Dakota's oil and gas tax structure is comprised of two main taxes: the production tax and the
extraction tax. Beginning January 1, 2016, the extraction tax rate was 5% of the gross value at the well.
This rate can increase to 6% if the high-price trigger is in effect. The production tax is 5%.
Production taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $0.5 million and $0.9 million,
respectively. Production taxes per BOE of production were $3.20 and $2.67, respectively.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ("DD&A")
 
DD&A of capitalized drilling and development costs of producing oil, natural gas and NGL properties
are computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved
developed oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Costs of acquiring proved properties are depleted using
the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed and
undeveloped reserves. DD&A for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.4 million and
$5.1 million, and DD&A per BOE of production was $14.81 and $14.48, respectively.
Management Fees
Fees incurred under the Management Agreement with the Former Manager for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 were $0 and $0.9 million. As discussed below, the Management
Agreement was terminated in April 2016. The reduction in management fees is partially offset by the
Partnership hiring additional resources to replace certain services previously provided by the Former
Manager. Therefore, the Partnership has increased accounting and consulting fees, which are
classified as general and administrative costs.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.3
million and $0.1 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership incurred general and administrative expenses of $0.7 million and $0.2 million,
respectively. The principal components of general and administrative expense are accounting, legal
and consulting fees. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three- and six-month
periods was driven by the closing of the Partnership's interest in the Sanish Field Assets in December
2015, contributing directly to a rise in current quarter and year-to-date accounting, legal and consulting
fees.
Current Developments
Management Agreement
At the initial closing of the sale of common units, August 19, 2015, the Partnership entered into a
Management Services Agreement (the "Management Agreement") with E11 Management LLC (the
"Former Manager") and E11 Incentive Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of the Former Manager ("Incentive
Holdings"), to provide management and operating services regarding substantially all aspects of the
Partnership. The Former Manager was formed by Aubrey K. McClendon and he served as its Chief
Executive Officer. Upon entering into the Management Agreement, the Partnership issued 100,000
Class B units to Incentive Holdings; these units entitle the holder to receive a portion of distributions
made after Payout, as described in "Note 6. Capital Contribution and Partners' Equity" in Part I, Item I
of this Form 10-Q.
13
Index
The Management Agreement was terminable by the Partnership if, among other reasons, Mr.
McClendon, the Former Manager's key employee, ceased to be employed by the Former Manager and
the Partnership did not approve of a proposed replacement of such key employee. On March 2, 2016,
Mr. McClendon was killed in a car accident. Following Mr. McClendon's death and subsequent
correspondence between the Former Manager and us, on April 5, 2016, the Partnership elected not to
approve a replacement key employee for Mr. McClendon and exercised its right to terminate the
Management Agreement. Accordingly, the fees under the Management Agreement were no longer
accrued as of the effective date of termination. Also, upon termination of the Management Agreement
and in accordance with the terms therewith, 37.5% of the Class B units owned by Incentive Holdings
were canceled. As of June 30, 2016, the Class B units owned by Incentive Holdings total 62,500.
Substantially all of the Partnership's properties are currently being operated by Whiting, an
independent third party. Since the Partnership only owns a non-operating interest in the Sanish Field
Assets, most of the services that the Former Manager had been contracted to perform are being
performed by Whiting, as operator of those properties. Consequently, the Partnership does not
anticipate that the termination of the Management Agreement will have an adverse effect on its
operations.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership incurred fees and reimbursable
costs of approximately $0 and $0.9 million, respectively, under the Management Agreement.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Partnership's principal source of liquidity will be the proceeds of the best-efforts offering and the
cash flow generated from properties the Partnership has acquired.  In addition, the Partnership may
borrow additional funds to pay operating expenses, distributions, make acquisitions or for other capital
needs of the Partnership. In connection with the acquisition of the Sanish Field Assets, the Partnership
executed the Seller Note in the original principal amount of $97,500,000. The Partnership intends to
use proceeds from the offering to repay the Seller Note and its deferred payment obligations. As a
result, until the Seller Note is repaid, the Partnership may not have available liquidity to fund additional
acquisitions, capital improvements or distributions.
Partners Equity
The Partnership intends to continue to raise capital through its best-efforts offering of units by David
Lerner Associates, Inc. (the "Managing Dealer"). The Managing Dealer receives a total of 6% in
selling commissions and a marketing expense allowance based on gross proceeds of the units
sold.  The Managing Dealer may also be paid a contingent incentive fee, which is a cash payment of
up to an amount equal to 4% of gross proceeds of the units sold based on the performance of the
Partnership. 
 
As of August 19, 2015, the Partnership completed its minimum offering of 1,315,790 common units at
$19.00 per common unit.  In March 2016, the Partnership completed the sale of 5,263,158 common
units at $19.00 per common unit. All subsequent shares of common units are being sold at $20.00 per
common unit. As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had completed the sale of 6,714,383 common units
for total gross proceeds of $129.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs including selling
commissions and marketing expenses of $119.2 million. As of June 30, 2016, 93,548,775 common
units remained unsold. The Partnership will offer common units until January 23, 2017, unless the
offering is extended by the general partner, provided that the offering will be terminated if all of the
common units are sold before then.
Distributions
Prior to "Payout," which is defined below, all of the distributions made by the Partnership, if any, will
be paid to the holders of units.  Accordingly, the Partnership will not make any distributions with
respect to the Incentive Distribution Rights or with respect to Class B units and will not make the
contingent, incentive payments to the Managing Dealer, until Payout occurs.
The Partnership Agreement provides that Payout occurs on the day when the aggregate amount
distributed with respect to each of the units equals $20.00 plus the Payout Accrual.  The Partnership
Agreement defines "Payout Accrual" as 7% per annum simple interest accrued monthly until paid on
the Net Investment Amount outstanding from time to time.  The Partnership Agreement defines Net
Investment Amount initially as $20.00 per unit, regardless of the amount paid for the unit.  If at any time
the Partnership distributes to holders of units more than the Payout Accrual, the amount the
Partnership distributes in excess of the Payout Accrual will reduce the Net Investment Amount.
14
Index
All distributions made by the Partnership after Payout, which may include all or a portion of the
proceeds of the sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets, will be made as follows:
First, (i) to the Record Holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, 35%; (ii) to the Record Holders of
the Outstanding Class B units, pro rata based on the number of Class B units owned, 35% multiplied
·
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Class B units outstanding and the denominator
of which is 100,000; (iii) to the Dealer Manager, as the Managing Dealer contingent incentive fee
paid under the Dealer Manager Agreement, 30%, and (iv) the remaining amount, if any, to the
Record Holders of outstanding units, pro rata based on their percentage interest until such time as
the Managing Dealer receives the full amount of the Managing Dealer contingent incentive fee under
the Dealer Manager Agreement;
·
Thereafter, (i) to the Record Holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, 35%; (ii) to the Record
Holders of the Outstanding Class B units, pro rata based on the number of Class B units owned,
35% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Class B units outstanding and
the denominator of which is 100,000; (iii) the remaining amount to the Record Holders of outstanding
units, pro rata based on their percentage interest.
The Partnership may issue up to 37,500 additional Class B units, the amount of Class B units
canceled in conjunction with the termination of the Management Agreement discussed above in "Note
5. Management Agreement" in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q.
Since distributions to date have been funded with proceeds from the offering of units, the Partnership's
ability to maintain its current intended rate of distribution ($1.40 per unit per year) will be based on its
ability to increase its cash generated from operations.  As there can be no assurance that the
Partnership's current assets will or that the Partnership can acquire additional properties that provide
income at this level, there can be no assurance as to the classification or duration of distributions at
the current rate.  Proceeds of the offering which are distributed are not available for investment in
properties.
 
Financing
As part of the financing for the purchase of the Sanish Field Assets, on December 18, 2015, the
Partnership executed a note in favor of the sellers in the original principal amount of $97.5 million. The
note bears interest at 5% per annum and is payable in full no later than September 30, 2016 ("Maturity
Date"), see further discussion in "Note 4. Note Payable" in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q. Subject to
the Partnership's compliance with the conditions set forth in the note, the Partnership has the right to
extend the Maturity Date to March 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on the note
was $52.0 million.
Oil and Gas Properties
The Partnership has incurred approximately $0.2 million and $1.1 million in capital expenditures for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and expects to invest an additional $0.5 million in
capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 as long as oil, natural gas and NGL prices remain at or
near their current levels. The capital expenditure plan has the flexibility to adjust, should the
commodity price environment change. Reduced capital expenditures are anticipated to result in lower
oil, NGL and natural gas production volumes.
 
Since the Partnership is not the operator of any of its oil and natural gas properties, it is difficult for us
to predict levels of future participation in the drilling and completion of new wells and their associated
capital expenditures. This makes 2016 capital expenditures for drilling and completion projects difficult
to forecast and current estimated capital expenditures could be significantly different from amounts
actually invested.
 
The Partnership expects to fund overhead costs and capital additions related to the drilling and
completion of wells primarily from cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand. Any excess
cash (including cash from the net proceeds of sales of units in the Partnership's public offering) is
intended to be used to pay down the principal amount of the Seller Note in favor of the Sellers and
distributions.
Transactions with Related Parties
 
The Partnership has, and is expected to continue to engage in, significant transactions with related
parties.  These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm's length and the results of the
Partnership's operations may be different than if conducted with non-related parties.  The General
Partner's Board of Directors will oversee and review the Partnership's related party relationships and
is required to approve any significant modifications to existing related party transactions, as well as
any new significant related party transactions.
See further discussion in "Note 7. Related Parties" in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a–15 and 15d–15 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of our General Partner, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30,
2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of our General Partner, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 
Change in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
 
Common Units
The Partnership's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-197476) was declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 22, 2015.  Under the public offering we are
making under the Registration Statement (as amended and supplemented),we are offering common
units of limited partner interest (the "common units") on a best efforts basis with the intention of raising
up to $2,000,000,000 of capital, consisting of 100,263,158 common units. As of June 30, 2016, the
Partnership had completed the sale of 6,714,383 common units for total gross proceeds of $129.0
million and proceeds net of offering costs including selling commissions and marketing expenses of
$119.2 million. As of June 30, 2016, 93,548,775 common units remained unsold. The Partnership will
offer common units until January 23, 2017, unless the offering is extended by the General Partner,
provided that the offering will be terminated if all of the common units are sold before then. The public
offering is being made through David Lerner Associates, Inc. (the "Managing Dealer") and is
continuing at $20.00 per unit.
Upon formation of the Partnership, the General Partner and organizational limited partner made initial
capital contributions totaling $1,000 to the Partnership. Upon closing of the minimum offering in
August 2015, the organizational limited partner withdrew its initial capital contribution of $990, the
General Partner received Incentive Distribution Rights (defined below), and has been and will
continue to be reimbursed for its documented third-party out-of-pocket expenses incurred in organizing
the Partnership and offering the common units.  Under our agreement with the Managing Dealer, the
Managing Dealer receives a total of 6% in selling commissions and a marketing expense allowance
based on gross proceeds of the common units sold.  The Managing Dealer may also be paid a
contingent incentive fee, which is a cash payment of up to an amount equal to 4% of gross proceeds of
the common units sold based on the performance of the Partnership. Based on the common units sold
through June 30, 2016, the total contingent fee is approximately $5.2 million.
