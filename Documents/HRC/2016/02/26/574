</b></p>
<p><b>including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and affirming the </p>
<p>inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter and elaborated in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
</p>
<p>applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly reaffirming, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>Human Rights Council resolution 19/17 of 22 March 2012, in which 
</p>
<p>the Council decided to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to 
</p>
<p>investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the human rights of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, and to the occupied Syrian Golan, and recalling the declarations 
</p>
<p>adopted at the Conferences of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
</p>
<p>held in Geneva on 5 December 2001 and 17 December 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the recent accession by Palestine to several human rights treaties and the core 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law conventions and its accession on 2 January 2015 to the Rome Statute of 
</p>
<p>the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
</p>
<p>population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocol I to the four Geneva Conventions, 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and 
</p>
<p>ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the International Court of Justice concluded that the Israeli settlements in 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, had been established in 
</p>
<p>breach of international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the recent relevant reports of the Secretary-General, the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Committee to 
</p>
<p>Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
</p>
<p>Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories and the treaty bodies monitoring compliance with 
</p>
<p>the human rights treaties to which Israel is a party, and the recent reports of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 
</p>
<p>1967, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to 
</p>
<p>investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem,1 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that Israel has over the years been planning, implementing, supporting and 
</p>
<p>encouraging the establishment and expansion of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem, through, inter alia, the granting of benefits and 
</p>
<p>incentives to settlements and settlers, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-
</p>
<p>Palestinian conflict, and emphasizing specifically it<b>s </b>call for a freeze on all settlement 
</p>
<p>activity, including so-called natural growth, and the dismantlement of all settlement 
</p>
<p>outposts erected since March 2001 and the need for Israel to uphold its obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, by which, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, Palestine was accorded the status of non-member observer State in the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, and taking note of the follow-up report thereon of the Secretary-General, 2 
</p>
<p><i>Aware </i>that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of nationals of 
</p>
<p>the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of land, the forcible 
</p>
<p>displacement of Palestinian civilians, including Bedouin families, the exploitation of 
</p>
<p>natural resources, the conduct of economic activity for the benefit of the occupying Power, 
</p>
<p>the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the de facto annexation of land and 
</p>
<p>other actions against the Palestinian civilian population and the civilian population in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan that are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, undermine regional and international efforts aimed at the 
</p>
<p>realization of the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and 
</p>
<p>security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting in this regard </i>that the Israeli settlements fragment the West Bank, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, into isolated geographical units, severely limiting the possibility of a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/22/63. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/67/738. </p>


<p>contiguous territory and the ability to dispose freely of natural resources, both of which are 
</p>
<p>required for the meaningful exercise of Palestinian self-determination, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that the settlement enterprise continues to be a root cause of many violations 
</p>
<p>of the Palestinians&#8217; human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning<b> </b></i>the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of settlement 
</p>
<p>activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in East Jerusalem, in violation of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions, the agreements reached 
</p>
<p>between the parties and obligations under the Quartet road map and in defiance of the calls 
</p>
<p>by the international community to cease all settlement activities, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> <i>in particular</i> at the construction and expansion by Israel 
</p>
<p>of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its so-called E-1 plan, 
</p>
<p>which aims to connect its illegal settlements around and further isolate occupied East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>families from the city, the revocation of Palestinian residency rights in the city and ongoing 
</p>
<p>settlement activities in the Jordan Valley,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction by Israel of the wall inside 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, in violation of 
</p>
<p>international law, and expressing its concern in particular at the route of the wall in 
</p>
<p>departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian hardship and a 
</p>
<p>serious decline in socioeconomic conditions for the Palestinian people, is fragmenting the 
</p>
<p>territorial contiguity of the Territory and undermining its viability, and could prejudge 
</p>
<p>future negotiations by creating a fait accompli on the ground that could be tantamount to de 
</p>
<p>facto annexation in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, and make the two-State 
</p>
<p>solution physically impossible to implement, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include 
</p>
<p>the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> at the incidents of violence, destruction, harassment, provocation 
</p>
<p>and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians and their properties, which are a long-standing 
</p>
<p>phenomenon that appears to be aimed at, inter alia, displacing the occupied population and 
</p>
<p>facilitating the expansion of settlements, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>the need for Israel to investigate all acts of settler violence against 
</p>
<p>Palestinians and their properties and to ensure accountability for these acts, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> of the detrimental impact of the Israeli settlements on Palestinian and other 
</p>
<p>Arab natural resources, especially as a result of the confiscation of land and the forced 
</p>
<p>diversion of water resources, including the destruction of orchards and crops and the 
</p>
<p>seizure of water wells by Israeli settlers, and of the dire socioeconomic consequences in this 
</p>
<p>regard, which precludes the Palestinian people from being able to exercise permanent 
</p>
<p>sovereignty over their natural resources, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the agricultural sector, considered the cornerstone of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>economic development, has not been able to play its strategic role because of the 
</p>
<p>dispossession of land and the denial of access for farmers to agricultural areas, water 
</p>
<p>resources and domestic and external markets owing to the construction, consolidation and 
</p>
<p>expansion of Israeli settlements, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 22/29 of 22 March 2013, in follow-up 
</p>
<p>to the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the 
</p>
<p>implications of Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights </p>


<p>of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
 
which place 
</p>
<p>responsibilities on all business enterprises to respect human rights by, inter alia, refraining 
</p>
<p>from contributing to human rights abuses arising from conflict, and call upon States to 
</p>
<p>provide adequate assistance to business enterprises to assess and address the heightened 
</p>
<p>risks of abuses in conflict-affected areas, including by ensuring that their current policies, 
</p>
<p>legislation, regulations and enforcement measures are effective in addressing the risk of 
</p>
<p>business involvement in gross human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that, in situations of armed conflict, business enterprises should respect the 
</p>
<p>standards of international humanitarian law, and concerned that some business enterprises 
</p>
<p>have enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the Israeli 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War undertook to 
</p>
<p>respect and to ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances, and that States should 
</p>
<p>not recognize an unlawful situation arising from breaches of peremptory norms of 
</p>
<p>international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Calling upon</i> all States not to provide Israel with any assistance to be used 
</p>
<p>specifically in connection with settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance for States to act in accordance with their own national 
</p>
<p>legislation on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law with regard to 
</p>
<p>business activities that result in human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>about economic activities that allow the expansion and entrenchment of 
</p>
<p>settlements, and aware that the conditions of harvesting and production for products made 
</p>
<p>in settlements involve, inter alia, the exploitation of the natural resources of the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of Israel, the occupying Power, to cooperate 
</p>
<p>fully with the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Reaffirms</i> that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to 
</p>
<p>peace and economic and social development; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva Convention 
</p>
<p>relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan, to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention, in particular article 49 
</p>
<p>thereof, and to comply with all its obligations under international law and cease 
</p>
<p>immediately all actions causing the alteration of the character, status and demographic 
</p>
<p>composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately cease all settlement 
</p>
<p>activities in all the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in<b> </b>the<b> 
</b></p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan<b>,</b> and calls in this regard for the full implementation of all relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions of the Security Council, including, inter alia, resolutions 446 (1979) of 22 
</p>
<p>March 1979, 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March 1980, 476 (1980) of 30 
</p>
<p>June 1980 and 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003; </p>


<p>4. <i>Also demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
</p>
<p>obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Condemns </i>the continuing settlement and related activities by Israel, including 
</p>
<p>the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, the 
</p>
<p>confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction 
</p>
<p>of bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the 
</p>
<p>occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a 
</p>
<p>violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
</p>
<p>Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 thereof; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also condemns</i> the construction of new housing units for Israeli settlers in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank and around occupied East Jerusalem, as they seriously undermine the peace 
</p>
<p>process, jeopardize the ongoing efforts by the international community to reach a final and 
</p>
<p>just peace solution compliant with international legitimacy, including relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations resolutions, and constitute a threat to the two-State solution; 
</p>
<p><b>7</b>. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at, and calls for the cessation of: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The operation by Israel of a tramway linking the settlements with West 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, which is in clear violation of international law and relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>resolutions; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The expropriation of Palestinian land, the demolition of Palestinian homes, 
</p>
<p>demolition orders, forced evictions and &#8220;relocation&#8221; plans by Israel in areas identified for 
</p>
<p>the expansion and construction of settlements, and other practices aimed at the forcible 
</p>
<p>transfer of the Palestinian civilian population, including Bedouin communities and herders, 
</p>
<p>and further settlement activities, including the denial of access to water by Israel to 
</p>
<p>Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in 
</p>
<p>areas slated for settlement expansion, and including the appropriation of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>property through, inter alia, declarations of so-called &#8220;State lands&#8221;, closed &#8220;military zones&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;national parks&#8221; and &#8220;archaeological&#8221; sites to facilitate and advance the expansion or 
</p>
<p>construction of settlements and related infrastructure, in violation of Israel&#8217;s obligations 
</p>
<p>under international humanitarian law and international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Israeli measures in the form of policies, laws and practices that have the 
</p>
<p>effect of preventing Palestinians from full participation in the political, social, economic 
</p>
<p>and cultural life of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 
</p>
<p>prevent their full development in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p>8<b>.</b> <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
</p>
<p>immediately the expansion of existing settlements, including so-called natural growth and 
</p>
<p>related activities, to prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories, 
</p>
<p>including in East Jerusalem, and to discard its E-1 plan; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To put an end to all of the human rights violations linked to the presence of 
</p>
<p>settlements, especially of the right to self-determination, and to fulfil its international 
</p>
<p>obligations to provide effective remedy for victims; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To take immediate measures to prohibit and eradicate all policies or practices 
</p>
<p>that discriminate against and disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by, inter alia, putting an end to 
</p>
<p>the system of separate roads for the exclusive use of Israeli settlers who reside illegally in 
</p>
<p>the said territory, to the complex combination of movement restrictions consisting of the </p>


<p>wall, roadblocks and a permit regime that only affects the Palestinian population, and to the 
</p>
<p>application of a two-tier legal system; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To cease the requisition and expropriation of Palestinian land and the 
</p>
<p>allocation of &#8220;State land&#8221; for the establishment and expansion of settlements, and to halt the 
granting of benefits and incentives to settlements and settlers; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To put an end to all measures and policies resulting in the territorial 
</p>
<p>fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and which 
</p>
<p>are isolating Palestinian communities into separate enclaves; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To take and implement serious measures, including confiscation of arms and 
</p>
<p>enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of ensuring full accountability for and 
</p>

</p>
<p>the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) To bring a halt to all actions, including those perpetrated by Israeli settlers, 
</p>
<p>harming the environment, including the dumping of all kinds of waste materials in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian 
</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) To cease the exploitation, damage, cause of loss or depletion and 
</p>
<p>endangerment of the natural resources of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East
