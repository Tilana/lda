$159,540 for the  period  from  February 20, 2001 (inception) to June 30, 2005, and has no
sales. The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon
future profitable operations from the development of its mineral properties. Management has
plans  to  seek  additional  capital  through  a  private  placement and  public  offering  of  its
common  stock.  The  financial  statements  do  not include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the
recoverability  and  classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain  statements  contained  in  this  Form  10-QSB  constitute  "forward-looking  statements".  These
statements, identified by words such as “plan”, "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "should," "expect"
and similar expressions include our expectations and objectives regarding our future financial position,
operating results and business strategy. These statements reflect the current views of management

described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth under
this Item 2. "Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation" and elsewhere in this Form
10-QSB. We do not intend to update the forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes
in the factors affecting such forward-looking information. We advise you to carefully review the reports
and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
particularly our annual reports on Form 10-KSB, our quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB and our current
reports on Form 8-K.
As  used  in  this  Quarterly  Report,  the  terms  "we",  "us",  "our",  “Company”  and  “Merritt”  mean  Merritt
Ventures  Corp.  unless  otherwise  indicated.  All  dollar  amounts  in  this  Quarterly  Report  are  in  U.S.
dollars unless otherwise stated.
INTRODUCTION
The following discussion and analysis summarizes our plan of operation for the next 12 months, our
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and changes in our financial condition
from  December  31,  2004.  This  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Management’s
Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation included in our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the
year ended December 31, 2004.
We  were  incorporated  on  February  20,  2001  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Nevada.  We  are  an
exploration  stage  company  engaged  in  the  acquisition,  exploration  and  development  of  mineral
properties.
In November, 2004, we acquired a 100% interest in a mineral claim located in the Yellow Pine Mining
District in Clark County, Nevada that we refer to as the Ireland Claim. Our plan of operation for the next
twelve  months  primarily  involves  conducting  preliminary  exploration  and  development  work  on  this
property in order to ascertain whether it possess commercially exploitable mineral deposits. To date,
no commercially viable mineral deposits have been identified on the Ireland Claim and there is no
assurance that any commercially viable mineral deposits exist on the property.
PLAN OF OPERATION
During the next twelve months, we intend to proceed with Phase I of the exploration program proposed
in the engineering report that we obtained for the Ireland Claim. Phase I of the exploration program will
consist of conducting a VLF electromagnetic survey that traces geological fracture and breccia zones.
We expect that it will cost approximately $5,500 to complete Phase I of the exploration program. Once
Phase I is completed, our Board of Directors will make a determination whether to proceed with Phase
II of the exploration program.
3
We have approved a private placement offering of up to 1,750,000 shares of our common stock at a
price of $0.10 per share for total potential proceeds of $175,000 (the “Offering”). As of the date of filing
of this Quarterly Report, we had received gross proceeds pursuant to this Offering of $124,000. The
majority of these funds will be used by us to pay for our exploration programs, operating expenses and
pay  down  our  accrued  liabilities.  There  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  sell  the  remaining
number of shares offered.
There is no assurance that the results of Phase I will be sufficiently favorable to justify proceeding with
the next phase of our exploration program. Even if our Board of Directors determines that the results of
Phase  I  justify  proceeding  to  the  next  phase  of  our  exploration  program,  we  will  require  additional
financing in order to complete our exploration programs. There are no assurances that we will be able
to obtain sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.

We have not earned any revenues since our inception and we do not anticipate earning revenues until
such time as we have entered into commercial production of our mineral properties. We are currently in
the  exploration  stage  of  our  business  and  we  can  provide  no  assurances  that  we  will  discover
commercially  exploitable  levels  of  mineral  resources  on  our  properties,  or  if  such  resources  are
discovered, that we will be able to enter into commercial production of our mineral properties.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles
requires  our  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amount  of
assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates
about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the audited financial statements included
in this Quarterly Report.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail
Our current operating funds are inadequate to complete our planned exploration of the Ireland Claim.
Our business plan calls for significant expenses in connection with the exploration and development of
those mineral claims. As a result, we will require additional financing to complete our exploration and
development plans. We will also require additional financing if the costs of exploration are greater than
anticipated and to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues once
exploration is complete.
We currently do not have any arrangements for financing and we may not be able to obtain financing
when  required.  Obtaining  additional  financing  would  be  subject  to  a  number  of  factors,  the  known
material factors being market prices for gold and silver, investor acceptance of our mineral claims, and
investor  sentiment.  These  factors  may  make  the  timing,  amount,  terms  or  conditions  of  additional
financing unavailable to us.
If  we  complete  a  financing  through  the  sale  of  additional  shares  of  our  common  stock,
shareholders will experience dilution
The  most  likely  source  of  future  financing  presently  available  to  us  is  through  the  issuance  of  our
common stock. Any sale of share capital will result in dilution to existing shareholders. The only other
anticipated alternative for the financing of further exploration would be the offering by us of an interest
in our properties to be earned by another party or parties carrying out further exploration thereof, which
is not presently contemplated.
In order to maintain our rights to the Ireland Claim, we will be required to make annual filings
with federal and state regulatory agencies and/or be required to complete assessment work on
the Ireland Claim
In order to maintain our rights to the Ireland Claim, we will be required to make annual filings with
federal and state regulatory authorities. Currently the amount of these fees is nominal; however, these
maintenance fees are subject to adjustment. In addition, we may be required by federal
6
and/or  state  legislation  or  regulations  to  complete  minimum  annual  amounts  of  mineral  exploration
work on the Ireland Claim. A failure by us to meet the annual maintenance requirements under federal
and state laws could cause our rights to the Ireland Claim to lapse.
Because we have not commenced business operations, we face a high risk of business failure
We  were  incorporated  on  February  20,  2001  and  to  date  have  been  involved  primarily  in
organizational  activities,  the  acquisition  of  mineral  claims  and  the  exploration  and  development  on
these  claims.  We  have  not  earned  any  revenues  as  of  the  date  of  this  Quarterly  Report.  Potential
investors  should  be  aware  of  the  difficulties  normally  encountered  by  new  mineral  exploration
companies  and  the  high  rate  of  failure  of  such  enterprises.  The  likelihood  of  success  must  be
considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in
connection with the exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential
problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional
costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates.
Because we anticipate our operating expenses will increase prior to our earning revenues, we
may never achieve profitability
Prior  to  completion  of  our  exploration  stage,  we  anticipate  that  we  will  incur  increased  operating
expenses  without  realizing  any  revenues.  We  therefore  expect  to  incur  significant  losses  into  the
foreseeable  future.  We  recognize  that  if  we  are  unable  to  generate  significant  revenues  from  the
exploration of our mineral claims and the production of minerals thereon, if any, we will not be able to
earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the
likelihood  that  we  will  prove  successful,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  ever  generate  any  operating
revenues  or  achieve  profitable  operations.  If  we  are  unsuccessful  in  addressing  these  risks,  our
business will most likely fail.
Because of the speculative nature of exploration of mining properties, there is substantial risk
that no commercially exploitable minerals will be found and our business will fail
The  search  for  valuable  minerals  as  a  business  is  extremely  risky.  We  may  not  find  commercially
exploitable reserves of gold or silver on our mineral claims. Exploration for minerals is a speculative
venture, necessarily involving substantial risk. The expenditures to be made by us in the upcoming
exploration  of  the  mineral  claims  may  not  result  in  the  discovery  of  commercial  quantities  of  ore.
Problems  such  as  unusual  or  unexpected  formations  and  other  conditions  are  involved  in  mineral
exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, we would be unable to
complete our business plan.
Because of the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that we may
incur liability or damages if and when we conduct mineral exploration activities
The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, if and when we conduct
exploration activities we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins
and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. The
payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
Even if we discover commercial reserves of precious metals on our optioned mineral claims, we
may not be able to successfully obtain commercial production
Our optioned mineral claims do not contain any known bodies of ore. If our exploration programs
7
are successful in discovering ore of commercial tonnage and grade, we will require additional funds in
order to place those mineral claims into commercial production. At this time, there is a risk that we will
not be able to obtain such financing as and when needed.
Because we are an exploration stage company, our business has a high risk of failure
As noted in the financial statements that are included with this Quarterly Report, we are an exploration
stage company that has incurred net losses since inception, we have not attained profitable operations
and  we  are  dependent  upon  obtaining  adequate  financing  to  complete  our  exploration  activities.
These conditions, as indicated in the audit report of Telford Sadovnick, PLLC, raise substantial doubt
as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The success of our business operations will depend
upon our ability to obtain further financing to complete our planned exploration program and to attain
profitable  operations.  If  we  are  not  able  to  complete  a  successful  exploration  program  and  attain
sustainable profitable operations, then our business will fail.
If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, we may not be able to implement our business
plan and our business will fail
Our success will largely depend on our ability to hire highly qualified personnel with experience in
geological exploration. These individuals may be in high demand and we may not be able to attract
the staff we need. In addition, we may not be able to afford the high salaries and fees demanded by
qualified personnel, or may lose such employees after they are hired. Currently, we have not hired any
key personnel. Our failure to hire key personnel when needed could have a significant negative effect
on our business.
Because our executive officers have only agreed to provide their services on a part-time basis,
they may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations,
causing our business to fail
Our  executive  officers  provide  their  services  on  a  part-time  basis.  Our  officers  may  pursue  other
business activities, provided that these other activities do not interfere with their obligations to us. Ms.
Archibald, Mr. Burley and Mr. Rommel devote their full-time attention to other business pursuits. It is
therefore possible that, over time, Ms. Archibald, Mr. Burley and Mr. Rommel may not be able to devote
sufficient time to the management of our business, as and when needed.
Because  our  executive  officers  do  not  have  formal  training  specific  to  the  technicalities  of
mineral exploration, there is a higher risk our business will fail
Our  executive  officers  and  directors  do  not  have  formal  training  as  geologists  or  in  the  technical
aspects of management of a mineral exploration company. Accordingly, we will have to rely on the
technical services of others trained in appropriate areas. If we are unable to contract for the services of
such individuals, it will make it difficult and maybe impossible to pursue our business plan.
As we undertake exploration of our optioned mineral claims, we will be subject to compliance
with government regulation that may increase the anticipated cost of our exploration program
There are several government regulations that materially restrict the exploration of minerals. We may
be  required  to  obtain  work  permits,  post  bonds  and  perform  remediation  work  for  any  physical
disturbance to the land in order to comply with these laws. While our planned exploration program
8
budgets  for  regulatory  compliance,  there  is  a  risk  that  new  regulations  could  increase  our  costs  of
doing business and prevent us from carrying out our exploration program.
If we receive positive results from our exploration program and we decide to pursue commercial
production, we may be subject to an environmental review process that may delay or prohibit
commercial production
If the results of our geological exploration program indicate commercially exploitable reserves, and we
decide to pursue commercial production of our mineral claims, we may be subject to an environmental
review  process  under  environmental  assessment  legislation.  Compliance  with  an  environmental
review  process  may  be  costly  and  may  delay  commercial  production.  Furthermore,  there  is  the
possibility that we would not be able to proceed with commercial production upon completion of the
environmental  review  process  if  government  authorities  did  not  approve  our  mine  or  if  the  costs  of
compliance  with  government  regulation  adversely  affected  the  commercial  viability  of  the  proposed
mine.
ITEM 3.               CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation Of Disclosure Controls And Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  (the  “Exchange  Act”)).
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are,  as  of  the  date  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report,
effective  to  ensure  that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  us  in  the  reports  that  we  file  or
submit  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time
periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
In connection with the evaluation of our internal controls during our last fiscal quarter, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have determined that there have been no changes to
our  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to
materially effect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
