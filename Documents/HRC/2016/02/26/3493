<p><b>Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (<i>g</i>) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p>in which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993,   
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council,   
</p>
<p><i> Taking note also</i> of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the 
</p>
<p>staff of the Office of the High Commissioner,1 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>management review of the Office of the High Commissioner2 and on the funding and 
</p>
<p>staffing of the Office,<footnote name="3">JIU/REP/2007/8.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
</p>
<p>culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
the Council on its nineteenth session (A/HRC/19/2), chap. I. 
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/19/24. 
</p>
<p> 2 A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1 
</p>

<p><i> Reiterating</i> its concern that, despite the repeated requests to correct the unbalanced 
</p>
<p>geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for 
</p>
<p>almost half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
</p>
<p>regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
</p>
<p>including in the senior management positions, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
</p>
<p>the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
</p>
<p>account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
</p>
<p>conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters,   
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> its serious concern at the fact that, despite the measures taken by 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
</p>
<p>the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
</p>
<p>single region occupies almost half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner;   
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report that 
</p>
<p>achieving geographical balance in the staff of her Office will remain one of her priorities, 
</p>
<p>and requests the High Commissioner to continue to take all measures needed to redress the 
</p>
<p>current imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff of the Office;   
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the past four years in the percentage of staff from 
</p>
<p>regions identified as requiring better representation and the various measures proposed and 
</p>
<p>already taken to address the imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff, while 
</p>
<p>noting with concern the small increase in 2011 and no change in the status of the prominent 
</p>
<p>region, and stresses the need to implement additional measures to redress the prominent 
</p>
<p>imbalance in a more expeditious way; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Takes note</i> of the progress achieved in improving the geographic diversity of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office, and takes note also of the commitment of the High Commissioner to 
</p>
<p>remain attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible geographic 
</p>
<p>diversity of her Office, as stated in the conclusion of her report;   
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographical 
</p>
<p>diversity of her staff by enhancing the implementation of measures to achieve a better 
</p>
<p>representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
</p>
<p>particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a zero-growth cap on 
</p>
<p>the representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
</p>
<p>the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
</p>
<p>issue;   
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue to enhance the ongoing 
</p>
<p>efforts made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
</p>
<p>recruitment and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior managers, 
</p>
<p>as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; </p>


<p> 9. <i>Affirms </i>the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
</p>
<p>the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
</p>
<p>national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, 
</p>
<p>as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution of staff in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly proposals for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable ranges, 
</p>
<p>with a view to establishing a more effective tool to ensure equitable geographical 
</p>
<p>distribution in relation to the total number of staff of the Secretariat;   
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages</i> the General Assembly to consider further measures to promote 
</p>
<p>desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner representing national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural 
</p>
<p>and religious backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems;   
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes</i> the increase in the human and financial resources allocated to the 
</p>
<p>activities of the Office of the High Commissioner and the impact it should have on the 
</p>
<p>geographic composition of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
</p>
<p>importance that the Assembly continue to provide support and guidance to the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance in the 
</p>
<p>composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner;   
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive and updated 
</p>
<p>report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session, in accordance with its 
</p>
<p>annual programme of work, following the structure and scope of her report and with a 
</p>
