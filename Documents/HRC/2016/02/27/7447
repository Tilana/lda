<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue their activities in 
</p>
<p>accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>to update the relevant reports and studies. 
</p>
<p>2. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2004/76, requested the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General to issue annually conclusions and recommendations of the special 
</p>
<p>procedures so as to enable further discussion of their implementation. The Commission also 
</p>
<p>requested the High Commissioner to continue to prepare a comprehensive and regularly 
</p>
<p>updated electronic compilation of recommendations made by the special procedures by 
</p>
<p>country where such did not yet exist. In paragraph 29 of the annex to its resolution 65/281, 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly provided that the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) would 
</p>
<p>continue to maintain information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily 
</p>
<p>accessible manner. 
</p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General draws the attention of the Human Rights Council to the 
</p>
<p>conclusions and recommendations included in annual reports and the relevant addenda 
</p>
<p>thereto, submitted by the special procedures to the Council in 2014 at its twenty-fifth,
