- v -

VIRS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED
Defendant

Ms. Ulamila Fa Tuituku (Law Solutions) for the Plaintiff
Ms. Goundar (Lajendra Law) for the Defendant

Ruling on Wasted /Indemnity Cost

[1] This case was set for hearing of the Plaintiffs Claim on 18th January 2011. On that day the defence was ready for hearing with their counsel. Defence witnesses were present. The matter was called for hearing there was no appearance or no application on behalf of the Plaintiff. The defendant counsel made an application that Plaintiffs claim to be stuck out and judgement awarded in favour of the Defendant as per the counter claim. The Defendant application was allowed and orders were made accordingly. Subsequently, on the same day on or about 10.15am Ms. Fa appeared for the Plaintiff and made an application for reinstatement. Then Court noted the application and The Plaintiff was allowed to file formal application for reinstatement. Then The Plaintiff filed reinstatement papers along with the affidavit of one Lusiana Marama-legal clerk in the law firm of Law Solutions. This matter came up on 31st January 2011 for supporting the reinstatement application and on that date the Defendant consented to the reinstatement subject to wasted cost. The Plaintiff opposed to pay wasted cost as they were ready to proceed the hearing on 18th January 2011. The matter was reinstated and for hearing on today. By the time parties filed their written submission on wasted cost application.

[2] I now consider the facts and merits of this application. According to the Plaintiff the chronology of events that took place on the morning of the 18th January 2011 as follows; 

			
	8:00 am	Ms. Fa advised the Plaintiff and her clerk that there was a matter in the Magistrates Court in Suva before Mr. Rajasinghe at 9:00am. Requested the Solicitors law clerk and Plaintiff to stand matter down. All witnesses present were also advised to go down to the Court House in Nasinu. 	
			
	8:15am	Solicitors Clerk called the Nasinu Magistrates Court Registry and advised the Court Clerk of the request for stand down.	
			
	8:45am	Solicitors Clerk, Plaintiff and 4 witnesses arrived at the Nasinu Court House and went straight to the Registry and spoke with a Clerk named Fina. Solicitors clerk was advised to go to the Court House and speak with the Court Clerk on duty by the name of Nilesh.	
			
	8:55am	Solicitors Clerk advised Court Clerk Nilesh of the request for stand down of the matter until 10.30 am. Court Clerk Nilesh agreed to do so accordingly and advised Solicitors Clerk that since the matter was listed for hearing, it would be the last case to be called on the list.	
			
	9:55 am	Defendants Solicitor arrived at the Court House and matter was called straight away. Court Clerk Nilesh failed to advise the Court that there was a request for stand down of matter and that he had advised the Law Clerk that the matter was stood down until the end of the list.	
		Matter was struck out.	
			
	10:15am	Solicitor Ms. Fa arrived at the Court House and made her application for reinstatement of the matter.	


[3] The Plaintiff says that this matter should never have been struck out had normal Court practice been followed. The normal practice that the court follows to deal with all other mention matters or first calls before the hearing of substantive matter begins. Therefore the Plaintiff is objecting for awarding of wasted cost on following grounds.

A] The plaintiff was also ready for hearing and had 4 witnesses that were outside the court room.

B] The Defendants solicitor aware that plaintiff was outside with his witnesses; however he went on ahead and asked matter should be stuck out. 

C] The Defendants solicitor told the Plaintiffs solicitors clerk that he had other commitments elsewhere and that he could not wait around at the court house for the plaintiff solicitors arrival.

D] The court clerk should have advised the Magistrate when the matter was called that there was a request for stand down until 10.30am. 

[4] I have carefully considered the facts before me. In considering item A] and B], I note that were no appearance for the Plaintiff nor the Plaintiff came in person before this court when matter called and struck out. Courts Proceeding is open and the Plaintiff should have come forward when case was called. Normally, Court acts on applications by the respective parties if there is no application; no order would be made; if there is an application then appropriate order would be made. Fiji has adversarial system and parties should make available for their respective cases. On a hearing date, if any party is not present deemed to be not ready. This is the normal practice of the Court and ignorance of law excuses nobody. This principle derives from legal maxims Ignorantia legis neminen exusat- Ignorance of law is excuse nobody or Ignorantia facti excusat; ingnorantia juris non excusat- Ignorance of fact is excuse, but ignorance of law is no excuse. The plaintiff may have been in the court each and every date; but he should come forward and mark appearance especially when his counsel is not present.

5] In considering the item C] it was an allegation which points out to the Defendants attorney. The Plaintiff relies on plaintiffs solicitor clerks version that the Defendant attorney said that he had other commitments in elsewhere. Surprisingly this context was not in Lusiana Maramas affidavit in support for reinstatement which is deposed on 21st January 2011. If this was really happened it could have been mention at first instance. I hold that the failure to mention that fact is fatal for truthfulness of the fact.

6] The Plaintiff said the court clerk should have advised the Magistrate when matter was called. Administration of justice is machine and hub of the machine is Judges, Magistrates or Presiding Officers. It cannot be smoothly run without subordinate officers. But it should be noted that Court clerks are not advisers of the Presiding Officers. I refer pertinent sections of the Magistrates Courts Act Chapter 14 in relations to court clerks. Section 13

The clerk of the court attached to a magistrates' court shall, subject to the general supervision and control of the Chief Justice, be under the immediate direction and control of the magistrate. (Emphasis is mine)

7] Duties of clerk of the court are articulated in section 14 of said Act;

The duties of the clerk of the court shall be-

(a) to attend at such sittings of the court as the magistrate may direct;

(b) to fill up or cause to be filled up summonses, warrants, orders, convictions, recognizances, writs of execution and other documents, and submit the same for the signature of the magistrate;

(c) to issue civil process in accordance with rules of court for the time being in force;

(d) to make or cause to be made copies of proceedings when required to do so by the magistrate, and to record the judgments, convictions and orders of the court;

(e) to receive or cause to be received all fees, fines and penalties, and all other moneys paid or deposited in respect of proceedings in the court, and to keep or cause to be kept accounts of the same; and

(f) to perform or cause to be performed such other duties connected with the court as may be assigned to him by the magistrate. (Emphasis is mine)

8] Instant case it is seen that special duty had been assigned to the court clerk to appear on behalf of the Plaintiff and ask matter to be stood down. This is not be done as a court clerk, an officer of the court, he should maintain the impartiality and neutrality. In R. V. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 Lord Hewart stresses  It is not merely of some importance, but it is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done (Emphasis is mine)

9] Thus, Mr. Nilesh Naidu, the court clerk has rightly acted and remained silence when the matter was called. 

10] Then, question arises who should pay the wasted or indemnity cost? Whether the Plaintiff or solicitors of the Plaintiff pay this could to be decided. 

11] It is to be noted in Rao v Goundar [1998] FJHC 237; [1998] 44 FLR 82 (22 May 1998) His Lordship Pathik J observed similar type of situation. His Lordship went on saying; 

In all the circumstances of this case, I have given serious consideration to the making of a "wasted costs order" against counsel particularly because counsel has acted improperly and negligently in failing to appear in Court in the morning at 10.00 a.m. when the case was specifically set down for hearing at that time. He is duty bound not to take engagement elsewhere and keep the Court waiting. If he is in difficulties or is likely to be late then he should instruct another counsel to appear in Court on his behalf and not send messages through other people. This mode of communication is not the right practice when it involves a hearing in open Court and it must cease forthwith. (Emphasize is mine) 

12] I am fully agreement with above observation that has been made by Justice Devendra Pathik. Therefore counsel for the Plaintiff in this case has adopted not acceptable mode of communication to the court. It is noteworthy to mention Normal practise in these courts; when if any counsel has any difficulty in appearing at scheduled time, he/she informs the oppose counsel and send other counsel or junior counsel to stand down the matter till he/she arrives. There are new entrants to the legal profession and it is reasonable to give chance to them be audience. As a matter of courtesy, then court stand down the matter and sole discretion lies on the court whether to stand or not. I stress counsels are not engaged in a case and they are retained. Retained has a special meaning. That is they are paid and retained for the case. They cannot go elsewhere. When the case is called they should be fully available for the case and case to be proceeded without any delay. A counsel cannot be omnipresent. He cannot take several cases elsewhere. He is duty bound to come and present his case whenever case is called. If he undertakes a case elsewhere, he may be guilty of double booking. He cannot come and say and find fault with that normal practise has not been followed by the case.

13] In Harley v. McDonald[2001] 2 AC 678, at 703, para [50] (English Privy Council) held 

"Failures to appear, conduct which leads to an otherwise avoidable step in the proceedings or the prolongation of a hearing by gross repetition or extreme slowness in the presentation of evidence or argument are typical examples of wasting the time of the court or an abuse of its processes resulting in excessive or unnecessary costs to litigants" 

14] Ms Fa's failure to appear in court was not an avoidable circumstance. She has appeared before Resident Magistrate Mr. Rajasinghe for urgent matter is not excusable for not awarding cost.

15] In Prasad v Divisional Engineer Northern (No 2) [2008] FJHC 234; HBJ03.2007 (25 September 2008) Her Ladyship Jocelynne A. Scutt defines the wasted or useless costs. 

" Cases where 'wasted costs' rules or 'useless costs' principles have been applied against solicitors where their conduct in proceedings has led to delay and/or abuse of process can provide some assistance in determining whether conduct in proceedings generally may be such as to warrant the award of indemnity costs. These cases specifically relate to solicitors' conduct rather than directly touching upon the indemnity costs question; nonetheless the analysis or findings as to what constitutes conduct warranting an award of costs can be helpful.

16] I note in this case Ms. Fa came to court and made application for reinstatement same day itself. As to the plaintiff version, the plaintiff was in outside the court room. The main fault with the Plaintiff and he could have appeared and informed when case was called and asked matter to be stood down till his counsel arrives. I cannot see gross negligence of Plaintiff's solicitor. The Plaintiff has every right to appear in court and inform the situation and move the matter to be stood down, which he failed to do so. Then, he has to face the repercussions. 

17] I have carefully considered the facts before me. I am of the view that the Defendant is entitled get wasted cost in indemnity basis. Therefore, I make following order.

The Plaintiff should pay $ 400 (Summarily assessed) as cost to the Defendant.
