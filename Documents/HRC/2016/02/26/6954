<p><b>4/&#8230; Question of the realization in all countries 
of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles relating to economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23), 
the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) and the United Nations General Assembly 
resolution 60/251 that established the Human Rights Council all affirm that all human rights are 
universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be treated 
in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council, of the Commission on 
Human Rights and of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular Human Rights 
Council resolution 1/3 on the Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> ongoing efforts, including by this Council, towards the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights and encouraging additional efforts to ensure the realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights and the removal of obstacles thereto at all levels, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) That, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of 
free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are 
created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as 
his or her civil and political rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) That all persons in all countries are entitled to the realization of their economic, 
social and cultural rights, which are indispensable to their dignity and the free development of 
their personality; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms and the obligation of all States to ensure the full promotion, 
protection and realization of all human rights; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The importance of international cooperation in assisting Governments to fulfil 
their obligation to protect and promote all human rights, including economic, social and cultural 
rights, while emphasizing that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human 
rights lies with States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The inextricable link between full respect for the rights contained in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the process of 
development, the central purpose of which is the realization of the potentialities of the human 
person with the effective participation of all members of society in relevant decision-making 
processes as agents and beneficiaries of development, as well as with a fair distribution of its 
benefits; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To give full effect to economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To consider signing and ratifying, and the States parties to implement, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as other international 
instruments related to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To guarantee that economic, social and cultural rights shall be exercised without 
discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To secure progressively, through national development policies and with 
international assistance and cooperation, full realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
giving particular attention to the individuals and communities living in extreme poverty and 
therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To promote the effective and wide participation of representatives of civil society 
in decision-making processes related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights, including through efforts to identify and strengthen good governance practices; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the six recent ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and calls upon the States parties to the Covenant: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To withdraw reservations incompatible with the object and purpose of the 
Covenant and to consider reviewing other reservations with a view to withdrawing them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To submit their reports to the Committee in a regular and timely manner; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To promote a concerted national effort to ensure the participation of 
representatives of all sectors of civil society in the process of preparation of their periodic reports 
to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Committee; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To ensure that the Covenant is taken into account in all of their relevant national 
and international policy-making processes; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recalls</i> that international cooperation in solving international problems of an 
economic, social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations, and affirms 
that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing 
economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes with interest </i>the work carried out by the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to assist States parties in fulfilling their obligations, including through the 
development and adoption of general comments, in order to assist in clarifying the content and 
scope of the articles of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and, 
in this regard, takes note of the recent adoption of general comments No. 16 on article 3 (the 
equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights),

moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which 
he or she is the author) and No. 18 on article 6 (the right to work); </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> the Committee to continue its efforts towards the promotion, 
protection and full realization of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, at the national and international levels, including by drafting further 
general comments to assist and promote the further implementation by States parties of the 
Covenant, by making the experience gained through the examination of States parties&#8217; reports 
available for the benefit of all States parties, and by organizing regional workshops to promote 
the follow-up to its concluding observations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its appreciation for and encourages</i> the continuation of the work

related to the promotion, protection and full realization of economic, social and cultural rights

</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages</i> enhanced cooperation and, as appropriate, increased coordination, 
between the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and United Nations bodies, 
specialized agencies or programmes, mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, and other 
human rights treaty bodies whose activities bear upon economic, social and cultural rights, in a 
manner that respects their distinctive mandates and promotes their policies, programmes and 
projects; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> the inclusion of the issue of the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.189/12 and 
Corr.1), in which States underscored, inter alia, the need to design, promote and implement at the 
national, regional and international levels, strategies, programmes and policies, and adequate 
legislation, which may include special and positive measures, for furthering equal social 
development and the realization of the civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights of 
all victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; </p>

 <p></p>

of economic, social and cultural rights;

Human Rights Institutions and of non-governmental organizations to the question of the

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the promotion of economic, social and 
cultural rights, mainly through technical cooperation, the work of its field offices, its relevant 
reports to United Nations bodies, the development of in-house expertise and its publications and 
studies on related issues; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights:
