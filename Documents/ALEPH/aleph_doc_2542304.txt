Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  for  Royal  Standard  Minerals  Inc.  have
been  prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting
principles consistently applied. The most significant of these accounting principles have been set
out  in  the  January  31,  2005  audited  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  statements  are
presented  on  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.  Accordingly,  a  precise  determination  of  many
assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events. Therefore, estimates and approximations
have been made using careful judgment. Recognizing that the Company is responsible for both
the  integrity  and  objectivity  of  the  financial  statements,  management  is  satisfied  that  these
financial statements have been fairly presented.
Auditors' involvement
The  auditors'  of  Royal  Standard  Minerals  Inc.  have  not  performed  a  review  of  the  unaudited
consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  October  31,  2005  and

On  April  13,  2005,  1,000,000  stock  options  were  granted  to  employees  and  directors  of  the
Company.  These  stock  options  were  fully  vested  on  the  date  of  grant  and  the  fair  value  was

estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.  Accordingly,
$243,784  was  recorded  as  stock  option  compensation  and  contributed  surplus.  The  following
assumptions were made in estimating the fair value of the stock options: dividend yield, 0%; risk-
free interest rate, 4.0%; estimated life, 5 years and volatility, 100%.

charged  to  the  statements  of  operations  and  deficit.  The  fair  value  of  the  stock  options  was
estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.  Accordingly,
$184,022  was  recorded  as  stock  option  compensation  and  contributed  surplus.  The  following
assumptions were made in estimating the fair value of the stock options: dividend yield, 0%; risk-
free interest rate, 4.0%; estimated life, 5 years and volatility, 92%.

1.  Basic and diluted (loss) income per share
2.  Basic  (loss)  income  per  share  has  been  determined  by  dividing  net  (loss)  income
attributable  to  common  shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted (loss) income per share is the same as
basic  (loss)  income  per  share.  The  Company's  stock  options,  warrants  and  agent
warrants were not included in the diluted (loss) income per share calculation because
it would have had an anti-dilutive effect.
1.  Income taxes
The estimated taxable income for the period  ended  is  $nil.  Based  upon  the  level  of  historical
taxable  income  it  cannot  be  reasonably  estimated  at  this  time  if  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that
Royal will realize the benefits from future income tax assets or the amounts owing from future
income tax liabilities.
Consequently, the future recovery or loss arising from differences in tax values and accounting
values  have  been  reduced  by  an  equivalent  estimated  taxable  temporary  difference  valuation
allowance.
The estimated taxable temporary difference valuation allowance will be adjusted in the period
that it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the future tax assets or
future tax liabilities will be realized.
For further information on Royal's actual losses for tax purposes, refer to the January 31, 2005
audited consolidated financial statements.
8. Subsequent Events
(a)
The Company entered into a 5-year purchase option agreement with a private individual for
all of his patented and unpatented mining claims in the Manhattan Mining District located in
Nye County, Nevada. The land package totals approximately 1600 acres (4 patented, 700
unpatented claims). This property position adjoins the Company's Goldwedge Mine. The
land package includes a number of exploration targets which are of interest to the
Company. In addition, the Company's option includes the Dixie Comstock claim group
located in Churchill County, Nevada. The Dixie Comstock is a 1500 acre property
containing an epithermal gold system that has been explored by a number of major mining
companies over the past 20 years. It is considered to be an attractive advanced exploration
project. The Company is currently engaged in the completion of a 43-101 property report.
Annual option payments of $48,000 are to be applied to a total purchase price of $600,000
– there are no royalties.
(b)
The Company signed an Exploration and Option Agreement with Metallic Ventures
("Metallic") to explore the Mustang Canyon Project in Esmeralda County, Nevada.
The agreement gives the Company the exclusive option to acquire 50% interest in the Mustang
Canyon Project by spending $20,000 per year in exploration expenditures with the objective to
identify a measured resource by June 30, 2010. Upon identification of a measured resource and
completion of a 43-101 report, the Company will earn a 50% interest in the project.
The  Company  may  terminate  the  Agreement  at  any  time  after  spending  the  initial  $20,000  by
providing  30  days  written  notice  to  Metallic.  When  the  Company  has  exercised  its  option  to
acquire a 50% interest in the project, Metallic and the Company will establish a Joint Venture in
respect to the project, on a 50/50 basis. Further expenditures on the Mustang Canyon Project will
then be made by the Joint Venture. The Company will be the operator of the joint venture as long
as it has at least a 50% interest in the joint venture.
