<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with established practice,1 follow-up reports are prepared by the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions  to assess progress 
made by States in implementing the recommendations made following a country visit. At 
the seventeenth session of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur was to 
present the follow-up report to the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, 
Philip Alston, in his report on his visit to the United States of America conducted from 16 
to 30 June 2008.2 In this context, the United States of America was requested to provide 
information on measures taken to implement the recommendations of the previous mandate 
holder by 18 March 2011. The response was received on 4 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for having provided the requested 
information. He deems that cooperation with Governments is important to the 
understanding and assessment of progress made. 
</p>
<p>3. Owing to the late receipt of information from the Government, however, the Special 
Rapporteur will be unable to present a full analysis of the progress made to the Human 
Rights Council at its seventeenth session. The present note provides an overview of the 
main issues addressed in the report of the previous mandate holder, which will be addressed 
by the Special Rapporteur in his follow-up report, to be presented at a future session of the 
Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Recommendations made by the previous mandate holder 
</b></p>
<p>4. In his report, the previous mandate holder stated that there was a good deal to 
commend in the record of the United States of America in relation to extrajudicial killings. 
Nevertheless, he identified three areas where significant improvement was necessary to 
bring the Government&#8217;s actions into line with its stated commitments to human rights and 
the rule of law. These related to due process in the imposition of the death penalty; 
transparency in law enforcement, military and intelligence operations; and accountability 
for potentially unlawful deaths in the Government&#8217;s international operations. 
</p>
<p>5. In his report, the previous mandate holder recommended that the United States, with 
regard to national issues, should ensure due process in death penalty cases; enhance 
reporting procedures and investigation of deaths in immigration detention; and track and 
respond to killings by law enforcement officials. With regard to international operations, 
the Special Rapporteur recommended, inter alia, that Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees not be 
tried under the Military Commission Act; that the Government enhance transparency with 
regard to civilian casualties; that it ensure transparency of military justice and 
accountability for unlawful deaths due to international operations, including comprehensive 
criminal jurisdiction over offences in armed conflict; and enhance reparation programmes.  
</p>
<p>6. While the Special Rapporteur continues his dialogue with the Government of the 
United States of America, and without prejudice to the information provided by the State in 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In order to assess the extent to which States had implemented recommendations, in 2006, the previous 
</p>
<p>mandate holder initiated follow-up reports on country visits. The first follow-up report 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2) concerned recommendations made by the previous mandate holder&#8217;s 
predecessor, Asma Jahangir, on her visits to Brazil, Honduras, Jamaica and the Sudan. Subsequent 
follow-up reports were issued by the previous mandate holder, Philip Alston, in 2008, on missions 
conducted to Sri Lanka and Nigeria (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3); in 2009, on visits to Guatemala 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.7) and the Philippines (A/HRC/11/2/Add.8); and in 2010, on visits to the Central 
African Republic (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5) and Brazil (A/HRC/14/24/Add.4).

account of and implement fully the recommendations made by the previous mandate 
holder.
