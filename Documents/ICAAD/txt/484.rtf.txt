SAKIUSA TUISOLIA

JUDGMENT

1.      
The following trial lasted 21 days, the assessors have returned with a unanimous verdict of not guilty on all six counts, mentioned in the information against the accused.

2.      
I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. I find that the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept their verdict.

3.      
I therefore find the accused not guilty as charged, on all six counts in the information. I acquit him accordingly.
